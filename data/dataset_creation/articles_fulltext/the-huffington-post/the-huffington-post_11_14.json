Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) announced that he will not vote to confirm any more of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller receives a vote in the Senate.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he will not vote to confirm any more of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into possible collusion with Russian officials receives a vote in the Senate.\n\nFlake, who is one of the president\u2019s biggest Republican critics in the Senate and is retiring at the end of this year, made the announcement shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) objected to Flake\u2019s unanimous consent request to bring the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act to a vote on the floor.\n\nThe bill, authored by Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), passed in the Senate Judiciary Committee this year in a bipartisan vote of 14-7. The measure would make it harder for Trump to fire Mueller by requiring officials to have \u201cgood cause\u201d to fire the special counsel. GOP leaders, however, have consistently maintained such protections are unnecessary because they do not believe Trump will fire Mueller.\n\n\u201cThere has been no indication ... that the Mueller investigation will not be allowed to finish,\u201d McConnell told reporters earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s efforts to shield the special counsel come amid Trump\u2019s intensifying attacks on Mueller, who is leading an investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has reportedly spoken several times about firing Mueller, whose probe Trump derisively refers to as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe push to protect Mueller took on more urgency after last week\u2019s ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his replacement by acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who is viewed as a White House loyalist and has attacked the Mueller probe. Legal experts and several top Democrats have questioned whether Whitaker\u2019s appointment was constitutional, given that he was never confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u201cWith the firing of the attorney general and, in my view, the improper installation of an acting attorney general who has not been subject to confirmation by this body, the president now has this investigation in his sights, and we all know it,\u201d Flake said in a speech on Wednesday, adding that he informed McConnell of his decision to oppose the president\u2019s judicial nominees on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Flake will be able to slow down the pace of Trump\u2019s judicial nominations, he won\u2019t be able to block all of them by himself. Unlike in the Judiciary Committee, where Republicans hold a slim 11-10 majority, Flake\u2019s vote is less crucial in the full Senate, where Republicans have enough votes to confirm judges without him. However, if any other GOP senator joins Flake in opposing judicial nominations, the Senate would not see a vote on a judicial nominee before Jan. 3, when the next congressional session begins.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) last week renewed her call for the Senate to pass legislation that would protect the special counsel, but it\u2019s unclear whether she or any other GOP sponsor of the bill will join Flake in blocking nominees.\n\nTwenty-one nominations are pending before the Judiciary Committee, according to Flake. Thirty-two other judicial nominations have already been reported out of the committee and are ready for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nTrump claimed credit for pushing Flake out of the Senate in a press conference last week.\n\n\u201cI retired him. I\u2019m very proud of it.

Since 1938, Gallop has asked the nation, Do you approve or disapprove of the way\u2026 [+13323 chars]", "fulltext": "JIM WATSON via Getty Images The key to Donald Trump\u2019s success in 2016 is rooted in the unequal distribution of racial and ethnic groups across the Electoral College system.\n\nSince 1938, Gallop has asked the nation, \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way the president is handling his job?\u201d\n\nAcross 80 years of polling, presidents have averaged approval ratings of 53 percent, ranging from a high of 74 percent for John F. Kennedy in November 1962 to a low of 35 percent for Trump in December 2017. In the days leading up to the 2018 midterm elections, Trump\u2019s approval rating rose slightly to 40 percent. Still, a commanding 54 percent of those polled said they disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance. His low approval ratings contributed to the resurgence of the Democratic Party in the House, where they picked up at least 33 seats and regained control of the chamber.\n\nRecord turnout and pointed campaigning in battleground states also helped Democrats pick up Senate seats in Arizona and Nevada, which would have been enough to take control of that chamber if all the party\u2019s incumbents there had held on to their seats.\n\nInstead, the chambers swung in opposite directions, with Republicans building on their majority in the Senate. They have already secured a 51-seat majority in the upper chamber and look likely to add two seats \u2015 Florida and Mississippi \u2015 by the time the dust settles.\n\nIf the GOP\u2019s success in the senatorial elections is a sign of anything, it is this: Regardless of what the country thinks of Trump or whom the majority of the country votes for, the current president maintains a very good chance of winning a second election in 2020.\n\nTrump\u2019s Advantage\n\nThe key to Trump\u2019s success is rooted in the unequal distribution of racial and ethnic groups across the Electoral College system. This arrangement allows him to target favorable demographic windows that lean hard to the right and exploit them to his party\u2019s advantage. This is how he won in 2016. And this is how his party beat incumbent Democratic senators in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota in the midterm elections this year. And if he wins again in 2020, this demographic advantage will lie at the center of his success.\n\nAs I argued here last month, migration of minorities out of rural states has demographically structured the United States such that the Electoral College favors not only rural states, as it was designed to do, but also conservative white voters who reside in greater numbers in rural regions of the country. As a result, instead of balancing power across rural and urban states, the Electoral College creates opportunities for ultraconservative factions to enter the national stage.\n\nPeople who support the Electoral College typically argue that the system was designed to provide rural regions of the country with equal representation. While this is at least partly true, it is important to keep in mind that when the Electoral College was devised, the only people who could vote were white males. And although white women gained the right to vote in 1920, minorities in the U.S. didn\u2019t gain full citizenship until the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. By that time, demographically, the U.S. was a very different place from in 1787, when the founders drafted the Constitution.\n\nJeff Swensen via Getty Images Since Aug. 1, 2018, Trump has held 33 campaign-style rallies, targeting states with rural, white populations and higher than average approval ratings for the president.\n\nEarly statesmen never could have envisioned the degree to which the Industrial Revolution would affect the distribution of residents across rural and urban settings. According to the Census Bureau, in 1800, 94 percent of the country lived in a rural setting. By 1900, that number dropped to 60 percent. Today, over 80 percent of U.S. residents live in an urban setting.\n\nWhile people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds left the countryside in search of opportunities from 1800 to 2018, as a percentage of their population, minorities left at much higher rates than whites. The unequal migration of people out of rural America helps us make sense of Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 as well as Republicans\u2019 ability to retain the Senate in 2018, despite their significant loss in the national popular vote for the House.\n\nAs Graph 1 illustrates, in states where at least 50 percent of the population lives in a rural setting, 81 percent of residents are white, which is 19 percentage points higher than the national average (62 percent) reported in the 2016 American Community Survey. The number of white residents drops to 57 percent in urban states. This trend is inverse to the ratio between electoral votes and population. That is, rural states average one electoral vote for every 393,393 people. In contrast, predominantly urban states average one electoral vote for every 590,081 residents. In practical terms, individuals living in whiter, rural states have 50 percent more representation in presidential elections than people living in urban states.\n\nGraph 1: Average population per electoral vote in rural, semirural and urban states\n\nBenjamin Waddell The bars show the percentage of white voters in rural, semirural and urban states. The line represents the average number of voters represented by each electoral vote. *The white population depicts individuals who identified as non-Hispanic white in the 2016 American Community Survey; data via FactFinder.Census.gov.\n\nAs Graph 2 shows, representation in the Senate is even more skewed. In urban states, there is one senator for every 5,225,465 residents, compared with one senator for every 1,184,428 residents in rural states. As a consequence, people living in rural (whiter) states have 341 percent more representation in the Senate than people living in urban states.\n\nGraph 2: Average population per senator in rural, semirural and urban states\n\nBenjamin Waddell\n\nThis arrangement wouldn\u2019t be so pernicious if racial and ethnic minorities voted consistently across party lines, but that\u2019s not the case. All minority groups \u2014 without exception \u2014 vote predominantly for Democratic candidates in major elections. In fact, in the 2018 midterm elections, ethnic and racial minorities favored Democrats by an average margin of nearly 60 percentage points. Put simply, no factor in American politics predicts voter outcomes across party lines better than race. And this is particularly true in rural America, where white voters show a strong preference for Trump and his party.\n\nThus, while the Electoral College may have been designed to equalize representation across rural and urban states, as it currently exists, the system systematically favors white voters living in sparsely populated areas of the country.\n\nAnd nobody seems to understand this better than Trump, who, since Aug. 1, 2018, has held 33 campaign-style rallies across the United States. He has used his rallies to target states with rural, white populations and higher than average approval ratings for the president. While 62 percent of the nation identifies as white, the states he has targeted in recent rallies average 72 percent white. And while his approval ratings hover around 40 percent nationally, in rally states, his ratings average 50 percent.\n\nThe Obama Effect\n\nObama is often cited as evidence of a colorblind electoral system. And while he was the first black president of the United States, it is important to keep in mind that he is a quintessential outlier. He won the presidency twice, and in each election he pulled enough votes in key electoral states to gather more than the needed 270 electoral votes.\n\nStill, he was a once-in-a-generation candidate. He is a gifted speaker, compassionate father and expert statesman and is extremely talented at navigating highly contentious political matters with grace. While Obama\u2019s presidency clearly represents a breakthrough moment in the long road to racial equality, it\u2019s simply misleading to imply that his election is evidence of a colorblind society.\n\nTo be fair, Obama\u2019s success demonstrates that race isn\u2019t an absolute barrier to the Oval Office. However, as Trump clearly shows, in the right election cycle, it can be. The 2016 election is a great case in point.\n\nObama\u2019s victories in 2008 and 2012 distract from the fact that American presidential elections are predominately decided by swing voters in a handful of states where, in most election years, a large majority of residents are white. In 2016, for example, three states decided the election: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, 76 percent of the population in Michigan is white, 82 percent in Wisconsin and 78 percent in Pennsylvania. These numbers grow when we look at voting-age populations. Whites account for 79 percent of the voting-age population in Michigan, 86 percent in Wisconsin and 81 percent in Pennsylvania.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images Sen.Claire McCaskill of Missouri was one of at least three Democratic incumbents who lost in states that are whiter than the national population.\n\nObama won each of these states in 2008 and 2012, but his success was largely the result of record turnout among young voters and his ability to pull moderates to his side of the aisle. But more important, he had favorable Electoral College windows. That is, the combination of states that ultimately decided the election did not work against him.\n\nCombined, the demographic makeup of each of these groupings was more in line with the country\u2019s national population. However, in 2016 that changed when Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania emerged as the most important states in the election. This combination placed the fate of the presidential election in the hands of three states with higher than average populations of white voters, and in doing so, it created the perfect demographic window for Trump.\n\nA recent study on white swing voters in the 2016 election found that \u201cwhite voters with racially conservative or anti-immigrant attitudes switched votes to Trump at a higher rate than those with more liberal views on these issues.\u201d Other authors have come to similar conclusions, finding that racial resentment played a clear role in Trump\u2019s success in 2016.\n\nAnd all available evidence points to a similar advantage in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe Midterm Elections\n\nTrump\u2019s party flipped three states in the Senate: Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. Not surprisingly, as Graph 3 shows, the president\u2019s approval ratings as of October 2018 were higher than average in these states. In Missouri, where 78 percent of residents are white, 52 percent of voters approved of Trump\u2019s performance. In Indiana, which is 80 percent white, 52 percent of voters approved of the president, and in North Dakota, which is 86 percent white, Trump registered an approval rating of 55 percent.\n\nGraph 3: White population and Trump approval ratings across Senate seats flipped by Republicans\n\nBenjamin Waddell The bars show the white population percentage in Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota. The line shows Trump's approval rating in each state, all above the national average.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, it seemed likely that Trump\u2019s demographic window might close if minorities and young people went to the polls in higher numbers. In the midterms, both groups voted in record numbers, contributing to Democratic flipping of Republican-held seats in Arizona and Nevada. Nonetheless, Republicans were able to retain control of the Senate by flipping seats in whiter states.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of the Electoral College.\n\nWe live in a nation that is deeply affected by racial inequalities, and we elect presidents and senators in a system that favors a handful of states where white, conservative voters make up the clear majority of eligible voters. This explains how openly racist candidates with \u201calt-right\u201d tendencies like Trump have been elected in recent years. And barring no major changes to the electoral landscape, it explains why more leaders of this nature may be elected in the future.\n\nFuture Elections\n\nAlthough diversity is on the rise across the U.S., including in rural areas, minority populations tend to be much younger than the majority group. In 2015 the median age for minorities in the U.S. was 31, whereas for whites, it was 43. In the 2016 election, the median age of voters was 47.5. And Trump cleaned house with voters in the 45 and older group, where he held an 8 percentage point advantage over Hillary Clinton. She maintained a 14 point advantage with 18-to-44-year-olds.\n\nSo what made the difference in 2016? Young people and young people of color in particular didn\u2019t turn out to vote at the same rates as white voters. Graph 4 illustrates voter turnout from 1980 to 2016 by age group.\n\nGraph 4: Voter turnout by age group, 1980 to 2016\n\nBenjamin Waddell\n\nGraph 5 shows voter turnout across racial and ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic whites go to the polls at much higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups. Black, non-Hispanic voters also turn out at high rates, but their rate fell sharply, from 66.6 to 59.6 percent in 2016, whereas white rates rose, from 64.1 to 65.3 percent. Hispanic and other ethnic groups have consistently voted at substantially lower rates.\n\nGraph 5: Voter turnout by racial and ethnic group, 1980 to 2016\n\nBenjamin Waddell\n\nIn the long run, as larger minority populations in rural states reach voting age, representation through the Electoral College may begin to reflect the nation\u2019s actual demographics again. However, in the short run, we are trapped in an electoral system that devalues minority voices."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Cole Delbyck", "title": "Kim Kardashian Confronting Tristan Thompson Over Cheating Scandal Is Petty Goals", "description": "The two came face-to-face in Khloe Kardashian's delivery room.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-khloe-tristan-thompson-cheating_us_5bec832fe4b0dbb7ea66b839", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec8f5b240000aa025834cf.jpeg?cache=GT5sHRJ38l&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:52:53Z", "content": "If Khloe Kardashian \u2019s game is the revenge body, then Kim Kardashian \u2019s is just straight-up revenge.

Currently on the letter, though not certain to stay on it, are:\n\n- Tim Ryan (D-Ohio)\n\n- Seth Moulton (D-Mass.)\n\n- Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.)\n\n- Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.)\n\n- Filemon Vela Jr. (D-Texas)\n\n- Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio)\n\n- Bill Foster (D-Ill.)\n\n- Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.)\n\n- Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.)\n\n- Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.)\n\n- Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.)\n\n- Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.)\n\n- Max Rose (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.)\n\n- Ben McAdams (D-Utah)\n\nThere is another contingent of Democrats \u2015 including Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), Dan Lipinksi (D-Ill.), Ron Kind (D-Wis.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) \u2015 who are seen as likely to vote against Pelosi, but who also are hesitant to sign the letter.\n\nFor Pelosi allies, keeping the number of names on the letter limited is a key to her survival, as more members publicly pledging to not support her would be a nail in the coffin.\n\nBut Pelosi also has a number of ways she could wrangle the speaker\u2019s gavel even if a dozen and a half members pledge to oppose her. For one, Democrats could make a new rule binding every member to vote for the Democratic nominee. Rule changes associated with that idea are already under consideration, and there\u2019s some thought that Pelosi may try to formalize rules so that Democrats have to vote for her, though many members question how this strategy would work. (Would they kick out the members who don\u2019t vote for the Democratic nominee? Would they still have a majority?)\n\nThere\u2019s also the thought that some Republicans could vote \u201cpresent,\u201c\n\nthus lowering the threshold for Pelosi. But that presents its own challenges. In effect, Republicans would have veto power over the speaker and Pelosi would not be negotiating from any position of strength.\n\nThe way the speaker election works is that a candidate first gets the nomination behind closed doors during the Democratic Caucus meeting. That is the easiest hurdle to clear. A candidate only needs a majority of their party for the speaker nomination, and Pelosi has that part essentially locked up.\n\nThe hard part is the floor vote, when a candidate needs a majority of the House: 218 of the 435 members. That number includes Republicans. While we don\u2019t know the exact breakdown of the House yet, it\u2019s likely to be around 234 Democrats and 201 Republicans \u2015 give or take a couple of members on both sides. If the number is 234 Democrats, Pelosi can lose only 16 Democrats if every member votes.\n\nThe trick for Pelosi would be to get some of her Democratic opponents \u2015 or Republicans \u2015 to vote present. That would lower the threshold for her election. In effect, a present vote would be a half-vote for Pelosi.\n\nBut the Democrats who say they are opposed to Pelosi are already swearing they won\u2019t vote present. If Pelosi can\u2019t convince some of those Democrats who oppose her to vote present, she has a real problem.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi members are working to gather as many names as possible as quick as possible, as they believe the longer they remain in the shadows, the more likely it is that Pelosi could flip some of their members.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s opponents also told HuffPost they think the actual number of Democrats who do not want to vote for Pelosi is much larger than anyone anticipates, and they remain confident she doesn\u2019t have the votes.\n\nRyan, who ran against Pelosi to be minority leader at the end of the last Congress, told reporters Wednesday that he was certain Pelosi didn\u2019t have the votes, and multiple members who support Pelosi even told HuffPost on the condition of anonymity that they believe she is in trouble.\n\nOne of the members pointed to Pelosi\u2019s minority leader race in 2016 with Ryan in which he received 63 votes from his Democratic colleagues to Pelosi\u2019s 134. This member said Pelosi didn\u2019t get the message when one-third of the caucus voted for a \u201cbackbencher.\u201d\n\nBut if Pelosi didn\u2019t get the message before, she and her team are certainly working now to try to tamp down the revolt and swing the incoming Democrats from no to yes \u2015 or at least to \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s allies all readily point out that \u201cyou can\u2019t beat somebody with nobody,\u201d but Pelosi\u2019s opponents are testing that idea. In fact, they seem to think their movement is strengthened without a clear alternative.\n\nThe idea is that, once Pelosi knows she can\u2019t win, she will step aside and there would be a new race for the speaker position.\n\nTo that point, one office for a prominent Democrat already reached out to HuffPost to suggest that their boss is well-positioned to become speaker if Pelosi can\u2019t get the votes.\n\nMembers believe \u2015 for good reason \u2015 that there would be a rush of candidates for the speaker job if Pelosi stepped down, potentially including Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Assistant Minority Leader Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).\n\nRyan, in an effort to deflect criticism that the anti-Pelosi Democrats are just trying to knock off a woman from a leadership role, repeatedly said Wednesday that he\u2019d like to see another woman become speaker, and he has pointed to four women: Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), Karen Bass (D-Calif.), and Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.). (Fudge and Rice are both also anti-Pelosi.)\n\nMoulton has also been strongly pushing Fudge, who is a former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi group is expected to release its letter by the end of the week, though Ryan also said they would hold the letter as long as they were still getting new signatures. Ryan, Moulton, and Perlmutter are the members loosely organizing the letter, and they\u2019re checking in mostly with the new Democrats to make sure they won\u2019t flip under pressure.\n\nBut Ryan also assured reporters Wednesday that there were more Democrats than just those who will be on the letter who intend to vote against Pelosi \u2015 they just don\u2019t want the scrutiny associated with revealing themselves.\n\nStill, Pelosi says she is confident she can survive.\n\nExiting a caucus meeting this morning, Pelosi said she could stop and take questions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a busy person,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be speaker of the House no matter what Seth Moulton says.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Arthur Delaney", "title": "Ted Cruz Clams Up About Beto O\u2019Rourke Funding Migrant Caravan", "description": "Never mind about that wild claim I made during the campaign, the Texas senator tells HuffPost.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-caravan_us_5bec80a7e4b09f4670062c5a", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec89b6220000bc04de3c9a.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:15:58Z", "content": "WASHINGTON He claimed during the campaign that his opponent illegally funded a caravan of migrants approaching the U.S. border, but now that he\u2019s won re-election, Sen.

Even some conservatives joined the chorus of criticism: \u201cThis is despicable, gutless and wrong,\u201d Christopher Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote on Twitter.\n\nSeveral Republicans in both chambers who are wary of American adventurism abroad and the legality of military action initiated without congressional approval have publicly supported the measures from Khanna and Sanders.\n\nTwo of them, Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Walter Jones (R-N.C.), lobbied fellow GOP lawmakers to vote against Ryan\u2019s effort in a Wednesday morning letter obtained by HuffPost. \u201cThis rule ... serves only to obstruct our constitutional right to decide questions regarding the use of military force,\u201d they wrote in a message also signed by Reps.

Tom MacArthur and made history in the process.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race on Wednesday afternoon, more than a week after the polls closed. Kim will become the first Korean-American Democrat to serve in Congress, which hasn\u2019t had a lawmaker of Korean descent since 1999. (Republican Young Kim is locked in a too-close-to-call race in California; if she prevails, she would be the first Korean-American woman in Congress.)\n\nAndy Kim\u2019s win adds to the House majority Democrats won in last Tuesday\u2019s election by gaining more than 30 seats and is the latest of a number of late-deciding races that went the party\u2019s way.\n\nThe son of South Korean immigrants who was raised in the Philadelphia exurb of Marlton, Kim campaigned as a moderate and didn\u2019t talk a lot about Trump in New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, a sprawling district that spans the state from the banks of the Delaware River to the Atlantic shoreline. Trump carried the district by six percentage points in 2016.\n\nIn the largely white district, Kim faced campaign ads that painted him as a carpetbagger despite his home state roots. One mailer, sent by the state\u2019s Republican Party, featured photos of fish heads on ice and Kim\u2019s name printed in Chop Suey font.\n\nAs vote-counting continued after no winner emerged on election night, Kim declared victory last week when he gained a lead on MacArthur. Kim gathered most of his support in Burlington County \u2015 the blueish suburbs of Philadelphia \u2015 while MacArthur\u2019s base was in Ocean County, the red part of the district that it home to a number of retirement communities.\n\nMacArthur, a millionaire former insurance executive, moved into the district from northern New Jersey to successfully run in 2014 for the seat that another Republican, former Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle Jon Runyan, was giving up.\n\nAlong with emerging as a vocal Trump supporter, MacArthur played a key role in reviving House Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare, an effort that was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2017.

(He also suggested people need to have voter ID to buy cereal at the store, which isn\u2019t true.)\n\nThe president has lied about voter fraud before. He once said that between 3 and 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election, but there\u2019s no evidence that\u2019s true. He convened a commission to investigate voter fraud but disbanded it after the panel only met twice.\n\nAny kind of voter fraud is rare, but the specific kind of fraud Trump seemed to be citing in his recent interview \u2015 voter impersonation at the polls \u2015 is particularly unusual. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former top Justice Department official, found there were just 31 credible allegations of voter impersonation between 2000 and 2014. There were over a billion votes cast during that same period. The Justice Department also studied voter fraud from 2002 to 2007 and didn\u2019t find much.\n\nWhen someone casts an illegal vote, it is usually because of confusion or error. Noncitizens may accidentally check a box indicating they\u2019re citizens and vote when no election official stops them. People with felony convictions may also be confused about whether they can vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come amid a slew of attacks on election officials in Florida who are counting votes to determine the outcome of races in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate, gubernatorial and agriculture commissioner race. Election experts say there\u2019s nothing unusual about what Florida officials are doing.\n\nShortly after the 2016 election, Trump alleged he only lost the state of New Hampshire because people were bused in to vote illegally. New Hampshire officials investigated the claim and found it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nNorth Carolina officials also looked for voter fraud after the 2016 election. State officials found 24 cases of double voting and two cases of voter impersonation that were referred to prosecutors. Around 4.8 million people voted in North Carolina in 2016.\n\nThe scant evidence of fraud hasn\u2019t stopped lawmakers in either state from passing new voting restrictions. In New Hampshire, Republicans passed a law requiring new voters to take additional steps to prove they were \u201cdomiciled\u201d at their address (a judge struck it down earlier this year). In North Carolina, Republicans put a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year to require photo voter ID at the polls. The measure passed last week.\n\nThe White House has previously pointed to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) as someone who can provide evidence of widespread voter fraud. Kobach supported Trump\u2019s claim that millions may have voted illegally in 2016 and claimed up to 18,000 noncitizens had attempted to register to vote in Kansas. But Kobach failed to successfully defend that claim in federal court earlier this year. A federal judge found that only 39 noncitizens had gotten on the rolls in the state since 1999."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Moye", "title": "Twitter Users Needle Donald Trump For His Claim You Need Voter ID To Buy Cereal", "description": "One Twitter user pointed out that Trump talking about cereal on National Pickle Day is distracting America from what's really important.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daily-caller-cereal-voter-id_us_5bec7b57e4b0598443d3c944", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec7fdd2600001703847b5a.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:32:37Z", "content": "Donald Trump has stated some very strange falsehoods in the past, but the one he made on Wednesday about voter ID cards is a doozy.

The devastation is yet another example of the collision of climate-related risks and the human-built environment. Climate change isn\u2019t the singular cause of the Camp, Hill and Woosley fires; however, it has amplified environmental factors (including warmer and dried-out soils) in creating a longer fire season that sets the stage for increased risk. Growth and development have met these environmental factors at what experts call the \u201cwildland-urban interface.\u201d\n\nThe wildland-urban interface (WUI) is defined as the intersection of undeveloped natural land and human-built environment. Here, homes, developments and public infrastructure meet or intermingle with undeveloped, environmentally sensitive areas. It\u2019s created when people migrate farther and farther into \u201cnatural\u201d areas in pursuit of privacy, natural aesthetics, recreational opportunities and more affordable housing. Where there are people, housing follows. And where there is housing, other critical infrastructures and development are needed.\n\nThe WUI is a key factor in identifying the potential for wildfire disaster losses \u2015 California alone has more 4.5 million homes located within the WUI. Growth alone is not necessarily a problem, but poorly planned and unmanaged growth \u2015 particularly in hazardous or risky areas \u2015 can result in catastrophe. Low-density development, such as individual homes, significantly increase the fire-fighting cost, for example. California is not alone in its need to advance policies related to the link between growth management, hazard mitigation and land use; most states have room for improvement (and not just limited to fire \u2015 floods, also).\n\nGrowth alone is not necessarily a problem, but poorly planned and unmanaged growth \u2015 particularly in hazardous or risky areas \u2015 can result in catastrophe.\n\nPhysical vulnerability in a natural hazards context is usually characterized by things like location and proximity of the human-built environment to a hazardous threat. And the western region of the U.S. is historically volatile. This is especially true in California, where fire is a part of the natural ecosystem; a variety of vegetation have adapted to fire, and some reproduce only after a large fire. But when physical risk meets the social environment (including homes and other infrastructure), the human-built environment can also be literal fuel for naturally occurring fires.\n\nBoth windblown embers (small pieces of burning wood) and the flame front (the line of fire moving with the wind and topography) also cause concern in the wildland-urban interface. Because embers, not just direct flame, can destroy structures. And embers may precede the flaming fire front, carried by winds and distributing burning brands or embers across long distances. These embers fall \u2015 or are wind-driven into vegetation around structures or into air vents \u2015 and can go undetected for some time.\n\nUrban and regional planners can help communities achieve smart growth in smarter places. More specifically, planners focused on hazard mitigation can help communities think about growth and development in the context of hazard risks and the vulnerabilities associated with those risks. Planners can also support communities in developing a hazard mitigation plan that includes long-term strategies for protecting people and property from future hazard events.\n\nUrban and regional planners can help communities achieve smart growth in smarter places.\n\nResearch has shown federal policies make little difference in community land-use actions. State policy, on the other hand, exerts a strong influence. Therefore, mitigation and adaptation strategies have to be locally grounded and locally governed. Zoning plays a role in planning as well and most often is carried out at the local municipal level; it regulates the type, location, bulk and density of development and continues to be based on the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act of 1924.\n\nSome of the nation\u2019s earliest zoning laws were motivated by fire. Setback zoning laws were a form of hazard mitigation in which houses were required to have a certain amount of space between them to prevent fires jumping from home to home. In fact, just a few years before SZEA was issued, the city of New York enacted a zoning resolution related to buildings, congestion, living conditions and to reduce the risks of fire. Zoning on a larger scale can be used as a planning tool to regulate growth and establish buffers between hazards (e.g., fire-prone wildlands) and human development.\n\nThe concept of adaptation \u2015 modifying building practices in consideration of climate change and changing environmental conditions \u2015 has grown in popularity over the last two decades. And a community\u2019s wildfire adaptation often sits at the household level. Take California\u2019s WUI building codes, for example. Specifically, the law requires that homeowners reduce vegetation 100 feet (or the property line) around their buildings to create a defensible space for firefighters and to protect their homes from wildfires. Building codes, which include ignition-resistant standards, are thought to protect buildings from being ignited by flying embers.\n\nOf course, a final tool in reducing risk is to incentivize development in lower-risk areas. Higher-density development in urban areas reduces the cost of fire protection and often reduces overall fire risk. Policymakers and planners should develop zoning and land-use policies that guide development away from the riskiest areas.\n\nSome of the nation\u2019s earliest zoning laws were motivated by fire.\n\nCommunities have all of these planning tools at their disposal, but more inclusive and innovative practices are needed to improve wildfire resilience. This means mitigating fire when possible and, when exposure is inevitable, bouncing back \u2015 and bouncing back in such a way that future buildings, structures and systems are more adapted. Communities across the country (including those in California) have already begun this process, but we believe many necessary household- and community-level adaptations have yet to be identified.\n\nPlanners must increasingly provide an opportunity for community members to participate in the development process, not just to voice concerns, but to exchange ideas and practices and find ways to actually implement adaptation strategies. Communities are more resilient when everyone has an opportunity to participate and share their vision for future growth. And as the recent wildfires in California have shown, we all have a stake in this.\n\nMarccus D.

But in the face of an endless barrage of mass shootings and daily gun deaths, he says doing nothing is no longer an option.\n\nUnder a city policy announced last month, between massacres at a Pittsburgh synagogue and at a bar in California, gun and ammunition companies seeking to outfit Toledo\u2019s law enforcement officers will first have to show that they follow what the city has deemed responsible business practices. It will use the following questions to judge potential partners:\n\nDo you manufacture assault weapons for civilian use?\n\nDo you sell assault weapons for civilian use?\n\nWhich firearms does your company agree to not sell to civilians?\n\nDo you require your dealers to conduct background checks?\n\nDoes your company have a plan in place to invest in gun- and ammunition-tracing technologies?\n\nDo you use, at a minimum, industry best practices for inventory control and transactions?\n\nThe policy \u2015 the first of its kind in the U.S. \u2015 will go into effect early next year, when the city begins soliciting bids for contracts for its gun and ammunition needs. The city\u2019s police chief said he agrees with the mayor\u2019s decision, telling Toledo\u2019s The Blade that it is \u201cnot an indictment on the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nKapszukiewicz said he sees his plan as a way to use the free market to tackle gun violence by trying to impose change on the firearm industry, which has long resisted getting involved in divisive debates about how to best prevent shootings.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is quintessentially American and baked into the capitalist structure that has been a foundation of this country since its founding,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nWade Kapszukiewicz Campaign Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz is working to get other U.S. mayors behind a plan to do business exclusively with gun companies that follow responsible practices.\n\nAlthough there are federal regulations designed to control the flow of firearms from manufacturer to buyer, few gun companies go beyond those standards. And when safeguards inevitably falter and guns are diverted onto the black market or used in crimes, manufacturers and dealers are largely shielded from liability under a federal law passed in 2005.\n\nBy creating a financial incentive for responsible behavior, Kapszukiewicz hopes he can get manufacturers to take further steps to address the violence committed with their products.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this is going to eradicate the problem in our nation or even avoid a tragedy in my own city, but just because we can\u2019t do everything doesn\u2019t mean we can do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Kapszukiewicz\u2019s ideal world, the U.S. would be taking a multifaceted approach to gun violence, touching on issues of access to firearms, mental health care and even school safety. But with congressional lawmakers showing that they \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about the bloodshed, firearm manufacturers must be part of the solution, Kapszukiewicz said. And if they won\u2019t step up voluntarily, he\u2019ll try to force their hand.\n\nToledo will likely need help creating the financial pressure necessary to do that. The city spends $150,000 to $175,000 every year on firearms, ammunition and replacement parts, he said \u2014 a tiny fraction of a large gun company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut if other cities follow Toledo\u2019s lead, the movement could have more sway.\n\nAdd the other big cities of Ohio, and \u201cthe $150,000 of free-market pressure that the city of Toledo is going to bring to bear on this problem all of a sudden becomes almost $1 million,\u201d said Kapszukiewicz.\n\nAnd with buy-in from larger cities around the nation, that amount could swell far beyond that.\n\n\u201cWhile the gun companies could easily ignore Toledo and its $150,000 and never miss it, my sense is that they would miss the tens of millions of dollars of business that they would lose from the major cities of America,\u201d he said.\n\nOther mayors have already expressed an interest in joining Kapszukiewicz in his attempt to use cities\u2019 consumer power to encourage better corporate behavior from gun companies, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley told HuffPost.\n\nCranley chairs the Task Force of Mayors and Police Chiefs under the U.S. Conference of Mayors. He said he\u2019ll be calling a meeting of the committee in the spring to discuss expanding Toledo\u2019s policy nationwide.\n\n\u201cI suspect that we\u2019ll have broad-based support from the mayors and from the chiefs to try to come up with a good behavior model that a majority of us would agree to,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is for all the members of the conference to sign on.\u201d\n\nCranley will be watching to see how gun companies respond to Toledo\u2019s questionnaire, he said. He added that he intends to reach out to firearm manufacturers for feedback on criteria they could use to craft a national model for the conference to consider.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe that at least one of the companies, if not several, are going to want to be responsive,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not yet clear how manufacturers will respond to Kapszukiewicz\u2019s survey.\n\nThe first questions about so-called assault weapons are fairly straightforward. Many of the leading suppliers of law enforcement sidearms also manufacture semiautomatic rifles, which are typically available to civilians, as well as police and military.\n\nSig Sauer, the company that currently makes Toledo\u2019s duty pistols, also manufactures a variety of rifles, including the one used in the 2016 mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Glock, a favorite of U.S. police departments, is one of the few large companies that offer only handguns.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images A rack of Sig Sauer rifles at the company's booth during the National Rifle Association annual meeting in Dallas, May 5.\n\nOther questions on Toledo\u2019s questionnaire are less clear cut. Federal law already stipulates that licensed gun dealers must conduct background checks at the point of sale. But there are loopholes.\n\nThe gunman in the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting was able to purchase a handgun before his background check was completed, for example. Walmart is among the retailers that have sought to patch that gap by adopting a policy of denying any gun sale in which the buyer hasn\u2019t been approved by federal authorities. Because manufacturers don\u2019t typically sell their products directly to consumers, they may have limited control over this sort of retail practice.\n\nFederal law has also established guidelines for inventory control and transactions, to be upheld by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Mike Weisser, a Massachusetts-based gun dealer.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a federal dealer with a federal license and I ship my gun to another place, I have to keep track of where that gun went,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ATF inspects that.\u201d\n\nThe bureau lays out additional best practices for federally licensed gun dealers to keep track of their wares, but the agency lacks the authority to fully enforce the standards. Most large firearm manufacturers are likely in adherence, said Weisser. But if a company is not, it would be hard to know unless ATF caught it in a specific violation.\n\nQuestions about manufacturer investments in tracing technologies could also pose issues, he said. Mainstream gun companies aren\u2019t investing in those areas, he said, even though California law requires all new handguns sold in the state to be able to microscopically stamp the firearm\u2019s make, model and serial number onto each fired shell casing, allowing police to trace spent ammunition back to individual guns. Weisser argued that mayors might be better off pressing manufacturers on other gun features related to child safety.\n\nThose companies that are doing it poorly will see their market share diminish, or they\u2019ll change their behavior in an effort to win that business. Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz\n\nKapszukiewicz said he understands the initial set of questions may not be perfect. It\u2019s possible the survey will reveal that no gun company fits Toledo\u2019s definition of \u201cresponsible,\u201d he said, or conversely, that all gun companies provide answers to make them look as though they\u2019re already doing everything they can to keep their products out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.\n\nBut in exploring the topic, he said, he was surprised to learn that nobody had done research identifying responsible and irresponsible firearm manufacturers. By establishing a procedure to figure out which companies have the strongest policies, cities \u2015 and consumers more generally \u2015 will be able to make more informed choices about which gunmakers to support."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sarah Ruiz-Grossman", "title": "Southern California Wildfire Burns Most Of National Park In Santa Monica Mountains", "description": "The Woolsey fire outside Los Angeles has torched 83 percent of the federal parkland popular among hikers.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/santa-monica-mountains-national-park-burned-woolsey-fire_us_5bec7cdce4b0598443d3ca8c", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec7e42210000de05ca267f.png?cache=B4CYna47cl&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:52:14Z", "content": "The deadly Woolsey fire in Southern California has burned 83 percent of the national parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, Cal Fire said.

Patekar had been a revered figure in Bollywood for decades and had won numerous awards. Dutta was young and beautiful and relatively new to the industry; she had won the Miss India Universe title a few years prior, and had successfully made the transition into movies.\n\nHer role in the film was a small one, a so-called item number in which she was to dance to one song alongside Patekar. Instead, Dutta says, she was sexually harassed on the job. She alleges that Patekar took over choreography for the song himself and groped her during dance rehearsals. As she left the set later, she was hounded by a mob that smashed the windows of her car. When she stood up for herself, she was fired and replaced by another actress.\n\nThe incident made national news that year, and Dutta explicitly named Patekar as her harasser. But the response, from both the media and the public, was tepid at best.\n\nFast forward to September, when Dutta came forward about the incident once more. This time, after a year of Me Too stories making waves around the globe, she was finally heard. India was catapulted into its own Me Too moment, and hundreds of women used social media to post their accounts of being harassed. They did so in such huge numbers that, in October, when Google Trends released a visualization of the heat generated by Me Too searches around the world, India burned the brightest.\n\nWhen Google Trends released a visualization of the heat generated by Me Too searches around the world, India burned the brightest.\n\nTo date, all of these accusations have come from women with power. They are celebrities, or professional and upper-middle-class women in film, advertising, publishing and journalism. Their stories have exposed truths about men in eminent multinational organizations that, for years, were brushed aside or hidden.\n\nAnd though this is happening a few oceans away from the United States, it has the potential to create seismic changes here. Bollywood puts out an average of 1,000 movies annually, which are consumed by an estimated 2.7 billion people worldwide. What happens there is a matter of global economic and cultural importance.\n\nAlready, Indian companies are toppling amid sexual harassment scandals. A prominent Indian production house, Phantom Films, has dissolved after a co-founder was accused of predatory behavior toward an ex-employee. The company was owned by Reliance Entertainment, part of the Reliance Group, with total assets worth approximately $110 billion. A vast number of Bollywood projects are being pulled. The fourth film in the \u201cHousefull\u201d franchise replaces Patekar, with rumors his scenes are being reshot with a new actor. Even though Patekar only was involved in 10 days worth of footage for this installment, some estimates put the additional cost of the reshoots at about $300,000.\n\n- via Getty Images Indian Bollywood actor Nana Patekar is mobbed by the media as he leaves after making a statement outside his home in Mumbai on Oct. 8.\n\nThough it is challenging to put a rupee or dollar value on the cost of sexual harassment for victims, for large corporations there is a price tag. There are lost hours, lost employees, legal fees and PR for damage control, to say nothing of consumer-driven boycotts.\n\nThere are cultural ripples to consider alongside the economic ones. If the impact of the Me Too movement in the West, and in the U.S. in particular, are any guide, India\u2019s will change a lot of what happens in Indian cinema. That change is desperately needed in Bollywood, which has long normalized traditional gender roles. In 4,000 Hindi movies and 800 trailers released from 1970 to 2017, female roles were both trivialized and used as a lure for cinema audiences, according to an analysis by IBM, IIT and DTU.\n\nIn other words, Bollywood is still using butts and boobs to sell tickets, especially in movie posters, and typically the actresses whose \u201cassets\u201d are on display get less screen time and less money than their male counterparts.\n\nBollywood is still using butts and boobs to sell tickets, and the actresses whose 'assets' are on display get less screen-time and less money than their male counterparts.\n\nAs it is in Hollywood, it\u2019s too soon to say if the changes wrought in India by Me Too will be sweeping or permanent. But whatever those changes are, they won\u2019t stay confined to India. An estimated 16 million Indians \u2015 roughly double the population of New York City \u2015 reside outside India, and the total Indian diaspora amounts to 31.2 million people. In 2017 there were 4.4 million Indian Americans living in the United States. Where once Indian aunties in Chicago might have taken in a traditional Indian rom-com, today they can choose from the increasingly common women-centric Bollywood narratives. And the number of movies that tell women\u2019s stories is projected to increase further in coming years.\n\nStill, Me Too in India has a long, steep road ahead. Though sexual harassment remains a systemic issue, the ability to fight it is restricted to the privileged few in urban areas. Lower-class, and indeed, lower-caste women remain discounted from this conversation and shut out of the changes that result from it. Once Me Too in India is rises above poverty and culture, it will be truly inclusive to all victims.\n\nTanushree Dutta is filing fresh civil and criminal cases as India watches on tenterhooks. Though it\u2019s taken an additional year for India to enter the Me Too era, the impact of the case that sparked a hundred others isn\u2019t just local, it\u2019s global. Like women everywhere, Indian women are angry and, for the first time, vocal.\n\n\u201cI am seeing the women who have suffered with the burden for too long,\u201d Dutta said at a recent event. \u201cI am looking at them as human beings who have now let go of the burden on their chest. I am looking at these souls that are now getting liberated.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carly Ledbetter", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith Recalls Time 2 White Cops Hurled Racial Slurs At Her", "description": "\"I will never forget,\" the actress said on her \"Red Table Talk\" series.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jada-pinkett-smith-white-cops-slurs_us_5bec696ce4b0a2569fd12311", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec772c3c000091030eb940.png?cache=oihdsi4djm&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:11:54Z", "content": "Jada Pinkett Smith said she will never forget the devastating slurs two white police offers shouted at her when she was younger.

The fourth is nonchalant.\n\nThe instructions this time are a little different. As with other escape rooms, you have a certain amount of time to figure out how to get out. Also, you know that clues to the puzzle are hidden somewhere in the room. Figure them out and you\u2019ll be able to unlock the door.\n\nBut here\u2019s the difference: the temperature in this room will go up a degree with every minute that passes. If you and those four strangers can\u2019t figure out how to stop it from rising, you\u2019ll succumb to heat stroke. In other words, if you don\u2019t escape in the allotted time period, you\u2019ll die.\n\nYou immediately set to work looking for the clues. Maybe one or two are in the book on the table or maybe a code is carved on the underside of the table. Maybe you need to use the chair to climb up close enough to scrutinize the crown molding near the ceiling. Three of the strangers are doing what you\u2019re doing: trying to uncover clues.\n\nThe fourth is leaning against the wall, looking relaxed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke,\u201d he says to no one in particular.\n\n\u201cI already feel it getting warmer in here,\u201d you respond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just your imagination,\u201d he replies. \u201cPower of suggestion. Fake news.\u201d\n\nThe clock is already ticking. It can\u2019t be your imagination. It\u2019s definitely hotter in the room than when you first entered. You\u2019re sweating. Everyone\u2019s sweating, even the leaning man. \u201cTemperatures naturally fluctuate,\u201d he comments. \u201cIt might be going up now, but it will go down again. Count on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d says the teenager in your group. \u201cHe\u2019s just a jerk.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right and there\u2019s no time to try to persuade him either. The four of you are now uncovering one clue after another, which brings you to the truly challenging part: cracking the code. Each of you contributes something: the teenager quickly solves a quadratic equation, the stay-at-home mom translates that Japanese phrase, and the aging literature professor recognizes the quote from Dante\u2019s Inferno.\n\nAnd once the four of you use this code to open a panel you\u2019ve discovered beneath a loose floorboard, you finally get the chance to apply your engineering knowhow to the situation. You personally figure out how to reset the thermostat hidden inside it and so manage to slow the rise in temperature. It\u2019s not much perhaps, but it\u2019s a start.\n\nYou\u2019re working smoothly together now. Only through cooperation have you been able to get this far. Problem is, it\u2019s still too warm in the room. The 70-something professor is now crumpled in the corner, breathing heavily. You only have one bottle of water to share and a couple of nutrition bars and there are still more puzzles to solve. The teenager is urging you on \u2015 and little wonder, she has her whole life ahead of her.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch. You\u2019re getting tired, all of you.\n\nThis Hot Room is only the latest and greatest challenge you\u2019ve faced. You\u2019ve been doing escape rooms now for what seems like decades, each challenge evidently more urgent than the last.\n\nYou were relatively young when you first stumbled into this craze. In the War Room, you were trapped with two heavily armed men pointing high-powered weapons at each other. In the Pandemic Room, you were all infected with a deadly virus and had to find an antidote. Most recently, you were locked in the Autocrat Room with a raving narcissist who believed he was the king of the world and who had his finger on a very real button that could destroy you, him, and everyone else.\n\nYet somehow you managed to extricate yourself from each of those rooms \u2015 only to find yourself trapped in this one. You should be tired!\n\nYou can\u2019t even believe it: Only now is the reality of it all beginning to dawn on you \u2015 that you\u2019ve been proceeding through a series of nested escape rooms, boxes within boxes, that have led you here, to the ultimate box.\n\nIn this Hot Room, time is running out, resources are scarce, and you have to listen to an idiot leaning against a wall doing nothing, and acting as if this were a delightful sauna, not a potential coffin.\n\nYou suspect that this is the human condition, this endless succession of crises. Civilizations have risen and fallen throughout history. One culture after another has failed to figure out the riddle inscribed in its environment. Some didn\u2019t even realize that they were on the verge of collapse until it was too late.\n\nBut this is different. Each previous time, it was just one part of the globe \u2015 the Mycenaeans, the Khmer, the Mayans, the Romans \u2015 that grappled with its communal fate.\n\nNow, you\u2019re addressing the fate of the planet. This Hot Room, you\u2019ve come to realize, is Earth itself. And there\u2019s nothing on the other side of the door except the cold, cold void.\n\nTo solve the riddle of this ultimate escape room means performing a genuine miracle. You have to stop the temperature from rising. You have to multiply the water bottles and the nutrition bars. Most challenging of all perhaps, you have to prevent everyone from giving in to despair.\n\nSo, you take time out to do what you\u2019ve always done in such situations. You did it at work to rally your discouraged colleagues. You did it for your children at bedtime to dispel the nightly terrors.\n\nYou tell a story.\n\nA Matryoshka of Dystopias\n\nMy novel Splinterlands was an exploration of one particular dystopian path: the nationalist fragmentation of the world into ever-smaller splinters. This was no far-fetched fantasy when I wrote it, just an extrapolation, circa early 2016, from ongoing trends: tensions within the European Union, the polarization of politics in the United States, the rise of far-right parties, the widening global gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nUnfortunately, those trends only intensified after I finished the manuscript. It hadn\u2019t actually been my intention to predict. Like any politically engaged dystopian novel, Splinterlands was meant to be a warning. I knew things could get that bad. I just didn\u2019t think they would \u2015 not so quickly anyway.\n\nEven before the book came out, Britain had voted to leave the European Union and then, more improbably yet, Donald Trump managed to win the 2016 presidential election. Instead of being weird exceptions, the Trump-Brexit developments turned out to be part of a terrifying trajectory. Since then, the far right has assumed positions of power in Austria, Italy, and now Brazil. It has done well in elections in Germany and Sweden. In France, the extremist National Front is now, according to pollsters, the country\u2019s most popular party.\n\nGet on a train today in Poland, heading for North Korea, and you\u2019ll pass through an enormous swath of territory ruled by fake democrats and authentic autocrats. An illiberal axis connects this great expanse of Eurasia to Turkey, Israel, India, the Philippines, Colombia, and Nicaragua. The military or one-party governments hold sway over much of Southeast Asia. Religious zealots and strong-arm leaders rule the greater part of the Middle East. Democracy is weak in most African countries and non-existent in others.\n\nTogether, these illiberal forces are deeply suspicious of any transnational authority that demands they adhere to global human rights norms and international standards.\n\nThe international community, never a particularly robust entity, is beginning to evaporate. Countries are withdrawing from international agreements like the Global Pact for Migration and organizations like the International Criminal Court. With its high-profile exits, Donald Trump\u2019s America has done its best to undermine the Paris accord on climate change and the U.N. Human Rights Council. It\u2019s not quite a rush to the exits, nor is this retreat into sovereign parochialism irreversible \u2015 not yet anyway. But the Splinterlands scenario of the total collapse of the international order and the fragmentation of countries like the United States and China has become incrementally more likely.\n\nMeanwhile, global inequality continues to worsen. According to Oxfam, \u201c82% of the wealth created last year went to the richest one percent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity got nothing.\u201d Facilitated by financial deregulation, corruption has become rampant, registering as a serious problem in two-thirds of the world\u2019s countries, according to the latest Transparency International report. The media are under attack even in traditionally liberal countries like the United States.\n\nAnd surveillance by the state and corporate conglomerates like Facebook has become commonplace. In China, the two forces are working hand in hand under the auspices of the phone app WeChat. Chinese use the application to shop, listen to music, and exchange messages. But the app also assigns users a score based on everything from online behavior to how they drive their cars, and if that score is too low, they\u2019re locked out of certain jobs, travel opportunities, and schools. The system should be fully operational and exportable in a couple of years.\n\nThese various real-world dystopian scenarios are not discrete. They are indeed nested in one another, like one of those Russian matryoshka dolls that open only to reveal smaller versions of itself, each inside the next. Just as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once characterized Soviet Russia as \u201ca riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,\u201d think of the current reality as never-ending wars wrapped in nuclear proliferation inside nationalist fragmentation enclosed in climate change.\n\nThis last challenge is, of course, the most urgent, transcending politics as it does. Governments of every political flavor have contributed to it and continue to dither in the face of an obviously looming catastrophe, while economic greed prevents any sustainable solution. In other words, we\u2019re heading for a true existential reckoning. Heat up the planet enough and there won\u2019t be any more politics or economics. It will be the real end of history, not the triumphalist one that Francis Fukuyama thought up in 1989 in anticipation of the end of the Cold War.\n\nIn Splinterlands, I still saw climate change as one part of an overall ecosystem of threat. In my new dystopian novel, Frostlands, climate change takes center stage. A stand-alone sequel set in 2051, the moment when Splinterlands ended, it focuses on Rachel Leopold, an aging climatologist, living in Arcadia, a sustainable community in what was once part of Vermont. Arcadia is now under attack by unknown forces and Rachel is worried that those attacks are directed at her. She\u2019s been conducting experiments in secret to regenerate the Arctic ice cap in a desperate bid to enclose the remaining methane gas trapped in the permafrost. But (as in our world today) not everyone shares her urgent desire to stop climate change.\n\nAs with Splinterlands, the dystopia of Frostlands is, in fact, unspooling in real life on an accelerated basis. As environmentalist Elizabeth Kolbert wrote in a recent New Yorker:\n\n\u201dArctic soils contain hundreds of billions of tons of carbon, in the form of frozen and only partially decomposed plants. As the region heats up, much of this carbon is likely to be released into the atmosphere, where it will trap more heat... In the Arctic Ocean, vast stores of methane lie buried under frozen sediments. If these stores, too, are released, the resulting warming is likely to be catastrophic.\u201d\n\nKolbert then quotes Peter Wadhams, an ice specialist: \u201cThe risk of an Arctic seabed methane pulse is one of the greatest immediate risks facing the human race.\u201d\n\nWhy wait until 2051 when you can experience apocalypse now?\n\nEvolutionary Dead-End?\n\nA climatologist, a nuclear physicist, and an epidemiologist walk into a bar.\n\nThe bartender gestures to the three tiers of bottles arrayed behind her. \u201cPick your poison.\u201d\n\nThe three professionals laugh ruefully. The climate scientist links arms with her two colleagues and says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick your poison?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no joke.\n\nIn a culture that emphasizes free choice \u2015 among political candidates, breakfast cereals, and Internet avatars \u2015 we now face the ultimate choice. We can choose our dystopian future. We can cut funding for medical research and emergency response and increase our vulnerability to the next plague. We can elect leaders who have itchy nuclear fingers and increase the likelihood that we go out with a bang. Or, if we somehow make it out of those particular escape rooms, we can drink the ultimate poison and heat up the planet until it can no longer sustain anything but cockroaches.\n\nFor some, the inexcusable slowness with which the international community is addressing climate change \u2015 along with the other apocalyptic scenarios \u2015 is yet more proof that humans, like dinosaurs, have outlived their evolutionary usefulness. It\u2019s hard not to feel that all of humanity deserves a Darwin award when you see the effects of recent superstorms, the vanishing of polar ice, the heedless drilling for oil and gas everywhere, and the dilatory efforts of even sensibly led countries like South Korea to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nDinosaurs, of course, couldn\u2019t put up much of a fight against the asteroid that slammed into Earth 66 million years ago and the cataclysms that followed. You, however, can still tell the bartender, \u201cThanks, but no thanks, on the poison tonight.\u201d You can still solve the riddle of the Hot Room and hope that the next challenge won\u2019t be quite as apocalyptic.\n\nRemember: there\u2019s always going to be some guy leaning against the wall, making light of your efforts to save the world. It\u2019s maddening to have to listen to him. So, like Odysseus, you must close your ears to the siren songs of what passes for pragmatism today. The politics of the possible don\u2019t stand much chance in an impossible situation.\n\nIn that Hot Room, everyone but the skeptic is back to work, even the aging professor. Your story has inspired them to attempt the impossible: to work together, to solve the riddle, to overcome the resistance. They know the odds. They understand that they\u2019re already living in a dystopia.\n\nBut now you\u2019ve given them reason to believe that even dystopias can have sequels.\n\nJohn Feffer, a TomDispatch regular, is the author of the dystopian novel Splinterlands and the director of Foreign Policy In Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies.

No one was hurt in the blaze, since the camps were evacuated late Thursday, along with their Torah scrolls, camp director Seth Toybes told HuffPost in an email late Tuesday night.\n\nSince 1952, generations of Jewish Americans have attended the Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps, forging lifelong friendships and memories while learning how to be proud of their religious traditions. The camps became a prototype for other Jewish summer camps across the nation.\n\nThe camps were the brainchild of the temple\u2019s Rabbi Alfred Wolf, a prominent Jewish and interfaith leader who escaped Germany in 1935 as anti-Semitism was rising in his homeland. In 1950 he rented Presbyterian facilities and organized a summer camp for Jewish youths in Los Angeles.\n\nThe rented camp had many crosses on its property. So when Wolf opened Camp Hess Kramer at its current location in 1952, its leaders erected wooden menorahs around the site. Toybes said that through this ancient Jewish symbol, the leaders wanted to remind campers that \u201cthis was a safe place for Jews to be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States granted Jews freedoms of practice that stood in stark contrast to Nazi Germany and our founders were proud of that,\u201d Toybes said.\n\nOver the years, the camps also became a beloved retreat for non-Jewish youths \u2015 including young leaders in the Chicano movement of the 1960s.\n\nThe Wilshire Boulevard Temple Camps\u2019 menorah before the fire:\n\nMany of the wooden menorahs erected around the site, including Camp Hess Kramer\u2019s last surviving original menorah, were destroyed in the fire, Toybes said. He added that the metal and concrete outdoor menorah likely survived because it was built to withstand the elements.\n\nOver the years, that menorah has become a symbol of the camp community.\n\n\u201cThe menorah stands on our hillside as a symbol to our campers, staff and others that we are Jewish and proud of this,\u201d Toybes said.\n\nIn the wake of the Woolsey fire, he said, he thinks the menorah is helping the community rally together.\n\n\u201cI believe that people are not only feeling inspired that it survived the blaze but emboldened to rebuild this space that has meant so much to so many, Jews and non Jews alike over the years,\u201d Toybes wrote.\n\nAlumni of the camps have been posting on social media to mourn the destruction and reminisce about their time there.\n\ni spent several summers at #CampHessKramer as a kid. this is absolutely devastating and it\u2019s amazing that the menorah is still standing. it\u2019s a beacon of hope and a reminder of our toughness. we will come back from this...we always do. #WoolseyFire #California https://t.co/cvlHuaP2Z9 \u2014 jessica b (@pennylane586) November 12, 2018\n\nSo sad..generations of Jewish families remember this camp with great fondness, including me and my son.. \u2014 Michael Hiltzik (@hiltzikm) November 13, 2018\n\n2.

But after several days of speculation, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the chairman of the House tax committee, said Republicans would only pass a new tax cut if they kept control of both congressional chambers.\n\nSince it seemed unlikely Republicans would keep the House, Brady\u2019s condition essentially amounted to an escape from questions about the proposal, which only Trump had talked about but which not even he could explain.\n\nAs for whether the tax cut even existed or was simply a political ploy by a president known to make up stuff, Brady insisted on Wednesday that it was based on some vague semblance of reality.\n\n\u201cIn truth, we\u2019ve been working with the president for some time and had developed some good options for him,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nTrump had said that unlike last year\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2015 which benefited all income groups but especially the wealthy \u2015 the new bill would be just for the middle class.

A staggering 95 percent of these cases were never covered by national or international media, UIHI revealed Wednesday in its new report.\n\nThe oldest of the victims was 83. The youngest, an infant. Nearly 100 cases were tied to domestic violence, sexual assault or police brutality. The circumstances surrounding many of the other deaths and disappearances remain unknown.\n\nThese data were collected from cities that were known to have Native populations in 29 states. Some two-thirds of the cases that UIHI managed to find were from the last decade, although the oldest case dated back to 1943.\n\nThe 500-plus number likely represents a gross undercount, the Seattle-based tribal epidemiology center noted. The limited available information at various law enforcement agencies, and in some cases, the complete lack of it, speaks volumes about the racist attitudes surrounding indigenous issues in America, UIHI said.\n\n\u201cOur women and our children, our girls, they hold such value within our communities,\u201d said Abigail Echo-Hawk, the chief research officer at the Seattle Indian Health Board and the director of UIHI. \u201cFor us to let their deaths to just go unnoticed \u2014 for people not to know that we have missing women in our communities, for their voices not to be heard \u2014 to me was unacceptable.\u201d\n\nUIHI faced significant challenges over the past year while trying to gather information. Almost half of municipal police departments either failed to respond within the set time limit or failed to respond at all, the report said, and 15 percent cited an inability to search for American Indian, Native American or Alaska Native people in their data systems. Searching news reports, social media, missing persons databases and other sources, UIHI added up more than 150 cases, dubbed \u201cthe invisible 153,\u201d that did not even exist in police records.\n\nFor too long, data has been about other people telling Native people who we are. Annita Lucchesi, cartographer and doctoral intern at the Urban Indian Health Institute\n\nAnnita Lucchesi, a cartographer and doctoral intern at UIHI, worked with the center to count the missing and murdered indigenous women in the 71 selected cities. It\u2019s an issue close to Lucchesi\u2019s heart: Ashley Loring Heavyrunner, one of her former students from Blackfeet Community College in Browning, Montana, has been missing for more than a year. Heavyrunner vanished from Montana\u2019s Blackfeet Reservation on June 7, 2017, at age 20.\n\n\u201cFor too long, data has been about other people telling Native people who we are,\u201d said Lucchesi. \u201cIt\u2019s time we tell the world who we are, and that the world actually listens to us.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 alone, 5,712 cases of missing Native women nationwide \u2015 in cities, towns and rural areas \u2015 were reported to the National Crime Information Center. Just 116 of them were logged in the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s missing persons database, according to UIHI\u2019s report. Despite the sobering scope of the crisis, relatively little action has been taken at a political level.\n\nIn 2017, Democrats introduced a bill known as Savanna\u2019s Act that is still pending in the U.S. House of Representatives. Named after 22-year-old Savanna Greywind of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who was killed while pregnant in 2017, the bill was designed in part to increase and improve data collection for cases of missing and murdered indigenous women. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who introduced the bill in the Senate, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who co-sponsored it, unveiled UIHI\u2019s report on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWhen I introduced Savanna\u2019s Act, one of the main goals was to raise the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women to a national level and begin the conversation of how to address it. ... With today\u2019s report and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee moving forward on Savanna\u2019s Act, we\u2019re taking important steps toward finally raising the awareness needed to save lives and tackle this horrible epidemic,\u201d Heitkamp said in a statement.\n\nToo often, Echo-Hawk said, Native women and girls go missing \u201cthree times\u201d \u2015 in life, in data and in the media. \u201cTheir deaths are only visible to their families and to their communities who hold that grief, that hardship. And yet nobody sees it but them,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother area where indigenous women and girls have been noticeably absent is in the global Me Too movement. More than 4 in 5 American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetimes, including more than half who have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2016 study funded by the National Institute of Justice. More than 1 in 3 had experienced violence in the past year.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women in Indian country touches everybody in the community,\u201d said Bree Black Horse, an attorney with the law firm of Galanda Broadman, who works to protect the civil rights of tribal individuals. \u201cAs Indian people, we all know somebody who has been murdered or who has gone missing or had been the victim of violence.\u201d\n\nThe Me Too movement \u201capplies to Native American women, but not in the same way,\u201d Black Horse added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to worry about things like equal pay and fair treatment in the workplace when, as a Native American woman, at times you\u2019re just trying to survive.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Parkland Shooting Suspect Tackled Jail Guard And Took His Stun Gun, Sheriff Says", "description": "Nikolas Cruz already faces the death penalty in the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-shooter-jail-guard_us_5bec59e3e4b057089767c963", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec5f9f1d00008b0031321a.jpeg?ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:56:20Z", "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

No, it\u2019s more about the movies\u2019 shared \u201ccommunal scope,\u201d as McQueen put it when we talked last week. He wants \u201cWidows\u201d to have the same universal appeal as Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nStarring a blue book of Hollywood\u2019s finest, \u201cWidows\u201d twists and turns with fist-pumping electricity, indicting capitalism, American politics and racist police without needing a single sermon to drive home its messages \u2015 unless, that is, you count a TED Talk-worthy admonishment from Viola Davis: \u201cWe have a lot to do; crying isn\u2019t on the list.\u201d\n\nCo-written with \u201cGone Girl\u201d and \u201cSharp Objects\u201d savant Gillian Flynn, \u201cWidows\u201d follows four women uniting to pull off the heist that killed their husbands and saddled them with debts. At the center is Davis\u2019 Veronica, a strong-willed Chicagoan married to the ill-fated thieves\u2019 ringleader (Liam Neeson). Davis is joined by Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo, who are pitted against corrupt lawmakers (Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall), menacing crime chiefs (Daniel Kaluuya, Brian Tyree Henry) and other assorted bystanders (Carrie Coon, Jacki Weaver, Jon Bernthal, a fluffy white dog).\n\nThe project underscores how much McQueen\u2019s style and sensibilities have shape-shifted across each of his four movies. \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d elevated the 49-year-old British filmmaker\u2019s profile, but he first drew art-house audiences with 2008\u2019s \u201cHunger\u201d (a drama about the 1981 Irish hunger strike) and 2011\u2019s \u201cShame\u201d (a stark portrait of a sex addict featuring a highly naked Michael Fassbender). \u201cWidows\u201d is a ballpark away from any of those, less a meditation and more a decree.\n\nMcQueen, chipper and eloquent, called me last week to discuss \u201cWidows,\u201d which premiered to raves at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and opens in theaters Nov. 16. We talked about Davis and Neeson\u2019s intense make-out scene, Trumpian parallels and why McQueen wanted this to be his version of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d\n\nOf your movies, \u201cWidows\u201d has the most obvious commercial appeal. Does it feel like a different experience for you?\n\nYes, it does. The biggest ingredient missing when you finish a movie, of course, is the audience. The response we\u2019ve gotten, basically since Toronto, has been amazing. I think the audiences are responding to it as a group. It\u2019s like being on a roller coaster ride, where people watching the movie are gasping and cheering and applauding and laughing. It\u2019s like an added soundtrack to the movie that obviously isn\u2019t there when you\u2019re making it. I can\u2019t think of the word. What\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for? Oh God, I can\u2019t even think of the word! It\u2019s been \u2014 OK, how do I say this? I\u2019m trying to get the right sentence. It\u2019s almost like audiences have been responding in unison. That\u2019s the word. Thank God for that. Found it in the end.\n\nFox Liam Neeson and Viola Davis in \"Widows.\"\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with the opening shot. It\u2019s a striking image that immediately grabs people because it\u2019s so intimate: Viola and Liam in bed, really going at each other\u2019s faces. How did the three of you arrive at what that passion would look like in that very first moment?\n\nFirstly and foremostly, I think they enjoyed being together as actors who appreciate each other. It\u2019s one of those things where I just said, \u201cGo for it. Get your tongues out!\u201d I needed to establish from the very beginning of the picture that these two middle-aged people were passionately in love with each other. You have to have that stamp from the immediate beginning of the picture to put into effect the relationship and the meaning of that relationship and the passion and love they have for each other \u2015 and that was through the kissing. Also, I enjoyed looking at it. It\u2019s quite good. There you go.\n\nIt\u2019s also gripping because you juxtapose their romance with a raucous, violent shootout. What does that dichotomy mean to you?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s like a caress and a slap, a caress and a slap. Just as you get comfortable, you get woken up. That was what I was interested in going for, to throw the audience from one side of the cinema to the other side of the cinema. Again, when you enter into that space, even if you\u2019re there with your popcorn and your soda, it\u2019s, \u201cOh, I\u2019m in.\u201d We use that to get the audience into the picture in the initial opening scenes, basically.\n\nIt\u2019s quiet versus chaos, which is interesting in relation to your previous movies. \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d for obvious historical reasons, was labeled an important movie. Typically that\u2019s a calling card for art-house films and Oscar darlings. I think, in 2018 especially, \u201cWidows\u201d has a certain importance about it too \u2014 and it\u2019s still very much a twisty crowd-pleaser with blockbuster appeal. Were you conscious of blending those sensibilities?\n\nYes, I was, in a way. When people think of \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d or when people think of \u201cChinatown,\u201d you can go from some sort of accountant to some guy working in a florist\u2019s shop or a bookshop, or someone working as a top lawyer somewhere, or what have you, and it doesn\u2019t matter. [It could be] a guy working as a construction worker. All those guys will be interested in those movies. It has a certain communal scope. It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from; everybody\u2019s going to be looking at that picture. And that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted to make a picture that could be seen as high or seen as low. And also, the fact of the matter is that the larger matter is whether it\u2019s good or bad. End of story. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Wong Kar-wai or, I don\u2019t know, who\u2019s the most commercial filmmaker out there? Spielberg? I don\u2019t know. Doesn\u2019t matter to me.\n\nAlso, what I wanted to do was make a roller coaster ride of a movie. What I mean by that is, in every heist picture, as soon as it\u2019s moving, you know there\u2019s going to be this journey. Therefore, I wanted to take the audience on this roller coaster ride through this political, social environment. All the dips and swirls, all of that stuff, when you\u2019re in that situation as an audience member, you know there\u2019s going to be some kind of comeuppance at a certain point.\n\nFox Viola Davis and Cynthia Erivo in \"Widows.\"\n\nThe heist movie is a familiar genre, but \u201cWidows\u201d twists its tropes. Here, the heist is a necessity instead of an act of showmanship. Did you study other heist films to consider what to emulate \u2014 or, more specifically, what not to emulate?\n\nNo, not at all. It was the story. It\u2019s like anything else. Genres are meant to be broken. Before there was a heist, it was something else. It was just about how you break rules. So I wasn\u2019t thinking about, \u201cThis is a heist movie and that\u2019s not.\u201d I was thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s a good picture and what\u2019s not?\u201d These women\u2019s husbands died in an attempted heist, and the women have to pick up the reins. I take the nucleus of that narrative and place it in Chicago. So to study heist movies doesn\u2019t do any good for me because it\u2019s about tension, it\u2019s about suspense, it\u2019s about timing, it\u2019s about pacing, it\u2019s about performances within those spaces.\n\nWhen \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d came out, you talked about finding sympathy in the Michael Fassbender character, a brutal slave owner, and not seeing him merely as a monster. In a year like this, do you feel similarly about Colin Farrell\u2019s character in \u201cWidows,\u201d a corrupt legacy politician who uses Chicago\u2019s have-nots for gain? The same goes for Colin\u2019s farther, played by Robert Duvall.\n\nWell, did I use the word \u201csympathy\u201d? I don\u2019t think I did use the word \u201csympathy.\u201d\n\nNo, I\u2019m extrapolating a bit. You said you saw him as a \u201chuman being\u201d instead of a \u201cdevil.\u201d\n\nSure, I don\u2019t shy away from that. He does bad things, but he doesn\u2019t understand why. It\u2019s a similar thing with Colin. He has empathy, to a certain extent, even if he\u2019s a person you completely disagree with. You can\u2019t tell the truth with one-dimensional characters. In some ways, I kind of pity someone like Mulligan, Colin Farrell\u2019s character. He has an inkling of what\u2019s going on, but somehow he\u2019s been forced down this road \u2014 maybe by his father, maybe by his assistant, but also by himself. Even if he knows better, he\u2019s found the correct path to succeed.\n\nFox Colin Farrell in \"Widows.\"\n\nRobert Duvall\u2019s character evokes the sort of archetypal white, male, old-guard politician who rants about illegal immigrants. Or, framed differently, he evokes, say, Donald Trump. Some people will certainly read it that way because of what\u2019s going in America at the moment. Was that intentional?\n\nI think it\u2019s always been there. Ten years ago, 20 years ago \u2014 it\u2019s always been there. It\u2019s nothing new, so I didn\u2019t have to flex my muscle or think that hard or think of Trump to do it. But also, for Robert Duvall, he\u2019s a survival character. Check out Chicago. Jesus Christ, who\u2019s that notorious mayor of Chicago? Richard Daley, for example. And there are more around the country, and others in Europe. That kind of nepotism having a grip on power is nothing new.\n\nAlso, you have to understand that character. He can\u2019t be a one-dimensional character. This is a person whose wife died at an early age, and he\u2019s raising a son. There are all kind of expectations being put on his future.\n\nThinking of him as a survivalist is an interesting angle. The thing I love about \u201cWidows\u201d is that it\u2019s a movie full of paradoxes. One of the more humorous juxtapositions is Viola Davis\u2019 fluffy white dog. Here she is getting roped into this outsize crime, which itself has ties to all this inner-city corruption, and the dog ends up exemplifying her everdayness. She won\u2019t do anything without making sure it\u2019s cared for.\n\nIt\u2019s all she has. She\u2019s lost her husband \u2014 and something else, but we can\u2019t talk about that. It\u2019s the only thing she has. I\u2019m happy people are laughing, but the importance of that dog is that it softens her. A lot of people could think Verionica is a bit of a B-I-T-C-H person because of the weight of her recent past, which we have no idea about, but we find out later on. The dog softens her in a very subliminal way: OK, she does have this thing she cares for. It\u2019s a huge plot piece in the picture. Also, at the beginning of the picture I said, \u201cWell, we have to have her put the dog in a kennel because she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to come back or not.\u201d So yes, I love that people will realize there\u2019s a reason and a purpose for this \u2014 it\u2019s not an expensive accessory; it\u2019s a really important piece in her life, and in the picture\u2019s narrative. I love that sort of disguise.\n\nFilmmakers often say you shouldn\u2019t work with children or animals. How was the dog on the set?\n\nBeautiful. Viola, I think, wanted to keep her. She was a great dog, a wonderful dog. I just love the fact that when you first look at it, you think nothing of it, and all of a sudden it becomes bigger than your first impression. There\u2019s a lot of icebergs in this picture. That\u2019s what\u2019s keeping people stimulated and excited.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s interesting about this picture is a lot of people have said to me how much they want to see it again. Like a roller coaster ride, first you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Then you know what\u2019s going to happen, and even with the anticipation, you get another thrill. That\u2019s why I made this picture for 200 or 500 or 1,000 people. I didn\u2019t make it for some person with a laptop popping in and out of the fridge every five minutes. It was very important to me to have that response from the audience. It is a group-participation picture.\n\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s something you didn\u2019t hear a lot with your previous films. They\u2019re much tougher to watch, emotionally.\n\nThe thing about it is, people label you as soon as you come out the door. I\u2019ve only made three pictures before this one! This is my fourth picture! And people like to have an idea of who you are before you\u2019re able to make any grounds. People say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s not like a Steve McQueen picture.\u201d Well, man, I\u2019m just starting. I need to actually get somewhere first before you start thinking about what kind of person or filmmaker I am.\n\nFox Daniel Kaluuya and Brian Tyree Henry in \"Widows.\"\n\nYou\u2019re not ready for the quote-unquote \u201cSteve McQueen picture\u201d to be a crystallized idea that gets perpetuated as if you were someone like Spielberg, who\u2019s made a movie almost every year for four decades.\n\nFor sure. The whole idea of being labeled is disconcerting anyway. As an artist, you\u2019re always looking and trying to find some sort of reasons to sacrifice a lot. You leave your family behind, your friends behind, and go to live in another city for a year or so.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not ready for people to make conclusions about your body of work, something each of your movies has is a striking scene captured in one long take: Michael Fassbender talking about the strike in \u201cHunger\u201d and running in \u201cShame,\u201d Chiwetel Ejiofor with the noose around his neck in \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d and now the Colin Farrell shot in \u201cWidows\u201d that pans from low-rent Chicago to all the privileged mansions mere blocks away. Is there a throughline with these senes? Do they have anything in common beyond the technique?\n\nNo, not at all. What happens is that I never put a stencil on a situation. I don\u2019t come at a situation and say, \u201cI will do this in this shot, and this in that shot.\u201d Basically, it\u2019s what the narrative is saying and how it needs to be shot. So the whole idea of a tracking shot is like having a two-shot or an over-the-shoulder shot; for me, it\u2019s just that. It doesn\u2019t mean anything other than, \u201cWhat is the best way of depicting that particular part of the narrative?\u201d It\u2019s not about me flexing my muscles and saying, \u201cLook what I can do.\u201d How can it serve the story better? Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\nIf I make a film where that doesn\u2019t happen, great. Maybe I\u2019ll make a film where there\u2019s not an over-the-shoulder shot.

Like many deeply rooted cultural myths, the idea has a kernel of truth in it.\n\nIn this episode of IVFML, we go back to our guests from Season One to ask what life is like now that they had children thanks to infertility treatments and whether they are trying to add to their family.\n\nInfertility is a diverse diagnosis, experts say, and whether couples will be able to conceive spontaneously depends on why they were deemed infertile in the first place.\n\nSome people, like Season One guest John Murray, were able to spontaneously conceive a child after infertility treatments. Other guests, like Silvija Ozols or Nam and Aubrey Tran, may hope for a similar outcome but may be more resigned to plunging back into infertility treatments when it comes time to bring more children into the family. Our final guest for the episode, Candace Wohl, knew from the beginning that she would never conceive that \u201csurprise\u201d baby. Wohl had her uterus removed as part of cancer treatment, and thus cannot carry a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cFor many couples, the diagnosis of infertility is more gray,\u201d said Dr. Beth W. Rackow, a fertility specialist at Columbia University Fertility Center.\n\n\u201cSome of these couples may be subfertile and can still conceive on her own,\u201d she explained. \u201cHowever, pursuing infertility treatment can speed up the time until pregnancy.\u201d\n\nAnd while a minority of patients will conceive spontaneously on their own, the odds are that if you needed help to have your first child, you\u2019re going to need help with your second child, said Dr. Ilana Ressler, a reproductive endocrinologist with Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut.\n\nThat struggle may be different the second time around, Ressler said.\n\n\u201cIt can be isolating, with less social support, as the couple already has a child,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may feel reluctant or guilty reaching out to others for fear of not \u2018being grateful\u2019 for the child they already have.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, said Rackow, couples may feel a new ease or lightness when it comes to infertility treatments to add more children to the family.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is the distraction of a child, or a different sense of possibility since they have conceived before,\u201d she guessed."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "HuffPost Video", "title": "Family Of Black Security Guard Killed By Officer Files Federal Lawsuit", "description": "Jemel Roberson was shot dead by police, as he held down a suspect at the bar where he worked.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-black-security-guard-was-killed-by-police_us_5bec4453e4b0dd5f94c8110e", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec61c73c00008e030eb93d.jpeg?cache=xNerFS7X7d&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:48:27Z", "content": "Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

According to the lawsuit, de la Huerta was \u201cwarned by Weinstein that any effort to take legal action against him would fail and would prompt him to interfere with her future success and career as an actress.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit includes images of Weinstein talking to \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d producer Martin Scorsese three weeks before de la Huerta\u2019s contract on the show was abruptly terminated.

The only example they found was from 1866, before the creation of the Justice Department. Nevertheless, the opinion concluded that Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker would be legitimate.\n\n\u201cFollowing Attorney General Sessions\u2019s resignation, the President could have relied upon the Deputy Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or an Assistant Attorney General to serve as Acting Attorney General. But the availability of potential alternatives does not disable Congress from providing the President with discretion to designate other persons,\u201d Engel wrote. \u201cNothing in the text of the Constitution or historical practice suggests that the President may turn to an official who has not been confirmed by the Senate if, but only if, there is no appropriate Senate-confirmed official available.\u201d\n\nOLC, sometimes referred to as the president\u2019s law firm, is a small unit within the Justice Department that plays an important role in the executive branch by offering internal legal reviews before the president or agency takes action. It\u2019s the office that signed off on President Barack Obama\u2019s use of drones against U.S. citizens, and the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d during the George W. Bush era. Much of OLC\u2019s work is typically shielded from the public, but it does occasionally make its opinions public when it benefits the administration to do so \u2015 such as when there are questions about whether the attorney general has been legitimately appointed.\n\n\n\nA senior Justice Department official declined to say when, precisely, the White House asked OLC to opine on Trump\u2019s options should Sessions resign. The OLC opinion takes the position that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered whether Sessions was fired or resigned.\n\nOLC cited dozens of examples of individuals taking control of top agency positions on an acting basis without being confirmed by the Senate, but could find only one example of an acting attorney general who had not been Senate-confirmed. J. Hubley Ashton, the opinion noted, was acting attorney general for six days in 1866 after the resignation of James Speed, who was appointed by Abraham Lincoln but resigned because he disagreed with President Andrew Johnson.

Those Lee lauded included a longtime collaborator, Jack Kirby.\n\nBack in the 1970s, Evanier was Kirby\u2019s assistant. He saw up close the talents of that legendary artist, a man who some in the comics industry today regard as the true creator behind beloved Marvel characters like The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk. Kirby\u2019s name never became quite as well known as Lee\u2019s, so Evanier was happy to hear Lee giving credit to him, as well as to the others.\n\n\u201cI went to the phone and called [Lee] and thanked him for doing that,\u201d Evanier recalled. \u201cI said I wish he did more of it. He said, \u2018I should do more of that.\u2019 But at times he disappointed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have so many things to say about [Lee] that it\u2019s going to take me a while to distill them down...,\u201d wrote Evanier. He continued:\n\nHis achievements in the world of comic books were awesome. I happen to think they\u2019re not exactly what a lot of people think but I don\u2019t doubt their size and endurance. I knew him since 1970, worked for him a few times, talked with him at length and fielded an awful lot of phone calls from him asking me questions about comic books he worked on. He really did have a bad memory, if not when he first started telling people he had a bad memory, then certainly later on as he turned more and more into the Stan Lee character he\u2019d created for himself. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to write now.\n\nUnlike the superlative-laden odes to an inarguably treasured icon of pop culture, Evanier\u2019s blog revealed something more: Stan Lee wasn\u2019t a superhero. He was a flawed human being whose legacy is just as complicated as the costumed demigods he helped create.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost not long after he published the post, Evanier elaborated.\n\n\u201cStan himself, he was a very complicated man,\u201d he said. \u201cOn many levels, there were things to admire about him; there were things you had to overlook to respect him sometimes. I grew up on his work, I got to know him very well, I liked many, many things about him. He participated in a legendary body of work for which I now see obits that vastly over-credited his participation. But I think that\u2019s to be expected at a time when someone like that passes.\u201d\n\nAlbert L. Ortega via Getty Images Comic book covers by Walt Simonson and Jack Kirby.\n\nBut by exaggerating Lee\u2019s status in comic history, Evanier explained, we run the risk of erasing the other voices who helped build the comic world we know today.\n\n\u201cI think that might at best be half right,\u201d he said of the claim that Lee is the \u201csingle greatest contributor\u201d to his field. \u201cThere is this problem of dividing credits when there\u2019s no official standard. He worked with some amazing artists who also were writers, being people who came up with plots and storylines and figured out what would happen in each panel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can say without fear of contradiction that [Lee] participated in this wonderful body of work, that the Marvel characters are an incredible force of nature that will live forever and just get bigger and bigger every time you look,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can also say without contradiction that his co-creators did not fare as well in terms of credit or remuneration.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the creation of Marvel\u2019s comic book characters was always a collaborative process, Evanier said, with artists contributing to the stories and their arcs, often without proper credit. Lee was always billed as his stories\u2019 first creator, while artists like Kirby or Steve Ditko, who co-created Spider-Man, came in a distant second. They famously resented Lee for it.\n\n\u201cWhen I met [Lee] in 1970, it became very clear to me early on that while he wanted to be rich the way everyone wants to be rich, what he wanted most was to be famous,\u201d Evanier said. \u201cAnd in the last decade or two, I got to see Stan be more famous than he ever dreamed, more a celebrity than he ever imagined, and you never saw anyone be happier at that than Stan.\u201d\n\nEvanier added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that he didn\u2019t deserve all that, but you tend to think with all that stardom, it\u2019d be nice if some of it had been shown to the other people who were responsible for the storylines and invention of characters. He and I had a few differences at times where I told him to his face that I didn\u2019t feel he had played well with others.\u201d\n\nshould also take the moment of stan lee's passing to note two of the key artists who worked with him to make legendary art - jack kirby and steve ditko pic.twitter.com/bqyJoYPc5S \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) November 12, 2018\n\nThroughout our conversation, Evanier spoke specifically of Kirby. Though beloved by comics industry fanatics and fanboys, Kirby failed to receive the recognition, notoriety or compensation he was looking for before his death in 1994.\n\n\u201cJack came out of a time when the most important thing a man did was provide for his family and he was frustrated when he was denied the ability to do that,\u201d Evanier recalled. \u201cStan was younger than Jack but essentially of the same era... It\u2019s just sometimes people have trouble separating what was done, and they shouldn\u2019t because these were co-creations, and they weren\u2019t necessarily co-creations where Stan wrote everything and Jack drew everything. Jack did draw everything, but Jack was a fountain of ideas and concepts and storylines and plots.\u201d\n\nThe label \u201cco-creator\u201d shouldn\u2019t downplay the immense role Lee played in igniting an entire fandom community. Todd McFarlane, the co-creator of Venom, told HuffPost he admired Lee as a kid before later going on to work at Marvel. In his opinion, Lee didn\u2019t take credit where it wasn\u2019t due. Rather than say things like \u201cI created,\u201d McFarlane said Lee would use the word \u201cwe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, unfortunately, part of the thing that gets put into this mix is he lived to be 95 and some of his co-creators didn\u2019t,\u201d McFarlane said. \u201cSo we have a tendency as a society to naturally just go to the person in front of us. When there were Stan and Jack Kirby, we talked about the both of them. But once Jack left us the only person left now is Stan.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t trying to steal [credit] away,\u201d McFarlane added. \u201cIt just got put on him. People were misusing the word. I was around a lot of people that would say \u2018the creator,\u2019 and I probably slipped up. [I\u2019d say] \u2018the creator of Iron Man,\u2019 and he would correct me and go, \u2018No, I created it with so and so.\u2019\u201d\n\nToday, Kirby is getting more acknowledgment. Following a lawsuit against Marvel by Kirby\u2019s family, which was settled in 2014, the artist now receives co-creator credit on various Marvel characters. That development, Evanier said, is a positive one.\n\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t let Lee completely off the hook for how Kirby and the other artists were treated, Evanier still at times counts himself among Lee\u2019s fans. He\u2019s glad the departed comic book legend \u2015 who worked a series of menial jobs in the comic industry before catapulting to fame \u2015 will be remembered for his contributions to Marvel\u2019s eventual global success.\n\n\u201cYou also have got these guys who created these comics who came out of the Depression who tried very hard to make livings at that time, who were working in an industry that was not prepared for this level of success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who owned and ran Marvel in its early days sold it for what now looks like the sale of Manhattan for junk jewelry. The creators did not get rewarded because the people who owned the building had no idea what the material was worth. We still don\u2019t because every time we think it\u2019s reached its maximum, it grows bigger on us. I\u2019m very pleased that Stan got to ride some success on that.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Curtis M.

Each has unique talents, specializes in a different genre of music and, of course, brings their own set of demons to the table.\n\nGreg Gayne/Netflix Netflix's \"Westside\" examines the lives, loves and struggles of nine Los Angeles musicians.\n\n\u201cWestside\u201d is further distinguished from its reality TV predecessors by its original soundtrack, featuring songs by Diane Warren, Robert John \u201cMutt\u201d Lange, Ryan Tedder and a host of other A-list writers and producers. Each member of the \u201cWestside\u201d cast gets a solo number, presented as a slickly produced music video that punctuates the dramatic action taking place on the show.\n\nMurray, 31, began developing the show within \u201cWestside\u201d with Ary and Byous after they returned from performing on a cruise ship. Together, they brainstormed ideas for a \u201cvery sexy, cabaret-esque\u201d evening, to be staged at 1 Oak in L.A. Once the remaining performers had been assembled, Murray began documenting the rehearsal process, and eventually approached Netflix executives, who he said \u201cloved\u201d the idea of a stylized yet off-the-cuff series with original music. (Check out Murray\u2019s song, \u201cAll I Wanna Be,\u201d in the video below.)\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so beautiful about unscripted television is that you don\u2019t need to make things happen. Life itself is very interesting if you let it happen naturally,\u201d Murray told HuffPost. \u201cI think every single person really made a pact with themselves that they would be their most truthful self.\u201d\n\nFor each of the show\u2019s nine subjects, nothing was off-limits, Murray said. One of his most personal milestones is included in the show\u2019s third episode, when he marries his husband, Andy Hotchkiss. He and Hotchkiss, who is not a performer, discussed whether to permit the \u201cWestside\u201d cameras to document their wedding for the show last year. Ultimately, they decided to give the team the go-ahead.\n\n\u201cI know people whose parents still don\u2019t accept them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m finding through this process that I have a responsibility to become the role model I never knew that I needed to be. Something that I take very seriously now is that with this platform [and] if someone could see this wedding and see all the love that was there on that night... maybe I might help someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWestside\u201d marks the latest chapter in Murray\u2019s varied performing career, which began when he booked a Hamburger Helper commercial at age 8. The New Jersey native studied acting at New York University before relocating to Los Angeles, and these days, he\u2019s focused less on Hollywood stardom and more on simply \u201ccreating work I love and can stand behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way the show would be a success is if we allowed ourselves to be the most authentic,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAs soon as we thought about the message that [having our wedding on the show] was going to send, it became about sharing love, acceptance and support.\u201d\n\nGreg Gayne/Netflix \u201cI have a responsibility to become the role model I never knew that I needed to be,\" co-creator Sean Patrick Murray said.\n\nWhether Murray and his \u201cWestside\u201d cast mates get the artistic recognition they crave from the show remains to be seen. (Early reviews of the series have been mixed.) Still, he\u2019s hopeful the show will be renewed for additional seasons and ultimately serve as a platform that \u201ccreates more opportunities for them to be their most authentic selves.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Stephanie Drenka", "title": "I\u2019m Adopted, But I Won\u2019t Be Celebrating National Adoption Month", "description": "National Adoption Awareness Month minimizes individual experiences of adoptees and masks the deeper systemic problems that keep the practice in existence.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-adoption-awareness-month-adoptee-perspective_us_5b3b9f5de4b09e4a8b27e53b", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be47a862000007f0502910f.jpeg?cache=nibp9x0q2f&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:35:27Z", "content": "Everyone asks me an adoptee what Im doing to celebrate National Adoption Awareness Month.

As if I should rejoice each November because I\u2019m so \u201clucky\u201d to have been adopted.\n\nBut to me, this month feels like being at a wild party and losing something in the crowd. You try calling for help \u2015 asking others to join in your search \u2015 but the music and festivities drown out your voice. Your interruption is not only unwanted; it is unacknowledged. This party is not for you.\n\nThe name itself irks me. National Adoption Awareness Month. I don\u2019t believe our country is generally unaware of adoption. The practice has been happening everywhere in various forms since ancient times. America\u2019s first modern adoption law dates back to the 19th century. Today people seem well versed in the popular \u201crescuer and rescued\u201d adoption narrative. We don\u2019t need a month, week or day to celebrate this.\n\nNancy Verrier wrote in her book The Primal Wound: Understanding the Adopted Child, \u201cWhen the adoptee is separated from her birth mother, she undergoes extensive trauma. She will not remember this trauma, but it will stay in her subconscious as she lived it.\u201d\n\nSome would consider me fortunate because I\u2019ve been able to cope with my trauma. I went to therapy for the first time at the age of 32. My counselor expressed her surprise that I was so quickly able to name the root of my issues. The desperation to please people, inability to say no, fear of abandonment, low self-esteem, susceptibility to abusive relationships \u2014 it all traces back to this thing that we\u2019re supposed to celebrate.\n\nNational Adoption Awareness Month minimizes individual experiences of adoptees and masks the deeper systemic problems that keep the practice in existence. The month remains dominated by happy stories of adoptive parents and their \u201cforever families.\u201d Adoptees who deviate from the narrative are deemed angry or bitter, traitors to the narrative of adoptees as \u201dthe lucky ones.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, I\u2019ve lived the fairy-tale adoption story. At 3 months old, I was one of the youngest adoptees to arrive from South Korea to the United States. My entire extended family waited at the airport to welcome me lovingly. I\u2019ve felt that blanket of love every day since May 21, 1986.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Stephanie Drenka Stephanie Drenka was adopted at the age of 3 months old from Eastern Social Welfare Society in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nI returned to South Korea in 2008 for a Future Leaders\u2019 Conference sponsored by the Overseas Koreans Foundation. During a visit to my adoption agency, I learned that I had two elder biological sisters who may or may not have known about me. That day, I decided to begin a long and emotionally taxing birth family search.\n\nThe adoption agency sent telegrams to my birth mother\u2019s home address for years. I went on a South Korean television show in the hope of reaching someone who might have a clue to my past.\n\nIn September 2013, I received an email from my social worker in South Korea. Although it was against the rules for her to reach out to my biological sisters, she had sent a telegraph to one of them. My sister responded. The family (including my younger brother, who I didn\u2019t know existed) had been searching too. They wanted to meet me as soon as possible. I flew to South Korea and reunited with them over Thanksgiving week.\n\nIt was during this trip that I understood fully: Adoption is loss. Not only the loss I experienced as an adoptee but also what my birth family endured.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Stephanie Drenka Drenka was reunited as an adult with her birth mother in South Korea, who expressed both gratitude that her daughter lived a happy life after adoption and shame from her decision.\n\nMy social worker had advised me to take childhood photos to share with them. I did her one better and played a video montage my mom made for my college graduation. As they watched my younger self dance across the screen in old high school show choir clips, the reactions weren\u2019t what I expected. One of my sisters started crying and left the room. Naively, I thought the video would bring them some sort of joy or comfort. In reality, I was forcing them to face the inescapable proof of a life they missed.\n\nAfterward, they shared the painful story of my adoption. It turns out that my fairy-tale ending wasn\u2019t so happily ever after: My birth father, who died in 2004, was abusive. He already had two daughters and wanted a son. After learning my gender, he coerced my birth mother into relinquishing me for adoption.\n\nShe wrote in a letter to me, \u201cAfter you were born and I was alone holding you, in that short time, I wanted to hold you until I died. It\u2019s a feeling I still can\u2019t forget today.\u201d\n\nI left South Korea with more questions than I arrived. With language and transportation barriers, there will never be enough time together to make up for lost years.\n\nBeing adopted means a lifetime of either searching or denial. Following trails of breadcrumbs, trying to find clues to your existence without losing yourself. It is an ever-present reminder that you belong nowhere. Sometimes the burden becomes too much to bear.\n\nA study conducted at the University of Minnesota from 1998 to 2008 found adopted offspring to be nearly four times as likely to attempt suicide as non-adopted offspring. Even with a relatively positive adoption story, I\u2019ve battled with depression \u2014 in silence, because I felt society\u2019s pressure to be grateful for my adoption. Though I never slit my wrists, there are scars on my ankle from self-mutilation as a teenager. Years of bullying and microaggressions marked my body and heart. I kept the cuts hidden under clothing, masking my pain with a smile I wore onstage in show choir and theater.\n\nMy high school in Southlake, Texas, recently made the news after a video of white students chanting the N-word went viral. This seemed shocking to some but came as no surprise to me. In my class of more than 500 students, I could count on my hands those who were people of color. During a diversity week at school, a classmate asked what I would do if he called me a Chink. He proceeded to repeat, \u201cChink, Chink, Chink,\u201d until he tired of my unresponsiveness. Though I wouldn\u2019t let my anger rise to his ignorance, internalized racism haunted me for years.\n\nI\u2019ve encountered many adoptive parents who insist they don\u2019t see their transracially adopted child as different from them. This false concept of colorblindness denies the existence of racism in America and their children\u2019s racial identity. Some even claim their children have never experienced bias or encounters with racist people. It is more likely that they have but are afraid or don\u2019t know how to discuss it. To speak truth is to be ungrateful.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Stephanie Drenka Drenka maintains contact with her biological siblings post-reunion, but language and geographic barriers limit their relationship.\n\nPlease do not mistake my tone as anti-adoption. I\u2019ve visited the Eastern Social Welfare Society\u2019s home for babies in Seoul. I stood helplessly on the other side of the glass staring into a room filled with days-old infants wailing without comfort. I didn\u2019t have the proper vaccinations to hold and soothe them and quiet their cries. I would never want them to live without a sense of belonging or family. But I do know: This is only the beginning of their struggle.\n\nMy call to action is not for the end of adoption. It is for a deeper understanding of its complexities, even the not-so-pleasant parts. There needs to be a centering of adoptee voices and value placed on their experiences. We must acknowledge their loss and develop trauma-informed support systems for them.\n\nIf you must do something to commemorate National Adoption Awareness Month, please honor the words of adoptees.

But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\u201d\n\nQuestions about Nielsen\u2019s job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump\u2019s first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Laura Ingraham Goes On 10-Minute Rant Against Diverse New Members Of Congress", "description": "The Fox News host dubbed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar the \u201cfour horsewomen of the apocalypse.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham-new-progressive-congress_us_5bec0687e4b044bbb1aaefc5", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec09d33c000091030eb906.jpeg?cache=xvkrsoq89k&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:09:59Z", "content": "Fox News host Laura Ingraham dedicated a segment of her show Tuesday to criticizing four progressive Democrats who won election to Congress in last weeks midterms.

When a moderator pried for more details about Kim\u2019s role in the J.K. Rowling franchise, she had only this to say: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nUntil about two months ago, with the \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d sequel due to hit theaters a week before Thanksgiving, Kim\u2019s role in the movie was almost entirely obscured. Her character was originally listed as \u201cMaledictus,\u201d which, according to the fan site Pottermore, is \u201ca witch who carries a \u2018blood curse\u2019 that \u2018destines her ultimately to transform into a beast.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut in September, a trailer confirmed her fate (and a popular fan theory): Kim\u2019s Maledictus would be Nagini, who before falling prey to Voldemort\u2019s reign was a young female circus performer with the ability to temporarily morph into a snake.\n\nIt\u2019s at the circus where Nagini befriends one of the central characters from the first \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d installment, Credence (Ezra Miller), who\u2019s struggling to define himself after an adolescence spent under the purview of a magic-hating foster mom in New York, where his wizarding abilities spiraled out of control.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Magic \u2015 plus protagonist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and American auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) \u2015 are hoping to track down Credence before Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) does. The evil wizard believes that Credence, who was able to survive the Obscurus parasite that formed inside him when his foster mother forced him to repress his magic, will help Grindelwald execute his dreams of wizard-muggle domination.\n\n\u201cThe path has been laid,\u201d Grindelwald says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s following it. The trail that will lead him to me.\u201d\n\nKim mostly serves as a sympathetic companion to Credence in \u201dThe Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d The film doesn\u2019t provide many clues about her eventual transformation into a snake, nor does it explain how she ends up turning to the dark side in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t yet have a wand, a fact she lamented during the panel. But unlike lovable, goofy Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) \u2015 a no-maj, the American term for \u201cmuggle\u201d \u2015 Kim told Entertainment Weekly in a recent interview, Nagini does have \u201cpowers that are yet to be explored.\u201d\n\nNagini\u2019s future is canonical, but just how she gets there \u2015 that\u2019s the stuff of intrigue. It\u2019s the kind of breadcrumb-laden story that will likely reel viewers into theaters for the third, fourth and fifth installments of \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d no matter how lackluster the sequels prove to be.\n\nA special Q&A with the cast in front of Hogwarts after fans experienced #FantasticBeasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald for the first time! #ProtectTheSecrets | \ud83d\udcf7: @LeStudioPhotos pic.twitter.com/FiHBp06Mj2 \u2014 Fantastic Beasts (@FantasticBeasts) November 4, 2018\n\nLike most Pottheads, Kim, now 33, read all of Rowling\u2019s books when they came out. She said she thinks it\u2019s \u201cso cool\u201d that her character isn\u2019t confined to the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d storylines and also appears in the \u201ciconic \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 films.\u201d\n\n\u201cKorean translations weren\u2019t available, so I had someone send books from the U.S. to me,\u201d she said during the panel, which was held in front of the Hogwarts replica at Wizarding World after a fan screening last week in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile she\u2019s new to Rowling\u2019s universe, the actress has been part of other popular franchises. She played Dr. Helen Cho in Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron,\u201d and last year she starred alongside Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in \u201cThe Dark Tower,\u201d based on Stephen King\u2019s popular books.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. announced Nagini\u2019s involvement in \u201cThe Crimes of Grindelwald,\u201d Rowling admitted to her Twitter followers that she had been sitting on the character\u2019s origin story for \u201caround twenty years.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of revelation that Harry Potter fans live for; a primary player\u2019s biography \u2015 two decades in the making! \u2015 is finally escaping the depths of Pottermore for the silver screen. Rowling was probably not prepared for the wave of criticism that followed.\n\nAfter the trailer revealed that a South Korean actress would be playing a woman destined to become the pet snake of a white male villain, a group of fans on social media criticized Rowling for the casting choice. Some \u2015 like author Ellen Oh \u2015 argued that by picking an Asian woman for the role, the movie was perpetuating long-standing racist tropes.\n\nI feel like this is the problem when white people want to diversify and don't actually ask POC how to do so. They don't make the connection between making Nagini an Asian woman who later on is the pet of a white man. So I'm going to say it right now. That shit is racist. \u2014 Ellen \"VOTE LIKE OUR LIVES DEPENDS ON IT\" Oh (@ElloEllenOh) September 25, 2018\n\nOh said she believes the casting controversy blew up in part because \u201cof what is a clear, stark division within the fandom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who will not hear one single bad word against their fave and those who recognize that she is human and as problematic as any of us can be if we don\u2019t learn from our mistakes,\u201d Oh told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cWe have to consider the type of representation we are getting,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m of the mindset that no representation is better than bad representation because bad representation has far-reaching negative ramifications. But I know that there are some who believe bad representation is better than none.\u201d\n\nRowling has faced criticism, namely for the lack of people of color cast in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise. In 2015 one YouTube user \u2015 Dylan Marron \u2015 compiled a video titled \u201cEvery Single Word Spoken by a Person of Color in the Entire \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Film Series.\u201d It\u2019s just over six minutes long. There are eight films in the series.\n\nOh noted that Rowling \u201cnever addressed the hurt she gave the Native American community for the cultural appropriation she committed when she published the history of the magical community in North America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like it was an opportunity for her to listen and learn, but instead, she doubled down and continued to expand the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 universe without thinking about the ramifications to her IPOC [indigenous people of color] fans,\u201d Oh said.\n\nRowling disagrees with her critics regarding the casting for Nagini. In response to the backlash, she tweeted, \u201cThe Naga are snake-like mythical creatures of Indonesian mythology, hence the name \u2018Nagini.\u2019 They are sometimes depicted as winged, sometimes as half-human, half-snake. Indonesia comprises a few hundred ethnic groups, including Javanese, Chinese and Betawi.\u201d\n\nThe Naga are snake-like mythical creatures of Indonesian mythology, hence the name \u2018Nagini.\u2019 They are sometimes depicted as winged, sometimes as half-human, half-snake.

Rowling (@jk_rowling) September 26, 2018\n\nKim didn\u2019t address the negative responses during the panel. But in an interview in Seoul, South Korea, last month, she described the criticism from fans as \u201cunexpected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I found out that I\u2019m playing Nagini, I thought it was meaningful because it\u2019s an important character in the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 series,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Harry Potter\u2019 is a franchise film with many Caucasian actors, so I thought many Korean viewers would be happy.\u201d\n\nShe added that she is \u201clooking forward to viewers being satisfied and the controversy fading away once the film premieres.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the controversy surrounding Kim\u2019s casting fades, it may give way only to discussions of the various other parts of the film that fall short. Namely, the gaping holes in the Wizarding World\u2019s timeline and the cumbersome twist at the end of the movie. (We won\u2019t give it away.)\n\nThere are parts that work. It takes a while to warm up to the fact that Jude Law is young Dumbledore, but the handsome actor nailed his entry into the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise. (During the panel at Hogwarts, he said that he was on vacation with his family when he heard he landed the role and that he started carrying around a twig as wand practice.) Depp, perhaps in part due to the controversy surrounding his own casting, is easy to despise as Grindelwald.\n\nMost notably, Kim does a solid job as a fellow newcomer to the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d world. Despite the meager amount of dialogue for her, she dazzles as a woman struggling to contain her inner beast. Her transformation from human into reptile is truly a wonder to watch on screen, thanks in part to the visual effects team and her work with a contortionist.\n\nKim told audiences in Los Angeles that the more she learned about Nagini\u2019s backstory, the more she sympathized with the character, adding, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that Nagini is absolutely terrifying.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d franchise might not yet have realized the same complexities that Kim has, but it has at least three more movies to figure it out."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Willa Frej", "title": "Trump Picks Retired General To Fill Vacancy As Ambassador To Saudi Arabia", "description": "If confirmed, Gen.

Pregnant and living in her vehicle with her four kids in the fall of 2013, Rebecca Fritz began a desperate, strategic search for a place to crash before winter hit.\n\nFritz, who had previously been living in a suburban domestic violence shelter, had called around to shelters, but they always seemed to be full. So she drove around looking for vacant, unsecured houses that hadn\u2019t yet been ransacked by scrappers. Then she\u2019d sneak in at night to inspect. Next came a look at property details on Zillow, using the Wi-Fi at McDonald\u2019s, and finally a county records check for delinquent taxes \u2015 meaning, Fritz determined, that the owner had likely given up on the property and her family would be less at risk of being discovered.\n\nFritz considered about a dozen houses before choosing a modest 1920s five-bedroom house on the city\u2019s west side. She changed the locks, blacked out the windows and quietly moved in. The most attractive feature of the home, which had no heat, was the fireplace \u2015 those first few months, Fritz and her kids spent nights curled up in blankets in front of the fire they fed with wood hauled from nearby alleys. When it was really cold, they\u2019d go to her dad\u2019s, a longtime squatter in an abandoned house heated by a wood-burning stove.\n\nFritz rigged a makeshift shower using a kiddie pool and found an oversized sink in the garbage that she could use for cooking and washing clothes. She installed a circuit box and ran wiring to the first floor so they could run electric heaters, learning as she went.\n\nEven without having to pay rent, Fritz has struggled to afford necessities. She takes housecleaning gigs, but can\u2019t reliably get to the suburbs, where jobs are more plentiful, without a car. She also juggles work with taking care of her kids and rehabbing the house.\n\nHer difficulty finding stable employment and housing led her to activism. She\u2019s protested the city\u2019s foreclosure epidemic and water department\u2019s shut-off policy for low-income residents \u2015 which brought United Nations scrutiny \u2015 through grassroots groups like Detroit Eviction Defense.\n\n\u201cAt eight months pregnant, I was scrubbing floors. A few of my friends, once they realized I was serious about what I was doing, they helped me get a dumpster to get the garbage out,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cI knew as an activist that sometimes when we push from the bottom, especially in emergency situations, things like this can be possible.\u201d\n\nSquatting To Survive\n\nTraditionally ignored by the city and often tolerated by neighbors, squatters occupy more than 3,000 homes in Detroit, according to the Detroit Land Bank Authority, a public agency that manages the city\u2019s abandoned properties. Squatters frequently go without running water or heat in neighborhoods that have seen little of the investment animating the city\u2019s downtown core.\n\nDetroit has a tangle of different conditions that make squatting a possibility, said sociologist Claire Herbert: The city has more than 43,000 vacant homes, according to research group Data Driven Detroit, and 1 in 3 families is living in poverty \u2015 plus there\u2019s a lack of city resources for both property regulation and housing assistance.\n\nAn assistant professor at Drexel University, Herbert lived in Detroit for five years researching illegal property use. She recently published two papers on squatting. She focused on survival squatters (people who take refuge in abandoned homes for emergency shelter) and holdover squatters (renters or former owners who stay after foreclosure). In Detroit, squatting is one form of precarious housing on a spectrum that includes street sleeping or doubling up in an apartment, said Herbert.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Fritz and her 4-year-old daughter, Honesty, remove Halloween decorations from their front porch and lawn on Nov. 12.\n\n\u201cThere are some squatters who in a sense \u2018choose\u2019 squatting because it allows them to buy their kids food,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cA lot of them have jobs, but they\u2019re still so poor they can\u2019t afford rent and to live.\u201d\n\nShelter facilities haven\u2019t kept up with the changing demographics of the homeless population, said Tasha Gray, executive director of the Housing Action Network of Detroit, which coordinates the different shelter agencies in the city. They tend to have openings for single men but not enough beds for women and families.\n\n\u201cI know that we\u2019re turning people away,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMaybe [squatting] is not the greatest resource but it\u2019s better for them than nothing at all \u2026 but because [squatters] are not always coming into the system, it\u2019s hard for us to make a case about the need for additional resources.\u201d\n\nKeeping Blight At Bay\n\nThe city has lost two-thirds of its population since its 1950s peak, and despite a frantic rate of demolitions in recent years, the housing stock hasn\u2019t declined at similar rates.\n\nSo when one house on a block goes vacant, blight can spread to neighboring structures like a cancer. Residents sometimes try to contain vacancies on their blocks by adopting empty houses, urban planning professor Kimberley Kinder details in her book DIY Detroit: Making Do in a City Without Services. This can be anything from hanging holiday decorations, moving the trash cans weekly or painting fake interior scenes on windows they boarded up themselves.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Mark Covington catches a chicken at the Georgia Street Community Collective on Nov. 12. In 2008, Covington started tending three vacant lots, turning them into a community garden to prevent illegal dumping.\n\nSome residents go a step further and use vacant property to create a community resource. Back in 2008, Mark Covington was tending to three vacant lots on his block when he decided to plant a community garden to stop people from illegally dumping their trash. Kids started showing up to help out, and 10 years later three lots have turned into 23, with hundreds participating in different programs at Covington\u2019s nonprofit, Georgia Street Community Collective. The community garden has turned into a full-fledged urban farm, with a few dozen kinds of vegetables, fruit trees, goats, chickens and a bee colony.\n\nSquatting can be another way to breathe life into abandoned homes. Of course, squatters are not always welcome. In some neighborhoods, legal residents are trying to keep them out. They have expressed anger at squatters trashing houses and selling drugs or bringing other criminal activity to their doorstep, including violence. But according to Herbert, those cases don\u2019t match many squatter-neighbor relationships.\n\nI wanted people to know I\u2019m not just a squatter. I\u2019m trying to make this a home. Rebecca Fritz\n\nThe city\u2019s vacancy and rampant speculation invert the normal assumption that ownership is the pinnacle of neighborhood care. In the absence of city enforcement, Detroiters use their own gauge to informally regulate illegal property use \u2015 what Herbert calls an \u201cethos of care\u201d \u2015 so if squatters contribute to the community, neighbors are more likely to welcome them.\n\nSome officials Herbert interviewed for her research encouraged responsible squatting. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have squatters, might as well be good ones,\u201d one police officer told her. Another cop confronted squatters on his block; instead of telling them to leave, he made them mow their lawn.\n\nWhen Fritz moved into a mostly occupied block where neighbors keep an eye on each other, she first focused on making the interior livable. But as soon as the cold weather broke, she started planting flowers and trimming bushes.\n\n\u201cI wanted people to know I\u2019m not just a squatter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make this a home.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, Fritz said, her presence on the corner makes it safer for the kids who walk to school through her alley.\n\nFrom Squatter To Homeowner\n\nFrom age 17 to 34, Fritz was homeless more than a dozen times, crashing in the woods, a storage facility and an apartment building basement.\n\n\u201cMy kids up to that point hadn\u2019t had any stability. This is the only home that Honesty\u2019s ever known,\u201d Fritz said of her 4-year-old daughter.\n\nBut squatting is still fraught with insecurity. Children\u2019s Protective Services caseworkers kept showing up. The owner tried to evict her. Eventually, the house was tax-foreclosed in 2015 and it became the property of the Detroit Land Bank Authority, leaving Fritz holding her breath again.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Honesty watches an episode of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" on Fritz's phone. In August, Fritz finally received the deed to the house she was squatting in with her family due to a Detroit Land Bank Authority program called BuyBack.\n\nThrough her activism connections, Fritz got wind of the Land Bank\u2019s experiment to sell homes to squatters. The BuyBack program started with a pilot in 2015, aimed at squatters who had previously been legal tenants or owners of their homes, had family connections to property, or had been paying utilities or fixing their homes. After paying $1,000 upfront, participants attend homeowner education workshops and must pay property taxes for a year.\n\nFritz had the receipts and pictures to prove she\u2019d been rehabbing her house. She scraped together about $400 and crowdfunded the rest to enter the program in March 2017. This August, nearly five years after she moved in, she got the deed to her home.\n\nA Hollowed-Out City\n\nOfficials have slowly begun to implement systemic changes to stem rampant foreclosure, as increasing evidence emerges to back up what activists have been saying all along: Under state law, many foreclosed owners should have had lower taxes or could have been exempted from paying them altogether.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost At left, a house owned by the Detroit Land Bank Authority and, at right, a vacant house owned by Covington and the Georgia Street Community Collective. The Land Bank required Covington to board up the house or possibly lose ownership, though the Land Bank has yet to board up this and other houses on the same block.\n\nStarting in 2014, the city began transferring vacant tax-foreclosed properties to the Land Bank in bulk to better manage abandoned buildings. Now the agency controls more than 60,000 vacant lots and 30,000 homes, according to Dispositions Director Reginald Scott II. It also unwittingly became a major landlord with a hands-off approach that\u2019s angered some neighbors who live by Land Bank squatters and decaying homes. Others complain that the Land Bank is holding onto properties and only offers a small fraction to buyers.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the resources to secure every one of our properties. It would just be virtually impossible,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe are the true owner of last resort.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Street gardener Mark Covington said the sales process has improved from the days when he\u2019d try to buy vacant lots and get shuttled from one clueless city office to another. Last year, GSCC was finally able to buy from the Land Bank six of the lots the group had worked for nine years, and it is authorized to buy another nine once it\u2019s raised the necessary funds.\n\nCovington said it was a relief to start taking ownership, easing fears that a developer might swoop in to capitalize on or destroy what he and his neighbors have built. \u201cI think it\u2019s more important that individuals and small, grassroots organizations do [community development] because they\u2019re on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir hands are in the dirt. They know what\u2019s happening in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nA Precarious Future\n\nScott works to shrink the Land Bank\u2019s inventory with a variety of programs, including BuyBack. It has identified 800 occupants so far who qualified to start the squat-to-own program, and 360 individuals have signed deeds. Only four dropped out before finishing.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Houses owned by the Detroit Land Bank remain not boarded up along the same street as Covington and the Georgia Street Community Collective.\n\nThe Land Bank has identified about another 1,400 squatters who don\u2019t meet the program qualifications. It\u2019s unclear what will happen to squatters who stay. Scott stressed the agency\u2019s \u201cpeople-first approach\u201d and said it is also working with nonprofits to rehab and rent properties to current occupants. That initiative has struggled, with an early partner evicting squatters improperly and selling some of the homes purchased from the Land Bank at a profit.\n\nThe program\u2019s strategy for addressing housing insecurity is progressive in some ways, Herbert said, though she questioned whether it could be a true long-term solution without efforts to address broader economic issues for low-income families, for whom homeownership can be a major financial burden. She suggested the program would ideally require less money upfront and give occupants longer to become financially independent, while offering assistance with repairs and employment search \u2015 similar to the \u201chousing first\u201d model. In Fritz\u2019s case, ownership is not a panacea, and her water was shut off recently after she was unable to pay her bill.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t see squatting going away in the near future but is concerned that as revitalization continues and the housing market strengthens, the city may crack down on squatters without providing alternatives \u2015 like the water department changing its policy to require a deed or lease agreement to get water turned on.\n\nSean Proctor for HuffPost Fritz builds a fire using wood collected from the alley to heat her house.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something really messed up happening in the city right now ... which is the increasing criminalization of squatting and demonizing those who do,\u201d said Michele Oberholtzer, who helps tenants buy those diverted auction homes through her work with the United Community Housing Coalition.\n\n\u201cWe have homes without people and people without homes. It does not make sense, and we have to find a way to put the two together,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.\n\nHuffPost\u2019s \u201cThis New World\u201d series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

For every well-wisher who knocks it out of the park with a warm, big-hearted spiel about the couple, there\u2019s a groomsman or old friend who goes hard on the open bar, overshares, and as a result, never gets to see the couple again.\n\nNeed proof of how bad wedding speeches can get? We recently asked comedians to share the weirdest, most half-assed wedding speeches they\u2019d ever had the displeasure of hearing. See what they had to say below.\n\nThe DUI-er\n\n\u201cAt my second wedding, my husband Mike\u2019s uncle stood up and gave a toast about how everyone rallied around him after his first DUI, but after his second and third DUI, Mike was the only person that stayed by his side. That\u2019s how he knew Mike would make a great husband, he said. He closed out the toast by telling everyone to not drink and drive as he downed a glass of champagne.\u201d \u2015 Mara Marek\n\nThe Not-So-Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\n\u201cI was at a wedding in upstate New York where the maid of honor was trying to be a comic after watching \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u2019 We were all really excited about her speech because we wanted to see her standup. The first line of her speech \u2015 \u2018I want to congratulate my best friend for marrying a guy with abs\u2019 \u2015 was met with polite laughs, which she followed with, \u2018And what\u2019s better than a guy with abs? Not having herpes.\u2019 Despite the silence and horrified faces, she continued the surprise roast with lines like, \u2018Can\u2019t wait till we\u2019re all together again for granny\u2019s funeral,\u2019 and \u2018Most marriages end in divorce but yours is special. It will end in homicide. Not sure who will kill who, but it will definitely be in self-defense.\u2019 Although she was probably only talking for about two minutes before the DJ played her off with the \u2018Austin Powers\u2019 theme, it felt like an eternity. After the speeches, the mother of the bride spent a good hour berating her near the bathrooms. Hopefully, they\u2019ll cover how to read a room in Season Two of \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u2019\u201d \u2015 Elise Golgowski\n\nThe Catfished Best Man\n\n\u201cThe best man invited his \u2018online girlfriend\u2019 Nicole to the wedding, and she said maybe, if he\u2019d pay to fly her there. She was pretty obviously catfishing him. Day of the wedding, Nicole is a no-show, no-call, and he has to change his speech in the hallway to take out all the references to his girlfriend (focus on the bride and groom next time, guy). The speech went pretty well until he just blurts out, \u2018Nicole stole my money, didn\u2019t she?\u2019\u201d \u2015 Allison Mick\n\nThe Racial Unifier\n\n\u201cAfter a number of heartfelt speeches from our closest friends at our wedding, my televangelist father-in-law got up to give one. My husband and I aren\u2019t religious, our friends are comprised of comedians, performers and activists of color. We even made it a point to not make the ceremony traditional in a religious sense; our queer friend performed the ceremony for us. Needless to say, my Southern, white father-in-law who preaches at a megachurch might\u2019ve felt like the odd man out. He walked up to the stage where my husband and I were sitting, grabbed the microphone from the stand and began to preach about bridging the gap between different types of people. Why? Nobody else pointed differences out. I sat there, thinking he was recycling an old sermon, listening at the edge of my seat while wearing a traditional Chinese qipao. \u2018I see there\u2019s a large Asian contingency here,\u2019 he said out of nowhere. The crowd of 180 people gasped. Then suddenly, almost screaming, he goes, \u2018...and I LOVE THE ASIANS.\u2019 The crowd laughed uncomfortably. My husband then motioned for him to please wrap it up.\u201d \u2015 Atsuko Okatsuka\n\nGrandpa Grumps\n\n\u201cWhen my brother-in-law got married to a British barfly he only knew for a few months, we were convinced his bride-to-be was marrying him for citizenship. During the wedding toast, his granddad spoke about lifelong partnership and soulmates and moved us all to tears with his sincere well-wishes for the both of them. There was one small problem. Granddad was somewhat hard of hearing and spoke very loudly. When he sat down, he whispered in a voice the whole room could hear, \u2018That\u2019ll never last. I give it six months, tops.\u2019 The bride\u2019s face turned as white as her dress. Turns out, he was wrong. They lasted 12 months. The exact minimum number of months it took to become a U.S. citizen!\u201d \u2015 Janet Quinonez\n\nThe Groom From Hell\n\n\u201cMy Polish friend had her wedding on Valentine\u2019s Day in Hollywood, which is how most modern nightmares begin. During the *dry* reception, her delightful husband relieved his best man from giving the speech so he could deliver a 20-minute monologue referring to the bride as his \u2018starter wife.\u2019 As if that isn\u2019t cute enough, he also told me and the other 75 guests that since she is starting a new life with him, she wouldn\u2019t be seeing any of her old friends or speaking her native language anymore. Last I heard from my friend, she ran off to Poland after they had gotten divorced a few months later.\u201d \u2015 Harper-Rose Drummond\n\nThe Bocelli Bro\n\n\u201cI was at a fraternity brother\u2019s wedding. He made a weird, I don\u2019t know, bet? We\u2019ll call it a bet. He made a bet with his best man when they were kids, whoever got married first, the other would have to sing \u2018Por Ti Volare\u2019 \u2015 that popular Andrea Bocelli song \u2015 at the other guy\u2019s wedding. Kurt got married first, so Tyler had to sing. All great, except that no one knew about the bet until afterward, so as a member of the audience, this was just a dude singing a love-themed opera ballad to another dude out of nowhere.\u201d \u2015 Jake Beckman\n\nThe Wildly Off-Topic Best Man\n\n\u201cI was at some wedding, and the best man gave a speech about his friend that involved a weird, brief, drunken tangent about not trusting people from Uruguay (neither he, the bride, nor the groom are from Uruguay. I guess this guy just had his wallet stolen there?). There\u2019s really no room for ethnic commentary in wedding speeches; everyone just sort of silently made eye contact, grabbed onto their chairs, and prayed this sentence would end and he\u2019d bring it back to how much Peter and Andie love each other.\u201d \u2015 Dan Perlman\n\nThe Pogo Sister\n\n\u201cThe groom had previously dated the sister of the bride. At their wedding, the sister was the maid of honor. During her speech, she joked about how she was such a good sister for vetting him first, both physically and mentally, before letting him marry her sister. It was taking pogo sisters to a whole new level!\u201d - Date/able podcast host Yue Xu\n\nThe Vaguely Racist Dad\n\n\u201cIn 2007, I went to an Irish wedding in my hometown of San Francisco. During the reception, the father stood up and gave a drunken toast where he said, \u2018You dated a lot of other kinds of guys, but I\u2019m glad you kept it Irish, angel.\u2019 Then he gave her a sloppy kiss on the cheek. I\u2019m black. Everyone (including my then-Irish date) at my table looked at me and said, \u2018We are soooo sorry.\u2019 I joked, \u2018Wait, you guys think I\u2019m black? I don\u2019t believe in race. So he\u2019s just a drunk asshole who just ruined his daughter\u2019s wedding party. Can somebody pass the pepper?\u2019\u201d \u2015 Kaseem Bentley\n\nThe Barcelonian By Way Of Irvine\n\n\u201cI was a bridesmaid in my friend\u2019s wedding, and one of the other bridesmaids flew in from Spain for the ceremony and apparently had gone Lindsay Lohan with a fully adopted Barcelona accent. It was like, \u2018Bitch, you grew up in Irvine; WE KNEW YOU BEFORE YOU MOVED. FOR A LONG TIME.\u2019 It was truly one of the most insane things. The balls it must take to fully commit to a full-time accent and then to unabashedly publicly speak with it at a wedding \u2015 it\u2019s so funny to me to this day. She tearfully gave a speech with a lisp! She still speaks with a lisp to this day. A blonde girl from Irvine.\u201d \u2015 Blair Socci\n\nThe Marrying Type\n\n\u201cA groom\u2019s speech I heard this past summer was funny, touching, then awkward. It ended with: \u2018So let\u2019s all raise a glass to my FIRST wife.\u2019\u201d \u2015 Christina Igaraividez\n\nThe Pious Bridesmaid\n\n\u201cI went to my extremely religious friend\u2019s wedding three days after filing for my own divorce \u2015 but I forgot to retract my plus-one. A bridesmaid asked me where my husband was. Against my better judgment, I quietly admitted to her that I had asked for a separation. It took a few seconds for me to realize that I had just copped the ultimate lady-sin to Aunt Lydia from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and she was not happy about it. Auntie Lydz later turned her entire wedding toast into a spontaneous sermon about the sanctity of marriage, directed solely at me, of course. She hoped that the bride would submit to her husband the way God commanded, unlike some women in the room. Her words were, \u2018Best wishes to the happy couple,\u2019 but her eyes, face and general vibe said to me \u2018Burn in hell, you unwashed heathen.\u2019\u201d \u2015 Vanessa Gritton\n\nThe IDGAF Uncle\n\n\u201cI went to one wedding where the bride\u2019s whole family hated the man she was marrying. When it came time for speeches, her uncle gave the toast: \u2018Sometimes you just gotta rock on and move on.\u2019 And that was it. That was the whole thing.\u201d \u2015 David Drake"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Dominique Mosbergen", "title": "Trump Becomes First President To Decline Kennedy Center Honors Invite Twice", "description": "The president and first lady Melania Trump won't be attending the gala because of \"scheduling conflicts,\" a White House spokeswoman said.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-kennedy-center-honors-2018_us_5bebdb3de4b0caeec2bf767a", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bebeeb4200000c3050292e8.jpeg?cache=gELn5JILLF&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:30:44Z", "content": "President Donald Trump will \u2014 again \u2014 be skipping the Kennedy Center Honors this year, becoming the first president in the gala\u2019s 41-year history to decline an invitation more than once.

The Kennedy Center Honors will be held on Dec. 2 in the Opera House in Washington.\n\nThis year\u2019s honorees are singer-actress Cher, composer Philip Glass, country music star Reba McEntire and jazz legend Wayne Shorter. \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and his co-collaborators will also be receiving a special award for their \u201cunprecedented work.\u201d\n\nThis is the second year in a row that President Trump and his wife will be a no-show at the gala. In 2017, the Trumps said they wouldn\u2019t attend the event to \u201callow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.\u201d Their statement followed the announcement by several honorees, including TV producer Norman Lear and legendary dancer Carmen de Lavallade, that they were boycotting or considering boycotting at least part of the ceremony because of the political climate.\n\nDe Lavallade blamed \u201cthe socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our current leadership is choosing to engage in\u201d as the reason behind her boycott. Lear skewered the Trump administration for threatening to get rid of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nSeveral of this year\u2019s nominees have been similarly vocal in their condemnation of the president and his policies. Glass has referred to Trump as an idiot; Cher has compared him to \u201cHitler\u201d (and has said she\u2019d be \u201cthrilled\u201d if Trump does not attend the gala); and Miranda excoriated the president\u2019s response to Puerto Rico\u2019s post-Hurricane Maria devastation, telling him \u201cyou\u2019re going straight to hell.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post noted, the sitting president has attended the Honors every year since 1978 with just a handful of exceptions. Jimmy Carter did not attend in 1979 because of the ongoing Iran hostage crisis. In 1989 and 1994, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, respectively, were not present because of overseas trips. And in 2015, Barack Obama arrived late to the event after delivering a primetime address to the nation from the Oval Office.\n\nIn all those cases, the first ladies served as hosts, the Post reported.\n\nSome Twitter users reacted to the Trumps\u2019 decision to skip this year\u2019s Honors with disappointment and disdain.\n\nNot surprising obviously.

Antifa activists photographed him at the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. He has posed for pictures in front of Nazi symbols and holding Nazi memorabilia.\n\nOn Gab, the favored social network of racists and anti-Semites, Clark had the username @PureWhiteEvil and called himself \u201cDC Bowl Gang,\u201d a reference to Dylann Roof, the bowl-cut racist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\nHuffPost Jeffrey Clark and his Gab gang made a hero of church killer Dylann Roof.\n\nMany alt-right white supremacists worship Roof, and Clark used an image of the killer and balaclava-clad gunmen as the header for his Gab page. His pinned image was an altered still from the video game \u201cDoom\u201d that depicted Roof executing black people in a church.\n\nHuffPost\n\nThis April, Clark threatened a HuffPost reporter, warning that the reporter would be going \u201cfeet first into a woodchipper.\u201d The reporter told police about the threat in August. They did nothing at the time. In late October, D.C. police did come to Clark\u2019s house in the Bloomingdale neighborhood after the death by suicide of his brother, Edward, but did not arrest him.\n\nOn Oct. 26, Clark defended Cesar Sayoc, the Florida Trump supporter accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats. \u201cNah he was BASED! Get used to it libtards. This was just a dry run for things to come,\u201d Clark wrote on Gab in response to another user critical of Sayoc. Clark\u2019s Gab profile is no longer online, but HuffPost viewed archives of the posts, which were collected by data scientist Jason Baumgartner.\n\nThe FBI incorrectly suggested in its affidavit that Clark\u2019s \u201cdry run\u201d post referred to Robert Bowers, the man charged with murdering 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27. NBC first reported the discrepancy. The FBI declined to comment.\n\nAfter the Pittsburgh shooting, Clark told family members he thought he had been \u201cfriended\u201d on Gab by Bowers. Clark wrote on Gab that \u201cthe fucking kikes that got shot by the hero #RobertBowers were all active supporters of pedophilia \u2026 and every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,\u201d according to court documents. Pedophilia-centric conspiracy theories are popular among members of the far-right; in 2016, a North Carolina man armed with a rifle drove to a Washington, D.C., pizza place he falsely believed was the center of a vast pedophilia ring. No one was injured in the shooting.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until November, after Clark\u2019s own family contacted law enforcement, that the FBI finally found the allegedly illegal weapons that have him facing gun charges. Court documents, as well as photos and videos obtained by HuffPost, suggest Clark\u2019s late brother, Edward Clark, shared a similar ideology. That both men were able to spew neo-Nazi rhetoric, amass an arsenal of weapons, and openly threaten journalists and critics for months without consequence shows just how much freedom far-right extremists have to operate in the U.S. \u2014 and how far their behavior has to escalate before law enforcement takes it seriously.\n\nWhite Supremacy, At Home In DC\n\nClark lived in a rowhouse in Bloomingdale with his father, sister and younger brother Edward William \u201cTeddy\u201d Clark, who killed himself on Washington\u2019s Theodore Roosevelt Island on Oct. 27, the day of the Tree of Life shooting.\n\nNo one answered the door Tuesday night at the Bloomingdale home, which was completely dark except for a television flickering in an upstairs room.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for these boys to step out of line,\u201d one neighbor, who asked for anonymity out of concern for their safety, told HuffPost. That neighbor, who was aware of Clark\u2019s neo-Nazi leanings and monitored his Twitter account, said that the Clarks, until a few years ago, were one of the only white families on the block, which is in a historically black neighborhood near Howard University that has gotten dramatically whiter and richer in recent years.\n\nI was waiting for these boys to step out of line. A neighbor of Jeffrey and Edward Clark\n\nThe neighbor said that last year several similarly dressed white men gathered at the Clark home around the time of an alt-right free speech rally in the city. The neighbor heard the group chanting what sounded like \u201cSieg Heil.\u201d When white supremacy flyers appeared in the neighborhood and a gay pride flag was torn down from the window of the nearby bar Showtime, the neighbor suspected the Clark boys were involved.\n\nLaura Sennett Jeffrey Clark, far left next to his brother Edward.\n\nFinding Their Place In The Far-Right\n\nThe Clark brothers appear to have been trying to find their footing in the far-right political scene over the past several years, showing up at \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d rallies outside the White House or at events with Spencer. One of them tried to join Identity Evropa, a prominent white nationalist organization, but was rejected, according to a source in the organization.\n\nIn May 2017, the Clark brothers teamed up with far-right \u201cPizzagate\u201d propagandist Jack Posobiec, who was then the D.C. bureau chief for the far-right website Rebel Media, to shoot footage for a film Posobiec was working on about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer whose murder near the Clarks\u2019 home in Bloomingdale has spawned numerous far-right conspiracy theories.\n\nLaura Sennett, an anti-fascist researcher who works with One People\u2019s Project, spoke with Jeffrey Clark a few weeks after he and his brother were spotted in Bloomingdale with Posobiec, who by then had been fired from Rebel under mysterious circumstances after plagiarizing Jason Kessler, the white nationalist who organized the Unite the Right rally.\n\n\u201c[Clark] told me that Jack Posobiec hired him and his brother to follow him with a camera to take video of his investigation of Seth Rich,\u201d Sennett told HuffPost. \u201cNot sure if it was a documentary or a news story, but [Posobiec] was doing some kind of reporting for Rebel Media. I asked him if Posobiec was aware of his Nazi beliefs. He told me that Posobiec absolutely was and had told Jeff that he was sympathetic to those beliefs.\u201d\n\nPhoto taken by a source who spotted Jack Posobiec Conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec being followed by the Clark brothers as they videotape him.\n\nPosobiec, now a host for the conservative One America News Network, denies this. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a Jeffrey Clark,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never hired anyone for Rebel Media, certainly not hired this person, and I never made a Seth Rich documentary for Rebel Media.\u201d\n\nBut there was Posobiec last year, traipsing around Bloomingdale with the Clarks:\n\nPHOTO TAKEN BY A SOURCE WHO SPOTTED JACK POSOBIEC\n\nKnocking on doors, a microphone in his hand:\n\nPHOTO TAKEN BY A SOURCE WHO SPOTTED JACK POSOBIEC\n\nJeffrey Clark also found a common cause with violent white supremacists on Gab, where he posted neo-Nazi propaganda and promoted prominent white nationalist voices such as Patrick Little, Brad Griffin, Jared Wyand and \u201cJack Corbin\u201d \u2015 all of whom Tree of Life shooter Robert Bowers also engaged with on the social media platform. He amplified older white nationalists such as Billy Roper and Peter Brimelow, and expressed his support for white nationalist Republican House candidate Paul Nehlen.\n\nClark\u2019s Gab profile picture was a photo of him and his brother wearing masks and holding guns in front of a flag with a skull and crossbones, according to court documents. The skull has a bowl haircut, another reference to Roof. Edward Clark went by \u201cDC_Stormer\u201d on Gab, according to the FBI. A Twitter account with the same user name is currently suspended. Previously, that account, which antifa activists believed to be linked to one or both of the Clark brothers, posted thinly veiled threats aimed at local antifa activists.\n\nSeveral of the internet service providers who worked with Gab abandoned the social media platform after the Pittsburgh shooting brought public attention to how easy it is for leading extremists to connect with individuals on Gab who might carry out white nationalism\u2019s violent ideology.\n\nHuffPost\n\nRegarding death threats, here's a note from right-wing Jeffery Raph Clark, @dc_stormer, who lives in DC area and has come to #antifa events. pic.twitter.com/bTRTQRH2By \u2014 Lacy MacAuley (@lacymacauley) July 4, 2017\n\nHow It All Came Crashing Down\n\nThe Clarks\u2019 history of extremism ended in the death of one brother and the arrest of another over the past two weeks. Edward Clark killed himself with a Beretta pistol on Oct. 27 sometime before 12:45 p.m., according to court documents. Responding officers found eight remaining rounds in the magazine of his pistol, as well as two additional magazines of ammunition with 20 more rounds. Family members told FBI agents they were surprised by Edward\u2019s suicide and did not know why he had so many bullets on him.\n\nCourt documents imply that Jeffrey knew his brother was up to something unusual on the day of his death. Jeffrey woke up around noon that day. When he realized Edward wasn\u2019t home, he called his mother and said he was going to report Edward missing to the police, even though Edward was 23 and hadn\u2019t been gone for long.\n\nJeffrey is the registered owner of a Remington Arms 1911 R1 handgun and a Mossberg Maverick 88 shotgun. His brother was the registered owner of a Ruger Mini 14 Ranch Rifle and a Beretta 92FS handgun, the gun he used to kill himself. Officers later recovered a Colt .38 Jeffrey gave to a family member that was not registered to either Clark brother. D.C. law requires registration of all firearms with local police.\n\nA D.C. homicide detective went to the Clarks\u2019 home after Edward\u2019s death. Jeffrey told him that Edward\u2019s rifle was still at the house, but the detective did not ask Jeffrey about his guns, according to court documents.\n\nTwo family members called the FBI on Nov. 2 to express concerns about Jeffrey, whom they said had become more outspoken about his white nationalist views after his brother\u2019s death. Jeffrey and Edward \u201chad both fantasized about killing \u2018Jews and blacks,\u2019\u201d and admired mass murderers Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski and Charles Manson, according to court documents. Family members told the FBI that Jeffrey was \u201creally riled up\u201d and \u201cagitated,\u201d and they feared he would hurt himself or others. The brothers believed there would be a race revolution, and they wanted to expedite it.\n\nFamily members showed FBI agents four boxes of gun parts they took from Jeffrey, including parts used to modify AR-15 assault rifles. Agents also found four high-capacity AR-15 magazines that can hold up to 30 rounds of ammunition. Possession of such magazines is prohibited under D.C. law.\n\nJeffrey and Edward\u2019s relatives confirmed they both attended the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. They believed there were photos of the brothers online standing next to James Alex Fields, the white supremacist who drove a car into protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others. They showed FBI agents a picture of the brothers holding a flag for the white supremacist group Vanguard America \u2015 the same group on the flyers posted around Bloomingdale.\n\nThe brothers marched into the Charlottesville rally behind that flag, which was carried by William Fears, a white supremacist arrested for attempted homicide after a Spencer speech in Gainesville, Florida, last year. Prosecutors ultimately dropped that case against Fears, who was arrested again this April for allegedly hitting and choking his girlfriend.\n\nLuke Osman\n\nFBI agents spoke with one of the Clarks\u2019 relatives again on Nov. 8. The relative told them that Jeffrey smoked and sold marijuana.

She\u2019s wooing freshman Democrats, showing up to orientation sessions, hosting dinner receptions and making friends.\n\nBut there\u2019s confidence from Pelosi\u2019s detractors that she doesn\u2019t have the votes.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) told reporters Tuesday night that he was \u201c100 percent\u201d confident there were enough votes to block Pelosi \u2015 more than 20 \u2015 during a speaker floor vote. He said the anti-Pelosi members planned to release a letter demonstrating to Pelosi that she doesn\u2019t have the votes, at which point they expect other Democrats to step up and run for the speaker position.\n\nMoulton said the members, led by less than a dozen existing Representatives and some incoming Democrats who have said they won\u2019t support Pelosi, are figuring out when to release the letter \u2015 \u201cwe\u2019re going to see what makes the most sense\u201d \u2015 but they plan to do it before the caucus votes for its leaders behind closed doors at the end of November.\n\nTo be speaker, a Democrat would have to win that election among just Democrats in November, but he or she would also have to win an election among the full House on Jan. 3. If current projections hold, Democrats look like they\u2019ll have a majority of 233 to 235 members out of 435 total, meaning Pelosi could lose 15 to 17 votes and still be elected speaker.\n\nBut the math is even more complicated and forgiving to Pelosi. If she could convince some Democrats to vote present, as two Democratic sources have told HuffPost she is trying to do, she could lower the threshold to be speaker to under 218 and potentially secure the vote with less than an actual majority on the floor.\n\nMoulton, however, says no one in his group is interested in voting present. \u201cImagine a candidate, coming and taking their first vote on the floor of the House of Representatives \u2015 present?\u201d he said.\n\nMoulton said he had another member approach him a couple of hours before House votes Tuesday night about not supporting Pelosi, and yet another member came to him on the floor during votes. He thinks the numbers are quite stark for Pelosi.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s contingent sees the numbers going the other way.\n\nThey point to a letter signed by 11 Democrats asking for a proposed speaker rule change \u2015 a letter that one of the Democrats, Albio Sires (D-N.J.), is now removed from after he came out in support of Pelosi on Friday.\n\nStill, that leaves Moulton, Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), Filemon Vela Jr. (D-Texas), Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), Bill Foster (D-Ill.) and Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.).\n\nOn top of that, you have Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), who has traditionally voted against Pelosi, Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), who has consistently said he won\u2019t support her to be speaker, and a handful of incoming Democrats who have said \u2015 to varying degrees \u2015 that they also won\u2019t vote for her, including Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), Max Rose (D-N.Y.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Haley Stevens (D-Mich.).\n\nDemocrats from at least three uncalled races \u2015 Jared Golden (D-Maine), Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.) \u2015 have also said they won\u2019t support Pelosi.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Pelosi\u2019s vote problem isn\u2019t fake. But it\u2019s also difficult to see who would be speaker if it\u2019s not her.\n\nMinority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) seems eternally stuck at the No. 2 spot in Democratic leadership. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), currently the assistant minority leader, could be a natural contender, but he says he backs Pelosi, though he also told HuffPost on Tuesday night that, if he were elected speaker, he would serve.\n\nThe fresher faces of Democratic leadership \u2015 people like Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) \u2015 seem more interested in moving one rung up the ladder than they are in mounting an actual speaker bid. Jeffries, who is in a race with Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) to be conference chair, coyly told HuffPost on Tuesday night that he still has trouble seeing himself as a member of Congress let alone speaker, and Bustos is focused on her race to become the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Denny Heck (D-Wash.) are also vying to be DCCC chair.\n\nThe former DCCC chairman, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, is in a race to become the assistant majority leader with David Cicilline of Rhode Island, and Luj\u00e1n could be a contender for the speakership if Pelosi were blocked.\n\nIn short, there are plenty of potential candidates \u2015 and none at all.\n\nAsked about how the Pelosi defectors could beat somebody with nobody, Moulton seemed undeterred, saying there was plenty of talent in the Democratic Caucus.\n\nMoulton was also unafraid of a potential backlash to blocking Pelosi \u2015 the only woman to ever serve as speaker. He said he would prefer the next speaker be another woman, and he pointed to polling that, he said, shows most Democrats want new leadership.\n\nMoulton was the focus of some dismissive remarks from Pelosi earlier this year, when she told Rolling Stone that he and Ohio\u2019s Tim Ryan were both \u201cinconsequential.\u201d\n\nThe anti-Pelosi members have had trouble organizing a convincing campaign thus far. When Ryan was asked about Pelosi on Tuesday night, he barely said anything other than unhelpfully telling reporters that there was \u201ca lot of conversations.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a question about whether the Pelosi detractors will try to get another rule change vote Wednesday morning, or whether one of Pelosi\u2019s allies would potentially bring up their motion and have it voted down.\n\nBut their machinations could quickly become real if they can release a letter with 20 Democrats who vow not to support Pelosi. That would put the California Democrat in a tough position, as she would need some of those Democrats to go back on their word, or she would need Republicans to vote for her.\n\nNeither outcome seems all that likely, but most Democratic members still seem to believe Pelosi can work her way out of this.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to be light-years ahead of anyone in our caucus,\u201d Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told HuffPost."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Barden", "title": "Royal Family Shares Adorable Photos To Celebrate Prince Charles' 70th Birthday", "description": "Featuring a giggling Prince George with his sister, Princess Charlotte, and brother, Prince Louis.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/royal-family-prince-charles-birthday-photos_us_5beb6e5ae4b0caeec2bf0e53", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beb7a01240000a602583455.jpeg?cache=nurwY4qASG&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:15:58Z", "content": "Clarence House released two new portraits of Prince Charles and his family to mark the heir to the British throne\u2019s 70th birthday on Wednesday.

Aside from the billions in tax incentives most locales offered, here\u2019s a look at five of the most outrageous things governments brought to the table \u2015 often at the expense of taxpayers.\n\nFree Pets, Hotel Rooms, Aquarium Memberships And More\n\nDallas is perhaps the best instance of a city\u2019s willingness to sweeten the deal with extravagant perks, offering up taxpayer dollars to provide free things to Amazon employees.\n\nThat offer included free one-year memberships to the Dallas Zoo, Dallas Children\u2019s Aquarium, Dallas Arboretum, Texas Discovery Gardens and the Trinity River Audubon Center for any employee hired between 2019 and 2021, and waived pet adoption fees at the Dallas Animal Services adoption center for Amazon employees until 2022.\n\nOne of the pricier perks offered was an estimated $1.5 million in free rides on \u201cshuttles, pedicabs, courtesy carts, or other quick transit solutions\u201d to help HQ2 employees get around while the city improves its transit system.\n\nAdditionally, Dallas offered the company 2,000 free nights at a city-owned hotel and 100 free days of event space.\n\nRenaming Public Property For Amazon\n\nThe state of Georgia said Amazon would have the opportunity to rename streets around a future campus in Atlanta.\n\nSuggestions included Amazon Lane, Alexa Way, Prime Place and Kindle Rd.\n\n\u201cSimply put, Atlanta has a long history of Amazon love,\u201d the state said in its attempt to woo the company.\n\nIt also promised to explore the possibility of turning one of Atlanta\u2019s MARTA transit cars into a vehicle for transporting Amazon products around the metropolitan area.\n\nNotice If The Media Is Looking Into Amazon\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the helicopter landing pad that helped Virginia win over a slice of the new Amazon headquarters. As part of its offer, the state will notify the company within two days of receiving any Freedom of Information Act requests about Amazon \u201cto allow the Company to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.\u201d\n\nFOIA requests are often filed by members of the media to obtain previously unreleased information or documents controlled by the U.S. government. For example, it was through a FOIA request that The Daily Beast revealed last month that Amazon had met with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to pitch the agency on its facial recognition surveillance technology.\n\nA Say In How Taxes Would Be Spent\n\nFresno, California, offered Amazon the chance to be the \u201cultimate corporate citizen,\u201d as Fresno Mayor Lee Brand described it to KQED, by letting Amazon have joint say with the city in how the taxes the company paid would be spent.\n\nThe deal would have established a so-called Amazon Community Fund for Amazon\u2019s tax money to be managed by five people: two elected officials, one community representative and two Amazon appointees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a proposal to give a company formal control,\u201d Greg LeRoy, executive director of the economic development nonprofit Good Jobs First, told KQED. \u201cThat\u2019s really off the charts.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Blank Check\u2019 For Transit Projects\n\nWhile many bids include promises to make transit easier for HQ2 employees, Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn took things a step further in the state\u2019s bid.\n\n\u201cOur statement for HQ2 is we\u2019ll provide whatever is necessary to Amazon when they need it,\u201d he told state senators during a hearing on his department\u2019s budget. \u201cFor all practical purposes, it\u2019s a blank check.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Michael Hobbes", "title": "The Stomach-Churning Spectacle Of Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Process", "description": "Want to get paid to expand your massive company to new locations?

Chicago offered to give highly paid tech workers their state income taxes back to them. Fresno was fine with letting Amazon decide how to distribute its tax revenue. Calgary, Canada, put up banners near the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle reading, \u201cHey Amazon, we\u2019re not saying we would fight a bear for you \u2026 but we totally would.\u201d In a bizarre inversion of municipal corruption, the city of Tucson sent a 21-foot cactus to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2015 who announced he was returning it for ethical reasons.\n\nAll of these efforts were aimed at landing the big prize: $5 billion in investment and 50,000 new jobs. After the announcement that Long Island City, in the Queens borough, would host half of the new HQ2, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, \u201cNew York City is about to get tens of thousands of new, good paying jobs and Amazon is about to meet the most talented workforce in the world.\u201d Allison Silberberg, the mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, which will host the other half of HQ2 along with Arlington, said her city\u2019s bid was successful due to \u201cthe collective strengths of our communities \u2015 our workforce, education, infrastructure and our unparalleled quality of life \u2015 all of which will be strengthened by this new investment from Amazon.\u201d\n\nOthers were less enthusiastic. New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said he was excluded from the negotiations with the company and that he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the details of the subsidy agreement. New York Assemblyman Ron Kim (D) introduced legislation to block the deal and spend the funds forgiving student debt instead. Even before the bids were announced, activists in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Chicago and Atlanta demanded city lawmakers release their bids to the public or rescind them altogether.\n\nThe year-plus bidding process was a cynical ploy at worst and a huge waste of time at best. After shortlisting proposals from Miss Congeniality candidates Indianapolis and Raleigh, North Carolina, Amazon ultimately chose two large, established American cities that offered millions of educated workers, existing tech clusters and proximity to financial and political capital. Bezos even owns homes in both cities already.\n\n\u201cBy using this process, Amazon was able to get cities to offer up bigger and better incentives than they otherwise would have,\u201d said Greg Squires, a George Washington University researcher who studies urban development. Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide corporate affairs, made this explicit Tuesday, stating that the talent pool \u2015 i.e., not the tax incentives \u2015 was the primary reason Amazon chose Arlington and Long Island City.\n\nBut the implications of Amazon\u2019s announcement go far beyond one company or two cities. The ugliness of the last 14 months highlights a growing challenge for cities and politicians who run them. According to a March 2018 report by the Brookings Institution, state and local governments dole out up to $90 billion worth of subsidies to individual businesses each year. As cities compete to give away more tax revenue and larger incentives to companies, they may lose track of the line between investing in their communities and exploiting them.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Amazon's new location outside Washington, D.C.\n\nWhy Do Cities Offer Tax Breaks Anyway?\n\nThe entire HQ2 process took place under a series of assumptions with little support in academic research.\n\n\u201cThis whole notion of providing financial incentives to businesses has been a losing proposition for most communities that have ever engaged in it,\u201d Squires said. Cities generally end up giving tax breaks to corporations that were going to relocate there anyway. Companies often don\u2019t hire local workers and, if they do, it\u2019s rarely the populations that need jobs the most.\n\nThe reason financial incentives are a losing proposition for economic development, Squires said, is that taxes don\u2019t make up a significant cost for companies when compared to other fundamentals, like the cost of utilities, recruitment and supply chains. \u201cIf Phoenix is the ideal place for a company to do business,\u201d Squires said, \u201cDetroit isn\u2019t going to get them with a big tax break.\u201d\n\nBut even by the standards of tax breaks, the HQ2 process was more crude and ad hoc than usual.\n\n\u201cEverything we know about incentives was just tossed out the window,\u201d said Nathan Jensen, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin who specializes in state and local development. Some cities were offering 30 years of exemptions on utility and income taxes. Since most companies plan only five to 10 years into the future, these incentives are worth almost nothing. \u201cIt has no effect as an enticement,\u201d Jensen said, \u201cbut it imposes a massive burden on taxpayers.\u201d\n\nNegotiators also overlooked the social and political effects of financial incentives. The sudden addition of 25,000 jobs can be a disruptive event. It means more kids in schools, more cars on the road, more tenants competing for housing and more pressure on every municipal service from parks to sewers to firefighting. Under normal circumstances, this influx of population is balanced by additional tax revenue. But when cities negotiate the revenue away, it simply shifts the costs of those services onto their residents.\n\nIn the long run, this can result in political tensions, disgruntled populations, threats of budget cuts and tensions between the company and the community \u2015 everything, in other words, that has happened in Seattle since Amazon began its aggressive expansion there in 2010. \u201cThe winner of this competition may turn out to be a big loser,\u201d Squires said.\n\nSo if financial incentives are so bad, why are politicians still offering them? Squires said corporate welfare falls into the gap between the long-term effects of tax breaks and the short-term rewards for politicians. \u201cA mayor can make an announcement or have a ribbon-cutting ceremony, but they won\u2019t be around to see what happens. Plus, if they appease a major employer, it could be easier to raise money next time they run for office.\u201d\n\nAgence-France Presse Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos already owns homes in Washington, D.C., and New York City.\n\nNot All Tax Incentives Are Created Equal\n\nBut the problem isn\u2019t just the tax breaks Long Island City and Arlington are offering Amazon. It\u2019s how those tax breaks will be applied.\n\nIn the news release announcing its decision, Amazon noted that it will receive \u201cperformance-based direct incentives\u201d of $1.525 billion in Long Island City and $573 million in Arlington in exchange for creating 50,000 high-paying jobs. The company is also receiving various other forms of state aid and has committed to funding \u201ccommunity infrastructure improvements,\u201d including donating space on its New York campus to a public school.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t clear, however, is how these commitments will be monitored and which tax incentives can be revoked if Amazon does not live up to its end of the bargain. While the state of Virginia has committed to monitoring the company\u2019s job-creation targets, documents released by New York state so far comprise only a nonbinding memorandum of understanding that appears to include no verification or audit requirements.\n\n\u201cWe need sincere third-party evaluations of what has been offered and what the company is giving back,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the minimum. If the company says it\u2019s going to invest in the community and hire locally, OK fine. Prove it.\u201d\n\nPlus, Jensen said, neither agreement seems to include an evaluation to determine whether the investments of $48,000 per job (New York) and $22,000 per job (Virginia) will bring back more in revenue than what they gave away. It\u2019s a common problem among cities: They believe the promises of companies in advance of a deal but neglect to verify that these commitments are carried out and that the community truly benefited from the arrangement afterward.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of transparency. Negotiations with Amazon were carried out without the participation of city residents or even politicians. Now that the locations have been announced, the commitments and obligations of the company and various government agencies are still unclear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate so much of this was done in secrecy,\u201d Squires said. \u201cResidents have a right to know how their tax dollars are being used.\u201d\n\nAmazon is unlikely to be the last company to stage a nationwide beauty pageant to get lower tax rates and higher subsidies. In response to this problem, the European Union has made it illegal for its member countries to offer incentives to specific companies. While some poorer regions are still allowed to offer rewards, the process is done within clear limits and with full transparency. The United States has no similar national framework.\n\nWhat cities should be competing on, Squires said, is amenities that improve communities and invite businesses of all kinds: Improving schools, building infrastructure, keeping libraries open and collecting the garbage every week. If the tax money spent on Amazon had been invested in better subways, subsidized child care or universal early education programs, the states may have created even more jobs than the tech giant ever will.\n\n\u201cTake care of public services,\u201d Squires said, \u201cand the rest will take care of itself.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sam Levine", "title": "Researcher\u2019s Testimony Casts Doubt On Motives For Study On Citizenship Question", "description": "The researcher says he outlined the cost and harm of adding the question.

Abowd met with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross only one time to discuss his recommendation, in February, before Ross ultimately decided to add the question.\n\nAbowd testified Tuesday that he and other top Census Bureau officials were surprised to learn in June that Ross was interested in adding the question months before he even began the possibility of studying it. Ross initially said that he began considering the question only after the Justice Department requested it in December so that it could better enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAbowd\u2019s testimony came as part of an ongoing federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Abowd\u2019s analysis of the effect of the citizenship question is one of the most important pieces of evidence in the suit for the plaintiffs \u201518 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant groups \u2015 who say the decision to add the question was motivated by discriminatory intent and ignored clear evidence that adding the question would decrease the number of people who respond to the census. An inaccurate census would have far-reaching consequences, since the survey is used to draw electoral districts and allocate hundreds of billions of dollars of federal funds.\n\nAbowd was repeatedly questioned Tuesday about a January memo he wrote to Ross in which he advised against adding the citizenship question. In the memo, Abowd said it would be very costly and harm the quality of the census count. He also said any citizenship data collected in a census would be substantially less accurate than information that\u2019s available from administrative sources. He recommended that the Census Bureau get citizenship data from existing government records.\n\nDale Ho, the director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project, pressed Abowd about a separate Census Bureau estimate showing that the non-response rate to a census survey with a citizenship question on it increased more among households with at least one non-citizen in it than it did among households of all U.S. citizens. Abowd testified that the Census Bureau was estimating the effect of the citizenship question based on the best information it had and could have better studied the question if it had more notice of the request to add the question because it could have done a randomized control trial.\n\nHo\u2019s questions to Abowd were meant to undercut Ross\u2019s March memo justifying the decision to add the citizenship question. In the memo, Ross said he set out to take a \u201chard look\u201d at the possibility of adding a citizenship question and that there was little empirical evidence that adding the question would lead to a decline in response rates.\n\nA Commerce Department spokesman said in a statement Tuesday evening that Ross considered Abowd\u2019s input along with that of other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cUnder authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce, Ross determined that the addition of the question, combined with administrative records, would provide the best results to fulfill DOJ\u2019s request. While his decision was ultimately different from Dr. Abowd\u2019s recommendation, the Secretary reached his decision, in part, due to the Census Bureau\u2019s assurances that any drop in self-response rates can and will be remediated by non-response follow operations,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAbowd\u2019s testimony suggested that, based on the Census Bureau\u2019s review of the existing data, adding a citizenship question would decrease the response rate.\n\nEven though Abowd and his team had developed an analysis of the downside of a citizenship question, Department of Justice officials did not want to meet with them to discuss alternatives. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions blocked Justice Department officials from discussing alternatives, a top official in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division said in a deposition.\n\nAbowd said it was unusual for an agency not to meet with the Census Bureau to follow up on a request for data.\n\nAbowd\u2019s testimony is expected to continue Wednesday, when he is expected to face questioning from Justice Department attorneys."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Lohr", "title": "FBI Profiles Behavior Of Person Who Abducted Missing Teen Hania Aguilar", "description": "Authorities in North Carolina want to be notified if a friend or relative has been acting differently.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-hania-aguilar-suspect-behavior_us_5beb6148e4b0caeec2bf0949", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be9c1b02600000503847a59.jpeg?cache=UWL7I9Um4q&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:55:56Z", "content": "Investigators are appealing to the public for help in identifying the person responsible for the disappearance of 13-year-old Hania Aguilar, as the search for the missing North Carolina teen enters its second week.
