Matrix headlights, such as those from Audi, use multiple LEDs that can be turned on and off in different groups to alter the beam pattern. Other systems use a combination of projector lamps and shades that can cover parts of the beam.\n\nIn development are pixel systems that can trim the light point by point, and a laser system that uses micro-mirrors.\n\nWhichever technology is used, the goal is to shape the light, throwing it a maximum distance while keeping it out of the eyes of oncoming drivers, whether they\u2019re in a tractor-trailer or on a motorcycle. Doing so requires sophisticated software, sensors and cameras capable of quickly and accurately detecting oncoming traffic. Much of that gear is already in modern vehicles.\n\nThe initial specifications proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration differ from those that have been in use for years in Europe and elsewhere. In other markets, A.D.B. high-beam lights can put out twice the light intensity currently allowed for high beams in the United States. And the agency wants A.D.B. headlights to also put out a minimum amount of light everywhere, even in the shadow areas where an oncoming driver\u2019s eyes might be.\n\nNeither idea is a good one, Mr. Stern said. He pointed out that as long as the light didn\u2019t dazzle an oncoming driver, brightness could be safely increased to European standards. And projecting a minimum amount of light in every area could still blind a driver at certain angles.\n\n\u201cIt does not make sense to have a high-beam limit with A.D.B. lamps, as there won\u2019t be any glare,\u201d said Matthew Brumbelow, senior research engineer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

It hit 97 million members this year, up from about 90 million last year, according to an estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. A pickup in membership growth would be welcome.\n\nAmazon has some experience with sports broadcasts. It streams \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d on Prime, for which it paid $130 million for two years. But $20 billion is a big price tag. So why would Amazon pay up for a business in which it has little experience? The answer is complicated.\n\nRegional sports networks are effectively the middlemen of sports rights. They are paid by cable and satellite companies that carry the network, but the network also has to pay teams for rights to broadcast their games. The problem is that cable and satellite companies want to pay less to carry these networks, because fewer people are paying for television these days, while sports teams are looking to receive higher fees.\n\nThere are bargaining tools that some companies could employ to make owning the middlemen worthwhile. A big media company, like Fox, could bundle the regional sports network with other channels, like Fox News, to get higher rates, making up for the corresponding increase in rights fees. Local TV station owners, like Sinclair or Tegna, both of which are also interested in Fox\u2019s regional sports channels, could use a similar tactic, by bundling local news broadcasts with a regional sports network.\n\nBut Amazon doesn\u2019t have such leverage, which may not matter.\n\nOne theory is Amazon could take the games off the cable and satellite systems and make them exclusively available to Prime members. There are two problems with that idea. First, Fox has already negotiated agreements for its 22 regional sports networks with most of the major pay-TV carriers. Those contracts will have to be honored for the next three to five years. Second, even after those contracts run out, team owners may not want to limit the visibility of their games to a single online service, even \u2014 or, perhaps, especially \u2014 if it\u2019s Amazon."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "STEVEN ERLANGER", "title": "As Theresa May Looks to Brussels on Brexit Deal, Europe Makes Its Own Demands", "description": "Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s meeting with the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was intended to push the British view on withdrawal from the European Union.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/world/europe/theresa-may-brexit-brussels.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/22/world/22brexit-1-sub/22brexit-1-sub--facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:11:42Z", "content": "Spain is likely to get some sort of guarantee or side-letter, known as a declaration, clarifying the point.

They have poured into China in recent years, attracted by its stunning growth and its increasingly affluent population. In September, Tommy Hilfiger brought its #TommyNow extravaganza to Shanghai, and in December, Coach is planning its 15th anniversary pre-fall show in Shanghai\u2019s picturesque Bund area, demonstrating that the brands want to cater increasingly to local tastes.\n\nBut a corruption crackdown under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party\u2019s top leader, put a halt to conspicuous consumption, and the brands must remain wary of a yawning wealth gap that has developed in China."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ROBERT D.

Earlier this year Jennifer and Sarah Hart drove their S.U.V. off a Northern California cliff, killing themselves and at least four of the six children they had adopted, probably out of the foster system. Last year, Cesar Gonzales-Mugaburu was acquitted after spending a year in prison on a charge of endangering or sexually abusing eight of the nearly 100 boys he had fostered in his Long Island, N.Y., home. In Duchesne County, Utah, a foster mother was charged this month in the death of a 2-year-old boy in her care.\n\nStories like these buttress the widely held misperception that children are most likely to be abused by strangers and that those in foster homes are therefore uniquely vulnerable.\n\nBut if you read past the first paragraph of the New York City investigation, you come upon this startling fact: A majority of the maltreatment incidents (which include cases of both abuse and severe neglect) happened while foster kids were visiting their biological parents. Foster parents were the perpetrators in just 19 percent of maltreatment incidents last year.\n\nThat\u2019s terrible, but more disturbing is that children who have been removed from their parents\u2019 homes because of abuse or neglect are then brought back to visit or stay with those parents.

The town studied evacuation routes after a 2008 wildfire in the area. The Paradise mayor, Jody Jones, is a traffic specialist who spent years working for the state agency that manages roads. But the mayor and other law enforcement officials argued that the Camp Fire spread so quickly \u2014 at one point moving the equivalent length of a football field per second \u2014 that it overwhelmed the ability of emergency workers.\n\nAfter the 2008 wildfire, a Butte County grand jury report noted the difficulty residents had in evacuating, and advised that the authorities find ways to make it easier for residents to escape. Instead, the authorities narrowed Skyway in the center of town to improve pedestrian safety, reduce traffic and promote commerce \u2014 a decision that is sure to be scrutinized in the aftermath of the Camp Fire. Eric Reinbold, the police chief of Paradise, was skeptical that removing a lane from parts of the downtown area made the evacuation more difficult. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it would have made a difference or not,\u201d Chief Reinbold said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t evacuate that many people in minutes or hours.\u201d\n\nA recent editorial in the The Chico Enterprise-Record described the town\u2019s preoccupation with emergency evacuations in recent years. \u201cPeople prepared. Fire prevention officials planned. They drilled. They worked with homeowners. They invented fire-safe councils and Fire on the Ridge and sent fire prevention officials to schools via a program called Fire Pals. They raised money to keep fire lookouts open when the state said it wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cEventually, geography and topography proved to be the trap everyone thought it was.\u201d\n\nJohn Owens counts himself among the lucky residents of Paradise. He and his wife and their dog are now sleeping in a friend\u2019s car in the parking lot of a Burger King in Chico. Their home in a trailer park in Paradise was destroyed, as was his Ford pickup, for which he had no insurance.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re alive, man,\u201d said Mr. Owens, 57, a welder.

Happy reading, and enjoy the holiday.\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nMONUMENT: Poems New and Selected, by Natasha Trethewey. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26.) The Mississippi-born poet Natasha Trethewey has an exalted r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 she has served two terms as poet laureate, and she won a Pulitzer Prize in 2007 for her collection \u201cNative Guard\u201d \u2014 but her poems are earthy; they fly close to the ground. \u201cTrethewey pivots knowingly, in her poetry, between hard times and good ones,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes. \u201cShe drops you into a drapery factory in 1956, a New Orleans beauty academy in 1945. She writes about the first black Civil War regiments. In her work, those who are gone linger like ghosts. The delicate branches of her verse run you along a harrowing borderline of substance and illusion.\u201d \u201cMonument\u201d is \u201ca major book, and in her best poems this poet soars.\u201d\n\nMY SISTER, THE SERIAL KILLER, by Oyinkan Braithwaite. (Doubleday, $22.95.) Ayoola \u2014 lovely, dopey, incorrigibly murderous \u2014 is the chaos at the heart of this much-anticipated first novel from the Nigerian writer Oyinkan Braithwaite. It\u2019s Lagos noir \u2014 pulpy, peppery and sinister, served up in a comic deadpan courtesy of the narrator, Ayoola\u2019s horrified sister Korede, a nurse who is always on hand to discreetly dispose of a body or to help concoct an alibi. \u201cThis book is, above all, built to move, to hurtle forward \u2014 and it does so, dizzyingly,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. \u201cThere\u2019s a seditious pleasure in its momentum. At a time when there are such wholesome and dull claims on fiction \u2014 on its duty to ennoble or train us in empathy \u2014 there\u2019s a relief in encountering a novel faithful to art\u2019s first imperative: to catch and keep our attention.\u201d\n\nTHE JEWISH AMERICAN PARADOX: Embracing Choice in a Changing World, by Robert Mnookin. (PublicAffairs, $28.) Mnookin, a Harvard law professor, delivers a methodical argument that for American Judaism to survive it will need to become much more inclusive. Our reviewer, Gal Beckerman, describes it as \u201ca lucid legal brief of a book that proposes what would amount to a revolutionary (some would say heretical) revision. It no longer makes sense, Mnookin thinks, to use matrilineal descent, or any descent really, to determine who is a Jew. If you feel yourself to be a Jew, you get to be one.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "JENNIFER SZALAI", "title": "Books of The Times: How Fugitive Slaves Exposed the Idea of the \u2018United\u2019 States as a Lie", "description": "Andrew Delbanco\u2019s \u201cThe War Before the War\u201d excavates the past in ways that illuminate the present.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/books/review-war-before-war-fugitive-slaves-civil-war-andrew-delbanco.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/22/books/22bookdelbanco1/22bookdelbanco1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:47:00Z", "content": "The fugitive slave clause might have been enshrined in the Constitution, but it initially proved difficult to enforce.

In the early days of the United States, the federal government was weak; the bigger the country became, the bigger and more permeable became the boundary between North and South. Northern legislatures, for their part, passed \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d laws to make it harder for slaveholders to recover their runaways.\n\nSouthern apologists for slavery, who liked to talk about \u201chappy slaves,\u201d had to devise ever more labyrinthine theories to explain why such happy people were so determined to escape. One Louisiana physician coined the term \u201cdrapetomania,\u201d from the Greek words for \u201crunaway\u201d and \u201cmadness,\u201d to diagnose \u201ca disease of the mind\u201d that \u201cinduces the Negro to run away from service.\u201d More common was the enraged accusation that deceitful Northerners colluded with \u201cslave stealers\u201d and inveigled slaves to flee.\n\nDelbanco depicts a republic that kept facing the problem of white supremacy and kept electing to punt. Sometimes this involved outright haggling, as in the Missouri Compromise of 1820. But the subject of slavery was so incendiary that in 1836 the House of Representatives implemented a \u201cgag rule,\u201d whereby any antislavery petitions would be tabled automatically without debate.\n\nThe antebellum South was tantamount to a rich, expanding, authoritarian power \u2014 what the historian Sven Beckert has called \u201ca kind of Saudi Arabia of the early 19th century.\u201d And as much as Northerners wanted to cast slavery as a Southern sickness, the North had long benefited from the slave system too, supplying the capital and processing the raw materials extracted by slave labor into textiles and sugary treats. As Emerson wrote about such refined pleasures, \u201cNobody tasted blood in it.\u201d\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 deepened the connections as well as the divisions between North and South, as the federal government assumed responsibility for recovering runaway slaves and demanded that the Northern states cooperate. The law denied habeas corpus to captives, rendering even free black people in the North vulnerable to slave catchers. Delbanco accepts that a string of precipitating events in the ensuing decade may have hastened the Civil War \u2014 the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Dred Scott decision that denied citizenship rights to black people, John Brown\u2019s raid on Harpers Ferry \u2014 but he argues that the Fugitive Slave Act \u201claunched the final acceleration of sectional estrangement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe War Before the War\u201d makes a few pointed comparisons to our current moment, though Delbanco emphasizes that, by the truly bloody standards of antebellum lawmaking, which included the vicious beating of the abolitionist senator Charles Sumner on the Senate floor, our politics are a veritable \u201cmodel of decorum.\u201d\n\nStill, as he lucidly shows, it was in the name of avoiding conflict that the nation was brought to the brink and into the breach. As early as 1827, the editors of Freedom\u2019s Journal, one of the country\u2019s first black newspapers, warned that all the deflecting and deferring could only sustain a terrible accommodation for so long. \u201cNational sins,\u201d they wrote, \u201chave always been followed by national calamities.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Meet the Democrats Who Want Pelosi to Step Aside - New York Times", "description": "New York Times Meet the Democrats Who Want Pelosi to Step Aside New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 There is a 45-year-old Democrat from the Rust Belt who has hosted yoga sessions on the Capitol lawn, a 40-year-old Harvard-educated former Marine from Massachusetts wh\u2026", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/us/politics/democrats-oppose-pelosi.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/22/us/politics/22dc-rebels3/22dc-rebels3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:41:26Z", "content": "WASHINGTON There is a 45-year-old Democrat from the Rust Belt who has hosted yoga sessions on the Capitol lawn, a 40-year-old Harvard-educated former Marine from Massachusetts who made recruiting and supporting veterans to run for Congress a pet cause, a few \u2026 [+1474 chars]", "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There is a 45-year-old Democrat from the Rust Belt who has hosted yoga sessions on the Capitol lawn, a 40-year-old Harvard-educated former Marine from Massachusetts who made recruiting and supporting veterans to run for Congress a pet cause, a few seasoned lawmakers who rarely buck their party, and a handful of newcomers who campaigned promising change in Washington.\n\nThe 16 House Democrats who signed a letter on Monday calling for new leadership of their party are the leading edge of what threatens to escalate into a full-blown intraparty fight for control of the new majority. The letter was an unmistakable message to Representative Nancy Pelosi of California that she may not have the votes to reclaim the speakership she lost in 2011.\n\nTheir ideological leanings and political profiles are diffuse \u2014 certainly not the Democratic equivalent of the Freedom Caucus, the group of ultraconservative Republicans that often acts as a thorn in the side of G.O.P. leadership. What the group shares is a determination to shake up the top echelons of the House Democratic Caucus, whose leaders have remained unchanged for more than a decade, with Ms. Pelosi, 78, at the helm; Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, 79, as the No. 2, and Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, 78, as the third ranking.\n\nSo far, no lawmaker has been willing to come forward to challenge any of them directly, and the list of signatories to the letter is limited, representing fewer than 10 percent of House Democrats. In fact, their ranks may be shrinking as Ms. Pelosi pulls them to her one at a time.

I\u2019d constantly be messaging my friends, asking them to take down certain pictures or posts that could help my abuser find me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a concern for me anymore, but the situation forced me to think about what kinds of personal data I was sharing online from the moment I started doing it, and I\u2019m grateful for that. A lot of people don\u2019t think about their online privacy until they\u2019re dealing with a compromising situation in which their data is already out there.\n\nUnfortunately, I think experiences like mine are quite common. Lots of people learn about the risks to their online security only when they\u2019re affected by a widespread breach like Equifax, or another security threat. After college, I started learning more about cryptography and going to crypto parties, which helped me realize security could be something fun instead of something scary. Encryption is seen as this nerdy, niche subject, but I think there\u2019s something almost romantic about putting in the time and effort to keep a conversation private and safe \u2014 it shows you care.\n\nWhat about protecting conversations with sources?\n\nI approach security as a journalist in much the same way that I\u2019ve approached security as a person. The first thing I think about is limiting my exposure \u2014 what kind of data are my source and I generating? How do I minimize that footprint, or at least minimize how long my devices retain it?

This was somewhat surprising (and ironic) since nearly all of the other kids in her class have a father at home. Then again, none of the fathers had materialized at the luncheon.\n\nThe truth is, I don\u2019t know whether any of the parents, relatives and pets named on the gratitude pumpkins exist outside the minds of the children who named them.

Destruction and how to heal it run through these 11 stories.\n\nThat the thief is a stranger makes him an outlier here; most of Tan\u2019s characters are hurt by those closest to them, often intentionally.

Each story begins unsuspectingly \u2014 a clerk helps a woman in a changing room, a wife decides to go to the gym \u2014 and, from these seemingly realistic setups, the magical and the surreal unfold. In \u201cFitting Room,\u201d the customer never comes out. A day goes by, and the clerk, who stays all night, offers the woman every piece of clothing in the store, then buys her clothes from another boutique to try on. Eventually, the clerk has no option except to haul the fitting room out of the store. If the reader has trouble picturing this, there is a cartoon diagram to assist. Motoya wins over her audience by pushing the absurd to extremes.\n\nPerhaps the most resonant stories are those about marriage; Motoya (a playwright as well as an author) excels in putting husband and wife through unusual trials. At face value, the stories are fun and funny to read, but weightier questions lurk below the surface. In the title story, a husband watches a boxing match and asks his wife what she thinks of his body. The wife tries her best to boost his ego, fails, then decides to take up bodybuilding. She commits to it, lifting regularly and consuming protein powder, yet while others notice her transformation, her husband does not. Even when she poses in front of him in a micro bikini, her hair now short, her body filled out and covered in tanning oil, he asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Lingerie?\u201d Back to the gym she goes. To get at the deeper themes of strained marriages, traditional gender roles and love, Motoya subverts tropes and allows her characters to inhabit bizarre and metaphorical trajectories.\n\nImage\n\nThe collection\u2019s longest story, \u201cAn Exotic Marriage,\u201d is more of a novella, and explores physical transformation as a metaphor for the shifting of identities in a relationship. A married couple begin to look like each other, and the wife wonders how she can prevent it. She can no longer recognize the husband\u2019s face; he starts to do housework. In a brilliant analogy, she compares marriage to a snake ball: \u201cThere are two snakes, and they each start cannibalizing the other one\u2019s tail. And they eat and they eat at exactly the same speed, until they\u2019re just two heads making a ball, and then they both get eaten up and disappear. I think that\u2019s the image I have of marriage.\u201d A friend recommends placing a stone between her and her husband to cure their transfiguration.

A few weeks after her death, Erica Jong eulogized her friend in the Book Review.\n\nI could speak here of the fact that Anne Sexton is one of the writers by whom our age will be known and understood in times to come \u2014 if there are any times to come. Some people \u2014 including other poets \u2014were embarrassed by her poetry and sought to denigrate it, perhaps because it was so naked and painful that it exposed the hypocrisies they lived by (and even, at times, wrote by). But I would rather speak of Anne Sexton\u2019s bigness as a person than of her greatness as a poet. The poems are there \u2014 seven published books and two more (at least) to come. They will be understood in time \u2014 not as \u201cwomen\u2019s poetry\u201d or \u201cconfessional poetry\u201d \u2014 but as myths that expand the human consciousness. Like all such myths, they are a bit frightening. Some people would rather pretend they do not exist, or do not exist in the temple of art. But no matter: the poems go on saying themselves to us in the dark. They will not go away.\n\nBut Anne is gone. I would therefore like it recorded that she was one of the funniest, warmest and most generous people I have ever met. She had little of the egomania that becomes so tiresome in so many writers. And she was unfailingly generous to students, younger writers, would-be competitors. She knew there was no competition among poets. She knew that poetry is, in a sense, a communal effort \u2014 that it does not matter whose name is on the poem if the poem is true.\n\nI would like to say something final and telling about suicide \u2014 something as final as suicide itself \u2014 but it seems to me that Anne Sexton killed herself because it is just too painful to live in this world without numbness, and she had no numbness at all. All the little denials, all the stratagems of not feeling by which most of us endure from minute to minute were unavailable to her. Words spared her for a while. With the process of writing the poem, there is a kind of connection which sustains one. Then the poem is done and one is alone again. Other people may enjoy the poem later, but the poet can hardly relate to it. The poet is happy only while writing the poem."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Letters to the Editor", "description": "Readers respond to recent issues of the Sunday Book Review.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/books/review/letters-to-the-editor.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:00:00Z", "content": "JAMES ANDERSON ASHLAND, ORE.

When one side of the business has too much power, it can be really challenging. And those two companies tipped more toward creative than the business side of it. When the creative could always trump business decisions, it made it very difficult to do my job.\n\nSo what happened at Best & Company?\n\nSusie flat out fired me by messenger in front of my entire team when I was C.E.O. in the fall of 2006. The messenger came and said, \u201cAre you Gregg Renfrew?\u201d And I opened up this package, and it said: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.

I was washing my children with a natural foaming oatmeal body wash by a name brand, but when I went on the Environmental Working Group\u2019s database, it rated it an eight out of nine for toxicity. I thought I was using natural oatmeal body wash, and in fact I was putting toxins on my babies. I was just outraged. And I became truly obsessed with this.\n\nAt the same time, I was looking at where direct to consumer was going, and where I saw the biggest white space was in beauty. No one had pioneered meaningful change in that industry. It took me a couple of years to concept the idea, the selling model, create the products from scratch. I went in thinking that we could just use white-label products and change a few ingredients. That was certainly not the case.\n\nYou\u2019re very focused on bringing more regulation to your own industry. That\u2019s unusual.\n\nMost people still believe that the Food and Drug Administration is protecting them in terms of personal care products. And most people believe that the products on the market are safe. But the F.D.A. is not necessarily screening ingredients for safety, which is very different from the food industry. The F.D.A. can be protective of the consumer in certain industries, but in our industry, we are woefully underregulated, and they don\u2019t have the power to recall products. And this is one area where you have bipartisan support. Everyone agrees that we need to update the laws.

La intenci\u00f3n es dar un nuevo paso en una ofensiva que al final tiene como objetivo derrocar al rey Felipe VI, quien lleg\u00f3 al trono hace cuatro a\u00f1os con la promesa de renovar la instituci\u00f3n.\n\nLa votaci\u00f3n universitaria se une a las organizadas en varios distritos de Madrid la pr\u00f3xima semana y a la decisi\u00f3n de Unidos Podemos, el tercer mayor partido del pa\u00eds, de presentar mociones en favor de organizar referendos similares en un millar de ayuntamientos. Los defensores de la monarqu\u00eda, incluidos los partidos que la sostienen, ven las consultas como un ataque al coraz\u00f3n del Estado espa\u00f1ol. En realidad har\u00edan bien en aceptar el envite: la monarqu\u00eda necesita un refer\u00e9ndum para garantizar su continuidad a largo plazo y renovar su legitimidad democr\u00e1tica.\n\nLos intentos de tumbar la Corona parten de la premisa de que representa un sistema arcaico y antidemocr\u00e1tico. Solo lo primero es cierto. Las dinast\u00edas europeas son vestigios del pasado, con sus miembros reducidos a menudo al papel de celebridades, pero la monarqu\u00eda espa\u00f1ola forma parte del modelo de Estado apoyado masivamente por los espa\u00f1oles en la Constituci\u00f3n de 1978, redactada tras la muerte del dictador Francisco Franco. Los partidos favorables a mantener ese pacto constitucional sumaron cerca del 70 por ciento de los votos en las \u00faltimas elecciones generales de 2016, muy por encima de los que piden abiertamente una rep\u00fablica.\n\nEl argumento que vincula de forma inseparable realeza y autoritarismo es endeble. Tres de las cinco democracias m\u00e1s avanzadas del mundo \u2014Noruega, Suecia y Dinamarca\u2014 mantienen sus monarqu\u00edas. Muchos ciudadanos de Corea del Norte, Ir\u00e1n o Venezuela discrepar\u00edan de la idea de que una rep\u00fablica es garant\u00eda de mayor democracia, libertad o prosperidad. Y, sin embargo, incluso monarqu\u00edas parlamentarias como la espa\u00f1ola, con un rey que reina pero no gobierna, tienen su punto d\u00e9bil en lo que Pablo Iglesias, el l\u00edder de Unidos Podemos, describe como el acceso a la jefatura del Estado \u201cpor fecundaci\u00f3n\u201d. Es decir, su car\u00e1cter hereditario.\n\nNi las tradiciones mon\u00e1rquicas ni la atenci\u00f3n educativa que reciben los herederos garantizan que el cargo pase siempre a una persona con suficiente capacidad intelectual o moral. Lo contrario es m\u00e1s probable: que el trono sea ocupado, tarde o temprano, por alguien incompetente o corrupto. Pero la eliminaci\u00f3n de la Corona no es la \u00fanica v\u00eda para subsanar un d\u00e9ficit que puede ser compensado con mecanismos constitucionales que permitan destituir a un monarca inapropiado e incluso eliminar la instituci\u00f3n cuando una mayor\u00eda de la ciudadan\u00eda lo quiera. Ambas opciones son en teor\u00eda posibles en Espa\u00f1a, pero los padres de la Constituci\u00f3n se cuidaron de dise\u00f1ar un proceso lo suficientemente complejo como para que nunca fuera puesto en marcha.\n\nResulta dif\u00edcil saber qu\u00e9 apoyo tiene entre los espa\u00f1oles Felipe VI, visto por sus partidarios como una figura de estabilidad y unidad en un momento de fragmentaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y de desaf\u00edos independentistas en Catalu\u00f1a y el Pa\u00eds Vasco. El Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS), el organismo p\u00fablico encargado de medir el pulso social del pa\u00eds, dej\u00f3 de preguntar sobre la monarqu\u00eda en 2015, despu\u00e9s de que los esc\u00e1ndalos de Juan Carlos I hundieran su popularidad.\n\nNadie ha encontrado falta en su hijo Felipe VI. Quienes conocen al rey de Espa\u00f1a aseguran que, de todos sus antepasados, encuentra especial inspiraci\u00f3n en Carlos III, un monarca austero, ilustrado y reformista que convirti\u00f3 su corte en la m\u00e1s aburrida de Europa por las mejores razones. Un retrato del regidor del siglo XVIII, al que se le conoce como el \u201cmejor alcalde de Madrid\u201d, adorna su despacho y fue la imagen que le acompa\u00f1\u00f3 en el discurso m\u00e1s importante de su reinado, hasta ahora, en respuesta al desaf\u00edo del independentismo catal\u00e1n.\n\nAunque Felipe VI no ha sido implicado en ninguna irregularidad, sus primeros a\u00f1os como monarca se han visto da\u00f1ados por acusaciones a algunos familiares cercanos. I\u00f1aki Urdangarin, su cu\u00f1ado, se encuentra en la c\u00e1rcel acusado de haber utilizado sus v\u00ednculos con la familia real para lograr contratos p\u00fablicos. Mientras, los esc\u00e1ndalos que obligaron a abdicar a su padre siguen ocupando las portadas. La revelaci\u00f3n de audios en los que la examante del rey em\u00e9rito, la princesa Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, aseguraba que Juan Carlos I cobr\u00f3 comisiones ilegales en el extranjero ha sido utilizada por los republicanos para pedir una investigaci\u00f3n en el parlamento y dar un empuj\u00f3n a su campa\u00f1a de consultas populares.\n\nLejos quedan los d\u00edas en los que la monarqu\u00eda espa\u00f1ola viv\u00eda un idilio casi perfecto con la ciudadan\u00eda, la familia real ten\u00eda una imagen impoluta y el debate sobre el modelo de Estado permanec\u00eda en la marginalidad pol\u00edtica. Si la ca\u00edda de Juan Carlos I fue especialmente dura, tanto para \u00e9l como para los partidarios de la monarqu\u00eda, fue porque durante demasiado tiempo su imagen estuvo sostenida en una fantas\u00eda. La prensa ocult\u00f3 sus excesos, los pol\u00edticos miraron para el otro lado y la \u00e9lite econ\u00f3mica le agasaj\u00f3 en busca de privilegios e influencia, creando un muro de protecci\u00f3n tan cortesano como ficticio.\n\nLa tentaci\u00f3n de los defensores de la monarqu\u00eda, temerosos de que sus opositores busquen desmontar el sistema democr\u00e1tico salido de la Transici\u00f3n, es otorgar al actual rey una protecci\u00f3n similar a la que se concedi\u00f3 a su padre. Felipe VI necesita exactamente lo contrario: abrir la instituci\u00f3n a la calle, huir del hermetismo que promueve su entorno m\u00e1s conservador y reanudar el impulso reformista de sus comienzos, abrazando incluso la idea de que al final su futuro sea decidido en un refer\u00e9ndum.\n\nPara muchos historiadores Carlos III fue un adelantado a su \u00e9poca, por la forma en la que comprendi\u00f3 que la monarqu\u00eda solo ten\u00eda sentido si demostraba su utilidad a la ciudadan\u00eda. Hay all\u00ed una ense\u00f1anza para Felipe VI. Los reyes modernos, adem\u00e1s, deben estar dispuestos a medir esa legitimidad en las urnas."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Ellen Rosen", "title": "Manufacturers Remain Slow to Recognize Cybersecurity Risk", "description": "Hackers go after supply lines and customer information in manufacturing computer systems, which are often not wellprotected.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/business/manufacturers-remain-slow-to-recognize-cybersecurity-risk.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/business/21cyber4/21cyber4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:04:10Z", "content": "While comparing information seems at odds with companies that often compete, Mr. Patel, for one, stressed the importance of superior cybersecurity measures over a perceived competitive advantage.

Catholic Charities, the organization assigned to provide the children with legal representation, could not find their parents. Ms. Goldberg enlisted the help of lawyers at several major firms, and when they could not find a number of the parents, they concluded the parents had been deported. She contacted Dentons, an international firm with offices in Central America, and its employees started looking for parents there.\n\nWeeks later, the government revealed the existence of the deported parents. The judge in the suit, Dana Sabraw, ordered the government to reunite these families but asked the A.C.L.U. to lead the effort. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A.C.L.U. national Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, turned to Paul Weiss, which became the head of a committee that would work with three nonprofits to find the parents, he said.\n\n\u201cI think we did quickly realize that this was going to be an enormous task,\u201d Mr. Gelernt said.

Now the likes of feathery bronze fennel, once eaten by Roman warriors before heading into battle; dill with its whispery fronds; pink, fuzzy-hearted, flu-fighting echinacea; and wild garlic, whose white-hooded flowers call to mind novice nuns, come entwined with conventional blossoms or command entire bouquets. The effect is often nostalgic, a paean to some lost pastoral idyll, but also intensely of the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re in turbulent times,\u201d McVicar says. She sees the embrace of herbs as a yearning for connection with not simply the natural world but our analog past: \u201cWe want to remember who we are, where we\u2019re from, how to be gentle with ourselves.\u201d\n\nHerbs are botanically delineated as among those plants that bloom and then die down to the ground, with only roots to attest to their persistence. (Rosemary and sage are among the notable exceptions.) They have a kinship to wildflowers, which have proliferated in floral designs in recent years, in keeping with a turn toward foraging and unstructured, almost anarchic arrangements. But unlike wildflowers, whose allure is their existence outside of human conscription, herbs have always had a relationship with mankind, from before we even recognized ourselves as mankind: feeding, protecting and arguably improving us. Parents come to McVicar\u2019s herb farm in search of bouquets to ease their children\u2019s asthma. For Mother\u2019s Day, Terri Chandler and Katie Smyth of Worm in London tuck lavender and rosemary into bouquets and deliver them with cheesecloth and string, to give the herbs a second life as a bath soak.\n\nTo Ellie Jauncey and Anna Day of the Flower Appreciation Society in London, herbs are the equals of flowers and ought to be treated as such. Their arrangements, mostly of locally grown plants, are built to ramble, inspired by the spirit of the great British country gardens at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent and Great Dixter in East Sussex. \u201cI see no point in segregating plants of differing habit or habits,\u201d wrote Christopher Lloyd, the gardening writer and master of Great Dixter until his death in 2006. \u201cThey can all help one another.\u201d It\u2019s an ethos shared by Amanda Luu and Ivanka Matsuba of Studio Mondine in San Francisco: What grows together, goes together. They like to mix chives with roses, a pairing commonly found in gardens. The alliums\u2019 pungency repels aphids and larger threats (compounds in the leaves offer a kind of herd immunity against black spot, a fungal infection and botanical equivalent of the plague). Herbs are good for pollination, too: Bees are drawn to flowering herbs more than to flowers themselves, with the herbs\u2019 healing powers suffusing the nectar.\n\nPart of the appeal of herbs is how quotidian they are, which makes them startling out of context. Luu and Matsuba transform yarrow, with its densely packed white corymbs, or dried oregano \u2014 stems faded to a faint taupe while the tips still give off a purple pulse \u2014 into near abstractions of color and silhouette. For the New York-based florist Lewis Miller, texture is the draw: \u201cIt makes you want to touch and pinch the leaves,\u201d he says, which in turn releases their aromatic oils."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "FARAH NAYERI", "title": "Museums in France Should Return African Treasures, Report Says", "description": "Two academics, in a study commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron, recommended a process for repatriating artifacts if countries asked for them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/arts/design/france-museums-africa-savoy-sarr-report.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/24/arts/24museumreport-1/24museumreport-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:36:17Z", "content": "Mr. Sarr, an economist at Gaston Berger University in Saint-Louis, Senegal, said in an interview that he and Ms. Savoy traveled to four African countries Mali, Senegal, Benin and Cameroon to meet with government officials, museum directors and art specialists\u2026 [+1079 chars]", "fulltext": "PARIS \u2014 The sprawling Quai Branly Museum in Paris is stuffed with treasure.

But they do define a fanatic, ferocious, dangerous strain within Islam.\n\nThis strain has led to various attacks on freedom of expression, the bedrock of civilization, over the past three decades. The first one was the Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s infamous 1989 \u201cdeath fatwa\u201d calling for the execution of the author Salman Rushdie for his irreverent novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201d Then came the violent reactions to cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2005. Terrorist attacks on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo followed. And among nations like Pakistan, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, Ms. Bibi is only one of the many victims of blasphemy laws.\n\nMuslims who support such violent or oppressive responses to blasphemy are missing two important points. One is that it is them, not the blasphemers, who are defaming Islam, by presenting it as an immature tradition that has little room for civilized discourse. The second point is that their zealotry is not as religiously grounded as they think.\n\nTo see this, one must look at the Quran \u2014 the most fundamental and only undisputed source of Islam. Most notably, throughout all of its 6,236 verses, it never tells Muslims to silence blasphemy with force. It tells them only to respond with dignity."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "SARA NOVIC", "title": "Disability: A Clearer Message on Cochlear Implants", "description": "I.S.D.B. is spelled out in sign language underneath some of the conference schools at the Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind in Gooding, Idaho.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/opinion/deaf-cochlear-implants-sign-language.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/opinion/21disability02/21disability02-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:00:04Z", "content": "Children with a cochlear implant and no access to visual language may be unwittingly engaged in a race against the clock as they learn to interpret the electrical signals provided by the implant.

So I want to be clear that I don\u2019t think our \u201cfamily canon\u201d is the only canon for every American family, but I do strongly believe that every American family should be developing their own canon of books they read together and repeatedly \u2014 and moreover that we should be comparing our lists with those of our neighbors and fellow citizens, so that we might enrich one another.\n\nAs we considered a thousand-plus candidate books for our canon, we ultimately decided to segment that work by limiting ourselves to 12 categories with a maximum of five books each. Our categories include big themes like: God, Greek Roots, Shakespeare, the American Idea, Markets, American Fiction, a Humanistic Perspective on Science, etc. Our category on Tyrants and Totalitarianism, for example, includes Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism,\u201d F. A. Hayek\u2019s \u201cThe Road to Serfdom,\u201d George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d and \u201cThe Communist Manifesto,\u201d by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.\n\nWhich books do you think capture the current social and political moment in America?\n\nI\u2019ve been aching over Robert Putnam\u2019s \u201cOur Kids: The American Dream in Crisis\u201d for two years straight. It was widely praised, but still not enough. We ought to be talking constantly about the troubling data Professor Putnam has uncovered. There really are \u201ctwo different Americas,\u201d but not in the way the phrase lingers in our ears because of how John Edwards\u2019s presidential campaign in 2004 branded the 1 percent and the 99 percent. Putnam shows that the troubling resurgence of socioeconomic class in America centers primarily around the divide between the mobile educated elite (31 percent of our neighbors, according to Putnam) and the majority of America \u2014 the 69 percent of kids he says are born into a house with no college graduates. These children have collapsing family structures, decreasing socioeconomic mobility and rapidly thinning networks of kith and kin. I like J. D. Vance\u2019s \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d but Putnam\u2019s work is, I think, the big backdrop for understanding the vicious cycle of how declining economic opportunities for the non-educationally credentialed and family and neighborhood collapse are becoming mutually reinforcing for broad swaths of America.\n\nA close second: Nicholas Eberstadt\u2019s \u201cMen Without Work: America\u2019s Invisible Crisis.\u201d\n\nWhich fiction or nonfiction writers inspired you most early your career?"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ALEXANDRA KLEEMAN", "title": "Feature: Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s Polarizing Visions", "description": "The Greek director has drawn acclaim \u2014 but also intense backlash \u2014 for his primal depiction of contemporary life.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/magazine/yorgos-lanthimoss-director-favourite.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/magazine/25mag-lanthimos-slideshow-slide-B5VG/25mag-lanthimos-slideshow-slide-B5VG-facebookJumbo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:00:02Z", "content": "Moving to England on the back of the success of Dogtooth gave Lanthimos access to bigger budgets and internationally known stars like Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz but in many ways, he has shaped his English-language productions to\u2026 [+8485 chars]", "fulltext": "Moving to England on the back of the success of \u201cDogtooth\u201d gave Lanthimos access to bigger budgets and internationally known stars like Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz \u2014 but in many ways, he has shaped his English-language productions to suit the spontaneous practices he developed in Greece, rather than remodeling himself to Hollywood\u2019s specifications. He likes to shoot with natural light, inviting the contingency of unplanned weather to enter his scenes, and he rarely makes use of the expensive cinematic lighting that productions order by default. \u201cI do walk outside and see the lighting people, the equipment just sitting around,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of their time, of the film\u2019s money.\u201d He steers clear of movie makeup, preferring to let the \u201creal face\u201d of his actors show through, unadulterated, the hair unfussy and requiring little touch-up work. One consequence of these decisions is that his sets are unusually quiet and intimate, and without setting up lights or pausing to reapply makeup, he explains, they are able to get much more of the actual work done. \u201cWe can do the scene over and over again, immediately, nobody has to stand around waiting. And the actors love it.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere he creates has more in common with an experimental theater troupe than a typical multimillion-dollar movie set. Lanthimos works to bring an actor\u2019s instincts to the surface \u2014 and he shrugs off questions about a character\u2019s psychological motivation, back story and context as effortlessly as he does questions about himself. \u201cIf you want to [expletive] annoy him, ask him character back-story questions,\u201d Colin Farrell told me, laughing, of his first experience working with Lanthimos on the set of \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d where Lanthimos refused to tell him what happened in the scene before the one they were filming. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really feel the need, you know. For him a story is born and dies between the first and last page.\u201d Lanthimos is \u201ctrying to give space to mystery,\u201d Ariane Labed, his wife, told me. \u201cYorgos does not explain things, even to the actors really, and they\u2019re not used to that. But then they go through this experience, and they discover that having gaps in their characters\u2019 journeys, they actually have more room for their own imaginations, [their] own mistakes, [their] own doubts, and I think that\u2019s why actors are amazing in Yorgos\u2019s films. They\u2019re on the line.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d Lanthimos gathered the central cast together for three weeks of rehearsal, where they delivered their lines while trying to tie themselves in knots, jumping from carpet tile to carpet tile, or writhing around on the floor. \u201cHe had us do all sorts of things that keep you from thinking about what your lines mean,\u201d Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Anne, told me. \u201cIt was completely unique.\u201d These gamelike exercises were also ways of forcing an actor\u2019s reflexes to the surface, submerging that part of the mind that analyzes and questions, or turns away from the moment and toward a script or director for answers. \u201cThe best way to describe it is, it becomes completely unconscious ... completely instinctual,\u201d explains Rachel Weisz, who first worked with Lanthimos in \u201cThe Lobster\u201d and appears in \u201cThe Favourite\u201d as Sarah Churchill, the queen\u2019s confidante and lover. \u201cIf you asked me afterward what had just happened, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you. And in fact, the experience of watching the two films, the ones I\u2019ve been in, are unlike other films in that I\u2019m completely surprised by what I did. Usually when you film you have a sense of what you\u2019ve done, but with Yorgos you have no sense. If that makes sense.\u201d\n\nLike the stories themselves, which thrust characters, existentially underprepared, into disorienting situations, Lanthimos\u2019s direction forces actors to inhabit their roles with convincing immediacy, giving them an authentic vulnerability. It reflects the broader connection between his films and theater, a temporary structure assembled by bodies that are clumsily, complicatedly occupying space. In a scene from last year\u2019s \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d Lanthimos\u2019s take on a horror film, the wife (played by Nicole Kidman) feigns unconsciousness in their bedroom at her surgeon husband\u2019s request; she rolls over, limp and lifeless, her head hanging off the edge of the bed as he caresses her. As he pulls her body ungracefully toward him, her hair dragging across the comforter, her foot catches on a pillow and it falls over, a piece of reality quietly disheveling the fantasy. Auteurs like Luca Guadagnino or Paolo Sorrentino, with their swooping, reeling shots and kinetic dance sequences, may get more credit for capturing bodily experience on film, but Lanthimos arguably shows greater fidelity to our actual bodies, stubborn and awkwardly choreographed by fate, etiquette and overarching structures of power \u2014 not glamorous bodies but bodies of ungainly yearning.\n\nLanthimos\u2019s latest project seems likely to win over even his most skeptical viewers: Brimming with an exhilarating sense of struggle, \u201cThe Favourite\u201d \u2019s brash reimagining of Queen Anne\u2019s court has a raw, magnetic likability to it. As Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone expressively vied for Olivia Colman\u2019s affections, they evoked throaty, full-body laughs from the audience at the screening I attended, rather than the tight, pressurized laughter I heard while watching his earlier films. The Lanthimos aesthetic transposes seamlessly to a historical setting: the sense of remoteness, the intricate system of rules and manners, the powerful force that oppresses everyone, including the individual chosen to wield it. But if in previous films that looming force was inhuman (social, familial or supernatural), in \u201cThe Favourite\u201d that power has its origins in human tendencies \u2014 loneliness, lustfulness and our susceptibility to manipulation. Power, of the state and of the individual, circulates in a wild and destabilizing way among the three women as they plot and beguile and wield themselves like weapons. Words are used as shoves or slaps; sex becomes a literal power grab, upsetting a fragile and transient order.\n\n\u201cThe Favourite\u201d is a first for Lanthimos \u2014 as a foray into period drama, as the director of a script that he did not originate himself \u2014 and it marks a true shift in his emotional palette. Rather than keep the viewer at arm\u2019s length, this new film works to draw you into the palace intrigue. You root for Abigail, the newcomer and underdog, as she tries to secure her livelihood, and then you root for Sarah just as strongly as she struggles to maintain her position by banishing her competition from the court. But as the hierarchy churns, the effort to get on top and stay there starts feeling less like rowdy fun and more like a form of imprisonment, implicating the viewer as well in its casual cruelty: Why do we as observers choose favorites, when this partiality so clearly limits our ability to see the whole? The ending, when it arrives, is inevitable yet unexpected. It is quietly, inscrutably heartbreaking \u2014 one of the only moments in a Lanthimos film that is not funny, not at all. \u201cThey\u2019re not so helpless in this film as in my others,\u201d Lanthimos told me breezily as we left the restaurant. \u201cBut they\u2019re still trapped.\u201d\n\nHe was heading back home after our lunch, to work out issues with the version of \u201cThe Favourite\u201d that will be shown on airplanes \u2014 they wanted to censor every other thing, even blurring the naked bodies of the cherubs in the palace art. But whether he felt that he owed me more time in lieu of self-explanation, or because he was in the mood to talk, he went out of his way to walk with me to my next appointment. He led us away from the high streets and down narrower residential rows where the hedges are a thick, towering green, trimmed into forcefully geometric shapes. He pointed out the bramble taking back the edge of an ad hoc park and the local town hall where he and Ariane were married. In these quiet slivers of street, London no longer feels modern: It\u2019s a pileup of the old and the new and the very old, the ground beneath our feet named by Saxon villagers. I could tell that I was being led though a terrain that was deeply personal, emotional, meaningful, but without an explanation of what I was seeing, I had to reconstruct the links myself. It\u2019s a kind of closeness at a distance, the same feeling I experience when I watch one of his films. When I mentioned that he seemed at home here, in his element among the mixture of old and new, the council flats facing meticulously preserved historical buildings, he seemed pleased, as if I\u2019d noticed something so important to him that he didn\u2019t mind allowing a stranger a glimpse. He thought for a moment, and then he replied with a slight smile: \u201cAt home, yes. But not so at home that it\u2019s become boring.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MAX RUBIN", "title": "Letter of Recommendation: Letter of Recommendation: Plymouth Rock", "description": "It\u2019s a monument to its own fraudulence \u2014 and the irrepressible nature of truth.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-plymouth-rock.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/magazine/25mag-lor-1/25mag-lor-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:00:02Z", "content": "If you are an American over the age of 6, chances are you have a mental image of that moment, in December of 1620, when the Pilgrims stepped ashore in Plymouth: a gray sky, a craggy coast and bone-chilling waters holding the Mayflower in the distance as a hud\u2026 [+2549 chars]", "fulltext": "If you are an American over the age of 6, chances are you have a mental image of that moment, in December of 1620, when the Pilgrims stepped ashore in Plymouth: a gray sky, a craggy coast and bone-chilling waters holding the Mayflower in the distance as a huddle of God-fearing voyagers, all with solemn expressions and oversize cockel hats, lasso their sloop to a rock. You can picture it because, every November, the story of the Pilgrims gets pur\u00e9ed with yams and spoon-fed to just about every kindergartner in the country. This is, like most Americans, how I first learned about Plymouth Rock.\n\nUnlike most Americans, I was raised in Southern California, along the shores of Manifest Destiny, about as far from Plymouth as the mainland extends. Lost along the route was the reality of the rock itself. I grew up believing that the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock but that its precise location was a mystery. It turns out the opposite is true: We have a Plymouth Rock, but we\u2019re next to certain the Pilgrims didn\u2019t land on it. In fact, we\u2019re pretty sure they didn\u2019t step off on any rock at all. Despite the way it\u2019s been mythologized, the shore that the Pilgrims found was a flat beach of sand and sediment. The only rock of note was a massive, lonesome boulder at the base of a hill.\n\nBy the time I learned any of this, I\u2019d been out of kindergarten for north of 20 years, and despite the fact that the boulder wasn\u2019t of the historical significance I\u2019d always believed it to be, I was so floored to discover there was an actual, physical Plymouth Rock that I de-Manifested my way to Massachusetts. Like anyone making the modern-day pilgrimage, what I saw upon approach to Plymouth Harbor was not the rock itself, but a Greco-Roman temple designed by McKim, Mead & White, architectural superfirm of the Gilded Age. The structure looks like a kiddie-pool equivalent of the Parthenon. Plymouth Rock is housed inside, and to view it you must first enter the portico, then approach the railing, then crane your neck downward. What you\u2019ll see is a ragged little lump half-buried in a sandpit, like a matzo ball sunken in soup.\n\nThe rock, as it appears today, has been whittled into near oblivion by an innumerable series of abuses, to the point that it\u2019s a mere fraction of the size it was when the Pilgrims didn\u2019t bother landing on it. Since then, it has been split cleanly in half, chiseled away by souvenir hunters and split again into many smaller pieces. It has been raised up, carted off, moved and re-moved and cracked and vandalized. Now, veins of cement bind the remaining pieces of the rock to one another; a patch of pockmarks has been plugged up and a flagrant \u201c1620\u201d has been chiseled into its face. It brings to mind a cake that\u2019s been toppled over and then hastily reassembled by a team of blind pastry chefs."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "GABRIELLE HAMILTON", "title": "Eat: Real People Eat Quiche", "description": "Silken custard, flaky crust: quiche Lorraine with Gruy\u00e8re and pancetta.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/magazine/real-people-eat-quiche.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/magazine/25mag-eat-image1/25mag-eat-image1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:00:01Z", "content": "And thats the thing about stupid quiche.

Mr. Whitaker became acting attorney general this month after Mr. Sessions was forced out.\n\nThe group provided the overwhelming majority of his income since at least 2016, according to the filings released Tuesday by the Justice Department."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u8a2a\u554f\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\uff0c\u4e2d\u83f2\u95dc\u4fc2\u300c\u53c8\u898b\u5f69\u8679\u300d\uff1f - \u7d10\u7d04\u6642\u5831\u4e2d\u6587\u7db2", "description": "\u7d10\u7d04\u6642\u5831\u4e2d\u6587\u7db2 \u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u8a2a\u554f\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\uff0c\u4e2d\u83f2\u95dc\u4fc2\u300c\u53c8\u898b\u5f69\u8679\u300d\uff1f \u7d10\u7d04\u6642\u5831\u4e2d\u6587\u7db2 \u66fc\u8c37\u2014\u2014\u5728\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u9031\u4e8c\u62b5\u9054\u99ac\u5c3c\u62c9\u958b\u59cb\u4e00\u6b21\u570b\u4e8b\u8a2a\u554f\u4e4b\u969b\uff0c\u4ed6\u53ef\u4ee5\u78ba\u4fe1\uff0c\u5728\u570b\u5bb6\u9996\u8166\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e7e\u4e4e\u6c92\u6709\u6bd4\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u7e3d\u7d71\u7f85\u5fb7\u91cc\u6208\u00b7\u675c\u7279\u8482(Rodrigo Duterte)\u66f4\u6e34\u671b\u898b\u4ed6\u7684\u4eba\u4e86\u3002 \u300c\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u611b\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\uff0c\u300d\u675c\u7279\u8482\u4eca\u5e744\u6708\u66fe\u8aaa\u3002\u300c\u4ed6\u61c2\u6211\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u9858\u610f\u5e6b\u52a9\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u6703\u8aaa\uff0c\u300e\u8b1d\u8b1d... \u9678\u83f2\u5143\u9996\u6703\u8ac7\u53cb\u597d\u7ba1\u63a7\u5357\u6d77\u5206\u6b67 \u4e2d\u6642\u96fb\u5b50\u5831 (\u65b0\u805e\u767c\u5e03) \u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u8a2a\u554f\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\uff1a\u300c\u96e8\u5f8c\u5f69\u8679\u300d\u4e0b\u7b49\u5f85\u300c\u5927\u6492\u5e63\u300d BBC \u4e2d\u6587\u7f51 \u5357\u6d77\u6316\u77f3\u6cb9\uff01\u4e2d\u83f2\u7c3d\u300c\u6cb9\u6c23\u958b\u767c\u5099\u5fd8\u9304\u300d \u5730\u9ede\u795e\u79d8\u4e0d\u516c\u958b\u2026", "url": "https://cn.nytimes.com/asia-pacific/20181121/xi-jinping-rodrigo-duterte-philippines-china/zh-hant/", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/world/21philippines-print/merlin_147107619_e8ca6c8c-2fff-43f8-b0e7-315190169e42-articleLarge.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T02:25:36Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5118\u7ba1\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u5c0d\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u70ba\u671f\u5169\u5929\u7684\u8a2a\u554f\u5c07\u6c89\u6d78\u5728\u8b9a\u63da\u8072\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u99ac\u5c3c\u62c9\u4e5f\u9762\u81e8\u8457\u96e3\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff1a\u675c\u7279\u8482\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u6062\u5fa9\u53cb\u597d\u95dc\u4fc2\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u5c0d\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u771f\u7684\u6709\u5e6b\u52a9\u3002\n\n\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u7684\u8a2a\u554f\u662f13\u5e74\u4f86\u4e2d\u570b\u9818\u5c0e\u4eba\u5c0d\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u8a2a\u554f\uff0c\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u6578\u5341\u5104\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u627f\u8afe\u3002\u4f46\u4e00\u4e9b\u7d93\u6fdf\u5b78\u5bb6\u5c0d\u9019\u4e9b\u627f\u8afe\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6703\u514c\u73fe\u8868\u793a\u61f7\u7591\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e2d\u570b\u5728\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u7684\u6295\u8cc7\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4ecd\u662f\u627f\u8afe\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u73fe\u5be6\u3002\u5169\u5e74\u524d\u9054\u6210\u7684240\u5104\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4e2d\u570b\u9805\u76ee\u548c\u6295\u8cc7\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u7d93\u6279\u51c6\u5be6\u65bd\u3002\n\n\u300c\u7f85\u5fb7\u91cc\u6208\u00b7\u675c\u7279\u84822016\u5e74\u4ee5\u4f86\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6c92\u6709\u9054\u5230\u9810\u671f\uff0c\u7121\u6cd5\u8b93\u4eba\u5011\u76f8\u4fe1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u300d\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u5927\u5b78\u6cd5\u5b78\u9662\u526f\u6559\u6388\u5091\u4f0a\u00b7\u5df4\u6e6f\u5df4\u5361(Jay Batongbacal)\u8aaa\u3002\n\n\u9031\u4e8c\uff0c\u4e2d\u570b\u99d0\u99ac\u5c3c\u62c9\u5927\u4f7f\u9928\u524d\uff0c\u4e00\u5834\u53cd\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u5728\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u4e0d\u65b7\u589e\u9577\u5f71\u97ff\u529b\u7684\u6297\u8b70\u3002 Noel Celis/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\n2016\u5e74\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u570b\u969b\u6cd5\u5ead\u7d66\u4e86\u83f2\u5f8b\u8cd3\u4e00\u500b\u610f\u60f3\u4e0d\u5230\u7684\u52dd\u5229\uff0c\u6cd5\u5ead\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u7531\u675c\u7279\u8482\u7684\u524d\u4efb\u8c9d\u5c3c\u5c3c\u5967\u00b7S\u00b7\u963f\u57fa\u8afe\u4e09\u4e16(Benigno S.

Federal prosecutors immediately objected, and Judge Brian M. Cogan shut down that line of questioning.\n\nAll of this took place as the courtroom audience was waiting for Mr. Zambada to testify about paying off a Mexican president. That expectation had been created last week after reporters saw a transcript of a sidebar Judge Cogan held with prosecutors and defense lawyers.\n\nAt the sidebar, the defense revealed a potential bombshell: that Mr. Zambada had previously told the authorities that he had paid \u201cthe now incumbent president of Mexico\u201d at least $6 million in bribes. The defense asked for permission to bring that information out in open court.\n\nBut hours before Mr. Zambada appeared for his final day of testimony, the government filed a motion under seal \u201cto preclude cross-examination.\u201d The secret motion prompted another lengthy discussion out of the jury\u2019s hearing on Tuesday afternoon, the transcript of which was also sealed.\n\nIt was only after that sidebar discussion ended that Judge Cogan shed a little light on what was going on in private. Ruling from the bench, he announced he was going to limit the questions that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers could ask Mr. Zambada.\n\nHe said the value of the information that might be learned from a broader cross-examination did not outweigh, as he put it, \u201cprotecting individuals and entities who are not parties to this case and who would face embarrassment.\u201d\n\nWho those people and entities were remained unclear. But when Mr. Zambada took the stand again to finish his testimony, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers were only allowed to ask vague questions about bribes to presidents.

It took him some time to get to Mr. Khashoggi. But bear with it. The statement is a fascinating journey into the mind of the president. Mr. Trump, when he is not obfuscating, is sometimes startlingly transparent about why he makes decisions.\n\nHere is the president\u2019s statement, as released by the White House, with additional context.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia America First! The world is a very dangerous place!\n\nWell, indeed it is! But not so dangerous, perhaps, that one should expect to be assassinated in a consulate while going to collect paperwork for a wedding.\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more.\n\nMr. Trump, here, is trying to remind the public who the United States\u2019 real enemy is. Hint: It is not Saudi Arabia. Riyadh\u2019s strong support for the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on Iran is a prime reason that the White House has maintained support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nLikewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government has been prone to shout the equivalent of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d But officials say Iranian terrorist activity is down recently. Tehran is seeking to keep Europe on board with the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration withdrew.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has created the worst famine the country has seen. Despite calls from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a cease-fire, Saudi Arabia has stepped up its military operations. The Saudi military\u2019s lack of discipline and planning in its airstrikes has resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties, according to American officials. Regional experts say the Trump administration\u2019s most decisive action against Saudi Arabia so far has been to cut off aerial refueling flights for Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen.\n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\n\nThis is a prime example of Mr. Trump\u2019s brutally transactional foreign policy. He is supporting Saudi Arabia because he thinks it is critical for the United States\u2019 defense industry. Saudi Arabia spends huge amounts on its military, and the United States is a beneficiary. However, the president\u2019s numbers are exaggerated. Trouble in the Saudi economy has led the government to slow roll some of the pledges to buy high-ticket items, including the missile defense system known as Thaad.\n\nIf we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nBaloney! The Saudis cannot hang a Russian or Chinese bomb on American-built F-15s or Apache gunships. They don\u2019t fit. Won\u2019t work. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in American-made and NATO-standard weapons. Where do you get munitions and spare parts for those planes and helicopters? The United States.\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nHere, at last, we get to Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident who was assassinated last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Trump administration\u2019s sanctions have mostly targeted the members of the Saudi kill team who traveled to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Interestingly, the administration\u2019s list included Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Prince Mohammed, but it did not include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, who Saudi officials said masterminded the plot to confront Mr. Khashoggi in the consulate on Oct. 2.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime.\n\nMr. Trump is repeating some of the phrases that the Saudi government has used to discredit Mr. Khashoggi. The president is pointedly not rebutting those claims, just saying his decision is not based on them. Arguably, he is being a bit backhanded.\n\nKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nWho knows! Can we ever really know what happened behind closed doors? Mr. Trump is clearly waiting for the kind of evidence shown on television: a recording of the crown prince giving the order or a confession of one of the kill team members. But former intelligence officers say that is not how it works. The puzzle pieces are never all present. Even without the smoking gun, enough evidence has emerged for C.I.A. officials to conclude that Prince Mohammed gave the order, according to current and former officials.\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nRemember who the bad guy is here! Another hint: It is not Prince Mohammed.\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world.\n\nOther presidents have often shied away from talking about what lies at the heart of the strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia \u2014 oil production and low gas prices. Not Mr. Trump. And, surprising as it may seem, he is correct about the United States being the world\u2019s largest oil producer.\n\nAs President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\nIn 1979, William Safire, the New York Times columnist and former presidential speechwriter, offered readers of this newspaper some sage advice: \u201cDon\u2019t overuse exclamation marks!!!\u201d"}]
