It was, after all, why she had called for the appointment with her doctor just a couple of hours earlier.\n\nThat morning she woke with the worst headache she ever had. It seemed to start at the back of her head and extend down her neck into her right shoulder. Her jaw \u2014 also on the right \u2014 had been painful off and on for the past three months, and it was worse than ever that morning. She called her dentist who had recently given her a mouth guard to wear at night. It wasn\u2019t working, she told the young woman who answered the phone. But as she tried to explain her symptoms, Ann\u2019s words sounded strangely slurred to her own ears.\n\nWhen she got off the phone, she hurried to the bathroom to see if she could figure out what was making her voice sound so odd. She hardly recognized the face she saw in the mirror. It was lopsided, asymmetric. The right side looked strangely flat as if all the air had been let out of the natural bulge of her cheek. The usual upward curve of her lip was gone and the corner of her mouth seemed to actually sag downward. She forced a smile and while the left side creased upward into a say-cheese kind of smile, the right side of her face didn\u2019t move at all.\n\nShe called her doctor right away and made the appointment to see him that afternoon.\n\nA New Set of Problems\n\nFor the past year, Ann felt as if she had been dealing with an overwhelming set of medical problems. Nearly 30 years earlier she developed diabetes but managed the disease by using an insulin pump. She had been a little too heavy when she was younger but lost most of her excess weight by eating better and exercising more often. But over all, she was healthy and happy until the year before when she developed a terrible burning pain and pressure in her throat and stomach any time she ate.\n\nShe was diagnosed with heartburn, what doctors often call reflux, and a gastric ulcer. Her doctor gave her an acid-reducing medication, as well as one to protect her stomach lining called Carafate. A scope a few weeks later showed that the reflux and ulcer were better, but her pain remained. Recently, simply eating any solid foods became excruciating. And so, four months earlier, she put herself on a liquid diet. If she drank her meals, she felt less pain.\n\nDiagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.\n\nBut suddenly she developed a new pain. The right side of her jaw, just over the joint, began to feel stiff and achy. She wondered if her jaw muscles had weakened because she was not chewing her food. Or perhaps she was grinding her teeth at night. She called her dentist, who said that she was likely experiencing a problem with her Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and gave her a bite guard to wear when she slept. It didn\u2019t help. Still, at that point, the pain was intermittent, and she could put up with it.\n\nBut over the course of the next few weeks the pain in her jaw grew more intense. It went from intermittent to constant and she felt as if it was affecting her ability to chew or even open her mouth.\n\nShe finally went to see her dentist who examined her and said that her jaw seemed misaligned. He made impressions of her teeth and sent her to an oral surgeon. The surgeon agreed that her bite was a little off but didn\u2019t feel that anything needed to be done. (You can see one of the X-rays of her jaw here.)\n\nAs Ann\u2019s jaw pain worsened, so did her headaches. And then she developed the strangest symptom of all. Every now and then her upper lip, on the right, would go flaccid. It didn\u2019t hurt \u2014 one of the few places on the right side of her head that didn\u2019t hurt \u2014 but it was strange and it sometimes made her speech sound a little funny. That was just a few weeks before the whole right side of her face did the same thing.\n\nWas It a Stroke?\n\nHer doctor was worried as soon as he saw her asymmetric face. Most of the time, unilateral facial paralysis is caused by something known as Bell\u2019s palsy \u2014 a type of temporary paralysis of (usually) one side of the face caused by damage or trauma to the facial nerves.\n\nThe facial nerve \u2014 also called the seventh cranial nerve \u2014 travels through a narrow, bony canal in the skull, just below the ear, to carry information to and from the spine to the muscles on either side of the face. For most of its journey, this nerve is encased in this bony shell.\n\nEach facial nerve directs the muscles on one side of the face, including those that control blinking and facial expressions such as smiling and frowning. The seventh cranial nerve is also in charge of the tearing of the eye (lacrimation) as well as the sense of taste. When Bell\u2019s palsy occurs, the function of the facial nerve is interrupted, and so the messaging between face and brain stops, resulting in facial weakness or paralysis.\n\nCurrent thinking within the medical community is that a viral infection such as an upper respiratory infection or the common cold sore virus \u2014 herpes simplex \u2014 is the most common cause of this kind of nerve injury. The viral infection causes the nerve to swell and press up against the bony canal, damaging the nerve or the fatty protective layer called myelin that surrounds it. Other possible causes of Bell\u2019s Palsy (named for Charles Bell, the 19th-century Scottish surgeon who first identified the facial nerve) include trauma, Lyme disease, tumors, high blood pressure, influenza or other upper-respiratory infections. Diabetes \u2014 which this patient had \u2014 is also an important risk factor for Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\nOn the other hand, her diabetes, although very well controlled, also increased her risk of having a stroke. Which was it? Her doctor wasn\u2019t sure. So, although the doctor thought Bell\u2019s was more likely, he wanted her to go to the hospital to make sure it wasn\u2019t anything else. (You can see her primary-care doctor\u2019s note here.)\n\nA Harrowing Car Ride\n\nAnn drove herself to a nearby medical center. There was no reason for her not to drive \u2014 she got herself to the doctor\u2019s office an hour before. But as she drove, her right eye suddenly shut, and she couldn\u2019t open it. She could drive with only one eye open but it was unnerving not being able to open her eye. When she arrived at the emergency room, she went to the registration desk. While she was there, signing the needed documents, she felt as if she couldn\u2019t control her right hand. Her signature was shaky and strange. Her right leg felt weak as well. Someone helped her into a wheelchair and brought her back into the treatment area.\n\nHearing the patient\u2019s story of progressive neurological symptoms that extended far beyond the face worried the doctors enough to have the patient admitted. A neurologist saw her in the emergency room. (You can see the notes from the E.R. here.) She was in the hospital for five days as her team looked for the cause of these strange symptoms.\n\nShe had many tests. A CT scan of her head was unrevealing as was an M.R.I., so it wasn\u2019t a stroke or a tumor. A lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal tap) was performed and was normal, showing the cause of her symptoms wasn\u2019t an infection or some kind of malignancy. It wasn\u2019t Lyme, it wasn\u2019t myasthenia gravis; it wasn\u2019t multiple sclerosis; it wasn\u2019t Sjogren\u2019s. She wasn\u2019t pregnant. It wasn\u2019t H.I.V. or syphilis. Her inflammatory markers were in the normal range. So was her thyroid hormone level. (Many of the specific lab results can be found here.)\n\nWhat was really strange about Ann\u2019s case was that her symptoms would wax and wane. Her right eyelid would close. Then it would open again. Her face would droop \u2014 only on the right \u2014 and then it would go back to normal. Her doctors had many hypotheses about what might cause these unusual symptoms, but testing didn\u2019t support any of them. She was discharged from the hospital and told to follow up with a neurologist as an outpatient.\n\nHelp Dr. Lisa Sanders solve this medical mystery. Click here to submit your diagnosis.\n\nA New Theory\n\nShe found a nearby neurologist, Adam Mednick. She brought in a timeline of her symptoms to help him see the full picture. (You can see Ann\u2019s timeline here.) Given the patient\u2019s waxing and waning symptoms, he thought that the most likely cause was a tear in one of the blood vessels going into the brain. When the inner lining of a blood vessel tears \u2014 something known as a dissection \u2014 the torn segment can flap back and forth, sometimes obstructing the flow of blood into the brain and sometimes leaving the vessel wide open. That kind of intermittent obstruction might account for her rapidly changing symptoms. He ordered an M.R. study with contrast to enhance the blood vessels to look for such an injury. He didn\u2019t find it. All of the major vessels going into her brain were fine.\n\nIf not a dissection, the neurologist wondered if these changing symptoms could be from an atypical migraine. Ann had headaches, these strange palsies or episodes of paralysis, although they didn\u2019t always happen at the same time, which made it a little less likely that a migraine was the cause. Beyond that, he wasn\u2019t sure what she might have. But she was clinically stable, so he didn\u2019t feel like he absolutely had to treat these odd paralyses until he had a more definitive diagnosis. (You can read Mednick\u2019s thoughtful notes here.)\n\nMeanwhile, the patient continued to limit her diet to liquids. She saw a gastroenterologist who performed an endoscopy that showed that Ann\u2019s ulcer was gone, with only a small area of inflammation. A biopsy showed evidence of chronic reflux and the only abnormality found in this very thorough workup was that her gallbladder wasn\u2019t working as well as it should. Although the gastroenterologist didn\u2019t think this was the cause of the patient\u2019s abdominal pain, she referred Ann to a surgeon to remove the poorly functioning gallbladder. And since Ann had no symptoms or stones, surgery to remove the gallbladder seemed to her to be unnecessary so she didn\u2019t call.\n\nBecause the patient had symptoms but normal studies, the gastroenterologist suspected that Ann\u2019s stomach and throat pain came from what is called a functional disorder. These are disorders that affect the way a body system works. Testing is normal; there is no structural or biochemical abnormality. But something about the way some system in the body works \u2014 in this case, the GI tract \u2014 causes the patient to have pain or discomfort.\n\nHelp Dr. Lisa Sanders solve this medical mystery. Click here to submit your diagnosis.\n\nThis is not a psychiatric diagnosis; it\u2019s not caused by stress, though, like many disorders, stress can make it worse. Our understanding of functional disorders is still inadequate. We basically have no idea why some people (nearly 25 million people in the United States) feel what they feel. These symptoms can disabling, however.\n\nAnd they can often be improved with low doses of an old class of medicines called tricyclic antidepressants. Although these drugs were originally used to treat psychiatric disorders, the doses needed to treat functional disorders is a tiny fraction of what is needed to have any effect at all on a psychiatric disease.\n\nTo treat Ann\u2019s stomach pains, the gastroenterologist started her on a tiny dose of one of these medications, nortriptyline. It took some time, but the medicine seemed to help. After a month, the burning in her chest stopped. The sharp stabbing pains disappeared. Slowly Ann was able to add solid foods, one by one, back into her diet. At this point, she\u2019s able to eat a normal healthy diet and she has stopped losing weight. After a few months, Ann noticed that her joints didn\u2019t hurt as much, and her headaches became rare and manageable. Even her facial droop, Ann feels, is a little better since she started taking the nortriptyline.\n\nThis medication has done so much more than either Ann or her gastroenterologist expected. As you can see, however, from the video, her facial droop remains a prominent symptom. (You can see the gastroenterologist\u2019s notes here.)\n\nCan You Help With the Diagnosis?\n\nHave you seen anything like this?

The latest report from Yahoo! Sports, in fact, disclosed that Green \u2014 who famously led the Warriors\u2019 recruitment of Durant during the summer of 2016 \u2014 essentially dared Durant to leave as a free agent next summer during his rant.\n\nThursday\u2019s early optimism, however, faded quickly. Perhaps not so surprisingly, given the depths of the discord, Golden State\u2019s on-court performance on Thursday night was dismal, to put it charitably, with Curry rooted to the bench in street clothes because of a pesky groin strain. And the postgame mood got downright testy when Durant was asked a solitary question about Green.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me that again,\u201d Durant said.\n\nGreen\u2019s stint on the floor beside Durant was equally icy: 24 minutes without a single point. The Warriors\u2019 starters failed to connect on a single 3-pointer sans Curry to bail them out. That hasn\u2019t happened to a Golden State starting five since March 2013.\n\nYet Iguodala, for the record, is still proudly sticking with the memorable line he uncorked Tuesday night after Green served his suspension during a Warriors home win over Atlanta. \u201cYou can\u2019t climb a mountain if it\u2019s smooth,\u2019\u2019 he intoned. And Green, defiant as ever, insisted after Thursday\u2019s loss that the 12-4 Warriors are \u201cstill the best team in the league\u201d and are \u201cstill going to win a championship.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets, meanwhile, remain determined to reject any suggestion that they\u2019ve fixed anything significant, even though they\u2019re now 3-0 \u2014 with impressive wins over Indiana, Denver (in Denver) and Golden State \u2014 since banishing Anthony.\n\nRather defiant himself over the years, going all the way back to his Phoenix Suns days, Houston Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni has very rarely indicated publicly that his team\u2019s confidence is so much as dented. So my ears perked up when he told me before Thursday\u2019s game that the Rockets had taken \u201ca good punch\u2019\u2019 to start the season. \u201cIt staggered us a little bit,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAnthony\u2019s departure isn\u2019t the first time Houston management has changed its mind so quickly. You\u2019ll recall that Kevin McHale, sporting a record of 4-7 to start the 2015-16 season, was fired as coach fresh off a trip to the conference finals. That happened during the first month of the first year of a three-year contract extension for McHale. But the frantic push to bring back Bzdelik and the Rockets\u2019 numerous proposals to acquire a free agent-to-be in Butler, combined with Melo\u2019s fate, haven\u2019t done much to dispel the whispers that the Rockets, deep down, fear that they\u2019ve already blown their best shot to ever unseat the Warriors."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ALAN BLINDER and RICHARD FAUSSET", "title": "Stacey Abrams Ends Fight for Georgia Governor", "description": "Ms. Abrams acknowledged that her Republican rival Brian Kemp would become governor, saying \u201cthe law currently allows no further viable remedy\u201d to challenge the vote.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/elections/georgia-governor-race-kemp-abrams.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/17/us/17georgia-01sub/17georgia-01sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:38:12Z", "content": "His proposals, though sometimes vague, thrilled conservatives: a Track and Deport plan that would create a comprehensive database to track criminal aliens in Georgia; new limits on the states budget, sustaining the governments efforts to lure major economic p\u2026 [+2193 chars]", "fulltext": "ATLANTA \u2014 Stacey Abrams ended her Democratic bid to become governor of Georgia on Friday, acknowledging that she did not have the votes to beat her Republican rival, Brian Kemp, but sounding a defiant note by declaring that an \u201cerosion of our democracy\u201d had kept many of her backers from the polls.\n\nThe narrow defeat of Ms. Abrams, who would have become the first black woman to be elected governor anywhere in the United States, as well as the apparent loss of Andrew Gillum, who sought to become Florida\u2019s first black governor, at once illuminated the vestiges of Southern history and demonstrated how demographic changes have taken hold across the region and begun to reshape its politics.\n\nThe two candidates ran as unabashed liberals and their strong showings in two pivotal states where Democrats have lately struggled is likely to keep the debate going within the Democratic Party over the best strategy for making gains in 2020.

New Orleans sits below sea level and it\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\nCalifornia is already one of the most expensive states in the country because of a housing shortage, and restricting growth in fire-prone areas \u2014 which includes most of the state \u2014 will only exacerbate that shortage, raise prices and further marginalize the most vulnerable populations. Many residents of Paradise, the town at the center of the Camp Fire, lived there specifically because they had been priced out of nearby cities.\n\nInstead, we should take a cue from the Dutch. Much of the Netherlands sits below sea level and is therefore prone to flooding, but the Dutch can\u2019t exactly move en masse next door to Germany. So they have learned over the centuries that the solution is to stop fighting the sea, and build their cities and towns to maximize saving lives through smarter planning and infrastructure. We could do the same with wildfire.\n\nSome parts of the country already follow the Dutch model, intentionally or not. The southeastern United States has not lost significant numbers of homes or lives to fire, despite its vast expanse of the \u201cwildland-urban interface\u201d \u2014 the mixture of rural homes and towns with wild vegetation. That\u2019s not because the region is immune to fire. It\u2019s because, in part, the Southeast uses prescribed fire across millions of acres each year to reduce how much vegetation is left to burn, effectively using intentional fires to limit out-of-control wildfire.\n\nIn California, some communities aggressively prepare residents for the eventuality of wildfire. Montecito, a community east of Santa Barbara, saw the need to address wildfire risk following the 1990 Painted Cave Fire nearby, which killed one person and consumed 427 homes.

But they are focusing on an automatic system designed to keep the plane, a Boeing 737 Max 8, from going into a \u201cstall\u201d condition.\n\nA stall can occur when the plane\u2019s nose points upward at too great an angle, robbing the craft of the aerodynamic lift that allows it to stay aloft. But if the 737 receives incorrect data on the angle \u2013 as the same plane did on the flight just before the crash \u2013 the system designed to save the plane can instead force the nose down, potentially sending it into a fatal dive.\n\nThe situation in this case is further complicated by Boeing\u2019s installation of the system, which the company did without explaining it in the new model\u2019s operating manual. So the pilots might well have been unfamiliar with it.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it was confident in the safety of the Boeing 737 Max, and added, \u201cWhile we can\u2019t discuss specifics of an on-going investigation, we have provided two updates to operators that re-emphasize existing operating procedures \u2014 the series of steps required \u2014 for these situations.\u201d\n\nIf the pilots of Lion Air 610 did in fact confront an emergency with this type of anti-stall system, they would have had to take a rapid series of complex steps to understand what was happening and keep the jetliner flying properly.

The Boeing anti-stall system cannot activate until the flaps are up.\n\nAfter the 600-foot drop, the pilots climbed to 5,000 feet, possibly to give themselves more maneuvering room if another unexpected dive occurred. They sought and received permission to return to the airport, but for reasons not yet known, they did not appear to have tried to do so. When the plane leveled off just above 5,000 feet, there was another indication that something was amiss: instead of the smooth, straight flight that the usual autopilot setting would produce, the plane pitched up and down, indicating manual operation.\n\nAltitude of Lion Air Flight 610 3,000 feet Pilot appears to struggle with manual control 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:22 6:23 6:24 6:25 6:26 6:27 6:28 6:29 6:30 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Pilot appears to struggle with manual control 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:23 6:25 6:27 6:29 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Pilot appears to struggle with manual control 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:25 6:28 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Pilot appears to struggle with manual control 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:23 6:25 6:27 6:29 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Pilot appears to struggle with manual control 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:23 6:25 6:27 6:29 6:31 a.m. The New York Times | Source: Flightradar24\n\nThat could indicate that the pilot simply was not very good at flying in manual mode. More likely, said Les Westbrooks, an associate professor at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, the pilot already was struggling with some system causing the plane to veer from its straight path.\n\nIn that case, Mr. Westbrooks said, it would be like trying to drive a car that is tugging one way or another \u2013 the driver can counteract it, but the path is jagged. The plane\u2019s up-and-down motion continued, including a larger dip and recovery of about 1,000 feet in the last few minutes of the flight that might have felt like a bit of rough turbulence to passengers, said R. John Hansman Jr., a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and director of the international center for air transportation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThen, suddenly, the plane went down.\n\nAltitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Plane plummets 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:22 6:23 6:24 6:25 6:26 6:27 6:28 6:29 6:30 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Plane plummets 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:23 6:25 6:27 6:29 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Plane plummets 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:25 6:28 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Plane plummets 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:23 6:25 6:27 6:29 6:31 a.m. Altitude of Lion Air Flight 610 Plane plummets 3,000 feet 1,000 feet 6:21 a.m. 6:23 6:25 6:27 6:29 6:31 a.m. The New York Times | Source: Flightradar24\n\nThere has been no official finding that the anti-stall system \u2013 known as the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or M.C.A.S. \u2013 was activated. But if the 737\u2019s sensors were indicating erroneously that the nose had pitched dangerously up, the pilot\u2019s first warning might have been a \u201cstick shaker:\u201d the yoke \u2013 the steering wheel-like handles in front of the pilot and co-pilot \u2013 would vibrate.\n\nIf the false warning in turn activated the automatic anti-stall system, the pilots would have had to take a series of rapid and not necessarily intuitive steps to maintain control \u2013 a particular challenge since those steps were not in the plane\u2019s operating manual and the pilots had not been trained on how to respond.\n\nIf it sensed a stall, the system would have automatically pushed up the forward edge of the stabilizers, the larger of the horizontal surfaces on the plane\u2019s tail section, in order to put downward pressure on the nose.\n\nTo counter the nose-down movement, the pilot\u2019s natural reaction would probably have been to use his yoke, which moves the other, smaller surfaces on the plane\u2019s tail, the elevators. But trying that maneuver might well have wasted precious time without solving the problem because the downward force on the nose exerted by the stabilizer is greater than the opposite force the pilot would be trying to exert through the elevator, said Pat Anderson, a professor of aerospace engineering at Embry Riddle.\n\n\u201cAfter a period of time, the elevator is going to lose, and the stabilizer is going to win,\u201d he said.\n\nThe M.C.A.S system angles the stabilizer, pushing the tail up.

The M.C.A.S system angles the stabilizer, pushing the tail up. As a result, the nose goes down. elevator Horizontal stabilizer The New York Times\n\nWith only fragmentary data available, Mr. Hansman said he suspects that a runaway of the M.C.A.S. system played a central role in the crash. \u201cThe system basically overrode the pilot in that situation,\u201d Mr. Hansman said.\n\nIf the anti-stall system indeed ran away with the stabilizer control, only a fast sequence of steps by the pilot and first officer could have saved the aircraft, instructions later issued by Boeing show.\n\nOn the outside of the yoke in front of both the pilot and the first officer, there is a switch for electrically controlling the trim \u2013 the angle of the stabilizers. If the pilot understood what was happening, he could have used that switch for a few seconds at a time to counteract what the M.C.A.S. was doing to the stabilizers. But that would have been only a temporary solution: the pilot has to release the switch or the nose could go too high. But if he releases the switch, the anti-stall system would reactivate a few seconds later, according to a bulletin issued by Boeing.\n\nElectric stabilizer trim switch Yoke 1.

Those switches disable electric control of the motor that moves the stabilizers up and down, preventing the anti-stall system from exerting control over their position.\n\nStabilizer trim cutout 2.

Cables for manually operating the stabilizers run over a wheel \u2013 actually two wheels, one on either side of the console next to the ankles of the pilot and first officer. One of the pilots must rotate the wheel to pull the stabilizer back into the correct position."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "WILLIAM K.

Several boys in his second-grade class also found \u201cEl Deafo\u201d a rewarding change from the usual fare recommended to them \u2014 those ubiquitous series that deliver endless action and flatulence jokes. For my son and his friends, it didn\u2019t matter that the narrator of \u201cEl Deafo\u201d is a girl, or that there is no galactic warfare to be found, no plotline about defeating others. Seeing them connect so strongly with this nuanced, absorbing novel made me wonder why boys at this age \u2014 the \u201cchapter book\u201d years, when they\u2019re reading on their own, but not full-on novels \u2014 are pushed mostly toward shallow books full of battles, boogers and pranks.\n\nI know librarians, teachers, writers and publishers all want to share emotionally complex books like \u201cEl Deafo\u201d with boys as well as girls. But I wonder, what in our culture often prevents boys at the chapter-book level from giving these books a try? Are too few parents seeking out stories for their sons that go beyond ninjas and winning things? A study this fall on adolescent gender perceptions found one in three boys reported feeling an expectation to \u201cdominate\u201d and \u201cbe in charge of others,\u201d which they attributed to factors including pressure to hide feelings of sadness or anxiety. Only 2 percent felt they were valued for their honesty and morality. Surely, reading can play a big role in freeing boys from this emotionally suffocating box.\n\nIn the picture book years, finding great stories that don\u2019t perpetuate traditional gender divides is relatively easy. Many of the enduring tales of talking animals are gender-free, and these days it\u2019s not hard to find picture books with humans in them who don\u2019t comply with gendered expectations. Among many others, we\u2019ve lately enjoyed Peter H. Reynolds\u2019s purple-haired verb-loving boy in \u201cThe Word Collector\u201d and Vanita Oelschlager\u2019s \u201cA Tale of Two Daddies.\u201d\n\nBut once children hit 7 or 8 and start reading chapter books and graphic novels on their own, a cloud of gendered smog descends over the bookshelves. Boys in particular, I began to notice \u2014 especially boys labeled \u201creluctant readers\u201d \u2014 find themselves directed toward shelves where it\u2019s hard to make out any reading options that don\u2019t involve competition or some explicit goal. Yet I\u2019m not convinced these fledgling readers wouldn\u2019t respond to other kinds of stories as well, especially ones presented, like \u201cEl Deafo,\u201d in the graphic novel format. Alongside the endless books about toilets and sword fights, I wonder if experiencing more stories about the interior lives of boys \u2014 the parts of themselves not pitched toward exterior action \u2014 would help shape their sense of what\u2019s really at stake in their lives, and broaden their ideas about what boys can find fun and worth voicing about themselves."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "SETH COLTER WALLS", "title": "A Long-Lost Symphonic Love Story Is Told Again", "description": "A new edition of Julius Eastman\u2019s Symphony No. 2, dedicated to a former lover in the early 1980s, will have its premiere by the Mannes Orchestra.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/arts/music/julius-eastman-second-symphony.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/17/arts/music/17eastman/17eastman-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:24:45Z", "content": "Concerts and recordings of the works of Julius Eastman a vibrant composer-performer who was all but lost to history after his death in 1990 have become reliably important events as his music has resurfaced in recent years.

But its continuance is anything but guaranteed, and its emergence after 1945 was \u201ca great historical aberration\u201d that saw the simultaneous collapse of the old power centers of Europe and Asia and the rise of a liberal, capitalist, democratic United States committed to internationalism and locked in a competition with a nuclear Soviet Union. The result was a sharp break from a past of endless cycles of powers rising, warring and falling, and one that saw \u201camazing progress over the past seven decades.\u201d\n\nNow, however, that system is in jeopardy. The jungle \u2014 that place of chaos and disorder and war \u2014 \u201cis growing back. History is returning. Nations are reverting to old habits and traditions.\u201d Kagan does not lay all the blame on the United States, but he does see the country as responsible, through acts of omission and commission, for letting the system unravel. Trump is accelerating that, though he cannot be faulted for the rise of antidemocratic nationalism in Europe or the return of Asian rivalries. Kagan passionately believes that the only way to beat back the jungle and reverse these dangerous trends is for the United States to recommit itself to lead.\n\nTo do that, Kagan concludes, Americans must first address the fraying of the liberal order domestically. On that score he is fairly sanguine: \u201cAmericans will come out of it.\u201d They \u201ccannot escape the principles of the Declaration, even if they want to. They have nowhere else to go.\u201d Not so the rest of the world. As much as many Americans would like to turn inward, that path will imperil the United States. Kagan may well overstate the role the United States can and should play going forward, but he powerfully underscores just how tenuous the world order is and always has been."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "DAVID TANIS", "title": "City Kitchen: Add a Bit More Green to Your Fall Diet", "description": "This salad puts hearty spinach leaves to work alongside marinated tofu and a dressing that takes cues from Japan.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/dining/spinach-tofu-salad.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/21kitchen1/21kitchen1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:19:29Z", "content": "Its November, and snow has already fallen in parts of the country.

Paper, $16.\n\nAmerican literature needs modernization, pronto. We need female lead characters and female voices, not only to rectify the male skew created by centuries of gender inequality, but also because women make supreme heroes, and it is high time we recognize that fact. In \u201cScribe,\u201d a slim and dense novel about an American dystopia, Alyson Hagy gives us both.\n\nStories have always had the power to shape and transform our world. But Hagy understands that, in order for this to happen, stories must be relevant to and reflective of their times. In oral storytelling traditions, including the Appalachian Jack tales Hagy evokes here, story is understood not as a museum specimen but as a living, growing organism, constantly cultivated to serve both the cultural needs and the idiom of the moment. In nonliterate societies, minstrels occupy a place of power, both as guards of the people\u2019s history and remodelers of the myths they tell. The protagonist of \u201cScribe\u201d is a refreshing version of this ancient archetype, largely because she is a she. The sole unnamed character in the novel (a fact that emphasizes her mythic status and role as an \u201cEverywoman\u201d), she survives in a future post-civil-war society in the wilds of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains, eking out an existence however she can.\n\nAnd what she can do is read and write, skills lost by the rest of the war- and disease-ravaged population. These huddled masses, \u201cthe Uninvited,\u201d live like \u201cgrizzled human weeds\u201d in the hills around her, reduced to a Neanderthal-level existence, trapped in violent feuds under the prevailing law of \u201ctake or be taken.\u201d They come to her when they need letters, and she writes them, especially \u201con behalf of the guilty and possessed,\u201d as trade for essentials: firewood, tobacco, sometimes sex. The novel ignites when a mysterious man named Hendricks seeks her services. Her martyred sister\u2019s ghost appears, time starts behaving strangely and all these lives entangle. Around them, the Uninvited\u2019s feud escalates, building to a conflict orchestrated by a nefarious merchant ruler named Billy Kingery, who holds a vicious vendetta against the protagonist.\n\nImage\n\nThe violated female body is a running theme; the protagonist reveals past traumas to Hendricks, and her wounds accentuate the healing power of the missives she writes.

Audible Studios.\n\nThere was a nice symmetry to \u201cPatti Smith: Words and Music\u201d opening a three-night run this past September at the tiny Minetta Lane Theater in the Village, while an old comrade had passed his 200th performance of the like-minded \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d up at the much larger Walter Kerr. Both artists are South Jersey rock \u2019n\u2019 roll refugees who earned New York citizenship, though Bruce Springsteen\u2019s is more honorary; he became a global ambassador of empathic workingman\u2019s Americana, while Patti Smith became an icon of urban punk bohemianism, a sensibility she helped invent.\n\nUnlike Springsteen, Smith has long held dual passports in the music and literary worlds. She came to performance as a poet, declaiming verse from the St. Mark\u2019s Church Poetry Project altar in 1971, and early books like \u201cWitt\u201d were more than mere lyric sheets, even if the words were generally more powerful off the page. Her best recordings, especially her debut single, \u201cPiss Factory,\u201d and the opening of her debut album, \u201cHorses,\u201d were often poems declaimed over and around music. They could even be unaccompanied incantation, like the breathtaking flow of her spoken-word B-side \u201cBabelfield,\u201d which still feels as riveting as it did when I played it as a late-night college radio D.J. in the \u201980s. And her stage patter has always been its own entertainment, part stand-up comedy, part populist sermonizing.\n\nAll of which is to say that whatever \u201cPatti Smith at the Minetta Lane: Words and Music\u201d exactly is \u2014 audiobook, live concert recording, podcast, radio theater or combination thereof \u2014 the hybrid form feels completely natural to her talents. The recording, which has a bootleg quality to it, assembles pieces from the three-night run into a single seamless show, though showing seams is a big part of her approach. She begins as if she\u2019s hosting a salon, promising a night of \u201chyper-living theater,\u201d with no nudity but for \u201cthe naked mind \u2014 and even more dangerous, the collective naked mind.\u201d She reverently reads a Rilke poem, \u201cAutumn Day,\u201d taking minor musical liberties, her daughter, Jesse Paris Smith, accompanying her on piano in a style evoking Erik Satie. That\u2019s followed by an offhand reflection on making a leaf-shaped ashtray in grade school that becomes a well-turned shaggy dog tale, complete with punch line. Smith has spoken about studying the work of \u201cmy two Johnnys\u201d \u2014 Coltrane and Carson \u2014 in honing her improvisatory way with words.

Last year, one of its location scouts was found shot to death in Mexico amid what was shaping up to be the country\u2019s deadliest year.\n\nThe first two seasons of the show focused on Pablo Escobar, the former kingpin in charge of the Medellin cartel in Colombia. But it started with Escobar already in power, rather than with his beginnings. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of history knew that Escobar was killed in a rooftop shootout in the 1990s. But the show was compelling regardless, mostly because of the simultaneous humanity and depravity Wagner Moura brought in spades to portraying Escobar. Moura, much like James Gandolfini and Bryan Cranston, was able to force the audience to catch itself in often rooting for a complex monster.\n\nIn Season 3, \u201cNarcos\u201d surpassed expectations in a post-Escobar universe, shifting focus to the Cali cartel that filled the vacuum left behind by Escobar\u2019s death: Its four charismatic leaders were equally monstrous, but they had more flair.

Thankfully such is not at all the case with two new audiobooks: \u201cMy Squirrel Days,\u201d written and read by Ellie Kemper, and \u201cOut of My Mind,\u201d written and read by Alan Arkin. Although both are memoirs by comic actors, these audiobooks could not be more different in content or delivery.\n\nIf you\u2019re at all a Kemper fan already (I am, a lot), you will freaking love this audiobook. Her performance is infectious. Her energy is like a rocket ship blasting out of my ear buds and into my soul! Every time I would tune back in, I was re-energized by her joie de vivre. This woman loves life, loves her life, seems to love the life of those around her; hell, she probably even loves the life of the manager of the brunch spot that didn\u2019t quite get the lentil-to-kale ratio correct on her salad. Ellie Kemper is a happy person. But she\u2019s still a regular person too. She tries and fails at inner calm, hilariously reflecting while attempting to cure her pre-wedding anxiety in the outdoors, \u201cEven a sunny hike in a vast park where severed heads are occasionally found was not enough to bring me inner stillness.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "JULIA MOSKIN", "title": "The Thanksgiving Leftovers Everyone Forgets", "description": "After the feast, many cooks find they've overstocked ingredients like scallions, pecans and onions.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/dining/thanksgiving-leftovers-recipes.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/21leftovers5/21leftovers5-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:37:38Z", "content": "I will need to use up some of the extra butter I buy (for the extra pies I will run out of time to make).

Having recently moved back into New York City from the suburbs, where I mostly listened to audiobooks in my car, I was struck by how different it is listening to a book on headphones while doing other things. On the one hand it\u2019s a peculiarly intimate experience; the narrator speaks directly into your ear, as if to you alone. On the other hand, it can be hard to concentrate on the story, particularly if it\u2019s nonlinear or experimental.\n\n\u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d is neither of these. If I hadn\u2019t read that Heather Morris originally wrote this novel as a screenplay, I might\u2019ve guessed: The story clips along without extraneous exposition, and the dialogue is snappy and convincing. As a reader, I\u2019m usually drawn to dense wordplay and complicated perspectives. But as a multitasking listener, I found the straightforward, chronological narrative easy and pleasurable to follow.\n\nBased on the author\u2019s interviews with a Jewish Holocaust survivor, \u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz\u201d is the story of Lale Sokolov, Prisoner 32407, who was transported from Slovakia to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Birkenau, Poland, in 1942 and assigned the task of tattooing numbers on his fellow prisoners\u2019 arms. As a T\u00e4towierer, Lale was in a privileged but morally compromised position, \u201cperforming an act of defilement on people of his own faith,\u201d as the narrator notes. Unlike most prisoners, Lale had agency. He was given his own room, fed extra rations and allowed freedoms most prisoners were denied, like traversing the camp alone and visiting both male and female barracks."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "NIKI KITSANTONIS", "title": "Greek Leader\u2019s Efforts to Loosen Church-State Ties Are Met With Skepticism", "description": "Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece, right, and the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, Archbishop Ieronymos, announcing a tentative deal this month to remove clerics from civil service payrolls and to resolve a longstanding dispute over church property.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/world/europe/greece-tsipras-orthodox-church.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/17/world/17Greece1/17Greece1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:30:28Z", "content": "Bishop Anthimos of Thessaloniki, Greeces second-largest city, has said the deal would be tantamount to national suicide, and predicted that it would not secure the approval of the Holy Synod.

When the officer stepped out of his S.U.V. cruiser, its blue and red emergency strobes piercing the darkness, I thought that perhaps a neighboring camper had summoned him to silence my dissonant guitar strumming beside the campfire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Mr. Behar,\u201d the sergeant announced. My cousin, who knew our whereabouts, had called the county sheriff, who dispatched the sergeant. His name was Brad Phelps, and he had navigated a dirt road at night through rugged alpine terrain to our location, because there was no cell reception where we were. After I identified myself, Phelps read from a palm-size paper notepad: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have to tell you that your mother has passed away.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d I remember thinking. My mother, at 73, was a competitive tennis player who often went up against (and defeated) women years younger. She was exceptionally fit, never smoked and ate like an ascetic thanks to her father, who ran a produce business and raised his daughter on fruits and vegetables. \u201cShe was the picture of health,\u201d I would hear from friends at the funeral.\n\n\u201cI was absolutely floored,\u201d her physician, Milah Frownfelter, told me recently. \u201cShe had this tremendous vigor that was completely divorced from the acute process she suffered.\u201d In 2014, my mother had a coronary calcium scan, which uses X-rays to look for plaque in arteries. The results were plugged into a risk-crunching algorithm that compares a patient\u2019s individual health data (blood pressure, cholesterol, age and so on) with that of people who are similar, demographically and pathologically. While my mother had some minor plaque, the algorithm calculated her odds of having an \u201cevent\u201d \u2014 a heart attack or stroke \u2014 at 7 percent over 10 years, hardly alarming for her age. She didn\u2019t even meet the threshold at which most doctors would prescribe cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, Frownfelter said.\n\nOn the day she died, she had only mild nausea and clamminess. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d she told my father before excusing herself to the bathroom. When he checked on her five minutes later, she was in the fetal position beside the toilet, dead from cardiac arrest. Cardiologists I consulted afterward surmised that she suffered a so-called widow-maker, a plaque blockage in the left anterior descending artery. It\u2019s an invariably fatal heart attack, one that disproportionately affects men and can kill an otherwise healthy person almost instantly and with no previous symptoms.\n\nAs an older father with young kids, I\u2019m vigilant about my health, which led me to get a coronary scan in 2016, the same procedure my mother underwent. I was 47 and exercised fanatically. My physician thought I was crazy and refused to approve the procedure for insurance coverage. So I paid $270 to a medical-imaging outfit in Boulder, where I live, to get it done. I had smidgens of plaque in two arteries, including the left anterior descending. My doctor was surprised, but my risk was considered negligible \u2014 a 3.5 percent chance of an event within five years, based on a similar algorithm, developed by the American College of Cardiology, to the one that had established my mother\u2019s odds. \u201cYou are already doing everything right,\u201d he assured me. And yet my mom had been, too.\n\nSix weeks after my mother\u2019s death, I visited Nelson Trujillo, a prominent cardiologist in Boulder. Coronary scans show only hard plaque, he explained; they don\u2019t reveal whether it\u2019s softening and ready to rupture, \u201clike a big pimple,\u201d in his words. If it pops, its fragments could clog an artery, which would be dangerous, if not lethal. A coronary angiogram, done with a CT scanner, can detect soft plaque. But because a CT scan is expensive and exposes the patient to radiation, it\u2019s rarely performed on someone whose probability of having a heart attack is statistically low.\n\nPart of the equipment SomaLogic uses to create aptamers. Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times\n\nTrujillo had a recommendation. A privately held biotech company in town called SomaLogic was conducting a trial for a new blood-screening process to gauge cardiovascular health, and Trujillo happened to be leading the study. \u201cYou are the perfect candidate!\u201d he declared with kidlike enthusiasm. Cardiologists make clinical decisions based on statistical factors gleaned from broad population studies. \u201cWe\u2019re always comparing you to big groups of people,\u201d Trujillo told me. \u201cThe problem is, we know that sometimes we\u2019re wrong. We have a miss rate \u2014 those six guys out of a hundred who we say are O.K. but who are not. I wanted to know who those six people were.\u201d\n\nThe test promised to search my blood for nine proteins associated with cardiovascular health. There are 20,000 or so known proteins in the human proteome, as the collective sum of proteins in any organism is called. Because it can signal when something is amiss inside a body, the proteome has the potential to serve as a diagnostic system \u2014 sort of like the ones in modern cars that alert mechanics when a fuel injector is plugged or a timing belt needs replacing. The SomaLogic screen wouldn\u2019t merely compare my health stats with those of other men like me. It would take a snapshot of what was happening inside my body at that moment. \u201cIt\u2019s not odds-based on people who look like you,\u201d Trujillo told me. \u201cIt\u2019s odds-based on you specifically.\u201d\n\nProteomics, or the study of proteins, has long offered the ability to identify many biological processes. But until recently, the sheer number of proteins and the complexity of their interactions made screenings impractical, if not impossible. Now, with the advent of more powerful computers and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning, medical experts are imagining a future where proteomics will realize its power to tell us, to an incredible degree, what\u2019s transpiring inside our bodies. As Omid Farokhzad, a professor and physician recently at Harvard Medical School, puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to diagnose diseases such as cancers and Alzheimer\u2019s years before symptoms.\u201d\n\nFor a physician like Trujillo, who is still working with SomaLogic to give the protein test to patients, the promise of proteomics is already here. \u201cI used to say to somebody like your mom, \u2018You don\u2019t have much heart disease; you don\u2019t need anything.\u2019 But that was B.S. I couldn\u2019t reassure her one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where proteomics comes in \u2014 and where it\u2019s fundamentally different than anything else we have.\u201d Proteomics might have saved her life \u2014 and it may yet save mine.\n\nGenes tend to get more attention, but proteins might really deserve the limelight. As the workhorses in the human body, proteins play a role in nearly all of its biological processes. They make antibodies to battle infections. They grow bone and muscle and convert what you eat into nutrients. Proteins are constructed inside cells, from building blocks called amino acids. Humans have 20 commonly occurring amino acids: We produce 11 naturally and obtain nine more from what we eat (which is why high-protein foods are essential to our diet). The blueprints for proteins are stored inside genes, which contain DNA and RNA. RNA is like a courier, delivering the instructions from genes to cells for making proteins from specified assortments of amino acids.\n\nOur proteins are in constant flux. They can appear and disappear, or shift in concentration, in response to our external environment or internal physiology. Our proteome reacts to what we eat, when we sleep, how we exercise, the smoke we inhale, the alcohol we drink. My proteins look different after I run a 10K than they do before the race; they change when I get the flu; they are altered by stress and emotions.\n\nResearchers are now learning that diseases have their own unique proteomic patterns. An ailment like colon cancer might involve interactions with hundreds of proteins. Stephen Williams, the chief medical officer of SomaLogic, told me about a recent experiment that turned up at least 1,000 proteins associated with diabetes.\n\nProteins and genes have very different things to say about our health. Genes are static. We live and die with the same set we\u2019re born with: about 20,000 in the human genome that make proteins. Certain diseases are linked directly to genes, like those for breast cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. But genes can inform us only of our odds. If my DNA resembles that of other men who have prostate cancer, that means I have a greater risk of suffering a similar fate. My genes can\u2019t tell me that I actually have cancer, or that I will, however, only that I have a predisposition for it.\n\nTubes holding individual samples at SomaLogic. Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times\n\nProteins can confirm an illness is underway, and they often appear in our blood long before we feel sick \u2014 months or years before symptoms, when many diseases are still curable. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, it\u2019s the proteins we can measure before anything else,\u201d says Joshua LaBaer, who founded the Harvard Institute of Proteomics and now directs the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, where he is a professor.\n\nThis kind of information is invaluable to doctors, who want to know exactly what is going wrong in real time, not what might happen in the future \u2014 and it\u2019s also why they haven\u2019t learned as much from genomics as they had originally hoped. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked a lot at genes in the past 15 years,\u201d says Jon Heimer, the chief executive of Olink Proteomics, a biotech firm based in Uppsala, Sweden, that sells protein panels to scan for ailments ranging from organ damage to inflammation. \u201cBut it makes more sense to look at proteins, because they are the biological machinery of human beings.\u201d\n\nToday, physicians rely largely on pattern recognition to make clinical diagnoses: They match observed symptoms with associated ailments. But there\u2019s a pitfall to this approach \u2014 symptoms are sometimes absent. Our bodies can function well when they\u2019re ill, even gravely so. It\u2019s an evolutionary survival mechanism that prevented my mother\u2019s heart from divulging any clues to its infirmity until it failed.\n\nIn general, we don\u2019t go to the doctor until we\u2019re feeling lousy \u2014 a persistent cough, say, or a throbbing headache. But there are deadly conditions that don\u2019t always exhibit conspicuous signs. Cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes and kidney dysfunction \u2014 six of the top 10 things that kill people in the United States, accounting for 1.6 million deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 can all manifest without symptoms. But proteins often show up first.\n\nHundreds of ailments, like strep throat, flu and H.I.V., among others, are already diagnosed through single-protein tests. The prostate-specific antigen protein, or P.S.A., can indicate if a man has prostate cancer. The blood drawn at your annual physical is analyzed for a variety of its proteins, like hemoglobin and lipoproteins, which flag cholesterol levels. Perhaps the most common (and reliable) test is the pregnancy pee stick, which measures human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG, a hormonal protein produced by the placenta.\n\nBut complex disease fingerprints with swarms of proteins are exceptionally difficult (and time-consuming) to spot using conventional \u201cwet lab\u201d methods. \u201cTo your eyes and my eyes, we won\u2019t catch them,\u201d says Farokhzad, who helped start Seer, a biotech firm, in 2017 to spin off his academic research into marketable protein tests. \u201cBut to sophisticated machine-learning algorithms, these things pop out like daylight.\u201d Once algorithms have identified these fingerprints, researchers can use them to develop tests like the one I took for my heart.\n\n\u201cDiagnostic medicine has always been about proteins,\u201d says Philip Ma, Seer\u2019s president and chief business officer. \u201cAll proteomics is allowing you to do is to look at them in bunches instead of one at a time.\u201d\n\nLarry Gold, a founder of SomaLogic, has wispy white hair and a bushy mustache, making him look a bit like Mark Twain. \u201cWe got our unicorn status,\u201d he said, when we met at his office in June, modeling a knit cap with a rainbow-banded horn protruding from its crown. \u201cI guess that\u2019s kind of a big deal.\u201d The designation is given to privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion. He was wearing bluejeans and a long-sleeve black T-shirt, and he has 30 more identical ones that he keeps stacked in a drawer and in regular rotation. \u201cI don\u2019t care what I look like,\u201d Gold said. \u201cBut I have a dress-up outfit somewhere in my closet for raising money.\u201d\n\nLarry Gold at SomaLogic in Boulder. Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times\n\nGold, who is 77, moved to Boulder after securing a professorship at the University of Colorado, a few years after earning a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Connecticut. He ran his own lab \u2014 now adjacent to the 111,905-square-foot Gold Biosciences Building \u2014 and still teaches there occasionally. During the 1980s, one of his graduate students was a scientist named Craig Tuerk, currently a biochemistry professor at Morehead State University in Kentucky. At the time, there were several available methods to determine the presence of a single type of protein, among them the use of antibodies, which Gold and Tuerk were familiar with. A protein of interest can be injected into an animal, like a mouse, whereupon its immune system will make antibodies to fight the invading molecule. These \u201cbinding antibodies\u201d attach themselves like Lego bricks to the protein, which becomes easier to spot as a result. The mouse antibodies are subsequently harvested for research and can be used to develop diagnostic screenings.\n\nIn 1989, four years after joining Gold\u2019s lab, Tuerk was conducting research for his Ph.D. thesis on viral DNA. While experimenting with a type of virus that infects bacteria, Tuerk noticed that strands from the virus\u2019s RNA had somehow bound themselves to specific proteins. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids. What Tuerk had discovered accidentally was a way to identify immense numbers of proteins at once with nucleic acids instead of antibodies, using a molecule found on both DNA and RNA called an aptamer. It was a momentous breakthrough. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start dancing because we were being science-y types,\u201d Gold said. They did, however, immediately begin drafting a patent, which Gold stayed up all night to write. The next evening, a biotech entrepreneur named David Brunel invited Gold over for Thanksgiving dinner. \u201cI fell asleep on the floor of David\u2019s house,\u201d Gold said. \u201cPeople were walking over me.\u201d\n\nBrunel later invested in SomaLogic, and Gold has put at least $20 million of his own money into the firm, made from the sale of two companies he founded previously. At his venture before SomaLogic, during the early 1990s, Gold helped develop the first F.D.A.-approved aptamer-derived medication, for macular degeneration, which had roughly $200 million in sales in its first year on the market. But even then, Gold had bigger plans for aptamers \u2014 to use them to analyze proteins on an unprecedented scale. He would glean patterns from the data that could diagnose diseases. It was possible to do the same thing with antibodies, but that would require luck and patience, like trying to catalog every fish in the ocean with a net that captured only a single species at a time. And even then, in those years \u2014 right about the time when Marc Wilkins, a graduate student at Macquarie University in Australia, coined the word \u201cproteomics\u201d \u2014 it might have taken months for researchers to make sense of the voluminous data. Proteins are folded into intricate three-dimensional structures. Mapping one was challenging enough; mapping thousands was all but unmanageable.\n\n\u201cAntibodies are used mostly to measure one protein,\u201d Gold said. \u201cThey would never scale to what I thought proteomics would have to do to make it significant in health care\u201d \u2014 that is, generate information quickly and cheaply enough to be practical for doctors to use in daily clinical practice. \u201cI had this idea that if you measured enough proteins, you\u2019d be able to get insights into human biology that were hard to get any other way.\u201d\n\nSOMAscan is the manifestation of his vision. It\u2019s a twofold technology platform, combining machine learning with a chemical process to isolate 5,000 proteins from a single drop of blood. Williams says this scan has found fingerprint-like patterns for more than 50 diseases, including lung and pancreatic cancer, both notorious for their dismal survival rates.\n\nWhat these fingerprints convey can be grouped into three categories: probability (your odds of getting sick), current state (you\u2019re already sick but don\u2019t know it) and trajectory (how soon you\u2019ll get worse). \u201cThere are patterns that do each of these jobs,\u201d Williams told me, adding that his ultimate goal is to find all these patterns, for any condition, in a single scan, and also measure whether they change in response to lifestyle improvements or medication.\n\nProteomics has faced something of a chicken-or-egg dilemma. Doctors won\u2019t embrace the technology until they are sure that protein screenings provide reliable results, but improving reliability is largely contingent on widespread adoption. Put another way, the greater the number of patients who are tested, the more accurate the fingerprints become.\n\nBefore it had patients whose proteins it could analyze, SomaLogic began building its disease database with biobanks, which store frozen blood and tissue for research. Using specimens from these repositories \u2014 the ones at the National Institutes of Health and many research hospitals are made accessible to scientists \u2014 the company began to hone its machine-learning algorithm, training it to search for key protein configurations. Donors to biobanks are anonymous, but their health data is not. By cross-indexing newly identified protein patterns with medical histories, researchers might find a new disease fingerprint in a subset of donors who had liver cancer, for example. SomaLogic can duplicate or confirm these findings by scanning different samples and using different biobanks, which the company is doing now.\n\nA box of samples in a deep cold freezer at SomaLogic. Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times\n\nIdeally, SomaLogic would run blinded trials, the gold standard for validating new medical drugs and diagnostics. But there is an ethical obstacle to doing so. SomaLogic typically focuses on a single disease when it\u2019s evaluating a disease fingerprint in a real-world setting, which is what Gold enlisted Trujillo to do with the heart test back in 2016. For a blinded trial, Trujillo would have had to randomly select some of his patients with a high-risk fingerprint and then \u2014 without informing them of the looming threat \u2014 wait to see if they had a heart attack.\n\nTrujillo\u2019s work is limited to his patient pool, about 180 people so far. But SomaLogic\u2019s continuing studies typically entail thousands of patients, whose proteomes are sampled and tracked longitudinally. In lieu of a trial, SomaLogic is able to confirm data retrospectively. Over the span of, say, a lung-cancer study, some people in the cohort will get other ailments. If one of those subjects in the lung cancer study develops diabetes, for instance, SomaLogic can check whether she carried the fingerprint for that disease when her blood was drawn years earlier.\n\nOnce a fingerprint is found, it can still need refining. The cardiovascular test from SomaLogic intrigued Robert Gerszten, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and also a Harvard Medical School professor. Gerszten had patients with a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to thicken abnormally. It can be treated by medically inducing a heart attack, which thins the affected tissue. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few examples where you know the person is going to have a big heart attack,\u201d Gerszten says. He sampled blood from his patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy both before and after the procedure, as well as from people who\u2019d had ordinary heart attacks.\n\nNot only did Gerszten find proteins that matched with those that SomaLogic had identified, but he also came across ones never previously tied to cardiovascular health. \u201cWe found dozens and dozens of new proteins that no one had discovered,\u201d he says. While Gerszten had helped validate that protein-screening panels could presage heart attacks, he also illustrated that the underlying biology was remarkably more complicated.\n\nOther factors also hinder proteomic investigation. One is a statistical anomaly known as \u201coverfitting,\u201d which happens when trying to match a disease that involves scads of proteins with too few patients. As LaBaer puts it, \u201cThere is a chance you\u2019re going to find a set of markers that look real but are not.\u201d Another is the tendency of proteins to interact with other molecules and change after they\u2019re formed, a process known as post-translational modification. \u201cThere is a landscape of these modifications \u2014 a real zoo of molecules \u2014 most of which we don\u2019t understand what their effect is,\u201d says Steven Carr, senior director of proteomics at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard. Scientists don\u2019t always know whether it\u2019s the actual proteins or the modified ones that are associated with trouble. Nor can they be sure if a blood test is necessarily distinguishing between these two protein structures \u2014 one of which may be malicious and the other benign \u2014 or even capable of detecting certain modified proteins at all. \u201cNot everyone who has these proteins might get that disease,\u201d Carr says. \u201cAnd some who have the disease might not have that particular form of proteins.\u201d\n\nSomaLogic\u2019s hunt for proteins starts in a sparse room at its headquarters, in eight-foot-tall upright freezers set to minus 80 degrees Celsius. They are filled with small trays holding dozens of inch-long plastic tubes, each containing a drop of serum (the clear liquid remaining after clotting compounds are removed from blood). At any given time, there are approximately 300,000 samples on site, stored in 13 freezers. Technicians oversee robotic arms programmed to add aptamers to the samples, with a fluorescent light-refracting tag. (SomaLogic has engineered 5,000 aptamers and rechristened them SOMAmers.) After more robotic juggling, the serum solution from the tubes is placed onto glass slides, and an imaging device measures the light intensity passing through the fluorescent substance to assess which proteins are present and in what concentrations. It\u2019s here that the biological information is converted into digital data.\n\nIt takes 30 hours to acquire protein data from one sample, and the lab processes about 680 a day. The raw data \u2014 totaling some four million protein measurements every 24 hours \u2014 is fed into machine-learning algorithms, which are revised constantly based on the various disease patterns they\u2019re interested in investigating.\n\nWhile allocating most resources to the big three \u2014 cancer, heart disease and diabetes \u2014 SomaLogic also is delving into realms that traditionally haven\u2019t been studied with proteomics, such as smoking, social deprivation, excessive alcohol consumption and fitness. There are hundreds of proteins common among tobacco smokers, which Williams speculates could be used to expose those suspected of smoking but who deny it. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst lifestyle health risk you can get,\u201d he says. \u201cBut people lie about it.\u201d\n\nPreparing a solution for the detector. Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times\n\nSomaLogic will commence its first large-scale beta test this year, collaborating with the Leeds Center for Personalized Medicine and Health in England. Williams told me that the project is starting with a diabetes trial, with other diseases to follow. More than one-third of British residents are prediabetic \u2014 meaning that they are not exhibiting symptoms but are at risk of developing the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t want those people to become diabetic,\u201d Williams says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t really know who is susceptible.\u201d\n\nSomaLogic will collect blood samples from patients in Leeds and then zero in on those whose protein fingerprints suggest that diabetes is imminent (the company recently set up a 3,000-square-foot lab in Oxford to process samples). Physicians, in turn, will instruct patients in strategies that have proved to pre-empt the need for diabetic medication, like exercise, weight loss and nutrition counseling. \u201cThe point is that this information may motivate people straightaway,\u201d Williams says.\n\nGold wants SOMAscan to eventually evolve into something he calls the \u201cwellness chip,\u201d a do-it-all protein screening to replace annual physicals, which several studies have suggested rarely benefit health. In May, at an annual health care and science symposium that Gold hosts at the University of Colorado, SomaLogic\u2019s chief corporate strategist, Mark Messenbaugh, displayed a slide during his lecture that showed a toilet equipped with a SOMAscan chip and captioned: \u201cOur Ultimate Goal \u2014 SOMAwhiz.\u201d He wasn\u2019t joking. Williams confirmed later that the company is adapting its technology for \u201ca noninvasive home-collected urine test\u201d to look for many of the same disease fingerprints found by SOMAscan.\n\nEventually, SomaLogic hopes to sell its blood and urine scans directly to consumers, for as little as $100 per test, Gold says. But there is a fear percolating among some scientists and health care providers about what patients will do with the data. Will they demand treatment from their doctors based solely on a proteomic scan? More important, will their doctors comply?\n\n\u201cThere are consequences to these measurements,\u201d Carr says. \u201cThere are interventions taken, drugs people are put on, additional testing. That costs money, and it raises the anxiety level of those being tested. So you damn well better be sure you\u2019re measuring what you say you\u2019re measuring \u2014 and know that it matters \u2014 before you employ it in a clinical setting.\u201d\n\nWhen my results came back from SomaLogic, a month after my blood was drawn, they told me that I had an 11 percent chance of experiencing a cardiac event within five years \u2014 more than three times as high as what the coronary calcium scan and associated algorithm had forecast. Trujillo insisted that I immediately start taking a statin drug to halt further plaque buildup.\n\nBecause proteins react to external inputs, Trujillo asked everyone who got the heart screening to redo it one year later. From what we know about the proteome, any actions taken to prevent a heart attack \u2014 dietary improvements, exercise, medications \u2014 should nudge the odds lower. For now, it\u2019s too early to draw conclusions from Trujillo\u2019s follow-up data. But, he says, \u201cthe results have really allowed me to personalize care. They have motivated people to change their lifestyle or take medication.\u201d\n\nI told Gold that my anniversary date for the heart test was approaching and that I would soon be providing a second blood sample to Trujillo. He warned me that my risk might not fall precipitously, as evolving proteomic research is showing that cardiovascular disease, like so many other ailments, is a more intricate biological puzzle than once thought. The results from my second test confirmed as much: I did not drop a single percentage point. I had spent a year on statins, mostly eliminated red meat from my diet and added high-intensity interval training to my workouts. I also did a five-day fast that Trujillo recommended for reducing inflammation \u2014 a well-known contributor to heart disease \u2014 and in the course of it lost eight pounds. None of it appeared to help.\n\nTrujillo was untroubled. \u201cMy work has led to a page of questions as it relates to how to use this test going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it God\u2019s word? Not even close. It\u2019s just part of the armamentarium.\u201d Trujillo reckoned that fathoming the proteome might spawn new mysteries while solving others.\n\nGold echoed a similar sentiment when we talked. \u201cWe know more about the proteome here than anyone on earth, and we think it\u2019s a treasure trove of understanding human biology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t lie about it. The science is hard \u2014 harder than I thought.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "TESS TAYLOR", "title": "Not Burned, but Suffocated", "description": "On a hiking trail in the Oakland hills, the normally stunning views were obscured by smoke in the Bay Area on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/opinion/environment/fire-california-air-quality-children-masks-smoke.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/15/opinion/15TAYLOR03/15TAYLOR03-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:08:04Z", "content": "So, we wait, our lives cloistered, partially on pause.

But it is sometimes very hard to watch the world go about its business as if nothing ever happened, when there\u2019s a whole group of people who are suffering in relative silence and watching the rest of the world be happy and get rich. \u2014 Roger Johnson\n\nWe Serve Our Nation Out of Uniform, as We Did Before\n\nI am a combat veteran who, by virtue of my role in health care, saw the impact of violence and war every day I was deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have PTSD, yet I have an incredibly meaningful life after service without issues of violence. I have many friends who have served as well and who also have PTSD. We continue to serve our nation out of uniform, as we did before. Many of us have shifted to saying \u201cPTS\u201d and removing the \u201cD\u201d to eliminate the \u201cdisorder\u201d and move to the cause of the stress. That\u2019s a simple but practical example that anyone can do to take a stigma and help eliminate it. \u2014 Richard Morton, Ponte Vedra, Fla.\n\nWe Are Just as Human as You Are\n\nI see no connection between the service and violent crime myself, but I can easily see how uninformed people can make that knee-jerk connection. Just because you have familiarity with a tool, people can presume you are prone to using it, and this is not true. We are just as human as you are; we just have a different and more professional experience with life and death, all of us. I talk about what it was I did, particularly the places and events, because those bring meaning to people who have an ability to listen. I draw intentional comparisons between the military and the first responders whom people are around everyday and trust with their safety and security. It\u2019s no different, this relationship, save for the fact that the police, E.M.T.s, doctors and car companies kill far more people than the military does, year in year out. \u2014 Chris McFarland, Toms River, N.J.\n\nI Am Open and Honest About My Experiences\n\nI believe a lot of people see combat veterans as \u201cdamaged goods.\u201d They look at servicemen and servicewomen as a certain warrior class, and once veterans are done with their time in service, they are seen as a liability. I am open and honest about my experiences. My past has made and almost broke me. I have received inpatient mental-health therapy and given speeches with the president of the United States in attendance. I received a diagnosis of PTSD, but with help from the V.A., I was able to work for a United States senator and finish my undergraduate degree. I currently work for the National Park Service, am married, have a beautiful son and am enjoying life. \u2014 Joe Bykowski, Westhampton, Mass."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "SWAHA PATTANAIK", "title": "Breakingviews: To Gauge Concerns About Brexit, Look at British Bonds", "description": "The best sign that investors have had enough of the United Kingdom would be when both its currency and bonds weaken at the same time.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/business/dealbook/brexit-crisis-indicator-bonds.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/17/business/17db-viewsbrexit/17db-viewsbrexit-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:48:25Z", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines and the power-brokers who shape them. __________ The British pound is the most sensitive barometer of Brexit fears.

The clearest sign that investors have had enough of the United Kingdom would be when both weaken at the same time.\n\nBritain\u2019s currency and its government bonds, known as gilts, have tended to react to political turmoil by moving in opposite directions. The pound fell nearly 2 percent against the dollar and euro on Thursday after a string of cabinet resignations cast doubt on the future of Prime Minister Theresa May and her draft Brexit deal. But even as the pound suffered its worst day since Oct. 2016, gilts rallied. The yield, which drops when prices rise, on 10-year UK government bonds fell more than 10 basis points, to as low as 1.35 percent.\n\nEven more telling was that British sovereign debt performed better than German and American alternatives. That would not have been the case if investors had become wary of Britain altogether. The gap between the yield on gilts and German bonds narrowed by roughly 10 basis points on Thursday.

The resort sprawls across 25,000 acres, an area nearly twice the size of Manhattan. A steel beam needed to build an \u201cAvatar\u201d attraction last year was so massive that Disney had to borrow crawler-transporters from NASA.\n\nNow Disney World \u2014 and Disney\u2019s global vacation empire \u2014 is about to get much, much bigger.\n\nWith its television business facing significant challenges in the streaming age, and lots of popular movie franchises to put to use, Disney is spending billions to supercharge its theme park division, which has emerged as a surprisingly strong moneymaker.\n\nDisney\u2019s annual revenue growth % +10 +5 0 Parks Media \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 Disney\u2019s annual revenue growth % +10 +5 0 Parks Media \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 Disney\u2019s annual revenue growth % +10 +5 0 Parks Media \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 Source: Company reports\n\nFor the 2018 fiscal year, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts had an operating profit of $4.5 billion, an increase of more than 100 percent from five years earlier. For comparison, Disney Media Networks, home to ESPN and ABC, had a profit of $6.6 billion, a 3 percent decline.\n\nEach of Disney\u2019s six theme park resorts around the world is undergoing major expansion, along with Disney Cruise Line. Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst, estimates that Disney will spend $24 billion on new attractions, hotels and ships over the next five years. That\u2019s more than Disney paid for Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm combined.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just be special \u2014 it has to be spectacular,\u201d Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s theme park chairman, said during a hard-hat tour of a 14-acre construction site at Disney World where \u201cStar Wars\u201d-themed rides, shops and restaurants were taking shape. Overhead, crews were sculpting spires designed to look like the petrified remnants of once-towering trees on a distant planet.\n\nMr. Chapek called the overall growth plan \u201cenhancement on steroids.\u201d Here is a look at what Disney is doing and why \u2014 along with the risks involved in such an aggressive undertaking:\n\nA worldwide transformation is underway\n\nSpaceship Earth 1 Soarin\u2019 Around the World 5 2 Imagination! 6 3 4 Epcot Lake Buena Vista, Fla. 1. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d roller coaster 2.

Marvel superhero land 2. Pixar Pier (overhauled)\n\nDisney faces an enviable challenge: Even with steady price increases for peak periods \u2014 single-day peak tickets at Disneyland in California now run $135 \u2014 visitor interest often exceeds capacity at some properties. \u201cYou can only let so many people in a park before you start to impede on satisfaction level,\u201d Mr. Chapek said.\n\nSo Disney\u2019s expansion plan is more ambitious than building a \u201cBlack Panther\u201d roller coaster here or introducing an \u201cIncredibles\u201d character there. The goal is transformation \u2014 adding significant capacity to Disney\u2019s most popular parks (Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea) and giving others major upgrades (Epcot, Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris) to help attract visitors more evenly throughout the empire.\n\nSpider-Man will be a centerpiece of a new Marvel-themed ride at the Disneyland Resort. Disney\n\nAn abundance of popular Disney film franchises makes this kind of mega-expansion possible, Mr. Chapek noted. \u201cFrozen\u201d and Marvel rides are coming to multiple resorts.\n\n\u2018Star Wars\u2019 is in a galaxy all its own\n\nInside an interactive Millennium Falcon. Disney\n\nIn terms of attracting crowds and creating excitement, nothing quite compares to the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise.\n\nIn 2019, Disney World and Disneyland will open matching 14-acre \u201clands\u201d called Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge. On one lavish attraction, guests will board an Imperial Star Destroyer, where roughly 50 animatronic stormtroopers await in formation. On another, guests will be able to pilot an interactive Millennium Falcon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personalized intergalactic ride \u2014 live your own \u2018Star Wars\u2019 story,\u201d said Scott Trowbridge, the Disney creative executive overseeing the Galaxy\u2019s Edge projects. \u201cIf you crash into a wall, that\u2019s what you will see out the cockpit window.\u201d\n\nThe Millennium Falcon ride will use real-time video rendering technology invented by Industrial Light & Magic that responds to the way guests use 200 cockpit controls.\n\nIncreased investment means increased risk\n\nThe theme park business will always be sensitive to swings in the economy, said Jessica Reif, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Disney has greatly increased security in recent years, deploying undercover guards and installing metal detectors, but these teeming resorts could become relative ghost towns if a violent incident took place.\n\nEven so, Ms. Reif said she was pleased that Disney was spending so heavily on its parks. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest return on investment that Disney has,\u201d she said.\n\nDisney Cruise Line will also nearly double in size by 2023. Disney has ordered three new ships costing an analyst-estimated $1.25 billion apiece. It is buying 746 acres on a Bahamian island to build a second Caribbean port. (Disney already has one private island port.)\n\nA seventh resort is \u2018an inevitability\u2019\n\nTo set Hong Kong Disneyland apart from its newer counterpart in Shanghai, Disney is adding a new \u201cFrozen\u201d land, where rides will include a \u201cmusical journey\u201d to Elsa\u2019s ice palace and a roller coaster supposedly built by Wandering Oaken, a trader and sauna operator. Disney\n\nRobert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts in May that there was \u201can inevitability\u201d to Disney\u2019s building a seventh theme park resort in China or another country, although he cautioned that no plans were on the horizon.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re going to look,\u201d he said. Mr. Iger\u2019s bullishness reflects the strong response to Shanghai Disneyland, which opened in 2016 at a cost of $5.5 billion. With its growing middle class, China is a particularly important growth market for Disney.\n\nEven so, a couple of Disney\u2019s older overseas parks have never lived up to their promise, and Mr. Iger wants to fix those headaches once and for all. That\u2019s one reason Hong Kong Disneyland is undergoing a $1.4 billion expansion, with half of the bill paid by the local government, which is a co-owner.\n\nThe Hong Kong park, which opened in 2005, has lost money for three years running, in part because of a regional tourism slump. To turn the property around, Disney is adding two \u201cAvengers\u201d-themed attractions; building the entire \u201cFrozen\u201d kingdom of Arendelle, with two icicle-covered rides; and supersizing the park\u2019s castle.\n\nCan\u2019t travel to space? Disney brings it to you\n\nAn immersive \u201cStar Wars\u201d hotel will simulate the experience of staying on a starship. Disney\n\nOne of the most anticipated additions to Disney World is not a ride. It\u2019s a hotel \u2014 one that will have no windows.\n\nThe still-unnamed property, code-named Project Hubble by Disney Imagineering, will simulate what it might be like to sleep on board a luxury \u201cStar Wars\u201d starship as it zooms through the galaxy. Every window will be a video screen offering a \u201cspace view.\u201d Guests will be encouraged to dress in \u201cStar Wars\u201d costumes.\n\nThe hotel reflects a push by Disney to provide more immersive and personalized experiences. Now even your hotel stay becomes an attraction that is \u201cunique to Disney, that you cannot get down the street,\u201d Mr. Chapek said.\n\nHe is applying the same thinking to Disney World transportation. Instead of relying on lumbering buses to get around, for instance, people can now use the Lyft app to hail a polka-dotted S.U.V. called a Minnie Van.\n\nBuilding the future, but living history\n\nDuring the opening of Toy Story Land in June. Scott McIntyre for The New York Times\n\nChange is not always welcomed at Disney parks. \u201cHOW DARE YOU,\u201d one Disneyland annual pass holder wrote in a letter to the company a few years ago in response to some simple tree pruning. \u201cI GOT ENGAGED UNDER THAT TREE.\u201d\n\nBeloved as they may be, these properties are businesses, and Disney must be mindful of relevance. Parents may have a soft spot for Epcot\u2019s creaky, 36-year-old Spaceship Earth ride, but their children \u2014 Disney customers of the future \u2014 most likely do not.\n\n\u201cThe bar for what our guests expect is getting higher,\u201d said Bob Weis, president of Imagineering, Disney\u2019s theme park design division.\n\nThe relevance factor is one reason that Disney has built so many \u201cToy Story\u201d attractions in recent years.\n\nA 360-degree view of Toy Story Land. Scott McIntyre for The New York Times\n\nWoody and crew are continuously freshened by new films; \u201cToy Story 4\u201d is set for release on June 21.

Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it?\n\nWhen news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, \u201cI\u2019d call those branch offices.\u201d It\u2019s a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage.\n\nAnd Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. \u201cWe know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth,\u201d Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. \u201cWe are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I\u2019m on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us.\u201d\n\nHow that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon\u2019s growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That\u2019s a mix of the technical and creative work that\u2019s already thriving in the city.\n\nMany had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win.\n\nBut Amazon\u2019s agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state\u2019s goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s vision there?"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Kaya Laterman", "title": "The Latest Trends in Home Security", "description": "New technology lets you use your cellphone to buzz people into your building or turn off the stove.

But to the union, Mr. Goodell\u2019s real job is using the shield to keep players a safe distance from the owners who pay his salary; his compensation can rise to $40 million a year with incentives.\n\nWhat frustrates Mr. Winston is that, to fans, N.F.L. labor disputes are seen as a greedy fight between two comparably rich sides over who gets more of the pie \u2014 and that historically, the league has swayed most fans to side with owners in the name of team spirit. To Mr. Winston, those fans are wrong in a fundamental way: Including retired players, most N.F.L.ers are not rich, and won\u2019t ever get rich from the game. Players drafted after the first two rounds each get the same basic contract: four years, non-guaranteed, escalating from a base salary of $480,000 in year one to $705,000 in year four. Sixty percent of the athletes in the league make the minimum salary.\n\nThe second contract is when players cash in. But that\u2019s the thing about the N.F.L.: the one-two punch of inevitable injuries and non-guaranteed contracts means that most players never get to a second deal. The average N.F.L. career lasts just over three seasons , and players don\u2019t see it as a coincidence that the standard initial term is set at four. (Nor that players don\u2019t qualify for a pension until they complete the third game of their fourth season.) The typical rookie can expect to make around $1.4 million before he\u2019s done, and before agents and accountants take their cut. Then he\u2019s out of football and unemployed by the time he\u2019s 25."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "LELA MOORE", "title": "Driving Through Flames, Breathing Through Blankets: 9 Tales From Californians Who Fled the Wildfires", "description": "We asked readers for their stories of evacuating from the wildfires ravaging California.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/reader-center/california-wildfires-escape.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/15/insider/15rc-wildfires1/merlin_146800815_75ab23fd-8e87-4352-8534-8b0776d2e4e7-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:00:16Z", "content": "Taran March, 65, fled the Camp Fire on Thursday, Nov. 8.

There\u2019s a freaky tween girl sleeping in his office until he can find a safe place for her and an opossum with a urinary tract infection residing in one of his desk drawers. Phoebe is both intrigued and repulsed by Heist. Having seen movies, you will recognize this as the prelude to soulful sex in the detective\u2019s sketchy trailer.\n\nImage\n\nLethem\u2019s chief metaphor in \u201cThe Feral Detective\u201d finds the \u201cwild edge\u201d of Los Angeles \u2014 i.e., the city\u2019s proximity to the ocean and mountains \u2014 standing in for all that\u2019s volatile and unknown beneath the surface of society. An acquaintance of Phoebe\u2019s announces this theme in neon: \u201cYou can feel the civilization as this kind of thin layer that\u2019s just been troweled onto the landscape. It\u2019s, like, everything\u2019s provisional.\u201d (That\u2019s a Didion-esque passage, of course; she hovers overs this novel like an archangel.) Phoebe shadows Heist on an ugly, downward-spiraling search for Arabella. They question dispossessed men and women living in tunnels, stumble on a ritualistic double murder atop Mount Baldy and descend into the thick of two tense, nomadic tribes in the desert. One tribe, called the Rabbits, is largely female and vegan; the other, the Bears, has more of a Hells Angels vibe. The plot is high on incident but feels meandering and oddly tension-less for the first half of the book. And Phoebe \u2014\n\nPhoebe can be a problem. She\u2019s our guide and conscience, yet Lethem colors her character in so slowly that she\u2019s on the edge of a breakdown before we can grasp who she is. Phoebe is sarcastic and occasionally vulgar. She makes dangerous choices. She loathes Heist for his taciturn masculinity, then yearns to jump him again: \u201cI wanted to slap him, but I might have damaged the tender flesh of my hand on his die-cut features, his Brillo sideburns.\u201d At times, she seems less like somebody destabilized by the new political order and more like somebody tapering off Zoloft. It\u2019s not a sexist portrayal, but in a blind taste test you would know that this book was written by a man. Phoebe appears to be a mouthpiece for Lethem\u2019s own rage, and she\u2019s not an especially convincing portrait of a woman. It\u2019s not enough to have her use the word \u201cmenstrual\u201d and read Elena Ferrante.\n\nAs for the feral detective, he\u2019s an enigma by design. The true mystery of the novel is not what became of Arabella (which proves anticlimactic), but who Charles Heist is and how his life story intersects with the history of the Rabbits and Bears. Phoebe tries to plumb the detective\u2019s depths with both charm and fury, but she\u2019s out of her element: \u201cSoon Heist was silent while I railed at him, amid empty hills born to swallow human language, carved by time to make my protests small.\u201d\n\nHalfway through the novel, Lethem just about switches genres on us as Phoebe and Heist are drawn into a gladiatorial battle in the desert involving the Bear clan and its throne. Lethem has taken us so far from the liberal bubble so fast that you\u2019ve either got to go with it or go home. Go with it. Even the author seems to know that he\u2019s pushed the plot over the top because he punctures the savagery with humor, as when Phoebe screams at the Bears watching the fight, telling them they\u2019re insane and demanding to know if they even voted. At its best, though, \u201cThe Feral Detective\u201d is a worthy morality play about our warring impulses for conflict and comfort. It asks who we are when we lose, or cast away, everything that was propping us up."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "DAN SALTZSTEIN", "title": "Q&A: \u2018It\u2019s Almost Three Years Since I Had a Proper Vacation\u2019", "description": "Ren\u00e9 Redzepi has opened what fans call Noma 2.0 after pop-ups in Mexico, Australia and Japan brought the restaurateur even more acclaim in the food world.

Ninety-nine percent of the time hearing the actual song or going to the actual concert is far more revealing than any paragraph describing it. But Jackson pulls off this near-impossible feat, pulling the reader past the velvet ropes into the black-box theaters and sweaty, sticky-floored stadiums.\n\nThe book opens with a prelude, the narrator setting the stage, so to speak, for what\u2019s to come. \u201cThe strip-mall goths, the mod metalheads, the blue-collar ravers \u2026 the jaded aesthetes who consider themselves beyond category. Everyone in line has imagined a night that could crack open and transform their dreary realities. This is it.\u201d\n\nThe prose can feel as cool as Rat Pack-era Sinatra and as sad as Lou Reed singing about a perfect day: \u201cI was terrified that I might lose him, the one person I loved, my deepest connection to this rotten planet.\u201d For all his insider knowledge and passion for music, Jackson is also at ease writing about the odd details of the everyday. There are confused kids and silent strangers in restaurants, funerals and forests. As Eddie and Xenie try to connect during a walk at nightfall, \u201cthe evening keeps losing texture. \u2026 She finds she\u2019s enlivened by the darkness that erases their expressions and absorbs their gestures. There\u2019s only the tenor of their voices to navigate, and this makes it easier to talk.\u201d\n\nWhy the violence keeps happening is the mystery burning beneath the novel, predatory and seductive as a Kendrick Lamar bass line. Jackson presents the novel like a vinyl record, with an A-side and a B-side. Shaun gives us the keys to this setup by confessing: \u201cI prefer the B-sides. They\u2019re the tunes where the bands bury their secrets.\u201d\n\nSo too with Jackson\u2019s own B-side, which contains revelations previously hidden on the reverse side of the narrative. Minor themes are repeated, magnified, rephrased. Do the killers act as a means of control, to intertwine their lives with the band\u2019s, as Chapman did with Lennon? Do they see themselves as the singer onstage, the act of murder a desire to silence themselves?\n\nOr are these strikes the result of our everyone-is-a-star culture, in which these characters\u2019 world is so saturated with bands and lyrics and melodies that, Xenie reflects, \u201cthe music didn\u2019t sound like anything\u201d any longer? Has music making become so widespread that it\u2019s been diluted of its power to transcend?

It was made in a recently unsealed filing in an apparently unrelated sex-crimes case charging a man named Seitu Sulayman Kokayi with coercing and enticing an underage person to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Mr. Kokayi was charged in early August, and on Aug. 22, prosecutors filed a three-page document laying out boilerplate arguments for why his case at that time needed to remain sealed.\n\nWhile the filing started out referencing Mr. Kokayi, federal prosecutors abruptly switched on its second page to discussing the fact that someone named \u201cAssange\u201d had been secretly charged, and went on to make clear that this person was the subject of significant publicity, lived abroad and would need to be extradited \u2014 suggesting that prosecutors had inadvertently pasted text from a similar court filing into the wrong document and then filed it.\n\n\u201cAnother procedure short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nThey added, \u201cThe complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has been studying how to charge Mr. Assange or WikiLeaks with some kind of criminal offense since the site began publishing its trove of secret military and diplomatic documents. Prosecutors, for example, toyed with the idea of charging Mr. Assange as a conspirator in Ms. Manning\u2019s crime of unauthorized disclosure of secrets related to national defense. And it eventually became public that a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia was investigating people with links to WikiLeaks.\n\nBut even as the Obama administration brought criminal charges in an unprecedented number of leak-related cases, it apparently held back from charging Mr. Assange. Members of the Obama legal policy team from that era have said that they did not want to establish a precedent that could chill investigative reporting about national security matters by treating it as a crime."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": null, "title": "'The Panic Attacks Are Setting In' - New York Times", "description": "New York Times 'The Panic Attacks Are Setting In' New York Times On March 29, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.

His life told a story, often left out of official narratives, in which people can come together to take control of their fates.\n\nImage An undated portrait of Mr. Levitas. Credit Levitas Family\n\nHe was born in Dublin in 1915 to Jewish immigrants who had fled poverty and persecution in the Russian Empire. His relatives who stayed behind would later perish in the Holocaust. Max was the eldest of six children, five of whom survived into adulthood. His father worked as a tailor\u2019s presser and the family lived in slum conditions. They were forced to leave Dublin in 1927 when Max\u2019s father was blacklisted by the city\u2019s sweatshop owners for his trade union activism. The whole family was political: Max\u2019s brother Maurice was also a union activist, and even volunteered for the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nMax left school at the age of 12 to work in the tailoring industry, and he threw himself into the labor movement as a teenager, joining the Young Communist League. He remained a Communist throughout his life. \u201cIt was never an issue to forge a Communist state like in the Soviet Union,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2011. \u201cWe wanted to ensure that the ordinary working people of England could lead decent lives \u2014 not to be unemployed, that people weren\u2019t thrown out of homes when they couldn\u2019t pay their rent.\u201d\n\nMuch of his campaigning centered on housing: In 1939, he organized a rent strike in his tenement block that lasted 21 weeks \u2014 and would introduce him to Sadie, whom he married two years later. In 1940, during the Blitz, he led an occupation of the Savoy Hotel to protest the lack of air-raid shelters for people in the East End \u2014 a campaign credited for the government\u2019s subsequent decision to let people shelter in London Underground stations.\n\nAs a wave of radicalism swept Britain in 1945, Mr. Levitas was one of 10 Communist candidates elected to his borough council. He remained a councilor for 17 years \u2014 and when I first met him in 2012, he was still able to point out housing estates that had been built as a result of local campaigns. Two years after our meeting, he was still at it, leading a delegation from his apartment block to protest unfair charges for repair work. \u201cHe still spoke with all the fire of the young man at Cable Street,\u201d one of his neighbors recalled. \u201cIt was astonishing, and none of the officials present dared to challenge him.\u201d He was 99 at the time."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "By MELANIE BISHOP", "title": "I Would Have Driven Her Anywhere", "description": "Caring for a mother who suffers from dementia was really hard.

A quick Twitter search leads Dee Dee and Barry to the perfect object for their insincere concern: a 17-year-old lesbian whose high school won\u2019t let her bring a girl to the prom. (The theater executive Jack Viertel came up with the idea after reading about several similar cases, including one in Mississippi in 2010.) Dragging along their exasperated press agent, the four vain actors hitch a ride to Indiana with a bus-and-truck tour of \u201cGodspell,\u201d hoping to rekindle their careers by wowing the \u201cJesus jumping losers and their inbred wives\u201d into submission.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna help that little lesbian,\u201d Barry sings, \u201cwhether she likes it or not.\u201d\n\nLike segregation in \u201cHairspray\u201d \u2014 or, for that matter, racism in \u201cSouth Pacific\u201d \u2014 anti-gay intolerance offers a comfortable target and a teachable moment.

Emma, the girl at the center of the storm, turns out to be a perfectly adjusted young woman with no satirical qualities except in her wardrobe.

Though smartly played by Caitlin Kinnunen, and provided with intolerant parents we never meet, the character as written is something of a blank.\n\nThat seems strategic to me. The lovely romantic ballads Emma is given to sing, with titles like \u201cDance With You\u201d and \u201cUnruly Heart,\u201d are completely anodyne \u2014 or would be if it weren\u2019t for the context, which turns them into breakthroughs.\n\nBut the other Indianans are blurrier, as if the authors couldn\u2019t quite decide how much ribbing they could take.

While the intended target survived the attack, some of his gunmen and several bystanders did not.\n\nThe following year, Mr. Arellano Fel\u00edx sought vengeance. In one of the most storied murders in Mexican history, Cardinal Juan Jes\u00fas Posadas Ocampo was killed in 1993 at an airport in Guadalajara. And in court on Thursday, Mr. Zambada claimed Mr. Arellano Fel\u00edx was to blame. He testified that the trafficker had personally killed the cardinal accidentally while trying to murder Mr. Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nIt took another decade for the bloody circle to finally be closed. In Feb. 2002, Mr. Arellano Fel\u00edx was stopped by the authorities in the Pacific Coast resort of Mazatl\u00e1n. A firefight ensued, and the Tijuana drug lord fled toward a hotel. But before he got there, someone put a bullet in his neck.\n\nMexican officials later blamed the death on the police, but Mr. Zambada, in another courtroom shock, testified on Thursday that the officers who killed Mr. Arellano-Fel\u00edx were working with the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nMr. Guzm\u00e1n was thrilled by the death of his antagonist, he said.\n\n\u201cIf anything had really given him pleasure,\u201d Mr. Zambada told the jury, \u201cit was to have killed Ram\u00f3n Arellano.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ELLEN BARRY", "title": "At Brexit Crunch Time, Theresa May Takes a Pummeling", "description": "The prime minister, who took office with the sole aim of negotiating her country\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, may not stay in power long enough to finish the job.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/world/europe/brexit-theresa-may.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/world/16may/16may-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:24:46Z", "content": "Even if Mrs. May survives an attempt by rebels within her own party to oust her, she now seems unlikely to win parliamentary approval for her agreement.

The next day, shortly after the hearing ended, NTK Network posted another story highlighting Mr. Rubio\u2019s criticism of Google during the hearing.\n\nThose pieces were just two of at least 11 negative items NTK has posted about Google since late March, including an article questioning why Mr. Zuckerberg needed to testify to Congress at another hearing earlier in the year but a Google executive did not.\n\nLike the documents on the senators, Definers distributed other memos that sought to lay out evidence for angles that it wanted reporters to pursue. The memos were typically based on public information like press clippings and social media posts.\n\nDefiners urged reporters to explore the financial ties between Mr. Soros and Freedom From Facebook, a coalition of groups that had criticized the company.

Some former inmates, like Ms. Mota, don\u2019t bother applying, Ms. Katcher said. Some fire departments also bar people with certain criminal backgrounds from becoming firefighters, she said.\n\nFor example, the fire department in Bakersfield, a city of more than 380,000 people in Southern California, said it disqualified applicants who have been convicted of a felony. In the Los Angeles County Fire Department, felonies and some misdemeanors are grounds for disqualification, said Capt.

And they pointed to countries with low corporate taxes, like Ireland, which appear to attract lots of foreign investment.\n\nThe key word here is, however, \u201cappear.\u201d Corporations do have a strong incentive to cook their books \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, manage their internal pricing \u2014 in such a way that reported profits pop up in low-tax jurisdictions, and this in turn leads on paper to large overseas investments.\n\nBut there\u2019s much less to these investments than meets the eye. For example, the vast sums corporations have supposedly invested in Ireland have yielded remarkably few jobs and remarkably little income for the Irish themselves \u2014 because most of that huge investment in Ireland is nothing more than an accounting fiction.\n\nNow you know why the money U.S. companies reported moving home after taxes were cut hasn\u2019t shown up in jobs, wages and investment: Nothing really moved. Overseas subsidiaries transferred some assets back to their parent companies, but this was just an accounting maneuver, with almost no impact on anything real.\n\nSo the basic result of lower taxes on corporations is that corporations pay less in taxes \u2014 full stop. Which brings me to the problem with conservative economic doctrine.\n\nThat doctrine is all about the supposed need to give the already privileged incentives to do nice things for the rest of us. We must, the right says, cut taxes on the wealthy to induce them to work hard, and cut taxes on corporations to induce them to invest in America.\n\nBut this doctrine keeps failing in practice.

Tax cuts in Kansas didn\u2019t jump-start the state\u2019s economy; tax hikes in California didn\u2019t slow growth.\n\nAnd with the Trump tax cut, the doctrine has failed again.
