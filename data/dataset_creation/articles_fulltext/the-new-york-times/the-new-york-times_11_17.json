Only the most seasoned, qualified member of a cabinet whose average talent level is raised exponentially by his presence.\n\nMattis, who subsequently told reporters that he doesn\u2019t belong to either political party, has stuck with Trump for what seem to be the best reasons. More than his predecessors, the president needs competent, even-keeled people around him, and there\u2019s no surfeit of A-list takers for even the administration\u2019s highest-ranking jobs. The working environment leaves something to be desired. So does the boss.\n\nBut there\u2019s a fine line between taming the president and enabling him \u2014 between tempering the way he governs and implicitly validating it. To stand beside him is to signal assent. To gloss over his motives is to launder them. And that\u2019s what Mattis did during his visit to the troops, who no doubt yearned to hear that their presence made sense but could be told that only if Mattis lied for the president and to all of us.\n\nOr fibbed, at least. Misdirected. Blabbered. He suggested to the troops that they were really there at the behest of Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, to support the Border Patrol. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that her people do all the work, but we\u2019re standing behind them as a confidence builder, and that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nA confidence builder? That sort of thing? He couldn\u2019t hide the dubiousness of their charge even as he tried to sell it. \u201cA moral and ethical mission\u201d was how he described it to the journalists who accompanied him.

We found stark differences in attitudes across groups: For example, only 1 percent of progressive activists, but 97 percent of devoted conservatives, approve of Donald Trump\u2019s performance as president.\n\nFurthermore, our results discovered a connection between core beliefs and political views. Consider the core belief of how safe or threatening you feel the world to be. Forty-seven percent of devoted conservatives strongly believed that the world was becoming an increasingly dangerous place. By contrast, only 19 percent of progressive activists held this view.\n\nIn turn, those who viewed the world as a dangerous place were three times more likely to strongly support the building of a border wall between the United States and Mexico, and twice as likely to view Islam as a national threat. By contrast, those who did not see the world as dangerous were 50 percent more likely to believe that people were too worried about terrorism and 50 percent more likely to believe that immigration was good for America.\n\nAnother significant finding concerned people\u2019s views on personal responsibility. It may come as no surprise that 86 percent of progressive activists believed that \u201cpeople\u2019s outcomes in life are determined largely by forces outside of their control,\u201d whereas 98 percent of devoted conservatives believed \u201cpeople are largely responsible for their own outcomes in life.\u201d But what is notable is that those who believe the former were twice as likely to favor increasing the government safety net, 25 percent more likely to believe that America had a moral obligation to accept refugees and about 35 percent more likely to believe that gender-based differences in pay were a result of sexism.\n\nA third core belief dividing liberals and conservatives was parenting philosophy.

China\u2019s admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was meant to integrate the country into the global trading system as an increasingly responsible world power. But after moving mostly in the right direction under Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, China stalled under Hu Jintao and has moved backward under Xi.\n\nChina has stolen technology and intellectual property even as it has become more aggressive militarily in the South China Sea and curbed freedom at home. Xi offends global values by detaining more than one million Muslims in the Xinjiang region, arresting lawyers and Christians, and steadily squeezing out space for free thought. I used to report from China each year but now find the limits on a journalist visa so onerous that it\u2019s not worthwhile. And I\u2019m supposed to be the lao pengyou, or old friend, of China.\n\nThere are other grounds for American concern about China\u2019s irresponsibility that haven\u2019t received much attention: I estimate that around 20,000 Americans die each year from overdoses of drugs originating from traffickers in China. In particular, two-thirds or more of America's fentanyl, a synthetic opioid far more lethal than heroin, appears to come from China.\n\nIn fairness, China has made some efforts to crack down on the drug trade, but this hasn\u2019t been a priority so long as the traffickers mostly export their fentanyl rather than sell it at home. If the Chinese government pursued drug smugglers the way it crushes dissident Christians, labor activists, lawyers or feminists, those drug exports would end.\n\nAmerica\u2019s business executives used to be strong supporters of a pro-China policy, but they, too, have cooled.

The divisive strike laid bare long simmering tensions within American liberalism over unions, education and race. Almost a half-century later, the evolution in liberal attitudes that the strike symbolized created vulnerabilities that a very different son of Queens, Donald Trump, exploited in his rise to the presidency.\n\nBy the late 1960s, after years of frustration with vicious white resistance to school integration, many African-American leaders supported the creation of a black-controlled local school district in the low-income Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn. The idea was that the district would hire more minority schoolteachers in order to provide role models for students and adopt a curriculum that was culturally affirming.\n\nA firestorm erupted, however, when the local school board (then known as the governing board) sent a telegram to 19 unionized educators indicating that the board \u201cvoted to end your employment in the schools of this district.\u201d The list included 18 white educators and one black teacher, mistakenly included, who was immediately reinstated once the error was discovered. A hearing by a retired African-American judge hired by the board, Francis Rivers, found that there were no credible charges against the teachers. But Rhody McCoy, the Ocean Hill-Brownsville local superintendent, told The New York Times, \u201cNot one of these teachers will be allowed to teach anywhere in the city. The black community will see to that.\u201d To protest the terminations, teachers throughout the city began a series of strikes shutting down the nation\u2019s largest school system from early September through mid-November.\n\nMany wealthier liberals, including Mayor Lindsay and McGeorge Bundy, the president of the Ford Foundation, joined with black activists like Stokely Carmichael in what they saw as an important effort to better the opportunities of black students. They argued that the union was standing in the way of teacher diversity. Two years earlier, Carmichael suggested that integration was \u201ca subterfuge for the maintenance of white supremacy\u201d because it \u201creinforces, among both black and white, the idea that \u2018white\u2019 is automatically better and \u2018black\u2019 is by definition inferior.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MAGGIE HABERMAN", "title": "\u2018We Were Told That He Did Not Play a Role\u2019 in Khashoggi Killing, Trump Says of Saudi Crown Prince", "description": "President Trump said on Saturday that he had not yet been shown C.I.A. intelligence that concludes the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing of a dissident journalist.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/us/politics/trump-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/us/18dc-trump/18dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T16:24:18Z", "content": "Weeks ago, as the White House faced mounting pressure over its response to Mr. Khashoggis death, the president condemned the killing as a bad original concept that was carried out poorly.

The first is due process: such a court can allow people to argue that mistakes have been made, and the court can then publicly explain its final decision. The second virtue is representation: the justices can represent different segments of society, bringing diverse perspectives and expertise to the difficult questions that they must answer. The third virtue is independence: while a legislature debates and passes laws, a court can be insulated from this political process when it interprets those laws and resolves competing legal claims.\n\nThere are good reasons to doubt whether even the United States Supreme Court is an institution that lives up to these ideals. But at the very least there are structures in place that aim to promote these values on the court. On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook is still figuring out how its panel will function. \u201cStarting today,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re beginning a consultation period to address the hardest questions\u201d about \u201chow this will work in practice.\u201d As Facebook \u2014 which operates in many ways like a government when it determines what kinds of speech are allowed \u2014 does so, it should pay attention to the government that already exists."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Ronda Kaysen", "title": "My Apartment Building Has Become a Dormitory.

Those waiting dragged folding chairs, coolers, tents and dog-eared brochures featuring numbered sites that, in just over 24 hours, they could stake a claim to for a $10,000 deposit. The mood, shortly after 8 a.m. one Sunday last November, was festive, ecstatic even. Drinks flowed, pizza appeared, a steel-drum band played into the balmy night. Some neighbors in the 300-person queue liked each other so much that they decided to become actual neighbors, switching their site choices to live closer together. A sense of destiny seemed to guide many of their decisions. Karen Goodwin, 55, a homemaker, had won the exact amount of the down payment a few weeks earlier in a Domino\u2019s sweepstakes. Matt Kelly, 62, a retired firefighter, had been chipping ice off his shingles in Orange County, N.Y., when a chunk broke loose in the shape of the Sunshine State, which he took as a sign.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in a 55-plus community,\u201d Ruth Kelly, 61, a former real estate agent and Matt\u2019s wife, said the following September. The three of us were sitting at a table in the dining room of the home the Kellys had secured on Cool Breeze Drive, a single-family unit with the L-shaped lanai that Ruth had had her eye on. \u201cBeing in real estate, I didn\u2019t think I would do what we did, wait in line for 11 hours. I always told my customers: \u2018Never buy in Phase 1. Never buy sight-unseen.\u2019 I did all of that. But I never once had doubt. Not once did I feel that way. It was meant to be, I really believe that.\u201d\n\nOutside, under an endless blue sky, a parade of trucks bore the trappings of former homes from as far away as Hawaii, Canada and El Salvador to sorbet-colored dwellings with emerald green lawns. At the entrance to the gated enclave, past a \u201cBarkaritaville\u201d dog park, beeping excavators moved dirt around what would soon be a town-square for concerts and dancing, surrounded by a state-of-the-art workout center, a restaurant and a walk-in pool with cabanas and a bar. It was impossible to stand on their cement foundations \u2014 which I had, in fact, done that morning \u2014 and not see a frontier settlement being carved into an expanse of subtropical wetland. The real frontier here, though, was not the surrounding wilderness but a hitherto uncolonized stretch of time: the multiple decades that more and more Americans can expect to live in better and better health after they retire. What will these pioneers do? Who will they become? And how will that, in turn, alter the course of human history?\n\nTo be sure, Margaritaville is not representative of how most of us will spend our retirement years. Fewer than 14 percent of Americans 75 and older occupy some form of senior housing today. Three-quarters of those over 50 say they would prefer not to move at all. And untold numbers of seniors who might need or want to enter an age-restricted or assisted-living community won\u2019t be able to afford to do so; 30 percent of those 65 and older have an annual income below $23,000, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The least-expensive homes in Margaritaville are more than 10 times that, before the monthly association fee of roughly $200 \u2014 and those sums don\u2019t include meals or care. (For statewide comparison, a private room in a skilled-nursing facility has a median cost of $9,000 per month, and in an assisted-living residence, $3,500 per month, according to LeadingAge Florida, an association of elder-care organizations. Continuing-care communities that guarantee all levels of lifetime care on-site have charges that range from $2,500 to $5,400 per month, plus substantial entry fees.)\n\nRhonda Harvey with her Chihuahua, Rusty, on her porch. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nLike all pioneer settlements, however, Margaritaville is not just a place but an idea \u2014 an imagined utopia, in this case inspired by a Jimmy Buffett song\u2019s reference to a frozen cocktail. Historically, such extreme aspirational-lifestyle experiments have had an outsize influence on our cultural imagination: It would be hard to call Jamestown, one cradle of our democracy, a practical project; same goes for the squalid boomtowns of the Gold Rush, which helped define the American dream. What intrigued me about Margaritaville was the specificity of its promise \u2014 a retirement based on music Buffett has described as \u201cdrunken Caribbean rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u201d \u2014 and the fact that it is still under construction. I could actually meet the early colonists as they went about pursuing their vision.\n\nGaining access to Margaritaville as a reporter had not been easy; several feet away, politely pretending not to listen to my conversation with the Kellys, was a Margaritaville brand ambassador and two public relations specialists for Minto Communities, the developer (Latitude Margaritaville is their collaboration). My visit had been approved at the highest corporate levels and my subjects preselected and scheduled in 30-minute time slots. All brands cultivate their image, but building communities for seniors typically requires a special degree of staging. \u201cArchitects are basically set designers,\u201d David Dillard, the president of D2 Architecture, a senior-housing firm, told me. \u201cWe fight to diminish any icons of this being a senior place. We literally hide things. Inside the community \u2014 this is part of our struggle \u2014 you don\u2019t want to see your future.\u201d\n\nOr at least not the part that includes inevitable death, possibly preceded by mental or bodily deterioration. The problem is that in order to avoid considering those eventualities, we tend to avert our collective gaze from the future altogether \u2014 and in doing so, risk missing our opportunity to stage a more enjoyable and meaningful one. Consequently, our concept of senior housing is often dystopic: a quarantining of those who can no longer care for themselves and are of no \u201cuse\u201d to society. To purchase a home in Margaritaville, on the other hand, is to aggressively reimagine the aging process as a ticket to an island paradise, which may prove to be willfully na\u00efve or ingeniously farsighted \u2014 or both.\n\nIf you make it to your 65th birthday in the U.S. today, you can expect about 20 more years and have a good chance at 30. The fastest-growing segment of the population, in fact, is between the ages of 85 and 94. But longevity alone will not transform senior housing, an industry that experts warn is about to experience a revolution for which it is ill prepared. The truly transformative trend is about proportions. The Census Bureau projects that in 2034, for the first time ever, people 65 and older will outnumber those under 18. Americans are living longer and having fewer children, and fewer immigrants are showing up.\n\nResidents of Latitude Margaritaville at the home of Karen and Norm Goodwin. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nA similar demographic shift is underway around the globe, and no one seems to have a solid plan for addressing it. \u201cIt really comes down to two questions: Where are we going to live, and who is going to take care of us?\u201d says Andrew Carle, founding director of the program in senior-housing administration at George Mason University. \u201cThe rapidly aging worldwide population will affect us more than global warming, I think. It\u2019s the seminal event of the 21st century.\u201d As Carle and many others see it, there are only two possible answers, which will need to be deployed in tandem to avoid a social and economic collapse: first, develop technology that will help seniors live independently longer, and second, persuade them to congregate so that they can be cared for more effectively, by humans or robots or both. The latter will be a more difficult sell than it was for those in the \u201csilent generation,\u201d who have been loath to complain as long as they feel reasonably safe and comfortable. Baby boomers came of age in the consumer culture of the 1950s and are comparison shoppers who expect to have agency and choice. \u201cWe\u2019re the same generation that invented 14 flavors of Coca-Cola,\u201d Carle says. \u201cSo we want more flavors. We\u2019ve blown up the portfolio of every product we\u2019ve touched.\u201d\n\nIn addition to senior communities organized around faith, military service and civic fraternities, there are now retirement cruise ships being planned for the superwealthy and floating condos for presale that will go up and down the Mississippi. The Villages, outside Orlando, has 52 golf courses and a new enrichment program that offers courses ranging from scuba diving to current affairs. Increasingly developers are partnering with schools like Duke and the University of Florida; Arizona State University recently broke ground on a 20-story senior-living facility it calls \u201cthe world\u2019s coolest dorm.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of experimentation with models,\u201d Bob Kramer, the founder of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no model that\u2019s really caught on yet.\u201d (A proposed nudist community has fallen through.) But existing facilities have been notoriously slow to innovate. \u201cChange things!\u201d David Dillard says. \u201cSenior housing are sluggards in that respect.\u201d\n\nWhat needs remodeling can be depressingly obvious: Cafeterias and set mealtimes are out; multiple restaurants, from fine dining to deli takeout, are in. But the bigger question is whether redesigning the physical environment where seniors live can redefine the way we experience aging itself. Biologically speaking, we know very little about what aging is or how it works. It isn\u2019t fatal, technically, but in developed countries it is the greatest risk factor for cancer, dementia and heart disease. It is a universal experience across the animal kingdom, one that unfolds uniquely in each individual. And while we think of other life phases as having a particular purpose \u2014 childhood is about growing and learning; adulthood is about procreating and producing \u2014 we have not defined old age as clearly. (In fact, apart from humans, only a few species of cetacean live beyond menopause.) \u201cWe have no shared collective articulation for what later life is for, what the value of living longer is, except not dying,\u201d says Elana Buch, an anthropologist at the University of Iowa who studies aging and labor inequality in the U.S. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any conversations about what the point of it is, so we reproduce it from other parts of life \u2014 doing things you didn\u2019t get to do before.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only so much that polling can tell us about how older people envision their coming decades. In a recent survey, the AARP found that, when it comes to growing old, people 55 and older looked most forward to having free time for family, friends and activities they enjoy; they most feared dementia and losing independence. What older people value in a place to live is much the same as it is for people in other life stages: well-maintained streets and sidewalks, safe parks. All of which seems to suggest a desire to stay connected to their current community \u2014 but says little about what their changing role within that community might be.\n\nNorm and Karen Goodwin. Karen had won the exact amount of the down payment for her home in a Domino\u2019s sweepstakes. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nWhen Jimmy Buffett rang the doorbell of the home on Island Breeze Avenue, he was greeted by Al Murdock, an energetic 89-year-old with a firm handshake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jimmy Buffett,\u201d Jimmy Buffett said.\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d said Al\u2019s wife, Fran, who assumed this was a practical joke.\n\nDespite being the second household to arrive in Latitude Margaritaville, the Murdocks, like many residents, are not Parrotheads, as superfans of Buffett\u2019s music are known. And yet, as the performer\u2019s appearance at their door illustrated, the man and his brand are embedded in the fiber of the place, from the Miami Beach scent floating through the models to the Margaritaville\u00ae Key West\u2122 Frozen Concoction Makers\u00ae that the sales team sets up in every finished home. In fact, Buffett, 71, bought a Bimini model (two beds, 2.5 baths) and was ostensibly calling on his new neighbors (P.R. team in tow). More than anything, I was curious how residents who were not connoisseurs of Buffett\u2019s music had decided to embrace \u2014 quite possibly for the rest of their lives \u2014 such a particular atmosphere. \u201cWe had to downsize,\u201d Fran said. \u201cDidn\u2019t know if it would need to be assisted living. Because I\u2019m 92. People were saying that\u2019s what I need. We looked at some of the places, and you\u2019d see people playing bingo and we thought, That\u2019s not what we want to do.\u201d They happened to drive by the Margaritaville sales center and stopped in on a whim; a greeter showed them around. \u201cWell, he had a sales pitch that you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Fran went on. \u201cAnd the next thing we know, Al\u2019s in line at 3 a.m. waiting to get us a model.\u201d\n\nAl added, \u201cWe wanted to meet more people. In most subdivisions, you know the names of people on both sides and maybe across the street. We know people all over the block and where they came from and the jobs they had. There\u2019s a feeling of neighborhood that I haven\u2019t experienced since I was a kid.\u201d\n\nRuth and Matt Kelly, who moved from Orange County, N.Y, to Margaritaville. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nMore than half of Americans \u2014 young people more so than older people, in fact \u2014 report feeling that \u201cno one knows them well,\u201d a recent Cigna survey suggests. But for baby boomers, according to a new report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, the problem of social isolation has become alarming, thanks to the generation\u2019s inclination to \u201cage in place,\u201d especially in the suburbs. \u201cIn these low-density areas, it\u2019s harder to meet your neighbors by accident, by walking in the neighborhood or bumping into them at a coffee shop,\u201d Jennifer Molinsky, the study\u2019s lead author, told me. And the evidence that social ties improve health for older people is significant: A recent study by the AARP Public Policy Institute and Harvard and Stanford Universities estimated that isolation among older adults costs Medicare an additional $6.7 billion a year.\n\nAll the residents I met shared Al\u2019s desire for a \u201cfeeling of neighborhood\u201d their previous homes lacked. Lana Byer, 71, moved in in April. \u201cEveryone looks out for everyone else,\u201d Byer said. \u201cThat was missing in the place I was living. Frankly, it\u2019s exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s so much better. It\u2019s a joy to get up in the morning.\u201d Byer had owned a court-reporting firm in Pittsburgh and is divorced. In other communities, she felt excluded by married couples, but that has not happened here. \u201cThere were places I\u2019ve lived where, if my daughter didn\u2019t call me, no one would know I was alive,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, they know I\u2019m alive. It\u2019s like living at a resort.\u201d That morning, she\u2019d come from a nutrition group. Later, on her way to paint wine glasses, she planned to stop by happy hour.\n\nI wondered if there was a chance that the feeling of being on a perpetual vacation would get old after a while? \u201cOnly if you do,\u201d she said.\n\nByer is far from the only single woman in Margaritaville. Rhonda Harvey, 62, lost her husband in an accident on Interstate 4 last year. Afterward, her mother, Ethel, 85, moved in. \u201cI had 12 acres,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cNow there\u2019s almost 12 feet between here and the next house.\u201d Harvey works as the chief operating officer of a behavioral health care agency with nearly 900 employees. Ethel, who is home alone during the day, feels safer with a guardhouse and nearby neighbors. Both are from Kentucky, where one of Harvey\u2019s daughters still lives. \u201cIn some ways I think you could say the community that\u2019s intentional here is reminiscent of small towns there where that\u2019s just the way it was,\u201d she said.\n\nEthel McClure and her daughter, Rhonda Harvey. Both are from Kentucky. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nHarvey\u2019s career requires her to understand basic human needs. \u201cIn social work, there are three things for good mental health,\u201d she told me. \u201cSomething to do, something to love, something to hope for.\u201d Harvey plainly had the first two: she worked full time; she loved her family. But what did she hope for?\n\n\u201cThis community fully developing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing we all hope for.\u201d\n\nWhat does a successful community look like? Are its features universal or situational? In \u201cThe Republic,\u201d Plato sketches an ideal city, ruled by a gentle philosopher-king with scant interest in power. It occurred to me that Margaritaville, too, is ruled by a benevolent philosopher. His decrees are painted on driftwood and hung everywhere: \u201cIt\u2019s 5 O\u2019Clock Somewhere,\u201d \u201cLivin\u2019 for the Weekend.\u201d Al Murdock, it turned out, had thought a lot about this iconography. At the turn-in, a Margaritaville sign is affixed to an enormous ladderlike structure \u2014 \u201ca lifeguard tower,\u201d Al said. \u201cIn Jimmy Buffett\u2019s mind, this is an island. It\u2019s a state of mind surrounded by land.\u201d\n\n\u201cAl bought his autobiography,\u201d Fran said. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s getting all this information.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the state of mind Buffett advertises seems purposefully mindless: grab a drink, kick back, relax. But Al read the invitation differently. By way of explanation he gave me two poems he\u2019d written about \u201clatitude\u201d as freedom from expectation and opportunity for change; \u201cparadise\u201d was simply \u201cwhere neighbors help their neighbors/And their differences forgot.\u201d\n\nLana Byer, who moved in in April. In other communities, she felt excluded by married couples, but that has not happened at Margaritaville. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nFor all their paradisal appeal, islands are also isolated. Many researchers and designers I spoke with described a future in which seniors will want to be more integrated with other age groups, not less, and the challenge will be making senior-housing communities, which exclude younger people to create an inclusive place for older people, more porous.\n\n\u201cI go to so many zoning meetings where people will say on the public record, \u2018I don\u2019t want seniors in the center of my community,\u2019 \u201d Max Winters, a planner and designer at Perkins Eastman, said. Winters is in his late 20s; the co-leader of the firm\u2019s senior-housing group, Dan Cinelli, is in his mid-60s. They are encouraging their clients to share square footage with companies like day spas, restaurants and coffee shops that appeal to a wider audience. The physical spaces could be adjusted to accommodate seniors \u2014 the lighting tweaked to reduce glare on thicker glasses, the acoustics tuned for the hard of hearing \u2014 while remaining inviting to millennials, too. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more adult children wanting to visit their parents in those settings,\u201d Cinelli said. \u201cWhereas 20 years ago, it was, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll come get you and take you to a nice restaurant.\u2019 Kids and grandkids want to come because it\u2019s got a good vibe.\u201d\n\nTechnology, meanwhile, is poised to shift how and where care is delivered. At some point, automated cars will let people who are no longer able to drive remain mobile longer. Nicole Werner, an industrial and systems engineer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is preparing to pilot a social platform that would help people caring for a relative at home to organize assistance from a network of friends and relatives without having to ask for it. The software would learn routines and assign tasks automatically. \u201cIf you live in a city and you\u2019re rich, it\u2019s easy,\u201d Werner, who plans to test the platform with people living with dementia in low-income rural and urban households, told me. \u201cDisadvantaged groups have community. You can harness the people around you.\u201d\n\nStill, it will be hard to change how we value old age without changing how we value the labor needed to support it \u2014 which, right now, is being done primarily by immigrant women and women of color for starkly low pay. \u201cThe challenge is we\u2019ve mostly managed longer life spans by inventing low-wage jobs to support older adults, and that\u2019s already failing,\u201d Elana Buch, the anthropologist, says. A partial solution could be personal robots, which at most are a decade away from being able to assist older adults with tasks as delicate and varied as using the bathroom and making tea, says Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Integrated Innovation Institute. \u201cThe beauty of A.I. is it\u2019s affordable by all,\u201d he says. Robots, though, are likely to reveal the degree to which we\u2019ve taken for granted the emotional connection human caregivers provide \u2014 and force us to put a price tag on it.\n\nPlastic cheeseburgers on display at a model home. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nRetailers, too, remain largely unprepared to tap this rapidly expanding market of older adults. The AgeLab at M.I.T. estimates that just 5 to 10 percent of advertising dollars are spent to reach people over 50. \u201cWe never speak of \u2018fun\u2019 with the older consumer,\u201d Joe Coughlin, the lab\u2019s director, says. \u201cBut retirement is a third of adult life.\u201d\n\nIn seeking to understand the desires, not just needs, of older consumers, Latitude Margaritaville seems ahead of the curve. In 2010, Minto, the developer, purchased the remaining buildable land in Sun City Center, Fla., one of the nation\u2019s first age-restricted retirement communities. \u201cThere were residents that had been there for 20-plus years. There are 17,000 households there,\u201d William Bullock, Minto\u2019s Latitude Margaritaville Division president, told me. \u201cIt gave us insight into where the market was headed.\u201d Once the companies announced the Latitude Margaritaville partnership, their database of interested buyers exploded to 150,000, whom they could target with digital surveys, rather than convening a handful of seniors for a focus group behind a two-way mirror. Bullock said: \u201cWe got as granular as asking, \u2018How many concerts do you want a week? Five by the pool and six by the community green.\u2019 \u201d As Stuart Schultz, director of residential community relations for the Daytona site, put it, \u201cOur aim is to give them exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nBut the paradox persists: No one wants to see themselves as old, because of the stigma attached to aging, so products and communities are designed to disguise or ignore the real struggles that accompany aging, thereby reinforcing the idea that those struggles are aberrant or shameful. The residents of Margaritaville often compared their living experience to college, to the amusement of their children. But were they pretending to be young, or refusing to conform to ageist notions about who gets to enjoy what? \u201cHoney, we don\u2019t sit around and drink mint tea,\u201d Byer told her daughter, \u201cWe go to each other\u2019s homes, we dance, we bring hors d\u2019oeuvres.\u201d\n\nThe challenge will most likely be keeping these activities accessible to residents who become less mobile. \u201cNo one wants to die and no one wants to believe they won\u2019t be able to do the things they do now,\u201d Cinelli told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re in senior living and you see somebody who needs help being fed, you want them to go somewhere more appropriate. Seeing someone I used to play cards with needing help, that is fundamentally disturbing.\n\nFran and Al Murdock. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of a neighborhood that I haven\u2019t experienced since I was a kid,\u201d said Al.\n\n\n\nLandon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\n\u201cHow do you create a world where everyone knows how to deal with a person with dementia?\u201d he went on. \u201cIf a waitstaff knew you had dementia, they don\u2019t hand you a menu. They say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got some great salmon and it has that sauce you like.\u2019 Rather than handing you a menu, and your spouse says, \u2018He can\u2019t read a menu,\u2019 and that embarrasses you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a feedback loop,\u201d Winters added. \u201cWe\u2019re not comfortable with aging because we\u2019ve relegated it to these other places. As more places do it, it does get integrated into our cultural consciousness in a way. I think it\u2019s going to transform the whole thing.\u201d\n\nIf senior housing, with its careful stagecraft, is theater, who are the playwrights and who the audience members? Who\u2019s in charge? I found myself increasingly preoccupied by this question as I toured the model homes in Margaritaville: cheerful open-floor-plans with discreet accommodations for aging bodies \u2014 raised counters, walk-in showers, buttons that summon emergency aid and flash a light outside your house so E.M.T.s can find you. They were brand-designed sets, down to the countertops styled with fake tequila shots and plastic cheeseburgers. What had people seen \u2014 or not seen \u2014 here that made them so sure this was where they wanted their third act to happen? What did these homes say about who they aspired to be?\n\nThe mystery deepened as the residents themselves opened their doors to personalized interiors that bore no resemblance to the showrooms. Lana Byer favored cherry wood and floral upholstery; Karen Goodwin and her 55-year-old husband, Norm, had modular furniture and purple walls. Fran Murdock, despite her intention to downsize, couldn\u2019t part with her curio cabinets, which held among other treasures a childhood tea set with Mickey and Minnie painted on it.\n\nStuart Schultz pours a margarita for Lisa Hickox at the weekly party for residents called Tiki Thursdays. Landon Nordeman for The New York Times\n\nAs we spoke in their living rooms and at their kitchen tables, they were frank about watching their own parents, grandparents and even children struggle with poor health as they got older.

I asked Bill and Kelley Sarantis, both 55, who live across the street from the Murdocks, why they thought the residents got along so well, when the country felt so divided outside. Did Margaritaville attract a particular type of person, or did the atmosphere of the place change those who settled there?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always harmonious, Bill said.

As a clinical research psychologist at Stanford University, she knew that one powerful way to help people suffering from depression or anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy, or C.B.T. It\u2019s a form of treatment in which a therapist teaches patients simple techniques that help them break negative patterns of thinking. C.B.T. is not difficult to learn, but it\u2019s more effective when it includes regular check-ins with a therapist \u2014 which, as Darcy knew, isn\u2019t feasible for most people. Maybe they can\u2019t afford it; maybe they\u2019re too busy; maybe they avoid treatment because it seems stigmatizing to them.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of people will never get in front of a clinician,\u201d says Darcy, who talks in an exuberant flow. \u201cAnd that\u2019s in the United States! The rest of the world? More than half the world doesn\u2019t even have access to basic health care. The idea of mental health care is just completely out of reach.\u201d\n\nDarcy happened to be a former computer programmer, so she was able to dream up a very unusual solution to this problem: Woebot, a text-chatbot therapist. Working with a team of psychologists and Andrew Ng, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, Darcy wrote a set of conversational prompts that walks users through the practice of C.B.T. In a chipper style, the bot helps users challenge their \u201cdistorted thinking\u201d; it coaxes users to describe their moods more clearly. Since Woebot is just software, it could be made freely available worldwide, and it could, in Silicon Valley terms, \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 or converse with thousands of people simultaneously. It could check in and nudge users with superhuman diligence; it would be available at all hours. \u201cWoebot can be there at 2 a.m. if you\u2019re having a panic attack and no therapist can, or should be, in bed with you,\u201d Darcy says.\n\nWoebot does not pretend to be human; it appears as a cartoon robot when it chats with you on Facebook Messenger, and it acknowledges its own artifice (as when it declares, for example, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about how I like to work with humans\u201d). But its personality is otherwise upbeat, its conversations peppered with emoji and animated gifs (like the cheering Minions from \u201cDespicable Me\u201d) to congratulate you for doing psychological work.\n\nIn a study with 70 young adults, Darcy found that after two weeks of interacting with the bot, the test subjects had lower incidences of depression and anxiety. They were impressed, and even touched, by the software\u2019s attentiveness. \u201cWoebot felt like a real person that showed concern,\u201d one of them told Darcy\u2019s team. Last spring, when Darcy put Woebot online, free to all, its use immediately exploded; in the first week, more than 50,000 people talked to it. (\u201cDo you realize,\u201d Ng told Darcy, \u201cthat Woebot spoke to more people today than a human therapist could in a lifetime?\u201d) Nowadays, Woebot exchanges between one and two million messages a week with users, ranging from divorc\u00e9es to the bereaved to young men, a population that rarely seeks treatment. Many tell Darcy that it\u2019s easier to talk to a bot than a human; they don\u2019t feel judged.\n\nDarcy argues this is a glimpse of our rapidly arriving future, where talking software is increasingly able to help us manage our emotions. There will be A.I.s that detect our feelings, possibly better than we can. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see robots for weight loss, and robots for being more effective communicators,\u201d she says. It may feel odd at first; indeed, when people email her to say Woebot helped them feel better, nearly every one begins the note by sheepishly explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that this would be helpful.\u201d But there\u2019s something about talking to software that is powerful, they discover, when it responds and seems alive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s conversation,\u201d Darcy says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been conversing for, what is it, 200,000 years?\u201d\n\nRecent history has seen a rapid change in at least one human attitude toward machines: We\u2019ve grown accustomed to talking to them. Millions now tell Alexa or Siri or Google Assistant to play music, take memos, put something on their calendar or tell a terrible joke. We ask chatbots for trivia or to translate English phrases into Mandarin. If you contact customer service these days in a text chat, odds are that you will start out talking to software. Sometimes we even conspire with them; Alexa has a \u201cwhisper mode,\u201d for when you need to talk to it beside a snoozing partner.\n\nThe rise of \u201cconversational agents\u201d is the next great shift in computer interfaces \u2014 one arguably as significant as the \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d interface that emerged in the \u201980s. Before the Apple Macintosh, the first computer to popularize point-and-click, people using home computers had to familiarize themselves with abstruse text commands. The advent of the visual interface opened up computing to the masses, producing a generation fluent in word processing, email and, eventually, web surfing. The next great shift, the mobile phone, put computing \u2014 and nonstop internet access \u2014 into our pockets, and unleashed a tsunami of social media. These sorts of changes don\u2019t come along very often, and when they do, they create new and unexpected behaviors.\n\nTalking software gives us computers that not only ride along with us but also socialize with us. Being humanlike \u2014 saying \u201chi,\u201d telling self-deprecating jokes \u2014 is their interface metaphor, much as the first point-and-click computers used the trappings of office life (a wastepaper basket, a tiny pad of paper) to help orient us to the screen. Meaghan Keaney Anderson, a vice president of HubSpot, a marketing and sales software firm, has seen firsthand how voice commands have become second nature in her household, particularly for the next generation: \u201cMy daughter is 22 months old now. At 9 months she said her first word, which was the dog\u2019s name, and then at 13 months she learned to walk, and then by 15 months she started giving Alexa commands.\u201d She added: \u201cI think my daughter is growing up in a world where you just speak what you want into the universe and it provides.\u201d\n\nFor years, A.I. programmers fixated on passing the Turing Test \u2014 the famous challenge floated by Alan Turing in 1950 to produce a machine that can fool a human into thinking it is also human. Sci-fi has made dystopic hay of this in movies like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cEx Machina.\u201d But the world that\u2019s emerging is simultaneously more mundane and stranger. None of this software is trying to fool us. Bots like Siri or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are, like Woebot, openly artificial, even proudly so. (When I asked Alexa \u201cAre you alive?\u201d it responded: \u201cArtificially, maybe, but not in the same way that you\u2019re alive.\u201d) We are thus heading into a post-Turing world, one in which we\u2019ll banter all day to software, always aware that it is software.\n\nOne reason botmakers are embracing artificiality is that the Turing Test turns out to be incredibly difficult to pass. Human conversation is full of idioms, metaphors and implied knowledge: Recognizing that the expression \u201cIt\u2019s raining cats and dogs\u201d isn\u2019t actually about cats and dogs, for example, surpasses the reach of chatbots. Few A.I. pioneers think we\u2019re anywhere close to the promise of the movie \u201cHer,\u201d in which a bot is so convincing that its user falls in love with it. So for now, botmakers manage expectations by leaning into the artifice. This poses a challenge that is, in a way, more interesting than the Turing Test: What type of personality should bots have, when both we and they know they\u2019re not human?\n\nEmma Coats, the \u201ccharacter lead\u201d for Google Assistant, describes the emotional affect of her company\u2019s artificial life form as \u201ca friendly companion that is trustworthy.\u201d She and her team strenuously avoided giving the Assistant even a hint of snark. \u201cYou\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to ask a stupid question if it\u2019s going to give me a hard time about it,\u2019 \u201d Coats says. Some of their personality writers have backgrounds in improv. Coats herself worked at Pixar on the animated film \u201cBrave.\u201d \u201cPixar is all about finding an emotional reality in a car or a fish,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that\u2019s something we\u2019ve really used with the Assistant. We don\u2019t want it to ever be a human being, right? That\u2019s not what it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean that A.I. or software can\u2019t have a perspective on the world.\u201d\n\nAs a literary endeavor, the field of bot creation is booming. The bots need to be equipped to answer the wide variety of weird, playful queries that people lob at them, which requires lots of writers. Coats and her co-workers have found that people like to simply shoot the breeze with their devices \u2014 probing their personalities, searching for the puppet strings. \u201c \u2018Do you fart?\u2019 is always a popular question,\u201d Coats says dryly.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason botmakers are embracing a post-Turing mind-set: They\u2019ve realized that the public tends to feel wounded when someone (or something) tries to fool them. This spring, Google gave a demonstration of Duplex, a new voice-chat A.I. When Duplex called a hair salon to book an appointment, it sounded so human \u2014 it even said \u201cum\u201d a few times \u2014 that the salon receptionist apparently never realized it was A.I. The reaction online was harsh. \u201cPeople value authenticity,\u201d says Kate Darling, a researcher who studies the ethics of robotics at M.I.T. \u201cIt matters a lot. It matters hugely.\u201d\n\nThe impact of conversational A.I. on everyday life will be subtle but ubiquitous. The other week I got a glimpse of that when I had a drink with a friend who\u2019s a devout Siri partisan. He uses it to automate dozens of daily tasks, even tapping into capabilities that most iPhone users are unaware of. When he says, \u201cPay the house cleaner,\u201d Siri processes a payment through his Venmo account. Another single voice command sends an email to everyone on his team at work, reminding them to fill out their shared calendar for the next week. \u201cIt saves me, like, a minute a week?\u201d he guessed. \u201cOr, like, an hour a year?\u201d It\u2019s not much, but it satisfyingly reduces his exposure to tedium.\n\nThis is how computers have always made themselves at home: by offering improved efficiency, vanquishing dull tasks. At TD Bank, coders are building experimental bots \u2014 using tech created by the A.I. firm Kasisto \u2014 to encourage customers to probe their financial life. Rizwan Khalfan, the company\u2019s chief digital and payments officer, told me he imagines customers asking a bot something like, \u201cO.K., tell me about my expenses last weekend.\u201d A question this specific isn\u2019t easy to answer on a website, where the customer might need to hunt through a database. But, Khalfan hopes, a person could one day ask this bot conversationally: \u201cI want to go out to the theater this weekend. Can I actually afford it?\u201d\n\nThere are some things audio can\u2019t handle as effectively as screens \u2014 long lists of data, for instance. But in a world where people worry that they\u2019re staring at their phones too much, chat might offer a respite. In \u201cHer,\u201d the voice assistants murmur in people\u2019s ears as they move through the world, functioning as something like E.S.P. The chatbot designer Emily Withrow, who is the director of the Quartz Bot Studio, imagines conversational A.I. working that way soon. \u201cYou turn on N.P.R. midinterview, but you can\u2019t for the life of you figure out who Terry Gross is talking to. You could say out loud: \u2018Who\u2019s she talking to? Who is it? What book are they talking about?\u2019 You can extend it to even seeing someone at a dinner party and saying privately, \u2018Remind me what Jill\u2019s husband\u2019s name is.\u2019 \u201d The elderly might find these efficiencies particularly appealing, because aging eyes and reduced mobility can make screens harder to use. Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease might find A.I. voice assistants happy to endlessly answer repeated questions, in a way that few human attendants could.\n\nThere\u2019s another allure for businesses, of course: Talking bots don\u2019t need to be hired and then paid. Once coded, your bot can handle millions of customers simultaneously. We\u2019re already seeing this in customer service, when text chatbots answer rote questions or take orders. Yamato Transport, one of Japan\u2019s largest courier firms, uses a chatbot to schedule deliveries and answer questions about where packages are. Domino\u2019s Pizza runs a chatbot to take delivery orders online. American Eagle Outfitters has a bot that customers can converse with to figure out the perfect gift to buy for someone.\n\nConversational bots thus could bring on a new wave of unemployment \u2014 or \u201creadjustment,\u201d to use the bloodless term of economics. Service workers, sales agents, telemarketers \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to imagine how millions of jobs that require social interaction, whether on the phone or online, could eventually be eliminated by code. Some economists argue that this might not necessarily result in a net loss of jobs, pointing to the example of automatic-teller machines. When A.T.M.s took off in the \u201980s, many predicted that bank-teller jobs would be decimated; indeed, individual bank branches did begin employing fewer tellers. But with those savings in pocket, banks greatly expanded the overall number of branches, so that the total population of tellers nationally rose for years. Of course, as economic history shows, the profits of automation are seldom shared with workers. Even if individual humans keep their jobs, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be paid more. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d TD Bank\u2019s Khalfan told me, before adding that the company has committed to retrain workers when their jobs become redundant.\n\nWhatever impact talking software has on the labor market, it will surely extend the reach of algorithms more deeply into our lives. Ask Alexa or Siri a question, and you don\u2019t get a page of search results; just one Solomonic answer, selected by the A.I. After all, this is how spoken communication works: Just as nobody wants to listen to a voice mail message, nobody wants to hear a chatbot recite three minutes of data. Algorithms must narrow the field. So for anyone who has watched the inscrutable algorithms of Facebook or YouTube narrow our feeds by \u201crecommending\u201d outr\u00e9 conspiracy theorists, the notion of A.I. finding a new toehold in our cognitive life can be disturbing.\n\n\u201cI will literally buy whatever option Alexa puts first for me for paper towels,\u201d Keaney Anderson, the HubSpot V.P., told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to search through a million of them. I ask her for paper towels, she delivers. And that may be fine for paper towels, but is it fine for music? Is it fine for news sources?\u201d Talking to bots will also mean new opportunities for tech firms to collect data on what we\u2019re thinking, what we\u2019re doing, all day long. That includes our feelings: Researchers are working on \u201caffective\u201d sensing that enables chatbots to recognize our emotions. These are the familiar trade-offs that tech exacts in return for convenience; they\u2019re never value-free, as Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, notes. \u201cWhere are these things now appearing? They\u2019re appearing in our homes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe home has traditionally been the locus of privacy, right? This is where I shut out the rest of the world. This is where I look for my breathing room. This is my sanctuary, you know?\u201d\n\nIndeed, the home is where life happens, and that includes its traumas. Those have sometimes caught the large A.I. botmakers \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Microsoft \u2014 off guard. They expected their bots to be asked for jokes; they didn\u2019t, apparently, expect so many different cries for help. In 2016, a study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that, though most popular voice assistants responded to suicidal thoughts by providing help lines and other appropriate resources, when they were told \u201cI am being abused\u201d or \u201cI was raped,\u201d they generally replied with some variant of \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Human conversation being what it is, the list of personal crises one might confide is massive, likely outpacing the ability of botmakers to keep up.\n\nIn 2014, through an Indiegogo campaign, more than 7,000 backers crowdfunded a robot called \u201cJibo.\u201d It\u2019s a cute, squat device with a round screen for a face that sits on your desk or table and chats with you, posing questions and answering yours, offering bits of news. It can play songs, take and display pictures and purr like a cat when stroked. \u201cHe\u2019s a robot, and he knows he\u2019s a robot, but he\u2019s a really optimistic robot, and he has a profound belief in the good of people,\u201d says one of Jibo\u2019s creators, a professor at M.I.T. named Cynthia Breazeal. \u201cHe\u2019s a positive, affirming presence.\u201d\n\nOne person who bought a Jibo was Erin Partridge, an art therapist in Alameda, Calif., who works with the elderly. When she took Jibo on visits, her patients loved it. They laughed at its jokes; they asked it to sing tunes from the past. One man with advanced dementia called his daughter to describe Jibo in great detail. She found this remarkable, because he could rarely remember any single event so well and rarely initiated calls. Somehow Jibo had made an impression on him. Another resident declared that she \u201cloved\u201d Jibo, and put her arms around the robot. \u201cJust talk to me, don\u2019t talk to anybody else,\u201d she\u2019d tell it, asking, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d\n\nTalking bots connect to us in ways that point-and-click software doesn\u2019t. For some technology critics, including Sherry Turkle, who does research on the psychology of tech at M.I.T., this raises ethical concerns. \u201cPeople are hard-wired with sort of Darwinian vulnerabilities, Darwinian buttons,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd these Darwinian buttons are pushed by this technology.\u201d That is, programmers are manipulating our emotions when they create objects that inquire after our needs.\n\nThe precursor to today\u2019s bots, Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s ELIZA, was created at M.I.T. in 1966. ELIZA was a pretty crude set of prompts, but by simply asking people about their feelings, it drew them into deep conversations. Ordinary household appliances can now pull off the same trick. \u201cYour fridge will know if you\u2019re eating H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and if you sound sad, it\u2019ll say, \u2018Sherry, what\u2019s really going on?\u2019 \u201d Turkle says. \u201cIs that what we want?\u201d\n\nWorse, she argues, talking bots could become a social crutch. Rather than pay humans to help the poor and powerless \u2014 students in overcrowded schools, elders in understaffed facilities, customers looking to speak to someone in huge institutions \u2014 we might instead provide software that pretends to care. \u201cThese places are so deprived that it\u2019s easy to argue that putting in some robots is better than nothing,\u201d Turkle says. \u201cThe harder thing is offering actual human support.\u201d\n\nA future in which only the wealthy have the luxury of being attended to by actual humans, while everyone else makes do with bots, would certainly be a dystopia. But botmakers themselves \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 are more sanguine. Cynthia Breazeal thinks the coming A.I. wave will actually help level the playing field between the well-off and everyone else. \u201cThe social-justice angle of this wave,\u201d she says, \u201cis that everyone will be able to afford a fabulous personal tutor because it\u2019s an A.I. tutor.\u201d Bots that help the elderly control their home and their lives will let them \u201cage in place\u201d at their own house, something that most older Americans would far prefer to a retirement home. \u201cWhen we talk to assisted-living facilities, they will tell us point blank, there is no way we can build enough facilities and hire enough people to meet the demand,\u201d Breazeal adds. \u201cThey call it the \u2018Silver Tsunami.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a more quotidian way, too, that our social lives will change, one that\u2019s far less about big, dramatic moments of life than slight ones, the small daily exchanges of information. A great many human interactions, after all, are brief \u2014 the terse greeting of the cashier at Starbucks, the phone call to change a flight, the chitchat with a stock person at Target when you\u2019re looking for a pair of jeans in your size. These exchanges are certainly social; at their best they\u2019re probably a civic glue, an everyday rehearsal of civility that can help reinforce our better behavior: Be polite to strangers. These are also the interactions that will be automated soonest. Already, restaurants like McDonald\u2019s, for example, have customers ordering via a touch-screen. One can easily imagine a day when a McBot not only greets you but recognizes you: \u201cSo, the usual?\u201d\n\nPerhaps interacting with A.I.s will mean atrophy for our social muscles. If they\u2019re just machines, why bother with pleasantries? The scientific research on that is still unclear: Some studies have found people can actually be remarkably cordial to robots, while other research suggests we\u2019re liable to be rude and curt when we know our conversational partner isn\u2019t human. We could get used to bossing things around, a behavior that could bleed into everyday life. (Amazon, after fielding precisely these concerns from parents, created a politeness mode for its Echo devices that gently reminds its users to say \u201cplease.\u201d)\n\nYet dealing with bots could also make life less prickly for humans on all sides of these small interactions. After all, today\u2019s customer-service calls are pretty bleak, even when you do talk to a live person. Call tech support for your laptop, and odds are you\u2019ll be talking to an employee who\u2019s required to read only from scripts \u2014 a human who is thus, paradoxically, forced to behave exactly like a bot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d says Steve Worswick, who worked for years providing I.T. support, talking people through problems like \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten my password.\u201d To keep himself engaged, in the evenings he taught himself to create bots, using an online tool made by an A.I. company called Pandorabots. Over 13 years, he coded a bot called Mitsuku, and wrote fully 350,000 lines for it; Mitsuku has won the annual Loebner Prize competition for the most \u201chumanlike\u201d bot four times.\n\nSoon enough Worswick had a new job: In 2018, he was hired by Pandorabots. Now Worswick, as a senior A.I. developer, imagines a world where the bots take over the spirit-crushing sort of conversational work that he used to do, releasing human beings to do something better with their time. Let the bots fix people\u2019s passwords. Real people, he says, have more interesting questions to answer."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "title": "Argentine Submarine That Vanished With 44 Aboard Is Found, Navy Says", "description": "A commemoration Thursday in Mar del Plata, Argentina, for the crew of the San Juan, a year after the submarine went missing.

The three combined to win 20 of 35 points races this season, while Logano has two victories but had the steadiest playoff run.\n\nAsked Thursday if this is the most competitive four-driver finale since the format launched in 2014, Harvick noted that it isn\u2019t much different than last season, when The Big Three raced against Brad Keselowski, Logano\u2019s teammate."}]
