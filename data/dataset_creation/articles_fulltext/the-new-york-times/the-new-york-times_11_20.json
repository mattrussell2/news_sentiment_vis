The measures, which impose penalties on companies buying Iranian oil, came into effect on Nov. 5. Buyers had been expected to reduce purchases of Iranian crude oil before the sanctions, but that activity seems to have curbed Iran\u2019s output only modestly. For instance, OPEC reported that Iranian production in October was down 4.5 percent from the previous month, to about 3.3 million barrels a day.\n\nSome background on why the impact has been muted: The Trump administration granted temporary waivers to Iran\u2019s largest customers, including China, India and Japan.

It might indicate, he said, that the administration\u2019s priorities leaned more to keeping prices low for American consumers than squeezing Iran. If so, the strategy seems to be working. The price of regular gasoline in the United States on Tuesday was $2.61, compared with $2.85 a month earlier, according to AAA.\n\nWhat will shape prices in the next few weeks?\n\nWhen OPEC members meet in Vienna next month, analysts expect the group to announce production cuts of around one million barrels a day, about 1 percent of world supplies.\n\nThere is little doubt that the Saudis can make cuts of this scale. After all, they have lifted production by almost 700,000 barrels a day compared with their average output in 2017.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which tries to avoid taking the pain on its own, may struggle to persuade producers like Russia and Iraq to join in making cuts, analysts said.

And colleagues were mourning Dayna Less, the pharmacy resident, who recently joined the hospital staff and who was not involved in the initial dispute.\n\nThe episode raised hard questions about the links between domestic disputes and shootings, as well as other concerns around gun violence. Here\u2019s a look at some of the issues:\n\nGuns make domestic disputes deadlier\n\nDomestic violence has long been known as a major risk factor for homicides of women. Researchers have found that women are killed by intimate partners, such as spouses or boyfriends, more often than any other kind of perpetrator. And the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "C-SPAN", "title": "U.S. Needs Saudis to Combat \u2018Mean, Nasty World,\u2019 Pompeo Says", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would stand by Saudi Arabia despite the C.I.A\u2019s belief that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of the Saudi journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006225422/pompeo-saudi-arabia-khashoggi.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/us/politics/pompeo-vid/pompeo-vid-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:19:05Z", "content": "1 U.S. Paul Manaforts Trail of Scandals", "fulltext": "9 U.S.\n\n\u2018Can The President Be Impeached?\u2019 We Answer Your Questions"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "PARUL SEHGAL", "title": "Books of The Times: \u2018The Condition of Secrecy\u2019 Teems With Love for Language and the Natural World", "description": "In her wide-ranging essays, the Danish writer Inger Christensen, who died in 2009, cuts her towering erudition with mischief and generosity.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/books/review-condition-of-secrecy-essays-inger-christensen.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/books/21bookchristensen1/21bookchristensen1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:13:33Z", "content": "Its a hectic kind of erudition that could easily seem showy, but in these essays we experience it as a kind of abundance, an outpouring of love for the world.

Nied\u2019s clean, musical translation helps. There is nothing knotty, nothing strained. The arguments radiate outward with the measured rhythm of ripples in water. Christensen herself repeatedly compares writing to other kinds of natural phenomena: \u201cI had the same \u2018right\u2019 to produce language that a tree has to produce leaves\u201d; \u201cWe can find comfort in imagining that it\u2019s possible to write as easily as frost creates its repetitions and variation on a windowpane.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that writing came easily to her \u2014 in fact, some of the best pieces in this book are about its nauseating difficulty. But she connects it to other forms of inquiry: \u201cPoetry is just one of human beings\u2019 many ways of recognizing things, and the same schism runs through each of the other ways, be it philosophy, mathematics or the natural sciences.\u201d\n\nHowever original Christensen\u2019s insights, the book has been published shabbily. There is no mention of where these essays first appeared, or when. Reading an interview with Nied, I was startled to learn that several of them were first written in German, and that Christensen had translated them into Danish herself, which is never noted. Nor is there any introduction or any effort to explore how these essays work alongside the poems.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame \u2014 not least because Christensen deserves to be championed, not merely published. It feels like an additional disservice given how passionate she was about context and hidden continuities. In the book\u2019s best essay, she investigates the parts of speech as tools for understanding the universe and our place in it. \u201cAll nouns are very lonely,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey\u2019re like crystals, each enclosing its own little piece of our knowledge about the world.\u201d All adjectives are helpless (\u201cthey have to cling to all the nouns they can find\u201d). Adverbs are stubborn but verbs are agreeable (\u201cthey shift, change identity and undo every noun\u2019s loneliness for a while\u201d).\n\nThe essay feels inspired by Gertrude Stein\u2019s playful meditations on language. (\u201cSentences are not emotional but paragraphs are,\u201d Stein wrote in her essay \u201cPoetry & Grammar.\u201d \u201cI said I found this out first in listening to Basket my dog drinking. And anybody listening to any dog\u2019s drinking will see what I mean.\u201d) But there\u2019s a larger point being made, one that Christensen keeps turning over, like a Rubik\u2019s cube. If there is a part of speech she is partial to, it is the preposition \u2014 the invisible and all-important part that signals where we are in relation to one another. According to her, we\u2019re all muddled on this score; we think of those markers of humanity \u2014 language, consciousness, art \u2014 as being ways of perceiving (or depicting) nature, not as its products. What would it mean to have a greater sense of identification with the world, she wonders. What would it do to our sentences, our sense of ourselves and how we conceive of our obligations to the environment?\n\nIs it such a far-fetched proposition, that \u201clanguage can\u2019t be separated from the world without separating the world from itself\u201d? Not to Christensen; we\u2019ve been there before. \u201cWhen I was 9 years old, the world, too, was 9 years old,\u201d she writes. \u201cAt least there was no difference between us, no opposition, no distance. We just tumbled around from sunrise to sunset, body and earth as alike as two pennies.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "Karen Weise", "title": "Somali Workers in Minnesota Force Amazon to Negotiate", "description": "Labor organizers and researchers said they had not heard of Amazon previously coming to the table after worker pressure, even for private discussions.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/technology/amazon-somali-workers-minnesota.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/business/21AMAZON07/21AMAZON07-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:11:32Z", "content": "But after Ms. Ibrahim returned from breast cancer treatment, a new manager scolded her for working slowly, she said.

He was a major league regular by the time he was 19 \u2014 it was determined after he had made the majors that the Los Angeles Dodgers had improperly signed him a year too early, which resulted in several suspensions as well as the team being forced to pay Beltre damages \u2014 and was still an above average player at 39.\n\n\u201cI remember one time I was going to give him a day off, and we\u2019re on the field and he just could not help himself,\u201d Ron Washington, one of Beltre\u2019s managers with the Texas Rangers, said in an interview on MLB Network Radio on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone this story, but I said, \u2018Adrian, I\u2019m going to kneel down here, I\u2019m begging you to take the day off. People don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m on my knees begging you to take the day off.\u2019 That was the only way I got him to take the day off \u2014 I actually got on my knees.\u201d\n\nBeltre finally relented. \u201cAnd you know that resonated with everyone in that clubhouse,\u201d Washington said, \u201cbecause no one wanted to take a day off, simply because they watched Adrian.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of Beltre\u2019s durability is that he kept himself on the field at such an advanced age thanks in large part to his glove.\n\nDefense can be hard to quantify, as the more modern statistics have only been tracked since the early 2000s, but using the best methods available from each season, Baseball-Reference credits Beltre with 23.1 career defensive WAR at third base, which trails only Robinson, who had 39.1 using far less precise methods of measurement."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MANOHLA DARGIS", "title": "\u2018Roma\u2019 Review: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Masterpiece of Memory", "description": "Cuar\u00f3n uses both intimacy and monumentality to express the depths of ordinary life in this autobiographical movie set in Mexico City in the 1970s.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/movies/roma-review.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/arts/21roma-1/21roma-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:29:57Z", "content": "In Roma, the Mexican director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n uses a large canvas to tell the story of lives that some might think small. A personal epic set in Mexico City in the early 1970s, it centers on a young indigenous woman who works as a maid for a middle-class white\u2026 [+2247 chars]", "fulltext": "The mother, Sof\u00eda (Marina De Tavira), is more present, though still less so than Cleo, the children\u2019s surrogate parent. Sof\u00eda is unfairly berated by her husband and she, in turn, rebukes Cleo, a chain of exploitation that Cuar\u00f3n represents coolly, occasionally letting a camera movement \u2014 a pan of the immaculate house \u2014 comment for him. \u201cRoma\u201d doesn\u2019t have a strong story; there are no inciting incidents or mysteries to solve. Instead, in scene after scene, Cuar\u00f3n creates a fine-grained vision of a woman and a world shaped by a colonialist past that inexorably weighs down the present, most conspicuously in a surreal interlude filled with guns, servants and a conflagration.\n\nCuar\u00f3n\u2019s authorial voice becomes progressively more conspicuous through his visual choices, his staging and camerawork. Much happens, but in fragments that slide together as the family and larger sociopolitical forces come into focus. In an early meal scene, one of the boys casually mentions seeing a soldier fatally shoot a kid who was throwing water balloons at an army jeep. He begins speaking over a close-up of Cleo\u2019s hands as she prepares a plate of food, an image that makes the brutality feel quotidian. In another scene, Cuar\u00f3n punctuates a shot of the parents and children watching TV with one of Cleo seated next to them on the floor, a child\u2019s arm draped on her body.\n\nCuar\u00f3n wrote as well as edited \u201cRoma\u201d; he folds just enough exposition into ordinary-sounding conversations to keep you tethered and doesn\u2019t step on the story by overcutting it. You don\u2019t necessarily know who the children in lederhosen are in one sequence, but their outfits, casual wealth and taxidermy menagerie could fill volumes. Mostly, he speaks through his visuals, particularly the camerawork that alternately articulates his and Cleo\u2019s points of view. You see what she sees and also view her from a distance, but at times \u2014 as in a scene in which she wades into violently crashing waves, the camera steadily moving parallel with her \u2014 the movie seems to embody her being.\n\nThis is a stunning sequence that\u2019s viscerally terrifying and emotionally overwhelming. Yet it also invokes the oceanic feeling of a being at one with the universe that dovetails with a climactic family road trip. You feel both Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s presence and Cleo\u2019s in this vision of her determinedly pushing against the threatening waves, an image he has dredged from the past and made alive through memory. \u201cRoma\u201d is dedicated to Liboria Rodr\u00edguez (\u201cfor Libo\u201d), the woman who raised him in a house like the one in this movie, where every so often you can see a jet passing overhead, a vision that points to a distant, peripatetic future, even as it suggests that Cuar\u00f3n never left this place, its women and its love."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New

Paper, $16.\n\nDaisy Johnson\u2019s first novel, \u201cEverything Under,\u201d is a force of nature. Its narrative is slippery as an eel and tangled like the murky, wreckage-strewn waterways of its Oxfordshire setting. Its title, possibly by design, recalls the debut of another writer, also resident in Oxford, who went on to have a glittering career. Like Iris Murdoch\u2019s 1954 novel, \u201cUnder the Net,\u201d Johnson\u2019s Man Booker Prize finalist is concerned with language, secrets and the damage wrought by what\u2019s left unsaid.\n\nJohnson, who at 27 became the youngest writer ever to reach the last round of the prestigious prize, also shares Murdoch\u2019s love of myth. In \u201cEverything Under,\u201d she subverts Sophocles\u2019 \u201cOedipus Rex\u201d by expanding the marginal part of Jocasta. Sarah, as she is called here, is both linchpin and catalyst for the deterministic events that follow. She is described by her \u201centhralled\u201d daughter, Gretel, as \u201clike a preacher or the leader of a cult,\u201d but also as \u201ca runner, a giver-upper.\u201d Gretel, who works as a lexicographer updating dictionary entries, is haunted by the way her mother abandoned her when she was a teenager. And she has spent the last 16 years fruitlessly trying to track her down. Ringing up the local morgues has become a habit: \u201cSometimes I thought that I kept doing it to make sure you were not coming back.\u201d\n\nThe novel is built around three chapter headings that are repeated over and over: \u201cThe Cottage,\u201d \u201cThe River\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt.\u201d The first of these is an isolated home where the adult Gretel has retreated to lick her wounds; the second is where mother and daughter lived on a houseboat for several years; and the third explains both Gretel\u2019s search for her mother and a ghoulish presence on the river that she and her mother refer to as the Bonak. This monster is sometimes glimpsed \u2014 \u201cIt is double-headed, has more limbs than it must need, flings in and out of the dull pockets of candlelight\u201d \u2014 but is also a shared symbol foreboding tragedy and loss.\n\nThe supernatural is something Johnson (who was born on Halloween) already explored to electrifying effect in her story collection, \u201cFen,\u201d which was set amid the flooded coastal plains of eastern England. In one story, a girl goes on a hunger strike and out of empathy metamorphosizes into an eel; in another, a house becomes furiously jealous of a woman\u2019s lovers. Johnson has a way of presenting these scenarios matter-of-factly, grounding the fantastic in the earthy details of country life."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "STEVEN B.

Why did he write in a way that permitted such misuse? Dangerous thinkers should expect to attract dangerous followers. What else to expect from a philosopher who describes himself as dynamite? Nietzsche would no doubt have despised populist demagogues like Mussolini and Hitler, but then one who promises that \u201cone day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful\u201d should not be surprised when something frightful comes along.\n\nAs the author of previous biographies of Edvard Munch and August Strindberg, Prideaux clearly knows her way around the world of European high modernism. She is strong on Nietzsche\u2019s life, but much less so on his ideas. In fact, apart from Nietzsche\u2019s ideas, his life is of relatively little import. She does little to explain what makes Nietzsche an enduring philosopher who continues to exercise great influence. Nor does she attempt to put Nietzsche in the context of his great fin de si\u00e8cle contemporaries and admirers including William James, Freud, Gide and Shaw, among many others.\n\nJohn Kaag\u2019s book, \u201cHiking With Nietzsche,\u201d is a semi-autobiography that follows the author as a 19-year-old, hiking to Sils-Maria in the Swiss Alps in search of Nietzsche\u2019s house, then recounts him making the same trip 18 years later as a professor of philosophy with his wife and baby daughter in tow. It is often said that you can understand someone only when standing in their shoes; Kaag believes that wisdom comes only when hiking on their trails.\n\nThis book is less a scholarly study of Nietzsche than a meditation on the relation between hiking and philosophy. For Kaag, walking is not about the destination but the adventure itself. Almost all of the great philosophers \u2014 Socrates, Aristotle, the Stoics, Rousseau, Kant, Thoreau \u2014 were walkers whose ideas germinated only in motion. He takes Nietzsche\u2019s challenge to \u201cbecome who you are!\u201d as a call to schlep his young family around the Alps to achieve his own goal of self-discovery. His wife must have the patience of a saint.\n\nImage\n\nKaag is a lively storyteller who brings Nietzsche\u2019s life into continual contact with his own. This is both the strength and the weakness of the book. He succeeds quite well in maintaining a balance between Nietzsche\u2019s life and thought and makes some nice connections to Emerson, Hesse, Mann and Adorno. I imagine he is an excellent teacher. At other times, a cloying style gets the better of him as we learn a little too much about the author\u2019s parenting skills.\n\nLike Prideaux\u2019s, Kaag\u2019s Nietzsche is a largely apolitical existentialist who challenges his readers to be what they might become. What he doesn\u2019t tell us is how to become what we might be. Nietzsche is presented as the great apostle of the free spirit, the nonconformist and the rugged individualist living in the age of the philistine and the \u201clast man.\u201d Kaag doesn\u2019t exactly ignore Nietzsche\u2019s rough edges \u2014 his fascination with eugenics, his flirtations with anti-Semitism, his hatred of democracy in all its forms \u2014 but he sees them as not fatal to Nietzsche\u2019s project of individual self-overcoming."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "ELEANOR STANFORD", "title": "A \u2018Lego Movie 2\u2019 Trailer and More: 6 Things to Know in Pop Culture Today", "description": "The new trailer for \u201cLego Movie 2\u201d introduces Rex Dangervest, a galaxy-defending archaeologist voiced by Chris Pratt.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/arts/lego-movie-2-avicii-brilliant-friend.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/arts/21cheatshee-lego/21cheatshee-lego-facebookJumbo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:50:01Z", "content": "The original Lego Movie was far better than it had any right to be: It was sweetly satirical and irreverently silly, and I loved it.

His drawing-room sex comedy, \u201cSmiles of a Summer Night\u201d (1955) was a hit at Cannes.

Wainwright, son of the \u201970s singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, fused indie folk and soft glam into a series of highly personal albums, beginning with his eponymous debut in 1998 and continuing through his pair of dynamic 2003-4 \u201cWant\u201d albums. Then he decided to write operas \u2014 the second, \u201cHadrian,\u201d with a libretto by Daniel MacIvor, premiered in Toronto in October \u2014 and to compose music for the renowned American experimental theater director Robert Wilson\u2019s 2009 staging of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets in Berlin. These works brought him into the creative orbit of the Amsterdam-based van Hove, whose freewheeling multimedia adaptations pay equal homage to avant-garde performance pioneers like Wilson and august playwrights like Arthur Miller, whose \u201cThe Crucible\u201d and \u201cA View From the Bridge\u201d he reimagined earlier this decade. (His theater company, Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, recently premiered \u201cA Little Life,\u201d adapted from the novel written by T\u2019s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara.) Wainwright and van Hove met up one October night in a Japanese restaurant in downtown New York; van Hove, 60, had just finished a day of rehearsals for the Broadway adaptation of Sidney Lumet\u2019s prescient 1976 media satire, \u201cNetwork\u201d (opening Dec. 6), which he is directing and which stars Bryan Cranston. Wainwright, 45, had just flown in from his home in Los Angeles, the day after debuting his tense, beautiful and political new single, \u201cSword of Damocles,\u201d as he prepares to go on tour. They were coming from disparate places, running on different clocks, but immediately opened up about that which matters most to them: politics, coming out, the multiplicity of the self \u2014 and the benefits of boarding school.\n\nRUFUS WAINWRIGHT: One of my husband J\u00f6rn [Weisbrodt]\u2019s great heroes is Ivo. I think the first thing that I saw of his was \u201cAngels in America\u201d at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2014, which was incredible, and then \u201cA View From the Bridge\u201d and \u201cThe Crucible.\u201d We\u2019ve wanted to do something together for years. It could take many forms: certainly an opera or a musical. Today, when I came to the photo shoot, it was in the basement of a church. And I said, \u201cWhat is this, an A.A. meeting?\u201d Then it dawned on me that this is where you\u2019re rehearsing \u201cNetwork.\u201d I had the same thing with my last opera: I think it was an old cigar factory \u2014 a very sacred aura, but also unglamorous and badly lit.

Are you disciplined?\n\nRW: My mother loved to drink and enjoy life, but when it came to music, she was incredibly exacting, and there was always a need for quality and trueness, and that really translated when I started making my early records.

The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties \u2014 we\u2019ve seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers.

A few months ago, he showed up at our father\u2019s birthday party and headed straight for his room without saying a word to any of our aunts, uncles or cousins.\n\nBeing the hotheaded sister I am, I stormed up to his room to give him an earful about his rude behavior. As soon as I opened the door, I could see something was off; he was lying on his bed with tears in his eyes, unable to speak. He eventually confessed that he has been feeling depressed for years, and that this was not the first time he\u2019s had this type of episode. He begged me not to tell our Asian immigrant parents, who he fears will never understand what he\u2019s going through. I told him that I would help him get the help he needs, and that I would always support him no matter what. I also promised him I wouldn\u2019t tell a soul.\n\nSince then, my brother has grown even more isolated and refuses to get the help he needs. It\u2019s been especially difficult keeping this secret from my parents. They don\u2019t understand why he would rather spend weekends alone in his cramped dorm room than with the family. I can hear the heartache in my mom\u2019s voice when she\u2019s on the phone with him. My brother is never apologetic, claiming that he acts this way because of his mental illness. I\u2019m upset with him, and don\u2019t believe his mental illness excuses his actions. How do I deal with these feelings? Should I tell my parents about his depression?

Before anything else, I advise you to educate yourself about depression. It\u2019s vital that you understand how debilitating an illness it is. Your brother is in tremendous pain. He\u2019s both frightened and ashamed. That\u2019s why he\u2019s avoiding your family, and isolating himself. Your priority should be helping him talk about his feelings with someone, as a first step to managing his mental health. A therapist would be ideal. A support group would also be great.

Globalization would lead to what Karl Marx had called in the Communist Manifesto a \u201cuniversal interdependence\u201d among nations; warfare would become a thing of the past. America\u2019s mission was to push other states to protect human rights and to help them transition to democracy.\n\nImage\n\nIn Walt\u2019s view, \u201cdespite minor differences, both liberal and neoconservative proponents of liberal hegemony assumed that the United States could pursue this ambitious global strategy without triggering serious opposition.\u201d But the very steps that America took to enhance its security, Walt suggests, ended up undermining it. He reminds us, for instance, that George F. Kennan warned in 1999 that NATO expansion eastward was a \u201ctragic mistake\u201d that would, sooner or later, ignite Russian nationalism. Under Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership, Russia became a revanchist power that launched cyber attacks on the Baltic States, seized Crimea, invaded Ukraine and interfered in the 2016 American presidential election. In Walt\u2019s telling, \u201cthe energetic pursuit of liberal hegemony was mostly a failure. \u2026 By 2017, in fact, democracy was in retreat in many places and under considerable strain in the United States itself.\u201d\n\nWalt reserves his greatest ire for what Barack Obama\u2019s adviser Ben Rhodes dismissively referred to as the \u201cBlob,\u201d or Washington\u2019s foreign policy elite. Some of his vexation is personal. He reports that the advertisement he signed attacking the invasion of Iraq has disappeared into the foreign policy memory hole: \u201cIn the 16-plus years since the ad was printed,\u201d Walt observes, \u201cnone of its signatories have been asked to serve in government or advise a presidential campaign.\u201d Walt\u2019s own zest for intellectual combat, though, can lead him into rhetorical overkill. \u201cInstead of being a disciplined body of professionals constrained by a well-informed public and forced by necessity to set priorities and hold themselves accountable,\u201d Walt writes, \u201ctoday\u2019s foreign policy elite is a dysfunctional caste of privileged insiders who are frequently disdainful of alternative perspectives and insulated both professionally and personally from the consequences of the policies they promote.\u201d\n\nWalt points to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Atlantic Council and the Center for New American Security, among others, as constituting a kind of interlocking directorate that fosters groupthink and consists of mandarins intolerant of dissenting views. But Walt\u2019s depiction of these organizations misses the mark. There\u2019s plenty of debate in Washington; whether it amounts to much is another question. He also focuses excessively on several rather obscure academic projects that he believes epitomize the sterile moribundity of American strategic thought. It would have been more illuminating had he zeroed in on those few organizations that really do exercise outsize influence in Trump\u2019s Washington, like the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which is helping to shape Iran policy.\n\nWalt persuasively contends that Washington\u2019s bungled interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya helped propel Trump, who has consistently derided foreign policy experts, to the presidency. But so pervasive is the influence of the foreign policy elite, Walt argues, that it has managed to capture Trump himself. In Afghanistan, Trump ditched his campaign vows and bolstered American force levels, claiming that they would engage in counterterrorism rather than nation-building. Trump has presided over an approach toward Russia and China that is driving them into each other\u2019s arms, precisely as realist doctrine would predict. Walt also drubs Trump for his embrace of foreign autocrats, which amounts to a pursuit of illiberal hegemony: \u201cThe United States still sought primacy and its global military role was undiminished, but it was no longer strongly committed to promoting liberal values.\u201d With foreign policy hawks like the national security adviser John Bolton and the secretary of state Mike Pompeo on the White House team, Walt perceptively observes that, far from being an isolationist, Trump has enabled a return to the confrontational unilateralism of Dick Cheney."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "HAROON MOGHUL", "title": "Happy Birthday, Muhammad", "description": "A view of illuminated Memon Mosque ahead of Mawlid, the birthday of Prophet Mohammad, in Karachi, Pakistan, Sunday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/opinion/happy-birthday-muhammad.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/opinion/20MOGHUL/20MOGHUL-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:03:28Z", "content": "It began with the troubled circumstances of my birth: I had a malformed intestinal tract.

Had I been born a few decades earlier, I would have died very early on. As a sick child, I spent much of my time indoors, with books my parents encouraged, many of which were about Muhammad.\n\nHe was an outsider like me. Being an orphan from age 6 in a very patrilineal, very patriarchal and very tribal society must have been a social death sentence. Muhammad could have reacted by seething with resentment and lashing out at the world. He could have turned on himself. Instead he became a paragon of compassion.\n\nWhen he first proclaimed prophecy, even his own uncle laughed at him, but he never laughed back. His followers were reviled, beaten and killed. He didn\u2019t strike back. Rather he ran from one town to another, like Hagar at Paran, desperate to find his people refuge. Twelve years into his religious mission, in the year 622, he was forced to flee his native Mecca and arrived a refugee in Medina \u2014 but the people who chased him there didn\u2019t leave him be. Not long after finding safe harbor, he was forced to take up arms, time and again, to defend his faith, his community, and himself.\n\nBut even as he did, he remained dedicated to building a society that would provide the inclusion he (and his followers) had been deprived of. The old Muslims from Mecca had just met the new Muslims from Medina, and Muhammad paired them off, each responsible for the other as they worked to make Medina flourish. This was hard work, and represents the most misunderstood part of Muhammad\u2019s life: Taking Jesus as their template, many critics wonder how a leader who pursues politics can still be a religious model.\n\nWhen terrorists struck New York and Washington in 2001 I was horrified, scared and bewildered. The Muhammad I revered bore no resemblance to the Muhammad they claimed. In their view, Muhammad was a conqueror first, a politician and a general second, and a man of faith last, and least.\n\nThis is a gross misunderstanding of his life, and an inversion of the message he actually preached. When he had nowhere else to turn, when he couldn\u2019t find anyone to protect his community, then \u2014 and only then \u2014 did he take up arms to defend his faith.\n\nBut the politics he attempted are instructive. In one of his first pronouncements in Medina, he pledged that the Muslim community would defend the native Jewish community from any of its enemies, and declared Medina to be one nation of two faiths, a profound and unusual gesture of pluralism and tolerance."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "MARK ATWOOD LAWRENCE", "title": "Nonfiction: The Disaster That Was the Vietnam War", "description": "Max Hastings\u2019s \u201cVietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975\u201d condemns all sides for corruption, cynicism and outright cruelty.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/books/review/max-hastings-vietnam.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/books/review/25Lawrence/25Lawrence-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:01:03Z", "content": "The book also excoriates the South Vietnamese.

Rejecting recent scholarship suggesting that leaders in Saigon may have had more legitimacy than often supposed, Hastings berates them as corrupt autocrats reliant on the United States and uninterested in the welfare of their people. Nguyen Cao Ky, for one, was \u201cremote as a Martian\u201d from his nation\u2019s vast peasantry when he served as prime minister from 1965 to 1967. As for the South Vietnamese military, Hastings sympathizes with ordinary soldiers and acknowledges that they sometimes fought well. But he dismisses most of their officers as inept careerists with scant regard for the hardships faced by their troops.\n\nFor all that, Hastings\u2019s judgment falls most harshly on the Communists. Drawing on new sources from Vietnam and recent studies of Hanoi\u2019s decision-making, he condemns America\u2019s adversaries as ruthless ideologues willing to spill any amount of blood to conquer the South. Ho Chi Minh, often romanticized as an amiable nationalist, was in fact a merciless despot who inflicted \u201csystemic cruelties\u201d on his people. Even worse was Le Duan, the little-known zealot who displaced Ho in the early 1960s as North Vietnam\u2019s chief warlord and climbed a \u201cmountain of his people\u2019s corpses\u201d to final victory over the South in 1975.\n\nThat victory ended three decades of war but also brought new waves of repression and deprivation for the Vietnamese. Hundreds of thousands rendered their verdict on the new order, Hastings notes, by risking their lives to flee, often in rickety boats. Those who stayed behind, he adds, made their opinions clear when they quickly embraced the West after the regime, confronting the failures of its iron rule, finally relaxed its grip in the late 1980s.\n\nThe main problem with Hastings\u2019s focus on the human toll of the war is his tendency to underplay the motives that led all sides to consider it worth waging. The result is sometimes to flatten decision makers into callous villains and everyone else, both soldiers and civilians, into victims. On the American side, for example, we learn little about the geopolitical calculations that led presidents from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon to fixate on the need to stop Communist expansion in Southeast Asia. Nor does Hastings have much to say about the pervasive anti-Communism that drove so many Americans to back intervention.\n\nOn the other side, Hastings only skims the surface of the economic and social injustices that fueled the rebellion against the South Vietnamese government and made Communism a plausible, if not broadly appealing, path for the nation\u2019s development. To be sure, Hastings acknowledges that the Communists \u201cworked with the grain of rural society,\u201d catering more successfully than the Saigon government to the everyday grievances that fueled unrest. But he never nails down how much importance to attach to this observation, instead emphasizing Hanoi\u2019s reliance on violence, coercion and propaganda to achieve victory.\n\nHastings could have written a more complete account by addressing these themes in greater detail. Actually, closer attention to the big ideas that drove each side might have reinforced his central point by underlining how much damage was done in the name of competing ideologies that meshed poorly with the needs of Vietnamese society. But Hastings is hardly wrong to place the emphasis on consequences rather than motives. In fact, he deserves enormous credit for helping us, half a century after the peak of the fighting, to see beyond old arguments about which side was right.

One of the removed articles, published in October 2011, concerns the now-familiar allegation that Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels had an affair. The rumor had appeared on The Dirty, an Arizona-based gossip website, and was later picked up by the celebrity magazine Life & Style, which ran a 2-page spread under the headline, \u201cDid Donald CHEAT?\u201d (The question was not actually answered.)\n\nTwo days later, Gossip Cop published a piece citing denials from both parties. An unnamed representative for Mr. Trump, identified hours later as Michael D. Cohen, described the rumor as \u201ctotally untrue and ridiculous.\u201d An unnamed attorney for Ms. Daniels, identified years later as Keith M.

Confronted with the question of whether Mr. Trump and Ms. Daniels had a secret affair, the site did what most outlets would do: Ask both parties for comment and publish their responses. But lawyers and publicists are not always forthcoming about their own clients. Nor are the clients themselves. Indeed, around the same time Ms. Daniels denied the affair to Gossip Cop, she told other outlets, including The Dirty and In Touch, the exact opposite.\n\nIn the seven years since the rumor of this affair surfaced, journalists have gathered evidence of its likelihood. Federal investigators have indicted Mr. Trump\u2019s former attorney, Mr. Cohen, over payments to Ms. Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, saying they violated federal campaign finance laws. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election spawned the inquiry into Mr. Cohen\u2019s payments, has not turned in a final report but House Democrats, who take control of the lower chamber in January, plan to investigate the president\u2019s role in paying Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal for their silence. Ms. Daniels\u2019 defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump, which could unearth even more detail, awaits judgment before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Moving from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, partly so Bianca can pursue vaguely defined career opportunities of her own, she and Adonis spend more time with his mother, Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad). When Rocky steps back from training, Adonis reaches out to Duke (Wood Harris), whose father was always in Apollo\u2019s corner. Rocky\u2019s estrangement from his own son, Robert, hangs over the movie, part of its weather system of loss and regret.\n\nThose are crucial features in the \u201cCreed\u201d universe. The chance to revisit the geopolitics of \u201cRocky IV\u201d in light of current Russo-American relations has been (wisely) passed up in favor of more personal concerns. And from the beginning, the \u201cRocky\u201d movies at their best have always embraced the power of defeat. Rocky lost to Apollo in \u201cRocky\u201d; Adonis lost to whatshisname in \u201cCreed.\u201d\n\nLosing doesn\u2019t make you a better person. It makes you a person. The cruelty and tragedy of the Dragos lies in their denial of this fact. Ivan, after Rocky beat him, suffered a kind of living death, stripped of his dignity and identity by a pitiless system. He has brought up his son in a private version of that world, teaching the younger man that if he doesn\u2019t win, he\u2019s nobody.\n\nAnd who, meanwhile, is Adonis Creed? Jordan and Caple explore that question through a series of loose, mood-driven passages that highlight Adonis\u2019s loneliness and uncertainty as well as his discipline and decency. Though he doesn\u2019t quite achieve Coogler\u2019s balance of poetic intensity and laid-back naturalism, Caple proves to be both a capable fight choreographer and a deft orchestrator of emotions. The climactic fight arrives on a tide of feelings and ends with a flood of tears.\n\nOn the way, it\u2019s the moments of intimacy, pain and humor that make \u201cCreed II\u201d a solid and satisfying experience. Underneath the boxing epic is a warm, poignant hangout with a young couple and the elders who watch over them.

You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.\n\nIs Nancy Pelosi in trouble or not?\n\nFrom reading the news coverage, it\u2019s hard to know, because reporters themselves aren\u2019t sure how much danger she is in of losing her role as the House Democratic leader. Here\u2019s what we do know:\n\nAs many as 22 Democrats who will be in the House come January have signaled some level of opposition to Pelosi, which would be enough to keep her from becoming speaker of the House. Of those 22: 16 signed a letter released yesterday explaining their opposition, including one (Ben McAdams of Utah) whose race remains undecided; five more have publicly announced opposition without signing the letter; and one (Marcia Fudge of Ohio) has also signaled opposition and might run for the speaker post herself.\n\nDemocrats will have somewhere between 232 and 235 seats in the House next year, depending on the outcome of three close races. Pelosi would need 218 votes to ensure herself a House majority \u2014 and victory. With apologies for introducing arithmetic to your morning, 232 (or 235) minus 22 clearly equals fewer than 218.\n\nBut Pelosi doesn\u2019t necessarily need to win them all over. If some of her critics vote \u201cpresent\u201d rather than against her, they won\u2019t be counted in the final tally, on either side \u2014 and the number she will need for a House majority would drop below 218.\n\nHer critics have also left themselves just a bit of wiggle room. Yesterday\u2019s letter calls for \u201cnew leadership,\u201d not a new speaker, as Julie Hirschfeld Davis of The Times points out, which means they could ultimately accept other changes to the party\u2019s House structure. Pelosi, for example, could make changes to party rules that would grant more power to rank-and-file members, as Matt Glassman, a Georgetown political scientist, has said .

On Nov. 7, a gunman killed a dozen people in Thousand Oaks, near the Rams\u2019 training facility and offices. Then deadly wildfires raged nearby, forcing some players, coaches and staff out of their homes.\n\nThe Rams managed to beat the Seattle Seahawks at home last Sunday, then flew to Colorado Springs to train at altitude in preparation for Monday\u2019s game, which was scheduled to be played in Mexico City.

Even when bureaucracies endorse a new idea, officials often fear change and jealously guard their turf. Many a good idea has been studied to death.\n\nBut this time might be different. The World Food Program and Unicef are enthusiastic, to the point of running joint pilot programs to test the idea in West Africa. \u201cWe are tremendously supportive,\u201d said Lauren Landis, the director of nutrition of the World Food Program. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s time for a revolution in the way we address acute malnutrition.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how malnourished children have been treated until now: If the child has a complication, such as pneumonia or fever, he or she goes to the hospital. Uncomplicated cases are separated into two categories, severe or moderate. (The test can be a weight/height ratio, the presence of marked water retention in the feet or the circumference of the mid upper arm.)\n\nUnicef treats severe cases, usually giving children Plumpy\u2019Nut packets to take home. The child must come back every week for a checkup and more packets. Children with moderate malnutrition go to a World Food Program feeding center, where they can get food on site and take-home food, often a corn-soy blend, to supplement the family diet.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? You name it.\n\nA large majority of malnourished children can\u2019t reach either program. \u201cMothers have to walk for hours, and even if they get there, the service might not be available,\u201d said Mesfin Teklu Tessema, senior director of health for the I.R.C.\n\nWhen programs do exist, a mother has no idea which one to go to. \u201cThe referral between programs doesn\u2019t always work,\u201d Ms. Landis said. And it\u2019s hard to make a weekly trip. \u201cIt\u2019s common to relapse if the mother is not able to bring the child every week to get the Plumpy\u2019Nut,\u201d said Grace Funnell, associate director of nutrition and health at Action Against Hunger.\n\nSince money is short, it is focused on treating severe cases. That means many children get no treatment for malnutrition until they deteriorate to the point where it is severe. This endangers children and creates extra costs, because they might need hospitalization. It also leads to a lot of relapses, because children can, in effect, be cut off treatment once they are only moderately malnourished."}, {"source": {"id": "the-new-york-times", "name": "The New York Times"}, "author": "AMANDA SIEBERT", "title": "d: Canada\u2019s Grand Cannabis Experiment Has Set Scientists Free", "description": "Legalization will vastly expand our understanding of the ancient drug plant and how it can improve lives.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/opinion/cannabis-science-legal-marijuana-canada.html", "urlToImage": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/opinion/00siebertWeb/00siebertWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:00:03Z", "content": "Enter Tilray, which, in a rare first this September, was approved by the Drug Enforcement Administration to supply cannabis extract from Canada to a California neurologist whos developing a treatment for tremors in the elderly.

And after a catastrophic year, insurers are not allowed to raise rates right away, but must phase in the increase over 20 years.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s fires, United Policyholders, an advocacy group, heard from homeowners who had received letters from their insurers, stating that their coverage would end in 45 days. The group set to work with regulators and lawmakers on a legislative package that would have required insurers to seek state approval before pulling out of high-risk areas, mandated discounts to policyholders who fireproofed their homes and given regulators the power to make sure that insurers\u2019 wildfire models were sound.\n\nThe only provision that became law was a two-year moratorium barring insurers from dropping policyholders for two years after a \u201ccovered disaster,\u201d said Amy Bach, the group\u2019s executive director.\n\nInsurers are also stepping up home inspections, she said, sometimes disqualifying houses with risks they hadn\u2019t cared about before.\n\nWhen that happens, the owner must try to find coverage elsewhere, possibly from a \u201cnon-admitted\u201d insurer, one that does not meet the state\u2019s regulatory standards.

If all else fails, they can get insurance from California\u2019s property insurer of last resort, the FAIR Plan.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nThe FAIR Plan was set up in 1968, after riots prompted property insurers to pull out of the Watts section of Los Angeles.

It was a scene so perfectly Gangwon it could have been a scroll painting.\n\nOf mountains and a monk\n\nI hadn\u2019t taken a two-hour night bus to Sokcho from Gangneung to see a hotel waterpark, though. My personal must-do of the trip was to hike in Seoraksan National Park, home to the region\u2019s highest mountain, and legendary fall foliage. I\u2019d missed peak leaf peeping by a week or two, but there were still a few trees that looked like they\u2019d been dipped in red and yellow Kool-Aid.\n\nAt the top of the park\u2019s cable car was a 20-minute climb to a rock face known as Gwongeumseong Fortress, the highest peak in the park and bare, with the exception of an occasional pine, bent over from the wind. I saw a woman hiking in heels, and a couple in matching red, black, and white, Mickey-Mouse-themed outfits. The only safety barriers between selfie-takers and precipitous cliffs were little four-inch signs featuring a tumbling purple cartoon bear and the words \u201cdrop\u201d or \u201cfall.\u201d\n\nThere were also Jenga-like towers of stacked stones, left behind by previous visitors engaged in a Buddhist meditative tradition I\u2019d seen practiced all over the province. The day before, at Woljeongsa temple on another mountain near Pyeongchang, Hahna and I had watched a little boy stack his stones, then clasp his hands in prayer and wish for \u201cgrandpa to be happy in heaven.\u201d\n\nBack at the cable car, I spotted a sign reading, \u201cAallack Temple,\u201d with an arrow pointing down a steep set of stairs no one else seemed to be taking. Metal gave way to slabs of stone laid flat between tree roots. Instead of a railing there were thick ropes attached to poles, and with so much slack and weight from recent rain I had to bend down to grab them. The sensation was less like walking on stairs than rappelling, sliding the rope through my hands and hoping that it would catch me if I fell the rest of the way, which seemed possible.\n\nAfter many more stairs than I\u2019d anticipated, I reached the temple, a single structure overlooking a valley. The steps continued to a dead end. Just as I was taking my final photos and heading back, a bald man in gray robes with a big smile poked his head out of the door.\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d the monk asked, in hesitant English.\n\n\u201cU.S.A.\u201d I told him.

There, a meeting was planned with the local county governor, or bupati, to discuss a similar situation.\n\nNorth of Sintang, a grim commercial town of concrete and rebar at a fork in the Kapuas River, two palm plantations were being developed on peatland bogs. These plantations, too, were located on tracts that Indonesian government maps had at one time explicitly labeled protected peatland, which should have placed them under the moratorium on palm development. The maps had since been changed. Yet there was no mistaking that this was peatland: Paths submerged into black goop, teams of dragonflies swarmed over the hot water, reeds and forest grew from their depths. And here came a flatbed truck, carrying an excavator toward the entrance gate, where a guard in a neatly pressed dark blue uniform turned away visitors.\n\nThe permits named two obscure companies, but a villager at the gate told us that he thought both plantations were run by the same company and that it had been clearing the forest for months. It\u2019s not uncommon for Indonesian companies to use layers of subsidiaries to hide their connections to illegal palm operations. \u201cWe call them shadow companies,\u201d said Eric Wakker, a founder of Aidenvironment Asia, an environmental consultancy that has investigated the two plantations. Upon further scrutiny, it appeared that the two companies may indeed have been linked to the Salim Group. They shared a business address with a Salim subsidiary in Jakarta and employed the same plantation managers in Kalimantan. Salim was also a buyer of the palm that would come from the Sintang plantations.\n\nThe connection matters because the Salim Group has benefited from more than $1.5 billion in loans and capital from foreign investors, including the American firms BlackRock and Vanguard, and Salim companies have pledged that their palm oil is not a product of recent deforestation or peatland destruction. Satellite images from 2017 confirmed that the forests on the Sintang plantations were now virtually gone. (A Salim Group executive, Mark Wakeford, declined to comment about the Sintang companies.)\n\nAt the bupati\u2019s house, an elegant, 19th-century Dutch-built compound bursting with tropical flowers, I pressed him to explain how these peatland forests could be cut down when the government insisted that such land clearing had stopped. The bupati, a doctor named Jarot, had moved to Borneo from Java and had developed a local reputation as a conservationist. He greeted us jovially, barefoot and dressed in bluejeans and a crisp, untucked blue button-down shirt. He said the rural districts must balance economic growth with sustainability, and while he has pledged to control corruption and illegal permits, he also described himself as helpless against the currents of a central government that is close to the big corporations and constantly changes both the rules and the playing field. United Nations forest programs pay communities to leave their trees in the ground. Such funding would help him strike a better balance here, he said, casually shrugging off the plantation case I asked about. \u201cWe do what we can do,\u201d Jarot said. \u201cWe cannot do it by ourselves. ... We need a fiscal incentive.\u201d\n\nAn aide offered a more nuanced explanation. The phrases \u201cpeatland\u201d and \u201cforest\u201d have distinct legal meanings in Indonesia, he claimed; not all treed areas are forests, and not all peat-filled bogs are peatland. In the strictest legal sense, he was correct. The Sintang regency alone, according to Indonesian government estimates, contains more than 160,000 acres of old-growth, heavily treed land that it has not designated as \u201cforest\u201d under the law and more than 86,000 acres of nondesignated peatland. After a request from the companies, the government maps for Sintang were revised to change the peatland borders. New maps show the bog boundaries tracing perfect 90-degree angles and straight lines \u2014 lines that happen to match the boundaries of the companies\u2019 land holdings. How do you account for such details in a life-cycle analysis?\n\n7. \u2018It Was a Mistake\u2019\n\nThis September, with late-season heat pounding Washington, Zenzi Suhadi cleared security at the Russell Senate Office Building, preparing to brief Senate aides about the impact that palm-oil development was having on Indonesia\u2019s environment.

The growing secessionist movement fueled factional clashes among the Saudi-backed coalition earlier this year and has complicated the prospects of a peaceful resolution in Yemen. While the international committee has acknowledged the council\u2019s demands, they are not a part of the upcoming peace talks in Sweden, according to United Nations officials.\n\n[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]\n\nDespite the event\u2019s being called off, hundreds turned out in the square. The atmosphere was celebratory but tense. Marching bands wove through crowds of men chewing mouthfuls of qat, a plant that induces a mild high.

On the main stage, political leaders, both men and women, were giving impassioned speeches to a steadily growing crowd. The women\u2019s section made up half the stage.

Hundreds of people dispersed within seconds, leaving the square almost empty. The activists moved to a quiet street behind the stage, all while shaking their heads and chuckling.

And the more we can pop these stories into girls\u2019 heads, the more choices we give them.\n\nOBAMA That\u2019s why girls have to be educated. If they\u2019re hanging on to bad choices because they don\u2019t have the power to walk away, that\u2019s how stuff never gets fixed. And I always put myself in a position where I knew I didn\u2019t need to be there: I don\u2019t need this job. I love my husband, but I don\u2019t need him to pay my bills or put my kids through school. That gives me leverage in life.\n\nGALANES How is marriage easier after the White House?\n\nOBAMA We celebrated our 26th anniversary this year. Now, I love my children. Obviously, I wanted them. But they are a big interruption to the process of a relationship. I joke with my girls: \u201cYou really got in the way of my marriage!\u201d But now, after the presidency and the other jobs, the financial stress, we\u2019re getting to that point in our 50s when we\u2019re rediscovering each other. We\u2019re the same people. But we went through this maze. We\u2019ve got cuts on our backs, but we\u2019re still holding hands. And it\u2019s like: \u201cAre you good? You lost a shoe. Leave it. Leave the shoe.\u201d But we\u2019re still there together.\n\nGALANES Last question: First lady is a job that comes with recriminations: She gave too many parties, she didn\u2019t give enough parties. Who elected her? When did you reach the point, both of you, when you thought: This is my voice, and I\u2019m good with it?\n\nROSS About two years ago, I realized my life was actually mine. And that\u2019s been a big unfolding for me. Here I am! And then all of a sudden you\u2019re tripping on a new thing. Then there\u2019s a new arrival and a new dark hallway.

What did you think of the violence? Did you find it too heavy-handed?\n\nBARONE The violence did feel heavy-handed. I reread the portions of the book that correspond to these first episodes, and Ferrante mentions beatings, however severe, only in passing. In the first episode, the attack outside church against Signor Peluso is prolonged and graphic; on the page, it doesn\u2019t take up more than a couple of haunting sentences.\n\nSTANFORD I think the graphic violence really worked. There was something almost ethereal about that scene where he\u2019s thrown against the wall and the girls run out of the church to see. The swelling Max Richter score, the camerawork emphasizing how little the girls are, their desire to watch this really shocking violence, it all combined to create a moment that was even more powerful \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 than in the book. I do also think the explicitness might be a symptom of how the show has to set a precedent of normalized violence quite quickly.\n\nSAFRONOVA What I found striking \u2014 and this is very true to the books too \u2014 is how flagrant the female anger is.

It\u2019s an Italian clich\u00e9, but for a reason: The story in my immigrant family is that my great-grandmother, who stayed behind in her tiny Italian town, lived well into her 100s but died only because she fell after yelling out her kitchen window. I appreciate how often Costanzo shows people doing this; you get the impression that the background noise of vocalizing matriarchs is as constant as bird song.

It seems like they were both cast, in part, for their staring ability: Ludovica Nasti (who plays Lila) has these eyes like glowing orbs and Elisa del Genio (Len\u00f9) has such long eyelashes.

Kyrsten Sinema became the first Arizona Democrat to win a Senate election in 30 years after Trump drove her Republican predecessor, Jeff Flake, not to run for re-election. Trump encouraged a successful primary challenge against the (very conservative) Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina. The Republican victor then lost in an upset to Democrat Joe Cunningham. In the Kansas gubernatorial primary, Trump backed far-right Kris Kobach, known for his voter suppression schemes. Kobach won that race but lost the general; Kansas\u2019s new governor will be a Democratic woman.\n\nThe spectacle of Trump\u2019s political failure unfolded as his policy failures are starting to harm more voters\u2019 lives.

Trump let himself be manipulated by North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un. He made the United States a literal laughingstock before the world.\n\nSo far, the people most directly affected by this record of misrule haven\u2019t been able to vote in national elections.

In 2006 the journal Science Communication published a research paper with the title \u201cA Longitudinal Study of The New York Times Science Times Section,\u201d which noted that the section had \u201cestablished itself as an important, reliable, and influential guide to the world of science, medicine, and technology.\u201d\n\nBy 2013 the number of weekly science sections had fallen to just 19, as newsprint-ads evaporated, the newspaper industry shrank, and the conversations shifted online. And there, it seems, the world of science is being discussed more vigorously than ever, on dozens of science news websites \u2014 Aeon, Ars Technica, Gizmodo, Live Science, Nautilus, Quanta, Stat, Undark, Vox \u2014 and a social-media landscape humming with the voices of engaging scientists and deeply informed writers.\n\nImage The first Science Times cover, published on November 14, 1978.

The mass shootings in Parkland and Las Vegas were elaborately staged hoaxes, much like the moon landing, according to countless YouTube videos. The recent wildfires in California were started with lasers, by people scheming to reduce the population.\n\nThese and other nuggets of misinformation are shared and amplified by cynics, the credulous and bots, thriving on the air of false equivalence. And, online, they live forever. Andrew Wakefield\u2019s research purporting to link vaccines to autism was discredited two decades ago, but it continues to circulate and infect, frightening parents into not vaccinating their children, and fueling the resurgence of measles.
