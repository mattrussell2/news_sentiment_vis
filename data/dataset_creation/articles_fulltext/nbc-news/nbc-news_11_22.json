These unmet expectations, at either end, are a breeding ground for messy emotions, ranging from anger to frustration to sadness.\n\n\u201cUnmet expectations strain all relationships, but the stakes are high in in-law relationships because they are stakeholders in your marriage, and your children if you decide to have them, as well as your household and even issues like finances,\u201d says Dr. Durvasula.\n\nTo help bridge the gap between differing expectations, make sure you and your partner are on the same page, especially on topics that are particularly contentious with your in-laws.\n\n\u201cA united front makes a huge difference,\u201d says Dr. Durvasula. \u201cYou do not want to be figuring things out on the fly with your spouse while in the cross hairs of your in-laws. If you and your spouse are on the same page, then you can take the path of least resistance with in-laws and just smile politely and say \u2018sure,\u2019 but then do things the way that you and your spouse believe is appropriate for your relationship.\u201d\n\nSome Dynamics Are More Complicated Than Others\n\nWhile many in-law relationship issues are the result of overstepping boundaries or not meeting expectations, sometimes other factors are at play. Stereotypically and often anecdotally, we see particularly embittered relationships between mother-in-law and her son or daughter in law. Jean, a 58 year old from Indiana who is using her middle name and prefers not to disclose her first and last name for obvious reasons, told NBC News BETTER that she\u2019s been struggling to find a happy ground with her mother-in-law for two decades.\n\n\u201cOne time, when the kids were little, I had dirty dishes in the sink and a pile of clean laundry dumped on the couch to be folded. My mother-in-law came in, looked at it, and said, \u2018I don't know how people live like this.\u2019 She didn't feel the least bit bad about how unfiltered that remark was or how bad it would make me feel,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cAlso, her hostility, domineering ways and criticism were so hard to live with [when visiting her] that I'd be in tears the last couple of days.\u201d\n\nWilson says that she\u2019s received comments from her mother-in-law expressing that she feels like she lost her son. Such feelings aren\u2019t so rare, according to Dr. Laurie Ann Levin, a clinical psychologist with decades of experience dissecting familial stressors.\n\nA mother-in-law\u2019s often unconscious fear is that her son has or will forsake her for his wife, preferring her family and her family holiday functions.\n\n\u201cA mother-in-law\u2019s often unconscious fear is that her son has or will forsake her for his wife, preferring her family and her family holiday functions, thereby leaving less time, attention and care for his mother,\u201d she notes. In the face of a nitpicky mother-in-law who harbors such feelings, she says it\u2019s vital to remind yourself of your true nature and worth. (We\u2019ve also outlined some helpful tips below.)\n\nThere are some extreme outliers to consider in regard to complicated in-law relationships, as well. These include widely varying (and excessively vocal) ideologies, mental illness and substance abuse. Minimal, controlled contact is ideal here, though in dangerous situations it may be best to practice complete avoidance. A therapist can help you navigate this more strategically.\n\nFive Ways to Get Through Holiday Dinner with Difficult In-Laws\n\nIn many cases, conflict is a two-way street. While you may not be able to smooth things over entirely, you can improve a complicated relationship with your in-laws by starting with the below advice.\n\nPrepare yourself mentally: If your father-in-law always brings up politics or your mother-in-law always makes passive aggressive digs, don\u2019t expect anything different the next time you see each other. \u201cIf you are mentally prepared for their nonsense, it may still hurt, but it won't be startling,\u201d says Dr. Durvasula. It's like putting on a heavy coat on a very cold day, it's still chilly, but at least you are prepared and can endure it for a little while.\u201d\n\nIf your father-in-law always brings up politics or your mother-in-law always makes passive aggressive digs, don\u2019t expect anything different the next time you see each other. \u201cIf you are mentally prepared for their nonsense, it may still hurt, but it won't be startling,\u201d says Dr. Durvasula. It's like putting on a heavy coat on a very cold day, it's still chilly, but at least you are prepared and can endure it for a little while.\u201d Set clear start and end times: Sometimes the biggest stress is not being able to get away or feeling guilted into staying longer. Kyle, a 34 year old from Arizona who is also using his middle name, told NBC News BETTER that keeping a firm schedule helps prevent trouble with his mother-in-law. Their relationship has been deeply contentious since they first met. \u201cWe often schedule time to see her and let her know we have to be somewhere else by a certain time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey get time alone with us, but it's limited so we don't all go crazy. This is a compromise.\u201d\n\nSometimes the biggest stress is not being able to get away or feeling guilted into staying longer.

A great default topic is how much you love or are proud of their daughter or son. \u201cThis is an easy way to connect with your in-law and to set the tone for your interaction for the occasion,\u201d says Dr. Colleen Mullen, a psychologist and family therapist.\n\nIf you know of topics that trigger your in-laws, avoid those topics completely.

It may feel disingenuous, but anyone can find one nice thing to say about someone. Even if the in-laws are gunning for a fight, you can snip those wires.\u201d\n\nHoliday survival guide\n\nWant more tips like these?

Her opponent, the secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton, attacked Hyde-Smith during their debate on Tuesday, claiming her comments are about \u201canother blackeye for Mississippi.\u201d WalMart also decided to withdraw its financial support for the senator, who was appointed six months ago to replace the retiring Thad Cochran. With the runoff slated for Nov. 27, a photograph of Hyde-Smith wearing a Confederate cap has cast further doubt on her racial views.\n\nWith a racially insensitive wisecrack about public hanging (Democratic opponent Mike Espy is black), Hyde-Smith put back in play what once looked like an assured seat in the heart of Trump\u2019s Dixie base.\n\nThe much-awaited televised debate proved to be a walking-on-eggshells experience for both of the nervous candidates. The incumbent\u2019s main message was that voters should go to Trump.com to get tickets to a 5 p.m. election-eve rally in Tupelo, home of the Presley birthplace museum, and an 8 p.m. rally in Biloxi, a coastal gambling resort, on Nov. 26. Espy hammered at her record on health care and depicted her as rooted in the state\u2019s racist past. Neither candidate scored a knockout. Hyde-Smith focused on \u201cconservative Mississippi values\u201d as defined by Trump. Espy\u2019s performance, while competent, came short of the obvious breakthrough that would provide a needed turnout boost.\n\nThe White House and Mississippi Republicans are laboring to make these Trump trips look like something other than a rescue mission. Indeed, a come-from-behind victory by Espy would be historic on two scores. First, he would be the first black Mississippi senator since Reconstruction. Clearly, Espy is trying to duplicate the watershed victory scored by Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama last December, when crossover voters in usually Republican suburbs ignored Trump\u2019s last-ditch on behalf of accused pedophile Roy Moore.\n\nAn Espy win would also prove that the anti-Trump tide that cost the president\u2019s party control of the House of Representatives on November 6 is now lifting Democratic boats in states even more conservative than Alabama. But Trump\u2019s chances of rallying his core believers is better in heavily rural Mississippi than it was in Alabama, where Republican women in the affluent suburbs of Birmingham, Montgomery, Huntsville and Tuscaloosa were a key contingent of Jones\u2019 21,000 vote margin.\n\nThe conventional wisdom in Mississippi is that the race has tightened but Espy will fall short of the 25 to 30 percent of white voters Democratic strategists think he needs to win. Curtis Wilkie, a veteran Boston Globe political reporter now teaching journalism at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, says polls have detected no GOP suburban crossover movement in Mississippi. It may also be difficult for Espy to get Obama-like turnout numbers in black precincts, another factor in Jones\u2019 victory. \u201cI\u2019ve characterized Mike Espy\u2019s chances as those of having to draw to an inside straight,\u201d Wilkie said. If disinterested Republicans stay home because of the odd timing of the election that could help Espy, said Wilkie, but Mississippi\u2019s white Republicans have not historically not been willing to cross over to vote for black Democrats.\n\nAnother (admittedly biased) Mississippi expert, former Republican Sen. Trent Lott, argued the Trump visit will in fact inoculate the GOP against apathy. \"That's why Trump's coming in,\" he told Politico. Trump \u201cwill get massive attention, and it will really make people aware this election is a week from this coming Tuesday and it's big, so don't forget to come out and vote.'\"\n\nJoe Trippi, the architect of Jones\u2019 victory in Alabama and a consultant for the Espy campaign, discussed the race with unusual candor. \u201cI think we\u2019re behind but it\u2019s very low single digits,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be 52 to 48 or can we eke it out by 23,000, the way Doug Jones did in Alabama? I definitely think it\u2019s going to be a tight thing.\u201d Turnout is going to be the biggest factor, but he argued that the timing of Hyde-Smith\u2019s stumbles can only help the Espy campaign. \u201cHer gaffes have her coming down and we\u2019re coming up.\u201d\n\nAs in Alabama, Trippi said, a split in the Republican ranks is helping the Democrat. Supporters of Hyde-Smith\u2019s primary opponent, State Senator Chris McDaniels, are sulking. Moreover, the Republican nominee is a lackluster personality who does not inspire Trump-like devotion. So could Trump\u2019s appearances the day before the election add a jolt of enthusiasm, as Lott claimed? Not necessarily. \u201cThat really helped Roy Moore in Alabama,\u201d Trippi said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s an unknown. I don\u2019t know if he can come down and get people excited about her.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith is certainly not distancing herself from the president. In fact, her use of weaponized, dog-whistle rhetoric echoes Trump\u2019s own style. In addition to the public hanging comment, Hyde-Smith also seemed to embrace voter suppression, which has a sordid history of black disfranchisement, after saying the state should make it harder for \u201cliberal folks\u201d to vote. (Hyde-Smith said she was joking.)\n\nWhen Espy tried to attack her as a relic of a bygone era on Tuesday night, she responded with a Trump-style apology to \u201canyone who was offended\u201d and cast herself as the wronged party whose words had been \u201ctwisted\u201d to make her appear racist. For his part, Espy seemed unsettled when she brought up a $750,000 lobbying fee he received by suspect sources in the Ivory Coast cocoa industry.\n\nAll in all, the debate ended in something of a tie after Espy failed to mount an energetic, sustained attack on her as a throwback to segregationist times. After the holiday break, \"factor x\" becomes Trump\u2019s visit, and whether it will energize Mississippi\u2019s usual Republican majority \u2014 or provoke enough backlash to jolt Mississippians into an Alabama-like, bi-racial and bi-partisan push for the Democratic challenger."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": null, "description": "Thousands lined the streets to brave one of the coldest Thanksgivings in over a century as balloons floated and marchers danced in celebration of the 92nd Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/slideshow/new-york-city-braves-cold-macy-s-92nd-thanksgiving-day-n939336", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2655861/ss-181122-macys-thanksgiving-parade-15_8181838bd39692e2b2de6143f34dd66c.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T19:14:00Z", "content": "A turkey float gets underway during the 92nd Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York on Nov. 22, 2018.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Responding to questions about Saudi Arabia's role in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that the U.S. can't afford to punish foreign nations for killing people.\n\n\"Do people really want me to give up hundreds of thousands of jobs?\" he said. \"And frankly, if we went by this standard, we wouldn\u2019t be able to have anybody who\u2019s an ally, because look at what happens all over the world.\"\n\nNBC and other outlets have reported that the CIA recently determined, reportedly with \"high confidence,\" that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey in early October.\n\nTrump rejected that characterization in an exchange with reporters in Palm Beach, Fla., where he is spending the Thanksgiving holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort, but said the American relationship with Riyadh wouldn't be affected even if the crown prince is responsible for Khashoggi's death.\n\n\"Whether he did or whether he didn\u2019t, he denies it vehemently,\" Trump said. \"The CIA doesn\u2019t say they did it. They do point out certain things, and in pointing out those things, you can conclude that maybe he did or maybe he didn\u2019t.\"\n\nThe aftermath of the killing bothered him, he said, but he argued the CIA gave him conflicting information about the act.\n\n\"I hate the cover-up. And I will tell you this, the crown prince hates it more than I do,\" he said. \"And they have vehemently deny it. The CIA points it both ways. As I said, maybe he did, maybe he didn't. But I will say very strongly that it's a very important ally.\"\n\nBy design, intelligence community analyses don't reach conclusions. Instead, analysts provide evidence and a degree of confidence about their judgments, along with information about any uncertainties.\n\nAfter Trump tweeted a statement of support for Saudi rulers Wednesday, Washington Post publisher and CEO Fred Ryan slammed Trump in an op-ed.\n\n\"A clear and dangerous message has been sent to tyrants around the world: Flash enough money in front of the president of the United States, and you can literally get away with murder,\" Ryan wrote.\n\nPressed Thursday on whether his message to foreign leaders is that they can act with impunity, Trump said \"no.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \" Saudi Arabia has been a longtime strategic partner. They're investing hundreds of billions of dollars in our country. I mean hundreds of billions. They're keeping the oil prices low.\"\n\nThe U.S Bureau of Economic Analysis does not report figures for Saudi Arabia's direct investment in the U.S. to avoid revealing information about specific companies. While overall data is not available, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative reports that \"Saudi Arabia's direct investment in the U.S. is led by real estate, information services, and retail trade.\"\n\nFinancial transactions between the two countries amounted to a negative number in 2017 \u2014 about $161 million in Riyadh's favor \u2014 according to BEA.\n\nSaudi Arabia spent about $9 billion on U.S. arms between 2013 and 2017, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, but Trump has said erroneously that Saudi rulers are ready to spend many multiples of that in the coming years \u2014 up to $450 billion in goods, including $110 billion in military equipment. Saudi Arabia's annual gross domestic product has been below $700 billion in each of the last three years."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Julie Moreau", "title": "Religious exemption laws exacerbating foster and adoption 'crisis,' report finds", "description": "Laws allowing child placement agencies to deny LGBTQ prospective parents are worsening the current \u201cchild welfare crisis,\u201d according to a new report.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/religious-exemption-laws-exacerbating-foster-adoption-crisis-report-finds-n939326", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2654746/181121-holding-child-hand-stock-cs-1234p_355a9344b5ac02a50249a51130a32147.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T17:23:00Z", "content": "Nov. 22, 2018 / 5:23 PM GMT Religious exemption laws allowing child placement agencies to deny LGBTQ prospective parents from fostering or adopting are exacerbating the current child welfare crisis, according to a new report from the liberal Center for Americ\u2026 [+11400 chars]", "fulltext": "By Julie Moreau\n\nReligious exemption laws allowing child placement agencies to deny LGBTQ prospective parents from fostering or adopting are exacerbating the current \u201cchild welfare crisis,\u201d according to a new report from the liberal Center for American Progress (CAP), Voice for Adoption and the North American Council on Adoptable Children.\n\n\u201cTurning away LGBTQ prospective parents by asserting a religious exemption or taking advantage of a lack of state nondiscrimination law is a violation of this group\u2019s rights,\u201d the report states. \u201cIt also negatively affects the already strained child welfare system, ultimately harming the children in its care.\u201d\n\n\u201cCHILD WELFARE CRISIS\u201d\n\nIn 2017, there were about 443,000 children in foster care across the U.S., according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Each year, some 50,000 children are adopted through the U.S. child welfare system, but about 20,000 others \u201cage out\u201d before being placed with an adoptive family, according to HHS.\n\nIn addition to helping place more children in permanent homes, the CAP report claims taxpayers could save hundreds of millions of dollars by removing barriers blocking LGBTQ people from becoming adoptive parents.\n\n\u201cEach child adopted from foster care, even with adoption assistance support, reduces state and federal spending by almost $29,000 annually when compared with those children who remain in foster care,\u201d the report states. \u201cIf the child welfare system finds adoptive families for just 1,000 ten-year-old children who would otherwise have aged out of foster care at 18, a rough estimate suggests it would save $230 million of taxpayer money over eight years.\u201d\n\nThe report warns that turning qualified prospective parents away will add unnecessary stress to \u201can already stressed system,\u201d and it notes LGBTQ people represent a an \u201cimportant subgroup of potential parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame-sex couples raising children are seven times more likely to be raising a foster child and seven times more likely to be raising an adopted child than their different-sex counterparts,\u201d the report states, citing data from the UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute. \u201cThey are also more likely to adopt older children and children with special needs, who are statistically less likely to be adopted.\u201d\n\nDespite the needs of children in the child welfare system and the willingness of LGBTQ prospective parents, the report notes there are significant barriers in place that are preventing them from being matched.\n\n\u201cWAIVER TO DISCRIMINATE\"\n\nAt present, 10 states \u2014 Alabama, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Virginia \u2014 have laws allowing religiously affiliated placement agencies to turn away LGBTQ parents, and even refuse to place LGBTQ children.\n\nFrank J. Bewkes, a policy analyst at the Center for American Progress and one of the report\u2019s authors, told NBC News these religious exemption laws \u201creduce the pool of qualified parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not in the position to turn any qualified parents away,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not in the best interest of children \u2026 [There are] too many people in care and not enough homes to take them in.\u201d\n\nThe report cites research that demonstrates children raised in same-sex households are just as emotionally and physically healthy those raised by straight couples.\n\nThe first legislation to allow religious exemptions for child placement agencies was passed in North Dakota in 2003, which allowed agencies to refuse to participate in placement that violated the agency\u2019s \u201cwritten religious or moral convictions or policies,\u201d and still receive government contracts. But after nearly a decade without other states following suit, such laws have been gaining momentum. Two states passed such a law between 2012 and 2016, three did so in 2017 and four in 2018 alone, according to CAP.\n\nThese laws have the potential to affect not only LGBTQ prospective parents but any prospective parent who does not fit the agency\u2019s definition of a suitable family. In March of this year, South Carolina made headlines when Miracle Hill, the largest foster agency in the state, turned away Beth Lesser and her husband for being Jewish, referring them to a different agency.\n\n\u201cTo say we can go somewhere else is like saying you can\u2019t use this state-funded hospital, but you can go to the one down the street,\u201d Lesser told the Greenville News.\n\nEarlier this week, 75 civil rights, child welfare and faith organizations sent a letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar asking him not to grant South Carolina\u2019s request to exempt Miracle Hill from federal nondiscrimination law.\n\n\u201cGranting South Carolina\u2019s request would upend HHS\u2019s responsibility to ensure that states are properly caring for the nation\u2019s children by explicitly permitting a provider to put its own interests ahead of the best interests and explicit rights of the children in its care,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIn addition, an exemption would sanction taxpayer-funded discrimination by organizations providing a government service, violating a host of constitutional and statutory protections.\u201d\n\nCurrey Cook, an attorney at LGBTQ civil rights group Lambda Legal said the implications of granting \u201ca waiver to discriminate\u201d for organizations funded with taxpayer dollars, such as Miracle Hill, \u201care enormous.\u201d\u201cTo allow faith-based agencies to put their beliefs ahead of the wellbeing of children in the state\u2019s care is not only unconstitutional, but more importantly, it is harmful to the very children agencies are paid by the government to care for,\u201d Cook said.\n\nThese religious exemption proposals are also being introduced at the federal level. In July of this year, Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., unsuccessfully introduced an amendment to the 2019 appropriations bill that, had it passed, would have slashed 15 percent of the federal funding for child welfare services programs to states that enforced nondiscrimination protections in child placement.\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wy., and Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., introduced last year the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, which aims to prevent the federal government from taking action against any child welfare agency that \u201cdeclines to provide, facilitate, or refer for a child welfare service that conflicts with the provider's sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.\u201d The bill is still pending in the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources.\n\nIn a statement supporting the bill, Rep. Kelly called it \u201c100 percent inclusive and child-focused\u201d and noted that \u201cfaith-based organizations have historically played a heroic role in caring for our country\u2019s most vulnerable kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no good reason why any of these care providers should be disqualified from working with their government to serve America\u2019s families simply because of their deeply-rooted religious beliefs,\u201d Kelly said in the statement. \u201cWhen it comes to helping kids and making families stronger, all service providers \u2013 religious or otherwise \u2013 should have a seat at the table. That\u2019s what this bill is about.\"\n\nBewkes cautioned that we have not seen the last of religious exemption laws. He said he expects a \u201cramping up\u201d of proposed legislation in the next legislative session. \u201cThis is one of the battlegrounds for LGBTQ equality,\u201d he added.\n\nThe lion's share of U.S. states no have explicit protections for LGBTQ prospective parents, according to Movement Advancement Project (MAP), an LGBTQ think tank. Three states (California, New Jersey and Rhode Island) and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination by adoption and foster care agencies and officials based on both sexual orientation and gender identity, and an additional six states (Oregon, Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland and Nevada) offer some adoption and foster care discrimination protections based sexual orientation alone, according to MAP.\n\nTHE COURTS\n\nRecently, religiously affiliated child placement agencies and LGBTQ prospective parents have been turning to the courts to decide their fate as foster and adoptive parents.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Catholic Social Services is suing the city for the right to receive government contracts even if it refuses to place children with LGBTQ parents, in violation of the city\u2019s nondiscrimination policy. Thus far a federal judge has rejected the Catholic Social Services\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, holding that the city\u2019s nondiscrimination law does not violate the organization\u2019s rights.\n\nAnd in Texas, a lesbian couple was turned away by a foster agency because they did not \u201cmirror the holy family.\u201d Lambda Legal is suing the HHS and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on behalf of the couple for \u201cunlawful funding\u201d of child welfare organizations that accept federal dollars but refuse to work with same-sex couples. The case is still pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n\nCASE STUDIES: TEXAS & MICHIGAN\n\nThe CAP report undertakes case studies of Michigan and Texas, two large states that have adopted relatively broad religious exemption laws. Bewkes described the situation in these states as \u201cpretty bleak,\u201d and the report describes an acute placement crisis in each of them.\n\n\u201cNationwide, 28 percent of youth had been in foster care for two or more years in fiscal year 2016,\u201d according to the CAP report, which cited HHS data. \u201cIn that same period, 38 percent of Texas youth and 52 percent of Michigan youth had been in care for two or more years.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, which has had a religious exemption law for child placement agencies since 2017, the number of foster and adoptive homes working with licensed child placement agencies has decreased nearly 40 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to data from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.\n\nAnd in Michigan, which has had a religious exemption law for child placement agencies since 2015, the number of licensed foster homes dropped by more than 20 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe report also highlights how LGBTQ-accepting agencies in these states may be inaccessible to some prospective parents because of geography.\n\n\u201cWe found they are actually spaced quite far apart,\u201d Bewkes said of LGBTQ-accepting agencies. \u201cIf you\u2019re in El Paso, there are no agencies that have explicit policies that are welcoming. You\u2019d have to drive 350 miles to Lubbock, Texas, to find an agency that is welcoming,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthat\u2019s in a different time zone.\u201d\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nCAP ended its report with recommendations for the federal government, state governments and state-licensed child-placing agencies to help address the current \u201cchild welfare crisis.\u201d\n\nThe organization recommended that a law be passed at the federal level that \u201cexplicitly prohibits state-licensed child placing agencies that receive federal funding, or that contract with those that do, from discriminating against or turning away qualified LGBTQ prospective foster or adoptive parents.\u201d And, in the absence of federal protection, CAP recommended that \u201cstate legislatures should pass into law explicit nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ prospective parents \u2014 both adoptive and foster.\u201d\n\nThe report also recommended that LGBTQ-welcoming child-placement agencies make their policies explicit by, for example, posting nondiscrimination policies to websites, as these are often the first place prospective parents go when considering fostering or adoption. The report also encouraged states and child placement agencies to increase their recruitment efforts to all prospective parents, especially those who identity as LGBTQ, as this population has a higher propensity to foster and adopt.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dennis Romero", "title": "California communities bring Thanksgiving to wildfire survivors", "description": "Volunteers planned to serve thousands of meals to evacuees after wildfires devastate California communities in Butte and Ventura counties.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-communities-band-together-bring-thanksgiving-wildfire-survivors-n939306", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2655746/181122-chico-thanksgiving-mc-15273_6aa87aab3ec90fbb0384b8aa723a19c7.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:59:17Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

If they have to. I hope they don't have to.\"\n\nHe added that he will \"close entry\" at the border if he deems it necessary to prevent immigration. Just before the midterm elections this month, Trump sent thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to the advance of caravans of migrants through Latin America.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo reinforced the president's message in a statement Thursday, saying: \"The caravans will not be permitted to enter the United States. There are real dangers to the safety and human rights of migrants from those who would prey on them.\"\n\nCritics of Trump's use-of-force policy have said it runs the risk of entering a thicket of federal statutes, constitutional principles and international law \u2014 most notably the Posse Comitatus Act, which, with some exceptions, precludes the military from domestic law enforcement activities.\n\n\"The Posse Comitatus Act keeps the President from using troops to enforce domestic policy.

Soon after the event sold out, tickets popped up on online re-sellers, with prices reportedly rising into the thousands. They were quickly taken down after complaints from the venue.\n\nObama\u2019s one appearance in Paris, on Dec. 5, was announced just before tickets went on sale. They were in high demand, though the event didn\u2019t sell out as quickly as in London.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Nissan Motor Co. fired Carlos Ghosn as chairman Thursday in a dramatic end to the powerful executive's nearly two decade long reign at the Japanese automaker after his arrest for alleged financial improprieties.\n\nIn an hours-long meeting, the company's board of directors voted unanimously to dismiss Ghosn as chairman and as a representative director, Nissan said in a statement. It said its own internal investigation, prompted by a whistleblower, found serious misconduct including under-reporting of his income and misuse of company assets.\n\nIt was a stunning downfall for one of the biggest figures in the auto industry, a man who helped drive turnarounds at both France's Renault SA and at Nissan and then managed an alliance between them that sold 10.6 million cars last year, besting its rivals.\n\nNissan said in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock Exchange that its investigation uncovered misuse of company investment funds and expense money for personal gain.\n\nEarlier this week, Renault voted to keep Ghosn as its chief executive but appointed Thierry Bollore, its chief operating officer, as its interim chief.\n\nAnother Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, was arrested on suspicion of collaborating in the wrongdoing and also will be dismissed as a representative director, Nissan said. Their replacements will be decided later, it said.\n\nGhosn, 64, is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to Tokyo prosecutors.\n\nNissan's board consists of nine members, including Ghosn and Greg Kelly. The seven other board members voted at the meeting, including two members from Nissan and two from Renault.\n\nGhosn and Kelly will remain on Nissan's board for now as that decision will be up to shareholders. No date has been set yet for a shareholders meeting.\n\nGhosn is also chairman at Mitsubishi Motors Corp., a smaller Japanese automaker that's partnering with the Renault-Nissan alliance and plans to hold a board meeting next week.\n\nGhosn has been held since his arrest Monday at a Tokyo detention center, under the same Spartan conditions as other detainees, Tokyo deputy prosecutor Shin Kukimoto told reporters Thursday. He gave few details about the case.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither has been charged so far.\n\nThe maximum penalty upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, an $89,000 fine, or both.\n\nA French citizen born in Brazil, Ghosn became something of a corporate superstar in Japan as he led Nissan's revival from near bankruptcy after Renault sent him to help in 1999.\n\nGhosn served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two automakers simultaneously. In 2016, he also became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan, maker of the Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models, in the U.S. in 1988. He became a board member in 2012. His background is in human resources and alliance management.\n\nAnalysts say the future of Nissan's alliance with Renault may be at stake, though Nissan's statement Thursday said the company's leadership was determined to minimize the impact from Ghosn's case on the partnership. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, and Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault.\n\n\"The longstanding alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,\" the Nissan statement in English said, stressing the alliance rather than the misdeeds.\n\nIt also said the board will study setting up a third-party committee to beef up governance in management and compensation at Nissan.\n\nCEO Hiroto Saikawa, in a lengthy news conference on Monday, said too much power had been concentrated in Ghosn, with too little credit given to the many others working for the company's success.\n\nJanet Lewis, managing director and head of industrial research, Asia, at Macquarie Capital Securities in Tokyo, said in an interview that an adjustment was needed to give Nissan more say in the alliance with Renault.\n\nThe partnership remains crucial for both companies, she said, since apart from financial ties the companies share technology and parts.\n\nThe automakers need to be more like roommates than a married couple, \"So they have to find a way to share their house and share all of their expertise because it's very necessary in terms of new automotive technology, new platform development,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"They need to figure out how they can continue this and still live happily together in the same house.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Iconic stretch of Berlin Wall wins protection from developers", "description": "After the wall fell in 1989, more than 100 international artists painted over its concrete transforming it into the world's longest outdoor gallery.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/berlin-wall-s-east-side-gallery-wins-protection-developers-n939311", "urlToImage": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/3452138/1000x563_3452138.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:15:00Z", "content": "MAINZ, Germany The longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall has been saved from the threat of demolition.

But in the end, we choose not to be that family, we choose to not attack each other.\u201d\n\nThere remain widespread political differences in the region, but data suggests that fear of Thanksgiving food fights may be overblown, even though people on the fringes may sound louder.\n\nThe NBC News exit poll on Election Day showed that a plurality of Michigan voters, 39 percent, identified as moderates, compared to conservatives at 34 percent and liberals at 27 percent. The share of moderate voters was even higher in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nAnd there is much to bring the two sides together. Overall, more than 44 percent of the voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ranked healthcare as the most important issue, and a plurality of voters in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin said Trump was not a factor in their vote.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a change because it can\u2019t be all this hate anymore. There\u2019s a boatload of Trump haters and Republican haters,\u201d explained Tammy\u2019s brother Derek, 51, a retired veteran who voted for Trump in 2016 and Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. It was the only Democrat vote I cast.\u201d\n\nWhitmer garnered 2.1 million votes in a state Trump won in 2016 by one percent. She promised to fight divisiveness during her victory speech. \u201cIn Michigan we want to build bridges,\u201d she said. \u201cWe choose bridges over walls.\u201d\n\nNationally, Democrats have so far picked up a net of 38 seats in the House of Representatives, bringing their tally to 234 and retaking control of the lower chamber. Republicans on the other hand stood their ground on the Senate, holding on to 52 seats with one contest in Mississippi yet to be determined.\n\n\u201cThe majority of families I deal with on the road are low-income African Americans that live in a blue state\u2026We definitely talk about life, crime and healthcare,\u201d said the youngest sibling David Cingano, 49, who customizes wheelchairs for people with disabilities, and describes himself as very independent. \u201cUntil I feel confident in a candidate and their views, I will stay on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nDespite drastically opposing views, the Ciganos actually all belong to the roughly two-thirds of Americans who don\u2019t identify with political extremes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much disrespect. It\u2019s across the board,\u201d Tammy Cingano said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Republican or Democrat, if you\u2019re independent, Green Party\u2026people need to be respectful.\u201d\n\nAs a recent report from the non-profit group More In Common showed, a sense of belonging to a political tribe is often a greater factor in divisiveness than ideology. More than polarization, it is tribalism that is at play. Those on the far left represent 8 percent of the U.S., compared to 6 percent on the far right. Most Americans actually share more common ground than fights on Facebook might suggest, including support for stricter gun laws, a belief that racism is a still a problem, and a sense that the immigration system is completely broken, even if they disagree on how to solve it.\n\nMost of the Cinganos reside in Isabella County, which swung from Obama over Romney in 2012 to Trump over Clinton in 2016.\n\n\u201cAmerica was built on opposing ideas,\u201d said Toni Sessions, who is married to Tammy. \u201cIt\u2019s actually compromise.\u201d\n\nAnd as Tammy responded: \u201cWe\u2019ve been family a whole lot longer than Trump\u2019s been in office... and pretty much that trumps everything else.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Brexit could leave the U.K. worse off, finance minister admits", "description": "\"We will have a politically chaotic situation\" without a deal, finance minister Philip Hammond said.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/no-deal-brexit-would-cost-britain-tens-billions-finance-minister-n939291", "urlToImage": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/3451962/1000x563_3451962.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:59:21Z", "content": "LONDON Brexit could leave the U.K. worse off than if voters had chosen to remain in the European Union, the country's finance minister admitted Wednesday amid deepening political chaos over the process.

Not a city at all, but a federal district, named for\u2026 Christopher Columbus. And, lest we forget (or ignore) history, the man opened the slave trade to the western hemisphere, slaughtered and enslaved Natives and set into motion a genocide that, even today, we can see in the numbers: We, indigenous peoples, are the smallest racial minority in our ancestral lands.\n\nThis means that we are more often the smallest racial minority in almost every setting: Work, of course, and especially at schools \u2014 which is unfortunate because another antiquated tradition of November resurrected every year is teachers dressing up their students as pilgrims and Indians.\n\nIt should be clear that this practice is not a cute, harmless affair, but an American tradition that has lifelong consequences. Those kids will grow up believing that it is perfectly acceptable to dress up as white stereotypes about another race, especially Natives \u2014 but it tends to carry over to other racist costumes like blackface and geishas.\n\nNative Americans taking part in the protest against the Redskins team name, carry tribal banners outside the stadium that the Washington Redskins will play the Minnesota Vikings in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 2, 2014. John McDonnell / The Washington Post/Getty Images file\n\nSo it is no surprise \u2014 at least to the indigenous peoples of these shores \u2014 that when we see fans of the Washington NFL team (or the Kansas City Chiefs or Cleveland Indians) in face paint and headdresses, they were likely once kids who were told that it\u2019s just good ol\u2019 American fun to \u201cplay Indian.\u201d\n\nMost of my Native relatives and friends look forward to the end of November because it means the annual autumn hostilities \u2014 from Halloween costumes to baseball season to fantasies of indigenous settler cooperation \u2014 are coming to a close, for at least a little while. Indeed, those hostilities are always there, but at least the colonialist victory lap every fall shuts down for a bit.\n\nBut just before the close of November, there\u2019s one more insult the U.S. feels it must deal to Natives, like a quintessential middle finger as one walks away: Native American Heritage Day itself.\n\nIt should be the annual time of year during which this century\u2019s Americans celebrate and honor and learn about the innumerable accomplishments and contributions indigenous peoples have given and still give to the world. After all, we gave you chocolate, tobacco and even the antagonists for the racist Hollywood westerns people seem to love so much.\n\nAnd it would make sense that such a day would be officially held in early November \u2014 when kids are in school \u2014 so they can learn about Billy Mills, the Native Olympian and Gold Medalist, read about Wilma Mankiller, the first female chief of the Cherokee Nation, and even today learn about Debra Haaland and Sharice Davids, the first two Native women to ever be elected to Congress.\n\nBut no: Native American Heritage Day was officially lumped together with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Black Friday. And I can\u2019t imagine people standing in long lines in the frigid cold outside of some big-box retailer turning to a fellow shopper who they most likely elbowed in the ribs and saying, \u201cOh, hey, by the way, Happy Native American Heritage Day!\u201d\n\nNovember, at least for Natives, is not the most pleasant month but, perhaps in time \u2014 with the proliferation of social media, which allows people to read our wisdom in real-time (follow #NativeTwitter for the latest), and as we push ourselves deeper into the American dialogue \u2014 sports teams won\u2019t be named after racist slurs, teachers won\u2019t dress up their kiddos as white stereotypes of Indians and people will reshape their beloved Thanksgiving holiday to reflect history, not myths and lies.\n\nUntil then, I reject the banal excuse of ignorance, especially in an age when we have access \u2014 literally at our finger tips \u2014 to rivers of data, first-hand accounts and uncontested history. This is not simple ignorance anymore. White ignorance of Native Americans is a direct insult, and it needs to end.

Even when gently parodying itself, there's still a level of sincerity at the core. Its latest animated offering is no different. Just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" was created by the minds behind Disney Animation Studios, the division of the entertainment behemoth that originally put it on the map. A follow-up to the 2012 surprise hit \u201cWreck-It Ralph,\u201d this sequel sends up all the company\u2019s own clich\u00e9s while reminding everyone that all Disney princesses, no matter where they come from, are just trying to follow their dreams.\n\nThis sequel sends up all the company\u2019s own clich\u00e9s while reminding everyone that all Disney princesses, no matter where they come from, are just trying to follow their dreams.\n\nWith Disney poised to merge with 20th Century Fox in less than a year, the company stands as the largest entertainment monopoly in the world. And yet, endless remakes and franchises have recently left something to be desired as far original content is concerned. Disney Animation Studios made the company iconic with stories that told a clear moral tale of family and heart, packaged and marketed to the hilt. But the overall company\u2019s acquisition of other studios and a new habit of co-opting these once-animated stories for CGI-heavy \u201clive action\u201d remakes has meant that the animation department has been overlooked these last few years. While fans fawn over Pixar\u2019s next \u201cToy Story\u201d installment and Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cDumbo\u201d trailers, Disney Animation Studios has had to get creative about where the niche is for them to fill.\n\nEnter the \u201cWreck-It Ralph\u201d series, which takes the \u201cToy Story\u201d formula and moves it to the dawn of the digital era. The toys who come to life when the kids aren\u2019t around are now arcade characters who wander out of their video games after closing. The original story, which was equal parts nostalgia, gentle parody and heartfelt buddy parable, centered around Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) from \u201cFix-It Felix Jr\u201d (a parody of the 1980s game \u201cRampage\u201d). Ralph was paired up with Princess Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from \u201cSugar Rush\u201d (a parody of every female-oriented game mixed with a parody of every racing game of the era) who together form an unlikely friendship so touching, the film was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\u201cRalph Breaks The Internet\u201d takes this 1980s parody and moves it to the present, as the old school arcade finally gets WiFi. When Vanellope\u2019s game is damaged, and the only replacement part can be found on e-Bay, Ralph decides to take his little friend out into the great internet unknown to find it before her console is dismantled and sold for parts.\n\nThe trip that ensues feels like a digital version of \u201cFantastic Voyage,\u201d or Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out.\u201d Human avatars are enveloped in a little bubble packet of data and flown through wires to the global World Wide Web, citified. Here. the social media district is dominated by a large blue book with the word FACE on it and Twitter birds fly through the air spouting endless cat pictures. Google\u2019s skyscraper dominates the landscape and eBay is a warehouse of enormous size. A trip to the \u201cdark Web\u201d finds everyone in dark glasses and hoodies, as unscrupulous pop-up ad dealers try to make a buck or two selling virus-laden cons. And, of course, over in one corner stands the entertainment district, dominated by a large pink castle and its flagship site, Oh My Disney.\n\nRalph, discovering he needs money to buy the Sugar Rush part from eBay, starts making viral videos on \u201cBuzzTube\u201d \u2014 an opportunity for the filmmakers to reference every viral YouTube video of the last few years. Meanwhile, Vanellope and her racer\u2019s heart discovers the latest generation of racing games when she enters \u201cSlaughter Race\u201d (an obvious parody of \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d), where the bad guys are led by Shank (Gal Gadot, doing a take on her \u201cFast & Furious\u201d character).\n\nThe premise is creative enough, and anyone who understands internet culture will appreciate the attention to detail. But the movie really shines when its main characters enter Disney\u2019s colonized corner of the internet. Part of being an entertainment monopoly today means being Extremely Online, and Disney\u2019s send-up of its own digital footprint is clearly done with love. The security at Disney is run by Stormtroopers, Buzz Lightyear stands outside entertaining the crowds, an animated Stan Lee wanders out of the Marvel building and endless comic-con panels run day and night.\n\nThe main draws, though, are the iconic princesses that made Disney a household name. The company released footage of these princess scenes ahead of the film's release, and it represents a microcosm of everything that makes the movie work overall: A visual feast of meticulously crafted puns that avoids self-indulgence by managing to always gently push the plot forward.\n\nCleverness aside, at the end of the day the real emotional center of this movie is (still) the friendship between Vanellope and Ralph. They may get into fights and internet viruses may try to exploit their insecurities, but in the end, theirs is the timeless love story of a big, strong self-declared hero and an itty-bitty princess with a dream to drive free. It\u2019s just another variation on the same story Disney Animation Studios has been telling since 1939, but it still works all these generations later."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jonathan Allen", "title": "Trump, ripping into Roberts, says judges make 'our Country unsafe'", "description": "President Donald Trump extended his feud with Chief Justice John Roberts and the federal judiciary on Thanksgiving, saying judges make the country unsafe.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-ripping-roberts-says-judges-make-our-country-unsafe-n939286", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2655571/181122-trump-roberts-mc-1235_1e09c082b2982a09fe26b50ab70e51a8.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T13:30:31Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Jonathan Allen\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 While millions of Americans prepared to eat roast turkey for Thanksgiving Thursday, President Donald Trump used a holiday call to U.S. troops and Twitter to roast Chief Justice John Roberts and the federal courts.\n\n\"Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Judges must not Legislate Security ...and Safety at the Border, or anywhere else. They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe. Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB! If not there will be only bedlam, chaos, injury and death. We want the Constitution as written!\"\n\nThe leaders of two of the three branches of the federal government have clashed this week over Trump's rebuke of a federal judge who ruled that the administration must consider claims of asylum no matter where migrants cross the U.S. border.\n\nWhile Trump didn\u2019t name-check Roberts in his conference call with members of military Thursday morning, he chided the Ninth Circuit.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of bad court decisions from the Ninth Circuit, which has become a big thorn in our side,\u201d he said of the federal appellate circuit most often targeted for derision by conservatives \u201cIt's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border. It's a disgrace.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is spending his holiday in Florida, chose to speak with members of the armed forces by conference call after taking criticism from some veterans for not yet having visited troops in a war zone.\n\nIn a subsequent exchange with reporters, Trump took a softer tone toward Roberts.\n\n\u201cChief Justice John Roberts \u2014 I like him and I respect him \u2014 but I think we have to use some common sense,\u201d the president said.\n\nTrump ripped the federal district court judge who issued the ruling, Jon S. Tigar, as an \"Obama judge,\" bashed the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, even though Tigar sits a level below the federal appellate tier, and generally argued that the judiciary both has no role in maintaining national security and is endangering America through its rulings.\n\nThe characterization of Tigar as an \"Obama judge\" clearly got under the skin of the chief justice, who, for the first time, pushed back on Trump.\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts told the Associated Press Wednesday. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n\nAnd, he added, \"the independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nTrump initially responded to that Wednesday on Twitter.\n\n\"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u2018Obama judges,\u2019 and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,\" Trump wrote on twitter.\n\nIn Trump's Thursday tweets, his citation of a 79 percent Supreme Court reversal rate in cases taken up from the Ninth Circuit is accurate for a specific set of years but does not provide the context that the Ninth doesn't have the highest rate among circuits.\n\nIn the October 2017 term, the reversal rate for the Ninth Circuit was 86 percent and the rate for all circuit courts was 76 percent \u2014 with three circuits being reversed 100 percent of the time \u2014 according to an analysis by SCOTUSblog.\n\nIncluding the two posts on the judiciary, Trump had tweeted four times before 7:30 a.m. on Thursday. \"HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL!\" he wrote shortly before tearing into federal judges."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Maria Shriver", "title": "Maria Shriver: Americans, step up and join the 'Inner Peace Corps' this Thanksgiving", "description": "We are the American family, and many of us are hurting and feeling isolated, lonely and scared.

He\u2019s a bright and creative writer and thinker, so I pay attention when he sends me a message.\n\nMatthew said: \u201cI think we should create an \u2018Inner Peace Corps.\u2019 Our world is in a mental and emotional health crisis and I feel like we need a corps of therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, spiritual teachers, meditation coaches, etc. to be organized in a massive and coordinated volunteer effort. In times of tragedy and grief, they can help people process their pain, trauma, grief and stress, and help them connect to their core emotions in a healthy way.\u201d\n\nAn \u201cInner Peace Corps.\u201d I just love this concept! Maybe it could also be called an \u201cInner Health Corps\u201d or an \u201cInner Service Corps,\u201d but regardless of the name, I think this idea is brilliant and spot-on. I hope you agree.\n\nI\u2019m going to work with Matthew on this idea. I\u2019m also going to pitch it to my state\u2019s new governor, who says his role model is my dad (founder of the Peace Corps). Yes, there are already so many wonderful organizations working around-the-clock to care for those who need support (and I hope you\u2019ll reach out to one of them if you feel that you are in need right now). But, I think we could really benefit from coming together to build one go-to resource \u2014 a place where anyone who is hurting on the inside could quickly get support from someone else.\n\nWe could definitely use a service corps like this in California right now, where so many people have been displaced due to the fires sweeping across our state. These families need resources and financial aid, but they also need emotional support at this time of grieving and loss. For them, I have no doubt that this upcoming holiday will be incredibly difficult.\n\nOne thing they need is to know that they aren\u2019t alone and that there are people out there who want to help. It\u2019s up to all of us to let them know that we\u2019re here for them.\n\nA national inner service corps like this could bring us together in so many ways. It could serve as a reminder that we are capable of serving one another \u2014 no matter our background, no matter our skillset. And, by answering that call of service, we would become more connected and more united by our shared humanity. We would also be reminded that we are one nation \u2014 one people \u2014 and that we all have it within us to help and heal another person. Our collective suffering could become collective healing, and it could start today. We just have to step up and serve.\n\nI don\u2019t think that we have to wait for this idea to become something official. We can start this Thanksgiving week as we gather around tables to share meals and give thanks. Connect to those sitting at your table. Listen to what they have to say. Ask them how they are doing (as in, \u201chow are you really doing?\u201d). And, if you have room at your table, then reach out and invite others to join you. So many people are alone during the holidays and would really appreciate your invitation.\n\nThanksgiving is my favorite holiday, by far. It involves everything I love: family, food, gratitude and conversation. I\u2019m going to throw this idea out to everyone who gathers at my table this Thursday and ask them if they would be of service in the \u201cInner Peace Corps.\u201d I\u2019m going to ask them to be of service to the people in their own lives by listening to a friend or reaching out to someone who may be lonely or in need.\n\nMatthew is right, our country is in trouble. People are hurting. They are spending a record number of hours immersed in their virtual worlds because their real worlds don\u2019t feel safe, welcoming or loving.\n\nOne of the best cures for our anxiety and our loneliness, though, is connection. It\u2019s building community and keeping those you love close. Sometimes all you need is dinner with someone who \u201cgets you,\u201d or who is willing to listen, to feel like everything is okay.\n\nIf you know someone who might be alone, then invite them into your life. Ask them to join you around your kitchen table. If you have family that you haven\u2019t seen in awhile, then clear your schedule. I\u2019m so grateful that my brother Bobby and his family are making the effort to come to Los Angeles to be with me and my family for Thanksgiving. I\u2019m also blessed that I just got to spend a few days with my cousins Sydney and Caroline.\n\nMoments with those I love, and whom I know love me, really fill me up. They make me feel grounded, safe and understood. They really serve me and help build up my inner life. I\u2019m sure those moments do the same for you.\n\nSo, make room for the people in your life. Make time. See yourself as a member of the \u201cInner Peace Corps.\u201d It\u2019s so important that we make the effort to gather \u2014 not just during the holidays, but during all times of the year.\n\nTogether, we can be of service to those who need some internal support. We are one big family, after all. We are the American family, and many of us are hurting and feeling isolated, lonely and scared.\n\nLet\u2019s step up. Let\u2019s serve one another. Let\u2019s be friends. Let\u2019s broaden our table and invite more people to gather with us. There\u2019s no better time than this week to begin.\n\nAre you in?\n\nThis essay first appeared in Maria Shriver\u2019s Sunday Paper, a free weekly newsletter offering news and views for a meaningful life.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Tony Brown\n\nLONDON \u2014 When it comes to Thanksgiving dinner, everyone has their own take on the classics, ranging from the traditional fare to the turducken \u2014 chicken stuffed inside duck stuffed inside turkey.\n\nAt Hebert\u2019s Specialty Meats in Maurice, Louisiana, they\u2019ve been making this deboned delicacy since 1984, when a customer came in with three birds and a special request to put them all together.\n\nThe turducken has proved so popular that owner Quinn Hebert says they\u2019ll make more than 1,000 of them on Thursday, and the word was even added to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2014.\n\nBut bizarre dishes similar to the turducken were being served in Europe hundreds of years ago, experts say.\n\nThe royal courts of Burgundy and later the Tudor court of Henry VIII strove to outdo one another with show-stopping dishes aimed to highlight the power and wealth of the host.\n\nKitchens at Henry VIII\u2019s historic Hampton Court palace recently painstakingly recreated some of them using 15th century recipes, hand-made tools and old-world methods.\n\nOne of their boldest attempts is the cokyntryce \u2014 which bolted together a bird and a pig and could be considered an ancestor of the turducken.\n\nThe top half of a pig is joined to legs of a turkey to create a cokyntryce, with all of it covered in buttered paper to prevent burning during roasting. Richard Fitch / Historic Royal Palaces\n\nOver a full day, two workers at the palace carefully double-stitched three parts of a pig with two turkeys, with the heads of both animals sewed onto the ends.\n\nAfter using wire to position the cokyntryce in as life-like position as possible, the creation was spit-roasted for two hours on a hand-turned rotisserie, basted in a pancake batter and finally decorated and served.\n\n\u201cThese are not everyday meals but would\u2019ve been made for special occasions such as large feasts after a specific tournament, or treaty meetings and high holidays,\u201d says Richard Fitch, the historic kitchens manager at Hampton Court.\n\nThe finished version of a pig and turkey cokyntryce. Richard Fitch / Historic Royal Palaces\n\nHe suggested ice sculptures were the modern equivalent of these expensive spectacles of the past.\n\nWhen asked about how cokyntryce was to eat, Fitch quipped: \"What do you think it tasted like? We\u2019re not mucking with their DNA it\u2019s just half a turkey and half a pig sewn together.\"\n\nHe said that its stuffing or batter provided more flavor but added that \"it genuinely just tastes of turkey or pig depending on what part you take.\"\n\nWhile the cokyntryce and similar recipes, such as the Yorkshire Christmas Pie \u2014 an 18th century combination of stuffed pigeon, partridge, turkey and goose \u2014 have fallen out of fashion in Britain, the turducken appears to have a lasting place at Thanksgiving tables.\n\n\"It\u2019s just the thought of having a turkey, a duck and a chicken all together, it just makes people want it,\" Hebert said. \"If somebody likes duck, they eat the duck, if somebody don\u2019t like duck, they can eat the chicken.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "U.S.-Israeli man sentenced to 10 years over anti-Semitic bomb threats", "description": "An Israeli-American man was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Israel on Thursday for making about 2,000 hoax bomb threats that forced evacuations of U.S. Jewish community centers.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-israeli-man-sentenced-10-years-over-anti-semitic-n939281", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_12/1942381/jcc-ejo-032317_3e076b1e8e8864bfcb39e592dad803dd.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:23:27Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He was 106.\n\nChavez, who had been battling pneumonia, died in his sleep in the San Diego suburb of Poway, his daughter, Kathleen Chavez, told The Associated Press.\n\nAs recently as last May he had traveled to Washington, D.C., where he was honored on Memorial Day by President Donald Trump. The White House tweeted a statement after his death: \"We were honored to host him at the White House earlier this year. Thank you for your service to our great nation, Ray!\"\n\nDaniel Martinez, chief historian for the National Park Service at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, confirmed Wednesday that Chavez was the oldest survivor of the attack that killed 2,335 U.S. military personnel and 68 civilians.\n\n\"I still feel a loss,\" Chavez said during 2016 ceremonies marking the attack's 75th anniversary. \"We were all together. We were friends and brothers. I feel close to all of them.\"\n\nHours before the attack, he was aboard the minesweeper USS Condor as it patrolled the harbor's east entrance when he and others saw the periscope of a Japanese submarine. They notified a destroyer that sunk it shortly before Japanese bombers arrived to strafe the harbor.\n\nBy then Chavez, who had worked through the early morning hours, had gone to his nearby home to sleep, ordering his wife not to wake him because he had been up all night.\n\n\"It seemed like I only slept about 10 minutes when she called me and said, 'We're being attacked,' \" he recalled in 2016. \"And I said, 'Who is going to attack us?' \"\n\n\"She said, 'The Japanese are here, and they're attacking everything.' \"\n\nHe ran back to the harbor to find it in flames.\n\nChavez would spend the next week there, working around the clock sifting through the destruction that had crippled the U.S. Navy's Pacific fleet.\n\nLater he was assigned to the transport ship USS La Salle, ferrying troops, tanks and other equipment to war-torn islands across the Pacific, from Guadalcanal to Okinawa.\n\nAlthough never wounded, he left the military in 1945, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder that left him anxious and shaking.\n\nReturning to San Diego, where he had grown up, he took a job as a landscaper and groundskeeper, attributing the outdoors, a healthy diet and a strict workout program that he continued into his early 100s with restoring his health.\n\n\"He loved trees and he dearly loved plants and he knew everything about a plant or tree that you could possibly want to know,\" his daughter said Wednesday with a chuckle. \"And he finally retired when he was 95.\"\n\nStill, he would not talk about Pearl Harbor for decades. Then, on a last-minute whim, he decided to return to Hawaii in 1991 for ceremonies marking the attack's 50th anniversary.\n\n\"Then we did the 55th, the 60th, the 65th and the 70th, and from then on we went to every one,\" his daughter recalled, adding that until Chavez's health began to fail he had planned to attend this year's gathering next month.\n\nBorn March 12, 1912, in San Bernardino, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Chavez moved to San Diego as a child, where his family ran a wholesale flower business. He joined the Navy in 1938.\n\nIn his later years, as he became well-known as the attack's oldest military survivor, he'd be approached at memorial services and other events and asked for his autograph or to pose for pictures. He always maintained that those events were not about him, however, but about those who gave their lives.\n\n\"He'd just shrug his shoulders and shake his head and say, 'I was just doing my job,'\" said his daughter. \"He was just a very nice, quiet man. He never hollered about anything, and he was always pleasant to everybody.\"\n\nChavez was preceded in death by his wife, Margaret. His daughter is his only survivor.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday it is helping investigate an outbreak of adenovirus that has killed one student at the University of Maryland and sickened at least five more.\n\nOlivia Paregol, 18, died Nov. 18, according to an obituary. She was a freshman at the university and died after suffering respiratory symptoms typical of the virus, her father, Ian Paregol, told local television stations as well as the Baltimore Sun.\n\nAt least one of those affected by the outbreak was infected with adenovirus 7, a strain that can cause sometimes fatal pneumonia, the Maryland Department of Health said in a statement sent to NBC News. It is the same strain of adenovirus that has killed 11 patients at a long-term care facility in New Jersey.\n\nThe CDC said it is testing other specimens from the patients. Neither the CDC nor the Maryland health department said whether it was adenovirus 7 that killed Paregol.\n\nAdenoviruses are very common and can cause symptoms ranging from a cold to eye infections and sometimes stomach upset. Only a few of the 50 or so known strains cause serious disease but they include the adenovirus 7 strain.\n\nThe virus is not typically tracked by health officials so there are no statistics on how many people it makes sick every year, or how many it kills. But the adenovirus 4 and 7 strains have been linked with deadly outbreaks in the past and can be such a nuisance among new military recruits that they are now routinely vaccinated. The vaccine is only approved for military recruits.\n\nThe university is closed for the Thanksgiving holiday but confirmed the outbreak and the death on its website. \u201cThe Health Center staff has been on high alert and we have reached out to medical facilities in the area to heighten awareness of this illness,\u201d Dr. David McBride, the health center\u2019s director, said. \u201cWe offer our condolences during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nTwo different strains of adenoviruses are causing outbreaks in New Jersey \u2014 one at the Wanaque long term care facility and a second at a pediatric facility in Voorhees. The New Jersey health department says 35 people, mostly ill children, were infected in the Wanaque outbreak. Eleven have died. Twelve cases are reported in Voorhees, all with adenovirus 3, a strain that is not usually associated with serious illness.\n\nLike so many other viruses, adenoviruses spread easily, through touching, in the air via coughing and sneezing, and from touching contaminated surfaces, the CDC says. People who are not sick can still spread the virus to others if they are infected. The virus is not easy to kill.\n\n\u201cAdenoviruses are relatively resistant to common disinfectants and can be detected on surfaces, such as doorknobs, objects, and water of swimming pools and small lakes,\" the CDC said.\n\nIan Paregol was quoted as saying his daughter was taking immune suppressing drugs to treat Crohn\u2019s disease. That could have put her at higher risk of severe illness from an infection such as adenovirus. \u201cPeople with weakened immune systems are at high risk for developing severe illness caused by adenovirus infection,\u201d the CDC says on its website."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Support crew keeps firefighters fueled to fight the Camp Fire", "description": "More than 3,700 people are at the Cal Fire basecamp in Chico, California, to support firefighters in the battle against the Camp Fire.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/support-crew-keeps-firefighters-fueled-to-fight-the-camp-fire-1377564739617", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nc_kcra_firewx_181121.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T03:58:53Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Support crew keeps firefighters fueled to fight the Camp Fire copied!\n\nMore than 3,700 people are at the Cal Fire basecamp in Chico, California, to support firefighters in the battle against the Camp Fire.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Alex Johnson", "title": "Man tried to bribe ICE officer to deport his wife", "description": "Antonio Burgos offered $4,000 to have his wife and her child removed after he brought them to the United States from El Salvador, according to his guilty plea.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/oregon-man-tried-bribe-ice-officer-deport-his-wife-her-n939211", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2655366/181121-ice-customs-enforcement-ac-10p_33627f8924639d39dc414333fd37f0c5.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T03:39:12Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Alex Johnson\n\nA Portland, Oregon, man has pleaded guilty to trying to bribe an immigration official to deport his wife and her child from a previous relationship, according to court documents.\n\nThe man, Antonio Oswaldo Burgos, 48, agreed last month to plead guilty to one of three counts of bribery of a public official in exchange for a reduced sentence, according to federal grand jury documents that were unsealed after his plea hearing in Portland on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the plea deal, Burgos married the woman, who wasn't identified, in El Salvador. But after he brought the woman and her minor child to the United States, the \"marital relationship deteriorated,\" and the woman moved out with her child, it says.\n\nOn May 24, according to the plea deal, Burgos tailed a deportation officer from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in his car for almost 15 miles from the ICE office in Portland across the state line to the southern Washington city of Vancouver.\n\nWhen the ICE officer finally stopped in a parking lot, Burgos offered the officer $4,000 to deport his wife, saying they were divorcing and giving the officer his contact information, according to the plea deal. ICE investigators then set up a sting, and in two phone calls, Burgos again offered money \u2014 $3,000 this time \u2014 \"to remove [the woman] from the United States,\" according to the plea deal.\n\nThen, on June 6, Burgos met with the ICE officer in another parking lot and gave the officer $2,000, with a promise of $2,000 more once his wife was out of the country, the documents say. He was arrested on June 29.\n\n\"We rely upon our officers to perform their duties with integrity,\" Brad Bench, special agent in charge of the Seattle office of Homeland Security Investigations, said in a statement. \"This case should send a strong message that those who attempt to coerce a public official will be punished.\"\n\nHad Burgos been convicted at trial, he could have faced 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Sentencing was set for next May."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Phil Helsel, Steve Patterson", "title": "Death toll in Northern California fire rises to 83, but number of missing drops", "description": "Searchers found the remains of two more victims of the Camp Fire in Northern California, but officials narrowed a list of those unaccounted for to 563.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-toll-northern-california-fire-rises-83-number-missing-drops-n939196", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2655321/181121-camp-fire-aftermath-ac-843p_3183e1139ed28b30a4fd79a18330fb36.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T03:18:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.
