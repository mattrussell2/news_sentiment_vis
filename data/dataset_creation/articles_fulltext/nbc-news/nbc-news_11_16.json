The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Andrew Blankstein\n\nA Jordanian-born man faces at least 25 years in federal prison after being convicted in connection with an illegal arm-smuggling scheme that included plans to sell surface to-air missile systems and other military equipment to groups in countries that included Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, prosecutors said Friday.\n\nRami Najm Asad-Ghanem, 52, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was convicted by a jury on Thursday of conspiracy to use and transfer missile systems designed to destroy aircraft, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California in Los Angeles said.\n\nAsad-Ghanem was arrested on Dec. 8, 2015, by police in Greece. For the charge that he was convicted of on Thursday, he faces a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison, and he is scheduled to be sentenced on March 4.\n\nHe previously pleaded guilty late last month to another six charges including violating the Federal Arms Export Control Act, conspiracy, smuggling and money laundering, prosecutors said.\n\nThe government argued that Asad-Ghanem sought to broker and transfer anti-aircraft missiles between 2013 and 2015 to clients around the world, as well as procured the services of mercenary missile operators to a Libyan militant faction. Prosecutors said that as a part of that effort, he planned to offer them a $50,000 bonus if they could shoot down Libyan government aircraft, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nAt trial no direct evidence was presented that any of the missiles made it to any of the countries, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the case. Asad-Ghanem was living in Egypt at the time of the criminal offenses, prosecutors said.\n\nAsad-Ghanem\u2019s attorney, H. Dean Stewart, said only one Soviet-style Strela missile was recovered at an airport overseas but it was so old and rusty it could not have been fired. He said that the other allegations were based on aspirations.\n\n\"He's an international entrepreneur\" involved in construction and other goods shipments like water, Stewart said. \u201cWhatever it was he could make a profit of, he did\u201d and \u201cthis was just one small piece of all kinds of businesses,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nThe lawyer said none of the crimes happened within the United States, and \"the only connection is his U.S. citizenship.\" They plan to challenge the 25-year mandatory minimum sentence as unconstitutional.\n\nU.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Nick Hanna said in a statement that the case \"demonstrates the dangers of underground arms trafficking to the international community and to the security of U.S. forces operating abroad.\"\n\nHanna called it a \"complicated case\" that involved law enforcement authorities conducting an international investigation, and said the conviction \"is a clear message to arms dealers that there will be severe consequences for providing weapons of war through the black market.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Jonestown survivor recounts massacre 40 years later (Part 2)", "description": "Jackie Speier was a 28-year-old staffer for Rep.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Adam Edelman and Dartunorro Clark\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams on Friday ended her candidacy for governor more than a week after polls closed in Georgia and accused her opponent of \"appalling\" intentional efforts to suppress votes, which largely affected African-Americans.\n\nAbrams, who was running to become the nation's first black female governor, said it is clear that Republican Brian Kemp will be the state's next governor. However, she refused to concede and used her speech to rebuke the \"rotten and rigged\" election process, alleging \"systemic disenfranchisement\" at the hands of Kemp, who was also the state's chief elections administrator.\n\n\"I acknowledge that former of Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election,\" she said. \"But to watch an elected official, who claims to represent the people in the state, baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people's democratic right to vote has been truly appalling.\"\n\nShe added, \"So let's be clear, this is not a speech of concession because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that.\"\n\nAbrams' speech came moments after the state's chief elections official certified the results following a protracted 10-day legal battle. Kemp led Abrams 50.2 percent to 48.8 percent \u2014 or by about 55,000 votes \u2014 with 99 percent of the vote counted.\n\nAbrams' admission of defeat brought to a close one of the most closely watched contests of the 2018 midterm cycle.\n\nIn her Friday speech, she said Kemp \"was deliberate and intentional in his actions\" of suppression while overseeing the state's election system.\n\n\"Democracy failed in Georgia,\" Abrams said of the contest, which was marred by allegations of voter roll purging and suppression largely affecting African Americans. \"This time, the mistakes clearly altered the outcome.\"\n\nAn Associated Press investigation last month revealed that Kemp's office had 53,000 voter registration applicants still pending, 70 percent of whom were African-American. Many of those prospective voters may not have even known their registrations were on hold, the report said.\n\nCivil rights groups, including one founded by Abrams, sued Kemp alleging that the practice was discriminatory because African-Americans make up 32 percent of Georgia's population.\n\nVoters in largely minority areas also faced malfunctioning machines and long lines at polls on Election Day.\n\nAbrams on Friday said, \"I will pray for the success of Brian Kemp, that he will indeed be a leader for all Georgians.\"\n\nShe implored voters not to be dismayed by a \"rotten and rigged\" system, but to continue organizing and holding public officials accountable.\n\nAbrams also said that despite ending her candidacy, her campaign will still pursue \"a major federal lawsuit\" aimed at the \"gross mismanagement\" of the election system.\n\nDuring the campaign, Kemp embraced President Donald Trump and highlighted his positions on gun rights and illegal immigration. And the president visited Georgia to stump for Kemp.\n\nAfter Election Day, Abrams had been fighting to buy time to have more ballots counted in hopes of triggering a mandatory recount or a runoff election. Under Georgia law, if neither candidate were to have topped 50 percent, they would have faced off in a runoff on Dec. 4.\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp, Georgia's next governor after Stacey Abrams ended her campaign, speaks at a rally at the Classic Center in downtown Athens, Georgia, on Oct. 9, 2108. Joshua L. Jones / Athens Banner-Herald via AP\n\nKemp had declared victory last Wednesday, the day after the election, and resigned as Georgia's secretary of state to focus on the transition process.\n\nBut following the election, Abrams' campaign accused the secretary of state's office of providing inaccurate and incomplete information about how many votes were still to be counted.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, as counties continued tallying uncounted ballots, a federal judge ordered Georgia to guard against any improper rejection of provisional ballots and to wait until Friday to certify the results.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, another federal judge ruled that the secretary of state must not certify the state election results without confirming that each county's vote tally includes absentee ballots on which the voter's date of birth might be missing or incorrect.\n\nEarlier Friday, it emerged that Abrams' camp was also considering an unusual long-shot legal challenge, based on a never-before-used statute in such circumstances, to seek an election do over, although they ultimately decided not to go that route."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Full speech: Stacey Abrams ends candidacy for Georgia governor", "description": "Democratic candidate for Georgia governor Stacey Abrams ended her candidacy in a speech to supporters on Friday.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Pete Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Opponents of Matt Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general opened a new legal front Friday in the fight over his selection, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that he is not legally qualified for the job.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed him on Nov. 7, shortly after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he was stepping down at the president's request. Whitaker had been serving as chief of staff to Sessions.\n\nThe latest move to contest the appointment came in a lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court against the U.S. attorney general, who was Jeff Sessions when the case was filed in June. The challengers asked the justices to rule that the name on the case should now be Rod Rosenstein, who they said is actually the acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker cannot be in the position, they contend, because he wasn't confirmed by the Senate. Their Supreme Court filing said the Constitution requires confirmation for a cabinet-level job, even an acting one. And a separate federal law provides that the deputy attorney general automatically takes over when the attorney general's office is vacant, they told the justices.\n\nTom Goldstein, a Washington lawyer who filed the motion Friday, said this appears to be the first time such a request has been made, asking the justices to rule on the identity of the correct defendant before the court has decided whether to hear the case at all.\n\n\"This is the extraordinary case in which the identity of the successor is both contested and has important implications for the administration of justice nationally,\" he said.\n\nGoldstein was the lawyer behind a similar challenge to Whitaker's appointment that was filed Tuesday in federal court by the state of Maryland.\n\nThe Supreme Court case was originally brought by a Nevada man, Barry Michaels, who asked the justices to rule that the right to own a gun should not be taken away from someone convicted of certain non-violent felonies.\n\nThe Trump administration vigorously defends Whitaker's appointment. An opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel said the government has identified over 160 times throughout U.S. history when presidents appointed non-Senate confirmed government officials to serve in high level positions. In recent years, the opinion said, such appointments were made by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nThe opinion said while courts have held that the Constitution requires principal officers to be confirmed by the Senate, \"it does not follow that Acting Attorney General should be understood to be one,\" because the person appointed to serve in that capacity is not in a \"continuing and permanent\" position."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Didi Martinez, Jasmin Boyce", "title": "Senators 'gravely concerned' over Facebook's ties to political research firm", "description": "Four Democratic senators joined a growing chorus of Facebook critics on Friday, sending a letter to the company\u2019s leadership requesting answers about its employment of a Washington public relations firm.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/senators-gravely-concerned-over-facebook-s-ties-political-research-firm-n937411", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2649626/181116-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-washington-cs-432p_1b754935a49198842cbfeaa82e7ce3ed.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:19:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Didi Martinez and Jasmin Boyce\n\nFour Democratic senators joined a growing chorus of Facebook critics on Friday, sending a letter to the company\u2019s leadership requesting answers about its employment of a Washington public relations firm.\n\nThe four senators \u2014 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mark Warner of Virginia, Chris Coons of Delaware and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut \u2014 asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the letter whether his company had hired a firm to collect and disseminate information about Facebook critics, including elected officials.\n\n\u201cWe are gravely concerned by recent reports indicating that your company used contractors to retaliate against or spread intentionally inflammatory information about your critics,\u201d the senators wrote.\n\nThe letter adds to what has become Facebook\u2019s latest crisis over its handling of Russia\u2019s efforts to spread disinformation and divisive political rhetoric on the company\u2019s social network.\n\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times published an in-depth look at the company\u2019s reaction to the Russia scandal, including efforts to downplay the severity of Russia\u2019s actions and hit back at critics \u2014 in particular by hiring Definers Public Affairs, which the Times found pushed information connecting Facebook critics to billionaire philanthropist George Soros and ran what one employee called an \u201cin-house fake news shop.\u201d\n\nThe Times article noted that Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, were \u201cbent on growth\u201d and that \u201cthe pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.\u201d\n\nCiting the company\u2019s role in failing to \u201cimplement protocols to prevent manipulation by foreign adversaries,\u201d the senators noted that this was not the first time the company\u2019s actions led to larger questions about the need for regulation.\n\n\u201cBoth elected officials and the general public have rightfully questioned whether Facebook is capable of regulating its own conduct,\u201d the letter read.\n\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg testifies during a Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill on Sept. 5, 2018. Drew Angerer / Getty Images file\n\nOn Thursday, the same group of senators submitted a letter to the Department of Justice, urging it to investigate the allegations that Facebook hired a firm to retaliate against critics.\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have each issued public statements acknowledging the company\u2019s shortcomings in responding to Russia\u2019s actions but pushed back against claims that it had attempted to hide the problem.\n\n\u201cMark and I have said many times we were too slow,\u201d Sandberg wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday night. \u201cBut to suggest that we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth, or we wanted to hide what we knew, or that we tried to prevent investigations, is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Times, one of the groups Definers tried to smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, pressing reporters to question its ties to Soros.\n\n\u201cBy suggesting to reporters that Color Of Change is acting as the puppet of Mr. Soros merely because he is one of our many funders, they have given oxygen to the worst anti-Semitic conspiracy theories of the white nationalist Trump base,\u201d Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nBoth Zuckerberg and Sandberg have publicly denied that either knew of the company\u2019s history with Definers. On Thursday, Facebook terminated the company\u2019s relationship with the firm.\n\nTim Miller, a partner at Definers, sought to clarify the firm\u2019s actions, writing in a blog post on Friday that the firm was trying to illustrate that Facebook opposition had not been a grassroots operation. Miller said Definers found that Freedom From Facebook, one of the organizations that Facebook reportedly sought to target, was backed by a variety of organizations, including the nonprofit organization the Open Markets Institute, which is funded by Soros.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether you think it\u2019s a good or bad thing, this funding is potential news for a reporter who covers tech policy to explore,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\nBut the momentum against Facebook continued to mount, as organizations and activists called for the company to face federal regulation.\n\nFreedom From Facebook filed a complaint Thursday to the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to investigate a data breach that had affected close to 30 million users in September and to enforce any violations Facebook may have made to a FTC\u2019s 2011 consent decree. Facebook could face financial penalties if it is found to have violated the FTC order.\n\n\u201cFacebook, Inc. is a serial privacy violator that cannot be trusted,\u201d the complaint stated. \u201cIt has grown too big and its products have become too integrated and too complex to manage. Not only can we no longer trust Facebook, Inc. to manage its system safely, the corporation no longer has the capacity to do so effectively.\u201d\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the FTC complaint or the senators\u2019 letter.\n\nSome lawmakers say they are just as frustrated with what they feel is a lack of federal regulation and enforcement of Facebook \u2014 particularly Democrats who will be better positioned to crack down on social media platforms when they take control of the House in January.\n\nI agree with \u2066@RepCicilline\u2069. We simply cannot rely on Facebook and other social media companies to regulate themselves. Hate is spreading & being given oxygen on these platforms--their profit model relies on this. We need to address this quickly. https://t.co/GsJO14wLjU \u2014 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) November 16, 2018\n\n\u201cWe simply cannot rely on Facebook and other social media companies to regulate themselves,\u201d Rep.

We need to address this quickly.\u201d\n\nBoth organizations and lawmakers have also called on Facebook to enact additional safeguards against itself, such as appointing a company ombudsman.\n\n\u201cAn independent board chair is essential to moving Facebook forward from this mess, and to re-establish trust with Americans and investors alike,\u201d Scott Stringer, New York City comptroller, said in a statement.\n\nStrong government action on the company may not come easily.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Erik Ortiz\n\nEarlier this month, 80 people who said they were sexually abused by one of three doctors \u2014 Larry Nassar of Michigan State University, George Tyndall of the University of Southern California and Richard Strauss of Ohio State University \u2014 sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos with a unified message: Don't give schools more control over how they investigate sexual assault allegations.\n\n\"The proposed changes will make schools even less safe for survivors and enable more perpetrators to commit sexual assault in schools without consequence,\" read the letter, which included names of women who attended the three schools.\n\n(Nassar is serving a de facto life sentence after pleading guilty to sexual assault and child pornography charges; Tyndall has denied any allegations and has not been charged with a crime; and Strauss died in 2005 before he could be properly investigated.)\n\nOn Friday, following months of anticipation, DeVos released her proposal for how cases of sexual assault and misconduct should be handled, noting that \"every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.\"\n\nWhile a 60-day public comment period is now in effect before the plan can be finalized, advocates for sexual assault survivors say they're worried that the guidelines would actually make campuses more dangerous, deter victims from coming forward and put them in traumatizing scenarios.\n\n\"It will return schools to a time where rape, assault and harassment were swept under the rug,\" said Jess Davidson, interim executive director of the group End Rape on Campus, adding that the proposal is \"worse than we thought.\"\n\nThe proposal earned a harsh tweet Friday from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who warned DeVos that she \"won't get away with what you are doing.\"\n\nThe rules involve federal guidelines known as Title IX, which prohibit gender discrimination, including sexual assault, on college campuses as well as in primary and secondary schools.\n\nAdvocates for students accused of sexual misconduct have argued that some of the guidance under the Obama administration was unfair to the alleged perpetrators \u2014 prompting DeVos last year to rescind Obama's measure and pledge the Education Department would embark on a \"workable, effective and fair system.\"\n\nBut Elizabeth Tang, a legal fellow at the National Women's Law Center in Washington, said the rules under DeVos' new proposals would be harmful to survivors while giving more deference to the accused.\n\nUnder Obama, the definition of sexual assault was less specific \u2014 described as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\"\n\nThe new definition would be narrower, requiring actions of misconduct to fall under certain categories, including \"unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity.\"\n\nThe DeVos rules would also require that allegations are reported to officials who have the authority to take \"corrective action,\" such as the school's Title IX coordinator, or for students in grades K-12, to a teacher. Critics point out that some students might feel more comfortable reporting to another adult whom they trust.\n\nIn addition, the alleged incident would only have to be investigated if it took place on campus or during a school-sponsored event. Critics note that assaults at off-campus parties or outside of bars could effectively be ignored by a school.\n\nOnce school officials are made aware of an allegation, it must be taken seriously, the guidelines state. But if a school acts \"deliberately indifferent\" toward a case, the Education Department would only have to punish it \"if its response to sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\"\n\nSchools that don't adhere to Title IX requirements risk losing federal funding.\n\nIn another notable change, accused students will be given the presumption that they're innocent throughout the disciplinary process and have the right to be given all evidence collected against them. In addition, the accused would be able to cross-examine their accusers, although it must be done through a lawyer or representative.\n\n\"They're importing a criminal standard for civil rights proceedings. There shouldn't be a presumption one way or another,\" Tang said. \"It only plays into this misconception that survivors are not to be believed and what happened is their fault.\"\n\nAdvocates for sexual assault survivors say it's already difficult to get victims to come forward.\n\nAccording to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, more than 90 percent of sexual assault victims on college campuses do not report an assault, and 89 percent of U.S. colleges reported zero incidents of rape in 2015 \u2014 an incredible statistic that illustrates how many victims likely stay in the shadows, experts say.\n\n\"We know it's so difficult to report, but we've especially seen it with the #MeToo stories in the past year, how difficult it can be for even adults,\" Tang said. \"It's indefensible that we subject students and children to such a high bar to get any help from their schools.\"\n\nDeVos' direction, however, is garnering praise from some individual liberties organizations, men's rights groups and Republican lawmakers who see it as striking a better balance between the rights of the accused and their accusers.\n\n\"The Department's approach seems to balance fairness and support for survivors,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate's education committee, said in a statement.\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group that had criticized the guidance under the Obama administration, said it supports the cross-examination process as well as affording parties involved the opportunity to examine all of the evidence.\n\nDeVos' guidelines would \"protect the rights of accused students and uphold the integrity of the process,\" said Samantha Harris, the foundation's vice president for procedural advocacy.\n\nBut another civil liberties group, the ACLU, surprised some on Friday by tweeting that it is against DeVos' proposed new rules \u2014 arguing they \"make schools less safe for survivors of sexual assault and harassment.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Minyvonne Burke", "title": "Olympic swimmer Rowdy Gaines said scammers pretended to hold his daughter hostage", "description": "Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines said his family was almost the victims of a virtual kidnapping scam when they received phone calls claiming his daughter was being held hostage.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/olympic-swimmer-rowdy-gaines-said-scammers-pretended-hold-his-daughter-n937296", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2649336/181116-rowdy-gaines-ew-112p_f1d5899eeddadd2ee76d49739f8eb650.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:45:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Avichai Scher\n\nPeanuts get a lot of attention, but the most common food allergy for kids under 5? Milk.\n\nIn a study released on Friday, researchers found that milk allergy affects over half of 1-year-olds who have food allergies, accounts for 40 percent of food allergies for kids 1 to 2, and is the most common overall food allergy for children under 5.\n\n\u201cThe general public needs to be more aware of milk allergies. They think it\u2019s all peanut,\u201d Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at the Northwestern school of medicine in Chicago and an author of the study, told NBC News. \u201cWe set out to build awareness so families can get the proper diagnosis.\u201d\n\nMilk allergy is different from lactose intolerance or other milk sensitivities, which generally cause gas, bloating and other gastrointestinal issues. The researchers were looking for symptoms of an immunoglobulin E-mediated allergy, such as hives, throat tightening and trouble breathing, which come on quickly after exposure to the allergen, in this case, milk.\n\n\u201cYou picture your kids growing up and having independence, and now every bite of food, every cough, was scary.\u201d\n\nIn a nationally representative sample of nearly 52,000 U.S. households, including over 38,000 families with children, the researchers found that nearly 2 percent of kids reported symptoms consistent with IgE milk allergy.\n\n\u201cOnly 1 percent of U.S. kids get milk allergy diagnosed with a physician,\u201d said Christopher Warren, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California school of medicine and another researcher on the study, presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in Seattle. \u201cSo this is more common than people realize.\u201d\n\nJamie Kauffman, a mother from Springfield, Illinois, thought her son Miles was just a fussy baby. He was always crying and uncomfortable, which caused her anxiety and embarrassment.\n\n\u201cA nurse once told me, in front of a whole group of moms, that I needed to learn how to soothe my son,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cBut when I breastfed him, I was just making it worse.\u201d\n\nWhen Miles was 8 months old, Kauffman fed him some creamy spinach, and he quickly went into anaphylactic shock, breaking out in hives, wheezing and becoming unresponsive. Kauffman rushed him to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a milk allergy.\n\n\u201cSo much about our experience made sense after that,\u201d Kauffman said.\n\nRather than switch to formula, she decided to continue breastfeeding and cut all foods Miles was allergic to out of her diet: nuts, soy, egg and milk.\n\nNow 13, Miles has mostly outgrown the other allergies, but continues to be allergic to milk. Kauffman said it\u2019s been a struggle to keep him safe.\n\n\u201cThe night we got the diagnosis, it was crushing, I cried,\u201d said Kauffman. \u201cYou picture your kids growing up and having independence, and now every bite of food, every cough, was scary.\u201d\n\nShe kept Miles out of restaurants and home-schooled him, but still, mistakes happen. When he was 3, she made him a grilled cheese sandwich, but confused the soy cheese with regular. \u201cAfter two bites, he started coughing and his lip was so swollen, I thought it was going to burst,\u201d she said.\n\nLuckily, she had an EpiPen on hand, something many parents of children with milk allergies don\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cOur survey found only one in four parents had a prescription for EpiPen for milk allergy,\u201d said Gupta.\n\nFeeding Miles safely three times a day is a challenge, Kauffman said, but it\u2019s easier now because he is able to tolerate foods with baked milk, something Gupta said parents should test for.\n\nThe Kauffman family on their trip to Disney World, the first time Miles, right, was able to eat at a restaurant. Courtesy of the Kauffman Family\n\n\u201cApproximately 70 percent of kids with likely IgE milk allergy can tolerate baked milk products,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s hard for parents to avoid milk, so don\u2019t just assume your child can\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d\n\nWhen Miles was diagnosed, Kauffman didn\u2019t know anyone else dealing with this concern, so she started a blog, Milk Allergy Mom, where she shares recipes and connects with other parents.\n\nThe allergy takes a toll on Miles too, who often misses out on social events because of safety concerns. But recently, he was able to eat out for the first time \u2014 on a trip to Disney World, where a chef accommodated him.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign that awareness for milk allergy is growing, Kauffman said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much better than it was 13 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cIt no longer feels like I\u2019m the only one.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Elisha Fieldstadt", "title": "North Carolina teacher missing in Mexico killed by drug cartel member, officials tell family", "description": "Patrick Braxton-Andrew, a North Carolina teacher of Spanish who has been missing in Mexico since October, was killed by a drug cartel member, officials told his family.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/north-carolina-teacher-missing-mexico-killed-drug-cartel-member-officials-n937306", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2649446/181116-patrick-andrew-braxton-killed-mexico-cs-252p_2dc17fb65de78f1051f0349aa73a81e6.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:36:23Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But it is nonetheless jaw dropping to hear reports that the administration may be thinking about surrendering to Turkish demands to extradite a long-time U.S. resident for the sake of placating Turkey and protecting Saudi Arabia in the wake of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder.\n\nAccording to four people interviewed by NBC, the White House has instructed the Justice Department, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to find a way to remove Fethullah Gulen, a former ally-turned-foe of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan claims Gulen was the mastermind behind a failed coup against him in 2016. The elderly Gulen has lived in rural Pennsylvania for close to 20 years. He is a green card holder, or permanent resident of the U.S., and he adamantly denies Turkey\u2019s accusations. But Trump presumably hopes that if he turns Gulen over to Turkey, Erdogan will return the favor by easing his campaign against Saudi Arabia, an important American ally that has been under intense scrutiny following the Khashoggi killing.\n\nTrump presumably hopes that if he turns Gulen over to Turkey, Erdogan will return the favor by easing his campaign against Saudi Arabia.\n\nU.S. authorities have already reviewed Turkey\u2019s two-year-old extradition request and found it without merit. But Trump, in an effort to help Saudi Arabia diffuse the Khashoggi crisis, is weighing whether or not to both sacrifice a man and make a mockery of the extradition system.\n\nThat system is designed not only to prevent politicians from interfering with what should be law-enforcement issues, but also to protect individuals from foreign governments fabricating charges for political purposes. Undercutting the system for the sake of protecting the Saudis makes the White House plan even more sordid. The fact that Gulen might not survive extradition to Turkey \u2014 Erdogan has said coup plotters should be beheaded \u2014 only adds to the moral bankruptcy of an idea that would further erode America\u2019s position as a country of laws.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that career officials at the agencies pressured by the White House are said to have initially rolled their eyes at the request and later become \u201cfurious\u201d when they realized the requests were serious, according to NBC.\n\nIslamic cleric Fethullah Gulen speaks to members of the media at his compound on July 17, 2016, in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. Chris Post / AP file\n\nThe White House has been scrambling to manage the fallout from the Kashoggi assassination. Saudi Arabia has finally admitted that its agents killed and dismembered the journalist after he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago, although they claim it was a rogue operation. Erdogan has done everything in his power to use the situation to his advantage, releasing information incriminating the Saudis.\n\nThe crisis has certainly thrown a wrench into Trump\u2019s Middle East policy. The Saudi de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, has been a key partner in the U.S. strategy to isolate Iran and develop and Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. The prince\u2019s troubles thus became Trump\u2019s.\n\nThe State Department has tried to deny the report of a Turkish tit-for-tat. Spokesperson Heather Nauert said the Gulen case has nothing to with Saudi Arabia, and it is wrong to \u201cconflate the two,\u201d acknowledging at least that the U.S. is reviewing Turkish extradition materials. But her denials are contradicted by her boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Pompeo traveled to Turkey after Khashoggi disappeared to discuss the case with Erdogan. He told reporters then \u201cWe did talk about Fethulla Gulen.\u201d One person with knowledge of the meetings said, \u201cThat [Gulen\u2019s release] was their number one ask.\u201d\n\nWe also know that Erdogan has been obsessed with Gulen, who before the crackdown was supported by many Turks. Erdogan has imprisoned at least 40,000 of Gulen\u2019s supporters, and systematically removed his backers from positions in the police, the judiciary and elsewhere.\n\nAfter his extradition demands met a dead end during the Barack Obama administration, Turkey hired none other Michael Flynn, who spent a few weeks as Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser. While a campaign adviser, Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying about his Russia contacts in the Mueller probe, wrote an op-ed claiming Gulen is a radical Islamist and \u201cWe should not provide him safe haven.\u201d\n\nIn an even more astonishing turn, former CIA Director James Wolsey claimed that Flynn and his son met with Erdogan associates to discuss a plan to secretly kidnap Gulen and fly him to Turkey, for which Flynn would allegedly be paid $15 million. One of these meetings allegedly occurred in December 2016, after Trump had already been elected and Flynn designated his top National Security Adviser.\n\nClearly, the Gulen case is already toxic. Career officials in the government have already determined that Turkey\u2019s extradition request does not meet the minimum requires for the U.S. to hand over the aging cleric. Thus, the idea of using him as a pawn to solve a major geopolitical conundrum is further evidence of an administration increasingly unmoored from ethical considerations and respect for human rights.\n\nGulen\u2019s life may seem small when compared to the issues at stake. Discarding him could not only help ease tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but it could also aid in repairing frayed ties between the U.S. and Turkey, a NATO ally with which the U.S. has clashed repeatedly on Syria, the Kurds and other issues.\n\nThe White House, according to NBC\u2019s sources, is also considering other options. Perhaps instead of sending Gulen to Turkey they could compromise by sending him to a third country such as South Africa or maybe find some problem with his immigration status.\n\nBut sacrificing Gulen to help the Saudis shake a murder rap would bring more harm than good to America. It would be a betrayal of America principles; it would injure the country\u2019s rule of law \u2014 already embattled under Trump \u2014 and would further tarnish the U.S. standing on the global stage."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jennie-O recalling ground turkey in salmonella outbreak", "description": "Not counting pet food, the recall was the first linked to a widespread outbreak that has resulted in one death and 164 reported illnesses in 35 states.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/jennie-o-recalling-ground-turkey-salmonella-outbreak-n937261", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2649366/181116-jennie-o-gournd-turkey-recall-al-1410_7bbd253f51078e72864a4807c34128c0.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:37:26Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nMeditation worked as well as traditional therapy for military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder in a small experiment sponsored by the Department of Defense.\n\nOne method preferred by the Department of Veterans Affairs is exposure therapy, but it doesn't work for everyone and many can't handle what it requires: purposely recalling traumatic events and confronting emotions.\n\nMeditation could be a better choice for some, the researchers said.\n\nThe experiment tested meditation against exposure therapy, which involves working with a therapist and gradually letting go of fears triggered by painful memories.\n\nMany vets won't try exposure therapy or drop out because it's too difficult, said Thomas Rutledge, the study's senior author and a Veterans Affairs psychologist in San Diego.\n\nEvidence for meditation \"allows us to put more options on the table\" with confidence they work, Rutledge said.\n\nThe study was published Thursday in the journal Lancet Psychiatry.\n\nAbout 400,000 veterans had a PTSD diagnosis in 2013, according to the VA health system. The VA already is using meditation, yoga and similar approaches to supplement traditional therapy with PTSD, said Paula Schnurr, executive director of the VA's National Center for PTSD.\n\nWhile the three-month study adds to evidence supporting these lifestyle practices, Schnurr said, more research is needed to learn how long meditation's benefits last.\n\n\"There's no follow-up in this study,\" Schnurr noted, and one therapist did 80 percent of the exposure therapy so the findings hinge largely on one therapist's skills.\n\nResearchers measured symptoms in about 200 San Diego area veterans randomly assigned to one of three groups. Some learned to meditate. Others got exposure therapy. The third group attended classes where they learned about nutrition and exercise.\n\nAll sessions were once a week for 90 minutes.\n\nAfter three months, 61 percent of the meditation group improved on a standard PTSD assessment, compared to 42 percent of those who got exposure therapy and 32 percent of those who went to classes. When researchers accounted for other factors, meditation was better than the classes and equally effective as exposure therapy.\n\nThe researchers defined success as at least a 10-point improvement in scores on a standard symptoms test, given to participants by people who did not know which kind of treatment they'd received. The test measures symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia.\n\nPTSD also can be treated with medications or other types of talk therapy. Many of the participants were taking prescribed medicine for PTSD.\n\nMost of the vets were men with combat-related trauma, so it's not clear whether meditation would be equally effective in women or with other types of trauma.\n\nThere's growing interest in meditation in the United States. A government survey last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently meditated, up from 4 percent from a similar survey five years earlier.\n\nThere are many styles of meditation. The type taught to vets in the study was transcendental meditation, or TM, which involves thinking of a mantra or sound to settle the mind.\n\nTM was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles in the late 1960s. Some of the study authors are affiliated with a university in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi. Their role was to oversee the meditation training.\n\nRutledge, who was the principal researcher, said he does not practice meditation himself.\n\nMeditation could be more acceptable to veterans who might associate mental health treatment with weakness, Rutledge said.\n\n\"It's probably less threatening,\" he said. \"It may be easier to talk to veterans about participating in something like meditation.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Pete Williams", "title": "Supreme Court agrees to referee fight over census citizenship question", "description": "The Supreme Court agreed to take up an aspect of the legal battle over the administration's plan to put a question about citizenship on the 2020 census form.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-agrees-referee-fight-over-census-citizenship-question-n937326", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_21/2241791/171128-us-census-test-houston-ew-1241p_333fd5dd4ddb9175e7e7cbc757348338.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:20:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

We are truly a great nation, and we\u2019re a nation that is doing really, really well right now.\u201d\n\nAs a couple, the Adelsons donated $30 million to aid the president\u2019s 2016 campaign effort, later giving $100 million to GOP efforts in the 2018 midterms.\n\nTrump made no mention of Adelson\u2019s political involvement Friday, highlighting her medical career as well as her support for Israel and various Jewish organizations.\n\nTrump is not the first president to award the medal of freedom to political backers. In 2013, President Barack Obama awarded the medal to Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton, among others. Winfrey and Clinton both actively campaigned for Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign, with Winfrey donating the maximum individual amount allowed.\n\nWhile honoring Hatch, Trump mentioned his role in last year's tax cut legislation. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Hatch was instrumental in getting the Republican tax reform bill through Congress, giving Trump one of the biggest wins of his administration.\n\nSupreme Court Justices John Roberts, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh were in attendance to honor Scalia, who Trump called \u201cone of the greatest jurists ever to serve our country.\u201d\n\nScalia\u2019s wife, Maureen, accepted the medal on her husband\u2019s behalf.\n\n\"You were very busy. Wow. Wow,\" Trump told Mrs. Scalia, while reading the names of her nine children in attendance. \u201cI knew there was a reason I liked the guy.\u201d\n\nPage, who is black, has been a vocal critic of the president, saying the administration has \u201cplayed to people\u2019s racial insecurities.\u201d In an interview with The St. Paul Pioneer Press this week, Page said he would accept the medal and use the honor to try to make the world a better place.\n\nTrump briefly paused his remarks on Presley to play the singer\u2019s rendition of the gospel song \u201cHow Great Thou Art.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was Elvis. That was my idea,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI said, 'Give me a little, little song.' That was, I guess a little promotional ability, but I will tell you, he was something special.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Amid food shortages, cattle ranching in Caracas?

They set them to graze behind their 2,000-square meter (21,528 square-foot) home, donated by the state-owned telecommunications company two years ago.\n\nThe government began transferring billions of dollars to a network of more than 70,000 such community groups under the administration of late President Hugo Chavez, who supported the communes as an alternative to a capitalist economic model. Maduro has called communes \u201cthe epicenter of solidarity.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the commune, who also grow fruits and vegetables, say the arrangement is simply a way to get cheaper meat. They do not graze the cattle for long, and have already slaughtered several inside their home.\n\nWith Venezuela\u2019s oil-reliant economy in a fifth year of recession and inflation nearing 1 million percent, securing staple goods is a daily struggle for many.\n\nJust 40 percent of families can afford beef and nearly two-thirds of the population reported losing weight last year, by 11 kilos (24 lb) on average, according to a study by three universities.\n\nA man cooks cow feet in the backyard of an Apacuana commune house in Caracas, Venezuela, on Nov. 13, 2018. Marco Bello / Reuters\n\nWestern economists and the domestic opposition blame Maduro\u2019s heavy-handed policies and economic mismanagement for the crisis. However, the government and its supporters attribute Venezuela\u2019s struggles to U.S. sanctions and hoarding by businesses trying to undermine socialism.\n\n\u201cThis experience shows the resolve of the people to push back against the economic war,\u201d said commune leader Sulimar Pedrozar, as two cow heads boiled in a pot over a wood fire and a group cleaned out a cow stomach for a soup.\n\nThe group has slaughtered seven cows and sold a small amount of meat to several hundred people at 560 bolivars per kilo, or about $2 at the black market exchange rate.\n\nThat was well above the government-set price of 90 bolivars. But with supply scarce, many butchers in Caracas sell beef for more than 10 times that amount, or more than half a monthly salary at the official minimum wage.\n\nIn 2016, Maduro launched a \u201cGreat Agro-Venezuela Mission\u201d to encourage city-dwellers to grow fruits, vegetables and herbs in their backyards, noting that he and his wife harvested pumpkins on their patio. Earlier this year, a government minister said people should breed and eat rabbits, arguing they are not just \u201ccute pets.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday evening, several dozen neighbors of the commune gathered to protest the ranch next door, complaining about the foul smell, flies, and health risks.\n\n\u201cIt is the first time in my life I\u2019ve seen cattle being raised in a house,\u201d said Luisa Ferro, a resident of the Los Chorros neighborhood. \u201cYou see stuff like that in the country, but never in a city.\u201d\n\nPedro M\u00e9ndez, a local opposition leader, said he would report the urban ranch to Venezuela\u2019s health ministry, but doubted the government would stop it given Maduro\u2019s support for such communes.\n\nPedroza said the commune would continue raising livestock.\n\n\u201cThere is resistance to this idea but those who want to let people die of hunger are crazier,\u201d Pedroza said.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Todd Johnson", "title": "NBCBLK launches Black History Month Series: 'She Thrives'", "description": "The series, \"She Thrives: Black Women Making History Today,\" will highlight 10 amazing women you should know from a variety of generations, occupations and regions.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/nbcblk-launches-black-history-month-series-she-thrives-n937221", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2649466/she-thrives1x1_2ab02427932371b8fd76aeea2088d636.1200;630;7;70;5.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:08:37Z", "content": "Nov. 16, 2018 / 8:08 PM GMT This February 2019, in celebration of Black History Month, NBCBLK, the African-American news vertical of NBC News Digital, presents a month-long special feature recognizing the accomplishments, power and prowess of black women.

His father, George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47; mother, Angela, 48; and older brother, George Wagner IV, 27; are also charged in the April 22, 2016, killing spree.\n\nEdward \"Jake\" Wagner, one of four family members who was arrested in the Ohio slayings. Ohio Attorney General's office via AP\n\nAll four are charged with eight counts of aggravated murders and potentially face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nIn announcing the charges, Ohio State Attorney General Mike DeWine said the massacre stemmed from an acrimonious custody dispute between Jake Wagner and Rhoden, over their then 2-year-old daughter, Sophia.\n\nThe body of 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden was found shot twice in the head. She was lying in her bed next to her youngest daughter, Kylie, who had been born just five days earlier, and who was unharmed.\n\nA paternity test later showed that Wagner was not the father of the infant.\n\nCourt papers say the Wagners went to different homes on the Rhodens' farm in Pike County, about 90 miles east of Cincinnati, executing Hanna and seven other Rhoden family members \u2014 whose ages ranged from 16 to 44. The Wagners had used their familiarity with the properties from previous visits to circumvent security systems, the attorney general said.\n\n\"It is our belief that the suspects used this knowledge to meticulously plan these horrendous, cold-blooded murders,\" DeWine said Tuesday.\n\nCourt papers say the Wagners went to different homes on the Rhodens' farm in Pike County, executing the family members. Lisa Marie Miller / The Columbus Dispatch via AP file\n\nSophia had been at the Wagners' home at the time, as per a pre-existing custody arrangement.\n\nA Rhoden relative told NBC affiliate WLWT-TV that Jake Wagner attempted unsuccessfully to convince Hanna to sign over her custody rights to Sophia a few weeks before the murders.\n\nThe network obtained court documents that showed Jake Wagner went to court six days after the murders in an effort to gain full custody. In his affidavit, he said the couple had been together from 2013 to 2015, but that Rhoden broke up with him because he was working too hard and couldn't make enough time for her.\n\nHe was granted temporary custody of Sophia on May 4, 2016, in what the judge said was the \"best interests of the child.\"\n\nSophia's great-grandfather, Leonard Manley told the Cincinnati Enquirer earlier this week that the now-5-year-old girl is safe and currently in state custody in a neighboring county.\n\nFayette County Sheriff's deputy Corey Boston held the door as George \"Billy\" Wagner III entered Fayette County District Court in Lexington, KY. on Nov. 14, 2018.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Dan De Luce\n\nThe son of an 82-year-old Iranian-American held in Iran for nearly three years warned his father could die in custody due to his deteriorating health and appealed to the Tehran regime to release him on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThe emotional appeal marked the first time the family has urged the release of Baquer Namazi without resolving the fate of a second son, Siamak, 47, who is also under detention in Iran. The public plea reflected increasing desperation for the Namazi family and comes at a time of tension between Iran and the United States after President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of an international nuclear agreement with Tehran.\n\nBaquer Namazi is the oldest American known to be held in Iran and has been on temporary medical leave in Tehran for much of the last nine months due to an irregular heartbeat and low blood pressure. But his health has steadily declined even while on furlough from prison, his son, Babak Namazi, and family lawyer told reporters in Washington.\n\nBabak Namazi said time was running out for his father unless he could leave Iran to receive medical treatment. \"I can't imagine how much more my father can really withstand. . .I fear the worst.\"\n\nThe son said he wanted \"to implore and beg the Iranian government to show mercy.\"\n\nIranian-American consultant Siamak Namazi in San Francisco, California in 2006. Ahmad Kiarostami / via Reuters\n\nIn October, the elderly Namazi started to suffer bouts of dizziness and disorientation, the son said, and a neurologist concluded he had epilepsy.\n\n\"Unfortunately to our horror, he was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of eighty-two. For me it is shocking,\" Namazi said.\n\nIn October 2016, both Baquer and Siamak Namazi were sentenced to 10 years in prison for \"collaborating with a hostile state\" after a secretive trial that a U.N. panel and rights groups condemned as arbitrary and a violation of international law.\n\nBabak Namazi, a lawyer based in Dubai, met senior officials at the White House and State Department in the past two days to appeal for renewed efforts to secure the release of his father and brother.\n\nThe family's attorney, Jared Genser, called on the Trump administration to pursue a dialogue with Iran solely focused on humanitarian and consular issues such as the Namazi case.\n\nHe said that \"it's clear that two years of what has been tried so far hasn't worked.\"\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif has suggested his government would be open to discussing a possible prisoner exchange.\n\nGenser said in their meetings with Trump administration officials, he and Babak Namazi asked that the White House make good on the president's promise during the 2016 election campaign in which he vowed not to allow Americans to languish in Iranian jails.\n\n\"This doesn't happen if I'm president!\" Trump tweeted at the time.\n\nThe Trump administration, which has repeatedly called on Iran to release the Americans held in Iran, has reimposed an array of hard-hitting sanctions on Tehran in recent months since Trump withdrew the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement. The 2015 deal between Iran and world powers eased economic sanctions in return for imposing limits on the country's nuclear program.\n\nThe death of an American citizen in Iranian custody would almost certainly add more pressure to an already volatile relationship, experts said.\n\nGenser said if the elderly Namazi was allowed to die in Iran, it would not only represent a devastating outcome for his family but also \"a really dramatic, terribly damaging incident that would further exacerbate the tensions between the United States and Iran in very serious and even irreparable ways.\"\n\nIn discussions this week, Genser said U.S. officials indicated they took the case very seriously. But there appears to have been no dialogue in recent months between the United States and Iran on the fate of at least five Americans held in Iran, he said.\n\nThe two countries have no diplomatic relations and U.S. official contact with Iran has been further curtailed since President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear agreement in May. Under the deal, U.S. officials had taken part in quarterly meetings with Iran and other signatories to the agreement, and the Americans would usually use the discussions to raise the plight of Americans held in Iran.\n\nNew medication to treat the epilepsy has required Baquer Namazi to stop taking sedatives and anti-depressants. As a result, he is suffering from recurring nightmares and a deepening depression, the family's lawyer, Genser said.\n\nBefore his retirement, Baquer Namazi worked as a senior official at UNICEF and helped craft the Convention on the Rights of Child.

You can\u2019t afford it, anyway,\u201d reads the cover of the game.\n\nThat one stings, according to some millennials who took to \u2014 where else \u2014 Twitter to voice their irritation over \u201cthe most condescending game ever.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that about four in 10 millennials are homeowners, according to survey results released in July by Bank of the West. Of those homeowners surveyed, one in three dipped into their retirement accounts to make a down payment, according to the survey.\n\nSo what happens when millennials can\u2019t afford the fancy Monopoly properties? In Hasbro\u2019s new game, the goal is to instead collect experiences, like going to a meditation retreat, crashing on a friend\u2019s couch or dining at a vegan bistro. If a player experiences something first, they can collect money any time an opponent lands on that experience.\n\nOh, and those classic game pieces have also been replaced with a crying emoji and a hashtag symbol.\n\nOne Twitter user pointed out that there are fewer spaces on the board, presumably because millennials are too lazy to finish an entire game of Monopoly.\n\n\u201cWe created Monopoly for Millennials to provide fans with a lighthearted game that allows millennials to take a break from real life and laugh at the relatable experiences and labels that can sometimes be placed on them,\u201d Hasbro said in a statement. \u201cWith many of us being millennials ourselves, we understand the seemingly endless struggles and silly generalizations that young millennials can face (and we can\u2019t even!).\u201d\n\nOthers saw some humor in the game and suggested millennials were easily offended.\n\n\u201cThe Monopoly Millennial Edition is somehow both relatable and condescending at the same time,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.\n\nWhile it\u2019s received plenty of attention and scorn from some millennials, Hasbro clearly has a hit. The $19.82 game, which is available exclusively at Walmart, is so popular it\u2019s already listed as out of stock on the retailer\u2019s website, with used versions selling for triple the price."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Adam Edelman", "title": "Trump says he's finished writing answers to Mueller's questions", "description": "Amid reports of the president's ill temper and impending staff shakeups, Trump said he is \"very happy with the White House.\"", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-he-has-finished-writing-answers-mueller-s-questions-n937241", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2649311/181116-donald-trump-al-1255_5d5ec836dc990bcf6002fbe4aad1db07.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:29:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The answers will pertain only to matters relating to Russian interference in the 2016 election, not obstruction of justice, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nThe New York Times reported in April on a series of questions Mueller wants to ask Trump, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.

The psychotherapist has kept the weight off ever since, but still eats whatever he wants, and looks forward to Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have turkey and dressing and gravy and pumpkin pie, and all of those things, but it will be in the portions that I have become habituated to,\u201d Anderson tells NBC News BETTER.\n\nAnderson, who authored the popular weight loss book \u201cThe Anderson Method,\u201d says he was obese from childhood until his mid-30s. He says finally losing weight after many years of struggle took more than willpower.\n\n\u201cI started to look at it as a behavioral problem, rather than a body problem or a diet problem,\u201d he says, \u201cand started to apply what we know works in terms of being able to change behavior.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s his advice on how to change long-term eating habits.\n\nBefore you diet, count the amount of calories you are currently eating\n\nMost people only count calories when they are dieting, then go back to eating \u201cnormal,\u201d says Anderson. But he says this way of thinking is backwards.\n\nIf you are going to lose weight and keep it off, Anderson says, you need to count the number of calories you currently eat.\n\nKnowing how many calories you currently consider \u201cnormal\u201d will deter you from falling back on old habits, he explains.\n\n\u201cIf the \u2018normal\u2019 that you\u2019re thinking of getting back to is the behavior that makes people overweight\u2026what you\u2019re doing is losing weight and planning to regain it again,\u201d he says. \u201cThe main work that we need to do is not losing the weight \u2014 it is developing a way of living where you will not gain the weight.\u201d\n\nForget about a number on the scale\n\nAll too often, people who want to lose weight are hyper fixated on reaching a certain number on the scale, according to the author. If that\u2019s your goal, he says, you will likely change your eating habits and exercise routines until you achieve that number, then go back to your old ways.\n\n\u201cLosing weight is nice,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cIt\u2019s a great gift, but the main thing that people need to do is learn how to live in a way where they will not gain weight.\u201d\n\nAnderson says there are no fancy gimmicks to keeping a healthy weight: all you have to understand is the amount of calories you need to maintain it and stay in that range. It\u2019s also important to be realistic, he says. If you enjoy a mostly sedentary lifestyle, how much you eat needs to reflect that.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at what is the metabolic rate that I will have for the rest of my life for the way I want to live,\u201d Anderson explains.\n\nYou can use this simple online calculator to understand how many calories you need to eat given your regular activity levels.\n\nEat what you enjoy\n\nA recent study finds that people who maintain a low-carb diet after weight loss are likely to stay slim. While healthy eating is important, the behavioral therapist says it\u2019s important to still enjoy foods you crave.\n\nHis first rule of thumb is to eat what you enjoy, but in smaller portions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned to eat what I like in the portions that keep me from gaining weight, and I enjoy it more than the eating I used to do when I was overweight,\u201d he says.\n\nThis \u201ceat-what-you-like\u201d rule goes against most conventional wisdom, he says, because people often believe they can give up certain foods for a stretch and then go back to their \u201cnormal\u201d eating habits.\n\n\u201cThis idea that I\u2019m going to do something that I hate to lose this weight creates an aversion to doing it,\u201d Anderson explains.\n\nInstead, he explains, you need to reduce the amount you eat while still eating what you like.\n\n\u201cTo create behavior, you have to associate reward with it,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAnd if you do that on a daily basis, you\u2019re going to get addicted to healthy habits, and that\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d\n\nTime your meals\n\nThe number-one strategy Anderson employs to maintain a healthy weight is meal timing. He says he only eats at specific times during the day and fasts between meals.\n\nRELATED: See how this woman lost 65 lbs through intermittent fasting.\n\nOn weekends, Anderson allows himself to eat more, but maintains a balanced caloric intake throughout the week. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of just going crazy on the weekend,\u201d he warns.\n\nLosing 140 lbs and keeping it off has been life changing for the 69-year-old.\n\n\u201cTo be able to solve that problem and feel good about myself and about my future, I mean, it\u2019s just the best thing that\u2019s ever happened in my life,\u201d Anderson says.\n\nMORE WEIGHT-LOSS SUCCESS STORIES\n\nWant more tips like these?

Three of the restaurant owners allege that they had to close their businesses, and two contend that they had to sell their businesses because of enforcement of the ordinance.\n\n\u201cThe City of Philadelphia has engaged in a pattern and practice to discriminate against Chinese people and their Chinese take-out restaurant businesses,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cThis pattern and practice has deprived Plaintiffs of equal protection under the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the city was reviewing the complaint and had no comment at this time.

In 2017, Oh\u2019s office prepared a report on the selective enforcement, which is referenced in the complaint.\n\nAfter the report was provided to the city, enforcement of the ordinance against Chinese take-out restaurants declined for a time, the lawsuit contends, but eventually resumed in mid-2018.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve said is this is clearly unconstitutional, it\u2019s discriminatory,\u201d Oh said. \u201cBut my colleagues have said, \u2018no it\u2019s not.\u2019 We have tried to have a discussion for over a year.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs are asking for the ordinance to be declared void, an order forcing the city not to enforce it, monetary damages connected to the fines, and attorney fees.\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "How scientists are working to save corals (Part 2)", "description": "Why protect coral reefs?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Martha C. White\n\nA strong stock market and better pay growth has Americans more confident heading into this holiday season: Several studies indicate we\u2019ll spend more \u2014 and borrow more \u2014 to fuel our shopping through the end of the year.\n\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, October activity (excluding cars, gas and restaurant spending) was up by 5.6 percent, year-over-year unadjusted, and all signs point towards a similarly robust holiday season. An NRF survey of more than 7,300 American adults found that the average shopper will crack the four-figure mark, with people saying they will spend an estimated average of $1,007.24 during the holidays, a 4.1 percent increase over last year.\n\nMuch of that spending momentum, though, is fueled by debt: Shoppers today are more willing to finance their holiday splurges, and if past history is any guide, a large number will borrow more than they intended before the year comes to a close.\n\nAccording to a study by WalletHub, 35 percent of shoppers plan to spend more than $500 over the holidays, up two percentage points from the year earlier, and roughly one in five say they expect to still owe money for this spending into February or later.\n\nBut people tend to be overly optimistic about how much they spent and how quickly they can pay it off, said WalletHub analyst Jill Gonzalez. \u201cWhat actually happens is more like three in five end up owing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople are continuing to take on more debt because they see economic numbers doing better,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAll these things do subconsciously influence our spending, especially this time of year\u2026 It\u2019s a sense of groupthink.\u201d Even if individual Americans haven\u2019t seen their financial situations change much, Gonzalez said there is a tendency for people to assume that their raise or other big break is just around the corner. \u201cIt\u2019s banking on something you\u2019re not sure of and spending anyway.\u201d\n\nA couple of factors this year mean that, despite a robust economy, more Americans might find themselves struggling to pay off their debts after the holiday season is over.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to paying off holiday bills, people count on a couple of things. You\u2019re looking for tax refunds, you\u2019re looking for your annual bonus,\u201d Gonzalez said. But tax experts warn that changes to IRS withholding tables mean people could find themselves with a smaller refund on their 2018 taxes, and although wage growth is improving overall, the corporate tax cuts have not translated into higher pay across the board as supporters predicted: A survey by human resources consulting firm Mercer found that a whopping 96 percent of businesses said they had no plans to funnel tax cut savings into higher salaries for 2019.\n\nA survey by Credit Karma found similar \u2014 if equally over-optimistic \u2014 expectations, with 22 percent of respondents saying their holiday spending typically puts them in the red.\n\nIronically, the factor that pushes people into debt over the holidays can be the prospect of a good deal: Credit Karma found that although more than half of survey respondents shopping over Black Friday and Cyber Monday have a budget, 63 percent of those would toss their budget for a really good deal, and 45 percent said they\u2019d go into debt if a discount was deep enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting time to be a consumer in this country. It\u2019s never been easier to buy items you want, it\u2019s never been easier to spend money \u2014 we\u2019re surrounded by more opportunities to spend and we are bombarded online with specially targeted ads that are designed to make us spend more,\u201d said Maizie Simpson, Credit Karma data editor.\n\n\u201cWhen you dig into this a little bit further, you find that Americans just aren\u2019t great at budgeting this time of year. I think you have this phenomenon where people have budgets, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re necessarily writing them down and sticking to them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it comes down to practice, they\u2019re not truly holding themselves accountable.\u201d\n\nOther research indicated that this indeed could be the case. According to a survey from the Center for the New Middle Class from Elevate Credit, an online lender that targets subprime borrowers, roughly four in 10 shoppers who said they just had a general plan for holiday spending as opposed to a detailed budget said they overshot their spending goals.\n\nThis study also indicated that consumers whose credit scores are already lower may be disproportionately affected by the promise of a good deal, even if it actually is detrimental to their finances. Although 36 percent each of prime (those with credit scores of 700 or better) as well as non-prime consumers report spending more than planned over the holidays, shoppers with credit scores below 700 who say they spent more than planned were more likely than their non-prime counterparts shop sales or use coupons to try to save money.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re prepared to spend and you feel like you\u2019re getting a good deal on something you probably have the feeling that you can spend a little more,\u201d said Jonathan Walker, executive director of the Center for the New Middle Class. \u201cPeople tend to think they\u2019re doing a good job because they\u2019re hitting the sales and coupons but they\u2019re not paying attention to the top line.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Rebecca Shabad and Frank Thorp V", "title": "Chuck Grassley opts to cede Judiciary Committee chairmanship", "description": "Sen.

She ended the affair in August after his wife, Shanann, and his two daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, went missing. Shanann was 15 weeks pregnant at the time she vanished.\n\nKessinger said she never doubted he killed them and even went to investigators with her suspicions.\n\nIn her first interview, she told The Denver Post that her short romance with Watts \u2014 which lasted less than two months \u2014 was plagued with lies, starting with him falsely telling her that he was close to finalizing his divorce from Shanann and planned to find a new apartment for him and his daughters.\n\n\u201cHe made me believe that he was doing all of the things that a rational man and good father would do,\u201d she said.\n\nWANT BREAKING ALERTS FROM NBC NEWS? SIGN UP HERE\n\nThose lies started to unravel on Aug. 13, the day Shanann and her daughters vanished from their home. Watts, who publicly pleaded for his family to come back, told Kessinger that Shanann had taken the girls to a play date and never returned, she told The Denver Post.\n\nShe said Watts had also texted her the day his family vanished saying they were \"gone.\"\n\nKessinger recalled how Watts showed little emotion while his family was missing and appeared calm. She said it wasn't until later that day that she learned troubling details about the disappearance, like Shanann's wallet still being at the home and how concerned people looking for the mother and children could not reach them.\n\nKessinger said it was only when she read the news that she found out his wife was pregnant.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018If he was able to lie to me and hide something that big, what else was he lying about?\u2019\" she told the paper.\n\nKessinger began questioning Watts about his family's disappearance, but he would try and change the subject, telling her that he would never hurt his wife and kids.\n\n\u201cIt got to a point that he was telling me so many lies that I eventually told him that I did not want to speak to him again until his family was found,\u201d she said.\n\nAs her suspicions grew, Kessinger reached out to the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office to tell them about their relationship and the lies Watts had told her.\n\nWatts, 33, was arrested on Aug. 15 for the murders. He pleaded guilty on Nov. 6 to all nine counts against him, including five counts of first-degree murder, three counts of tampering with a deceased human body, and one count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy. He took the plea deal to avoid the death penalty. A sentencing hearing for Watts is scheduled for Monday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a logical explanation for what he did,\u201d Kessinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a senseless act, and it\u2019s horrific.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Tim Fitzsimons", "title": "Alleged Brooklyn gay basher charged with hate crimes, faces 15 years in prison", "description": "Brandon McNamara, 25, is the suspect in a violent attack that left two gay men unconscious and with broken bones earlier this year.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/alleged-brooklyn-gay-basher-charged-hate-crimes-faces-15-years-n937141", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_39/2577121/180924-assualt-suspect-al-1411_0bc031bdbfef51e7829ef215a8559174.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:14:00Z", "content": "Nov. 16, 2018 / 4:14 PM GMT Brandon McNamara, the suspect in a gay bashing in Brooklyns hip Williamsburg district, faces up to 15 years in prison for hate crimes he allegedly committed in late September.

After meeting the needs of science, industry and commerce for more than 130 years, the kilogram has just been fundamentally reinvented.\n\nAt a meeting Friday in Versailles, France, representatives from the U.S. and 59 other nations adopted a resolution to define the familiar unit of mass in terms of the Planck constant, an unvarying and infinitesimal number at the heart of quantum physics.\n\n\"Celebrations and standing ovation as the vote is accepted,\" the Bureau of Weights and Standards, which hosted the event where the vote was taken, said in a tweet featuring a photo of packed auditorium. \"This has been a measurement revolution!\"\n\nPreviously, the kilogram was defined as the mass of a specific physical object: a shiny metal cylinder that since 1889 has been stored in a vault on the outskirts of Paris. Cast of a platinum-iridium alloy and roughly the size of a votive candle, the International Prototype of the Kilogram (sometimes called \"Le Grand K\"), represents the mass of one liter of pure water at its freezing point.\n\nThe resolution will take effect on May 20, 2019.\n\nSince the late 1880s, the shiny metal cylinder under these nested bell jars has been used to define the humble kilogram. BIPM / via Reuters\n\nThe kilogram \u2014 which was and still is roughly equivalent to 2.2 pounds \u2014 was redefined in order to streamline scientific research and development involving ultra-precise measurements of mass. It aims to do that by ending the reliance on Le Grand K and official copies of it held by the U.S. and other nations.\n\nThese reference kilograms, which periodically are taken from their protective cocoons for measurement and recalibration, are vulnerable to damage, wear and theft despite the care taken to safeguard them \u2014 and their masses have shifted by tiny amounts over the years.\n\n\"The change brings our best scientific understanding of the natural world directly into our daily lives, and gives us access to a definition of the mass unit which is available to everyone with the will and the skill to perform the experiments,\" Canada's chief metrologist, Alan Steele, told NBC News MACH in an email in advance of the vote.\n\nIn everyday life, the redefinition is expected to have no immediate consequence.\n\n\"Our community has worked very hard to be sure that ordinary people will not notice any difference at the time the change is made,\" Martin Milton, director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, told NBC News MACH in an email.\n\nThus a kilogram of coffee contains no more or less coffee under the new definition than under the old one.\n\nThe newly ratified plan is part of a broader effort to define all seven basic units of the International System of Units (SI) \u2014 the modern version of the metric system that arose in 18th Century France \u2014 on fixed numerical values from the natural world. Unlike physical objects like Le Grand K and the metal bar that once defined the meter, these constants never change.\n\nIn addition, the new plan subtly redefines the ampere (the SI unit of electrical charge); the mole (the unit for the amount of substance in a material); and the kelvin (the unit of temperature). The newly redefined units join three others whose definitions were already based on constants: the second, the meter and the candela, a unit of luminosity.\n\nThe kilogram was the last SI unit still defined by a physical object.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a challenge for our community since the time of the French Revolution to find a standard for mass that is available 'for all time for all people,'\" Milton said, referring to the catchphrase of the developers of the original metric system. \"We have now found that we can achieve what was first conceived over 200 years ago.\"\n\nIf Milton is enthusiastic about the redefined kilogram, he's not alone. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the federal agency that watches over the United States' reference kilograms on its Gaithersburg, Maryland, campus, some researchers were so enthusiastic that they got themed tattoos.\n\n\u201cThis is really a pivot point for humanity,\u201d Jon Pratt, a researcher who worked on the plan to redefine the kilogram and one of the tattooed NIST scientists, said in a written statement.\n\nPratt's tattoo bears a long stream of digits representing the Planck constant, which is designated by a lower-case 'h,' and the French words \"A tous les temps, a tous les peuples.\" English translation: \"For all times, for all peoples.\"\n\nThe design on Jon Pratt's tattoo is based on an 1830's medallion commemorating the adoption of the metric system in France.

But before starring in multi-million dollar movies, the award-winning Latino actor crafted his comedic talent with one-man plays like \u201cSpic-O-Rama\u201d and \u201cMambo Mouth.\u201d\n\nMany of these plays were often based on personal, sometimes dark moments from Leguizamo\u2019s life. This month, the actor, comedian and playwright brought one of his most intimate shows \u2014 the Tony-nominated \u201cLatin History for Morons\u201d \u2014 to a wide streaming audience on Netflix.\n\n\u201cLatin History for Morons\u201d was inspired by Leguizamo\u2019s son \u2014 who was being picked on racially in school \u2014 and is essentially a journey about rediscovering Latin identity. Many Americans \u2014 including U.S. Latinos \u2014 are not familiar with the history and culture of Latin America as well as the deep roots of Americans of Hispanic ancestry and its influence on our American story.\n\nJohn Leguizamo in \"Latin History for Morons.\" Matthew Murphy\n\nOn Friday, November 16, PBS is airing the premiere of \u201cJohn Leguizamo\u2019s Road to Broadway,\u201d which tells the backstory of his acclaimed one-man show, and profiles the actor\u2019s long career path from stand-up comedy to Hollywood and the Great White Way.\n\nThe actor's parents immigrated from Colombia, and one of his grandparents was Puerto Rican. He wanted to learn more about Hispanic historical figures and unexpectedly ended up empowering himself (and others) on stage with a 90-minute tongue-in-cheek play that covers 3,000 years of history, from the Aztec and Incan empires to Spanish patriots in the Revolutionary War to other unsung figures who remain largely unknown to everyday Americans.\n\nLeguizamo shared four of these heroes in a phone interview with NBC News.\n\nJovita Id\u00e1r\n\nJovita Id\u00e1r was a Mexican-American woman who became a pioneer in journalism, education, and political activism at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe daughter of a small Spanish language newspaper publisher in Laredo, Texas, Id\u00e1r wrote articles for La Cr\u00f3nica (The Chronicle) under a pseudonym, exposing poor social and economic conditions that marginalized and exploited Mexican-Americans.\n\nShe was also an outspoken civil rights activist who denounced racism and segregation at a time when Mexican-Americans were being lynched, and signs declaring, \u201cNo Negroes, Mexicans or dogs allowed\u201d were commonplace in small businesses and public spaces.\n\nId\u00e1r resonates with Leguizamo, he said, because she championed education as a tool of empowerment for Mexican-Americans.\n\n\u201cThere is no other means to do it but ourselves, so that we are not devalued and humiliated by the strangers who surround us,\u201d said Id\u00e1r. And now, a century later, Leguizamo finds himself on stage or behind the camera channeling that same urgency to his Latinx fans.\n\n\u201cEducation is the first step to empowerment,\u201d Leguizamo told NBC News. \u201cWe need to see the power of our contributions to feel more inside ourselves, more inside our bodies, more inside our culture. And now [after the experience of putting together \u201cLatin History for Morons\u201d] I feel like we Latinx people created America.\u201d\n\nArturo Schomburg\n\nArturo Schomburg was an influential black historian, writer, activist and collector who helped set the foundation for African-American studies in the United States. This Harlem Renaissance intellectual was the founder of the Negro Society for Historical Research and president of the American Negro Academy \u2014 two organizations that promoted black culture and history.\n\nBut very few Americans today know that this champion of black identity was really a Spanish-speaking black Puerto Rican with a German last name.\n\nHistorians point out that a defining moment in Schomburg\u2019s life happened early on in Puerto Rico, when a schoolteacher told him that black people on the island had no history.\n\nThe idea of having no past would later fuel his passion to collect anything and everything documenting the black diaspora, from newspaper clippings and pamphlets to books, manuscripts, and other memorabilia that could help younger blacks visualize their cultural and ethnic roots. Today, Schomburg\u2019s collection is kept at the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library.\n\nLeguizamo similarly identifies with Schomburg\u2019s passion to learn about his past. Leguizamo told NBC News that if teachers had included more Latino and indigenous heroes in school, he would have not felt so isolated or locked out.\n\n\u201cYou see all these white heroes, everybody is white, all the literature classes\u2014your Shakespeare, your poetry \u2014 everybody\u2019s white, and you start to feel less than,\u201d Leguizamo said. \"If I would have learned about all the great contributions Latinx people made to America, I would have never felt like an outsider. If I would have seen those heroes in my school books I would have never felt like there was no place for me.\u201d\n\nSylvia Mendez\n\nSylvia Mendez was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2010 for her lifelong commitment to civil rights. Her path to empowerment started when she was a little girl; she was the Mexican-Puerto Rican schoolgirl in the landmark case Mendez vs. Westminster \u2014 her family fought the fact that a California school didn't allow her in because it was only for whites \u2014 which set the groundwork for school desegregation in California, and eventually the entire country.\n\nSylvia Mendez Joshua Roberts / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThurgood Marshall (who would later become an associate justice for the U.S. Supreme Court) filed an amicus brief supporting Mendez on behalf of the NAACP. This brief upheld that segregation opposed the values and laws of democracy, an argument that was also used in Brown vs. Board of Education \u2014 the Supreme Court case that ended racial segregation in all public schools.\n\nMendez became a nurse and has dedicated the rest of her life to educating younger generations about the Mendez case and urging youth to stay in school.\n\nFor Leguizamo, Mendez is a trailblazer who planted the seeds of success for future generations of Latinx students.\n\n\u201cShe was one of the first people of color \u2014 a Latinx woman \u2014 who fought against segregation,\u201d Leguizamo said. \u201cShe opened the doors to better schools for all of us.\u201d\n\nMendez also reminds the actor how students still feel excluded. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see yourself talked about in your school days, how can you see yourself projected into the future? How can you see yourself projected into success?\u201d he asked.\n\nDesiderio Alberto \"Desi\" Arnaz\n\nArnaz was a Cuban-born actor, musician and TV producer who became an American icon as Ricky Ricardo in the groundbreaking sitcom \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d But for Leguizamo, Desi is like an imagined padrino or godfather who can still mentor younger generations of aspiring Latino actors in show business.\n\nDesi Arnaz AP\n\n\u201cHe was the first Latin actor I saw on TV, and was a pioneer \u2014 he used [35 mm] film cameras and a live audience to create the sitcom of modern day TV \u2014 and then he started his own production company, which produced Star Trek and The Untouchables,\u201d Leguizamo said.\n\nBut what speaks most directly to Leguizamo about the late Arnaz is the idea that anyone could become an unexpected hero by opening doors for others \u2014 something he has been doing too.\n\n\u201cI feel like an unexpected pioneer,\u201d Leguizamo told NBC News. \u201cI felt so invisible, like our culture was always being excluded, that we didn\u2019t even have a seat at the table.

That\u2019s how much Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, the Republican megadonors, ponied up to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign ($20 million) and to Republican and conservative groups and candidates in the 2018 election cycle ($113 million).\n\nThe Medal of Freedom is America\u2019s highest civilian honor and has been awarded to a who\u2019s who list of cultural icons, athletes and elder statesmen. This year, that list includes the likes of Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth and Sen. Orrin Hatch. The fact Miriam Adelson has also made the cut, however, perfectly captures the crassly transactional nature of Donald Trump and his presidency.\n\nBecause despite whatever adulatory nonsense Trump conjures about Adelson (the White House press release notes her financial support of medical research and Jewish causes), the $133 million elephant in the room is going to make Friday\u2019s ceremony feel very crowded indeed.\n\nDespite whatever adulatory nonsense Trump conjures about Adelson, the $133 million dollar elephant in the room is going to make Friday\u2019s ceremony feel very crowded.\n\nThis was of course not what President John F. Kennedy envisioned when he re-established the honor with a 1963 executive order. President Harry Truman had originally created a version of the medal in 1945 for civilians who had distinguished themselves during the war years. Kennedy revived and expanded the honor, broadening its scope to include cultural achievement.\n\nThis isn\u2019t surprising: Kennedy had a keen sense of the importance of the arts in the life of a nation. \u201cThere is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in the arts,\u201d he wrote to the publisher of Musical America in 1960. \u201cThe age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da Vinci, the age of Elizabeth also the age of Shakespeare.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath waiting for Trump to invoke Pericles, de Medici or da Vinci. (Da Vinci was a loser. My code is a much, much better code.) While he might view his own ascension from reality TV entertainer as the apotheosis of the nexus between the arts and public life, he brings a meaner sensibility to the job than JFK. Kennedy sought high-mindedness; Trump races to the bottom and the bottom line.\n\nOne way Trump\u2019s persona expresses itself is in the cynical way he exercises his presidential prerogatives, often doling them out like so much swag. \u201cAdelson\u2019s medal reflects a growing pattern: one of Trump awarding a large majority of such medals and even pardons to supporters, to Republicans, and to recipients who fit his political agenda,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake reported this week. \u201cOf the 15 pardons/commutations and Medals of Freedom that Trump has given, nine have gone to such recipients. Of the 11 such awards given to living people, eight have been politically oriented.\u201d\n\nThe recipients lined up for Friday\u2019s ceremony are a mixed lot: Adelson will be joined by stalwart conservative Hatch, a Republican from Utah, as well as former professional football players Roger Staubach (a longstanding GOP donor, though he doesn\u2019t register on the Adelsonian scale) and Alan Page. Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley and Antonin Scalia (which sounds like the start of a \u201cwalk into a bar\u201d joke) will round out the group, posthumously.\n\nBut it\u2019s Adelson\u2019s inclusion which has gobsmacked so many. She and her husband aren\u2019t simply GOP donors; they\u2019re the gold standard. The only person who gave more money to Trump\u2019s presidential run, according to the Center for Public Integrity, was the Donald himself. And the $113 million the couple contributed to the 2018 election cycle was as much as the next 11 biggest Republican donors gave, combined, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. It pays to play: Not only is Miriam Adelson getting the medal, but Trump personally lobbied Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sheldon Adelson\u2019s behalf for a casino license.\n\nOf course, none of this is a surprise. Trump has taken the hoary rhetoric of bringing a businessman\u2019s sensibility to government to extremes.\n\nOf course, none of this is a surprise. Trump has taken the hoary rhetoric of bringing a businessman\u2019s sensibility to government to extremes. You can hear it in his ill-informed rants about trade deficits and the derision and venom which he heaps on military alliances like NATO as being a sucker deal for the U.S.\n\n\u201cFear,\u201d Bob Woodward\u2019s recent journey behind the scenes of the Trump White House, makes this point repeatedly as well. Trump boils the U.S. commitment to protecting South Korea down to a dollar figure, which doesn\u2019t even come close to accounting for the economic and security benefits of our presence there. Woodward paraphrases former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s astonishment at Trump thusly: \u201cThe president was speaking as if the U.S. military was a mercenary force for hire.\u2026 As if there were no American interests in forging and keeping a peaceful world order, as if the American organizing principle was money.\u201d At another moment, in relation to Libya, Trump raged. Woodward describes Trump\u2019s view as: \u201cThe generals aren\u2019t sufficiently focused on getting or making . They don\u2019t understand what our objectives should be.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s bottom-line mentality is perhaps most visible in the way he and his family line their own pockets, whether through foreign and domestic emoluments, favors from foreign governments and his other business entanglements with foreign countries like Saudi Arabia and China, the millions he reaps from tenants (including foreign governments), and so on. David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick catalogued the Trumpian abuses in The New York Times last month: \u201cThere\u2019s a word for this,\u201d the paper summarized: \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the arts center which would come to bear his name, John F. Kennedy said in 1962: \u201cAfter the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit.\u201d Except for Miriam Adelson, who will be remembered for her contributions to Donald Trump."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "District Attorney recounts officer-involved shooting in Camp Fire evacuation zone", "description": "Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey describes to reporters the series of events that led to the shooting of a 48-year-old wanted parolee.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Variety\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 William Goldman, who won Oscars for his original screenplay for \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and his adaptation of \"All the President's Men,\" died on Friday in his Manhattan home, according to the the Washington Post. He was 87.\n\nHis daughter Jenny Goldman cited complications from colon cancer and pneumonia as the cause of his death.\n\n\"Butch Cassidy,\" a revisionist Western that helped popularize the buddy movie, announced Goldman as a screenwriter able to balance big laughs with a sense of adventure, while \"All the President's Men\" cemented his status as a deft writer of suspense. The two are considered to be among the finest screenplays ever written and exemplify Goldman's range and versatility.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Signature, Goldman was asked about his ability to bounce from genre to genre.\n\n\"You cross your fingers and never stop,\" he said. \"Praying is also good.\"\n\nGoldman, who frequently transferred his novels, such as \"Magic,\" \"The Princess Bride\" and \"Marathon Man,\" to the screen, was also a chronicler of the movie business. His books, \"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" and \"Hype and Glory,\" offer an unvarnished look at the kind of meddling and risk aversion by studio big wigs that all too often neuters creativity. Of the movie business he once famously observed \"nobody knows anything,\" a bit of wry wisdom that is often quoted on studio lots and executive suites.\n\nGoldman also turned his penetrating eyes towards the stage and professional sports, collaborating on accounts of those industries. As with his scripts, he brought acute observation, entertainment value and, especially, wit to even his most serious enterprises. He also did uncredited touch ups on such films as \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"The Right Stuff\" and \"Good Will Hunting\" as well as some films he was probably happy not to have on his resume, such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger flop \"The Last Action Hero.\"\n\nIn an April 2015 piece on Goldman, the Writers Guild magazine Written By declared: \"What's remarkable about 'Butch Cassidy' and Bill Goldman is how many kids they encouraged and how many would-be writers turned themselves into screenwriters by studying the script and the movie and Goldman's memoir 'Adventures in the Screen Trade.'\" Further detailing his influence, the magazine said: \"His descriptive style, with its literary origins and frequent use of asides and comments, provides a map to a screenwriting path followed enthusiastically by writers from Shane Black to Vince Gilligan.\"\n\nHis 1964 novel \"Boys and Girls Together\" failed to impress critics, but it became Goldman's first bestseller. That same year came \"No Way to Treat a Lady,\" a comic thriller that also later became a film. It was published under one of the many pseudonyms he used, Harry Longbaugh, the real name of the Sundance Kid.\n\nA screenwriting career came about by accident, Goldman said. Having read an early draft of \"No Way,\" actor Cliff Robertson thought it a film treatment and asked Goldman to adapt the short story \"Flowers for Algernon\" to the screen. Though none of Goldman's work made it into the movie eventually called \"Charley,\" it was through Robertson that Goldman was brought in to work on the 1965 caper movie \"Masquerade,\" his first produced film, for which he shared the script credit with Michael Relph. He next adapted Ross MacDonald's \"The Moving Target,\" which became the 1966 Paul Newman vehicle \"Harper.\"\n\nGoldman spent a year exploring the 1967-68 Broadway season -- doing everything from attending out-of-town tryouts of every production and to conducting interviews with actors and directors. \"The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway\" was criticized for bias and snark when it was published in 1969, but reviewers conceded that it was a highly entertaining read.\n\nAlso in 1969, Goldman received what was then a high-water mark of $400,000 for his original screenplay \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" The film starring Newman and Robert Redford was one of the biggest hits of the decade and made Goldman a screenwriter in demand.\n\nGoldman adapted his 1974 novel \"Marathon Man\" as a bigscreen vehicle for Dustin Hoffman and Laurence Olivier. The ending of the movie was changed without his consent, but the film contained a memorable sequence of torture that still leaves viewers reluctant to return to the dentist's chair. His 1976 novel \"Magic\" later made it to the screen with Anthony Hopkins.\n\nGoldman always considered himself first and foremost a novelist, but his scripts received so favorable a reception that he could not resist turning out such efforts as heist comedy \"The Hot Rock\" in 1972, a 1975 adaptation of Ira Levin's \"The Stepford Wives\" (from which he begged to have his name removed) and \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" a less-successful Redford vehicle about aviatorial barnstorming.\n\nHe had such a strong working relationship with Redford that he was enlisted to adapt \"All the President's Men,\" based on the Watergate investigation by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, in 1976. The film scored at the box office and picked up several Oscar nominations, including one for best picture. However, his next adaptation, of Cornelius Ryan's WWII epic \"A Bridge Too Far,\" was deemed overlong and was a box office disappointment.\n\nGoldman's first venture into television was the four-hour miniseries \"Mr. Horn\" in 1979. By now his experiences in Hollywood had reached critical mass, and he fictionalized some of those feelings in the 1979 novel \"Tinsel.\"\n\nHe adapted his 1973 adult fairy tale \"The Princess Bride: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure\" (1973) for the successful, and enduringly popular, 1987 film. (There was no S. Morgenstern classic tale; that was just a conceit, which he also used in a later work, \"The Silent Gondoliers\"). The film, a tongue-in-cheek adventure movie did only middling box office in its theatrical run, but became a cult favorite on video. Lines such as \"Never go in against a Sicilian when DEATH is on the line,\" and \"as you wish\" became fan favorites and entered the popular lexicon.\n\nSeveral nonfiction efforts also achieved popularity, especially 1983's straightforward and astute account of the movie business \"Adventures in the Screen Trade.\" It became a bestseller. Later in the decade he collaborated with sports writer Mike Lupica on \"Wait Till Next Year,\" which looked at 1987's baseball, football and basketball seasons. In 1990 came \"Hype and Glory,\" an account of Goldman's experiences as a judge for the Cannes Film Festival and the Miss America Pageant.\n\nThough his later work couldn't match the verve and promise of \"Butch Cassidy,\" a 1990 adaptation of Stephen King's novel \"Misery\" was an exception. The thriller stared James Caan as a novelist imprisoned by his number one fan, Kathy Bates. The actress won an Oscar for her work and fifteen years later, Goldman adapted \"Misery\" for the Broadway stage in a production starring Bruce Willis. Other Goldman efforts such as \"Year of the Comet,\" \"Memoirs of an Invisible Man,\" \"Chaplin,\" and \"The Chamber\" were a mixed bag commercially and artistically.\n\nThe thrillers \"The Ghost and the Darkness,\" \"The General's Daughter,\" and \"Absolute Power\" made money, as did a big-screen version of the TV series \"Maverick,\" but by then Goldman was as in demand for his work as a script doctor as he was for his original efforts.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Goldman grew up in the Highland Park suburbs. After attending Oberlin College, Goldman served in the military, then returned to school to complete his masters in English at Columbia University in 1956. That year he wrote his first novel, \"Temple of Gold,\" in 10 days, and though he had previously failed to get his early short stories published, Alfred Knopf picked up the coming-of-age tale, and it received good notices.\n\nHis next novel, \"Your Turn to Curtsy, My Turn to Bow,\" also dealt with a young male's life crisis; it was followed in 1960 by the well-received \"Soldier in the Rain,\" a tragi-comedy set on a Southern training base. It would be the first of his novels to reach the screen in the mid-'60s.\n\nIn 1967 he published the well-regarded marital drama tale \"The Thing of It Is...\" A bit later came novels including \"Father's Day\" and the children's book \"Wigger.\" \"Control,\" about a group of people who try to alter the future and the past, was well received when published in 1982. He also wrote \"The Color of Light\" and \"The Brothers,\" a sequel to \"Marathon Man.\" Goldman collaborated with his brother James, who died in 1998, on a stage comedy, \"Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole,\" and a musical, \"A Family Affair.\"\n\nGoldman was married to photographer Ilene Jones from 1961 until their divorce in 1991. He is survived by their two daughters, Jenny and Susanna.\n\nCarmel Dagan contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Pete Williams", "title": "Judge orders White House to temporarily restore CNN reporter's press pass", "description": "The order to restore Acosta's access came from Judge Timothy Kelly, appointed a year ago to the federal district court in Washington, D.C., by President Donald Trump.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/judge-orders-white-house-restore-cnn-reporter-s-press-pass-n936411", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646596/181114-jim-acosta-cnn-donald-trump-press-conference-cs-451p_3294c3406105f3c5697c9411b50f963a.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:30:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Pete Williams\n\nA federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to immediately return, on a temporary basis, the press pass of CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who was barred from the White House last week after a contentious encounter with President Donald Trump at a news conference.\n\nJudge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump a year ago to federal district court in Washington, said the White House must give the credential back temporarily to give Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, a chance to persuade the administration that he should be allowed to keep it.\n\nThe White House suspended Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which gives reporters access to the White House complex, shortly after the Nov. 7 news conference. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said she acted because Acosta had refused to surrender the microphone that reporters use to ask questions. Her statement accused him of \"placing his hands\" on a White House intern who tried to take the microphone back. Acosta's conduct, she said, was \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nTrump addressed the ruling during a bill signing on Friday, saying that the administration was \u201cwriting up rules\u201d regarding journalist conduct.\n\n\"We have to practice decorum,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re setting up a certain standard, which is what the court is requesting.\u201d\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders said Friday\u2019s court order \u201cmade clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House,\u201d however, that was never the issue in the case. Having allowed reporters in to cover the president, CNN said, the White House could not then pick and choose who get a press pass based on whether a news organization covers the president favorably.\n\nSanders said the White House would abide by the judge's decision.\n\n\u201cWe will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass,\" Sanders aid in a statement. \"We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.\"\n\nAcosta and Sam Feist, CNN\u2019s Washington bureau chief, entered the White House grounds not long after the ruling, attracting the attention of photographers and video camera operators as they made their way down the driveway.\n\nCNN filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Trump, Sanders and other officials, accusing them of violating the First Amendment rights of CNN and Acosta to report on the presidency. \"This severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting,\" CNN's lawyers said.\n\nKelly said the White House had denied Acosta's right to due process by suspending his credential with no notice, but the judge did not rule on the First Amendment issues at the heart of the case.\n\nCourts have long held that the government cannot discriminate against disfavored points of view.\n\nSuspending Acosta's press pass, which gives him access to the White House and his office in the building, is \"an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president's point of view,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nSeveral other news organizations, including The Associated Press, Fox News, NBC News, The New York Times and The Washington Post, supported CNN. \"Reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions,\" they said in a joint statement. \"It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the president and his activities and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons.\"\n\nBut the Justice Department told the judge that Acosta's press pass was suspended because he \"disrupted the fair and orderly administration of a press conference.\" The government's legal brief abandoned the claim in Sanders' statement that Acosta had placed his hands on an intern.\n\nAs for the First Amendment issue, the government said presidents have the same discretion to regulate access to the White House as they do to select which journalists get interviews or which reporters they call on at news conferences.\n\nThe government lawyers said there's no general right for the public or the press to enter the White House, and the First Amendment is not violated when a president exercises discretion to deny access to any of the hundreds of journalists who seek entry to the White House complex. Besides, the Justice Department said, roughly 50 other CNN employees already have White House press passes.\n\nLast week's televised exchange was particularly testy. When Acosta tried to ask a follow-up question, Trump said: \"CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you work for them. You are a rude, terrible person.\"\n\nBut the White House response appears to be the first time a reporter's press credential was suspended because of a journalist's demeanor."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "DeVos proposes changes to campus sex misconduct rules that allow accused to question accusers", "description": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is proposing a major overhaul to the way colleges handle complaints of sexual misconduct.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/devos-proposes-changes-campus-sex-misconduct-rules-allow-accused-question-n937111", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_34/2543826/180824-betsy-devos-ac-852p_aa4545cac22a83fac0d5f330be9673dc.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:00:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Associated Press\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday proposed a major overhaul to the way colleges and universities handle complaints of sexual misconduct, adding protections for students accused of assault and harassment, and narrowing the types of cases schools would be required to investigate.\n\nUnder the plan, schools would be required to investigate complaints only if they occurred on campus or other areas overseen by the school, and only if they were reported to certain campus officials with the authority to take action.\n\nThe Education Department says the proposal ensures fairness for students on both sides of accusations, while offering schools greater flexibility to help victims who don't want to file formal complaints that could trigger an investigation.\n\n\"Throughout this process, my focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,\" DeVos said in a statement. \"That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.\"\n\nDeVos previously said the existing rules were too prescriptive, pressuring schools to take heavy action against students accused of misconduct without giving them a fair chance to defend themselves.\n\nThe new proposal adds protections for accused students, giving them a presumption of innocence throughout the disciplinary process and the right to review all evidence a school collects. They would also be able to cross-examine their accusers, although it would be done indirectly through a representative to avoid personal confrontation.\n\nIf finalized, it will tell schools how to apply the 1972 law known as Title IX, which forbids discrimination based on sex in schools that receive federal funding.\n\nIn September 2017, DeVos rescinded a set of 2011 rules that were created under the Obama administration and guided schools on how to handle complaints.\n\nAdvocacy groups for victims say the Obama rules forced schools to stop brushing the issue under the rug, while advocates for accused students say it tipped the scales in favor of accusers. Some college leaders complained that the rules were too complex and could be overly burdensome.\n\nAmong other changes, DeVos's proposal narrows the definition of what constitutes sexual harassment. It would be defined as unwelcome sexual conduct that's \"so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity.\"\n\nIt also allows schools to use a higher standard of proof to determine if a student should be found responsible for misconduct. While the Obama guidance told schools to use a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, meaning the allegation is \"more likely than not\" true, the new proposal would allow a \"clear and convincing\" standard, meaning the claim is highly probable.\n\nThe department will collect public input on the rules before they can be finalized.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 16, 2018, 11:32 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the procedure that could be used in cross-examinations of those accusing other students of misconduct. The cross-examinations would be done indirectly through a representative; accused students would not be able to directly question their accusers."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Is NATO still relevant in today\u2019s world?", "description": "The chance of an armed, foreign invasion on U.S. soil is super slim.

She gets to add a new title Friday when President Donald Trump honors her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nMiriam Adelson is among seven people Trump is recognizing with the medal, the highest honor America can give a civilian.\n\nThe other recipients include retiring Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of the longest-serving senators in U.S. history; Alan Page, who was elected to the Minnesota Supreme Court after an NFL career with the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears; and Roger Staubach, the Hall of Fame Dallas Cowboys quarterback.\n\nPosthumous honors are being granted to Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth and Antonin Scalia, the conservative Supreme Court justice.\n\nThe Adelsons gave Trump's presidential campaign a $30 million boost in the final months of the 2016 race. The couple followed up this election cycle by donating $100 million to the Republican Party for last week's midterms.\n\nMiriam Adelson, 73, is an Israeli-born, naturalized U.S. citizen who earned a medical degree from Tel Aviv University and founded a pair of drug abuse treatment and research centers in Las Vegas and Tel Aviv. She and her husband own the Las Vegas Review-Journal and Israel Hayom newspapers.\n\nThe Adelsons are also avid supporters of Israel. Their passion for strengthening the country, along with Israel-U.S. relations, has helped keep such policy priorities as relocating the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem front and center in the Republican Party and the Trump administration.\n\nTrump moved the embassy in May, and Sheldon Adelson, who had offered to personally fund the move, was seated in the front row for the ceremony.\n\nRobert Weissman, president of public interest group Public Citizen, said it was difficult to believe the decision to recognize Miriam Adelson was based on merit.\n\n\"It's emblematic of the corrupt and transactional presidency of Donald Trump, and it is a shame, but not a surprise, that he is corroding and corrupting a civic treasure, an honor like the Medal of Freedom,\" Weissman said.\n\nLindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said Trump used the process that previous administrations have followed to settle on his group of honorees. The process was coordinated by the office of the staff secretary, taking into account recommendations from the public, relevant presidential advisory bodies, the Cabinet and senior White House staff, she said.\n\nThe award is given to individuals \"who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\"\n\nMiriam Adelson said she is \"deeply humbled and moved by this exceptional honor.\"\n\n\"Liberty is at the heart of my decades of work against substance abuse. Drug dependency is enslavement, for the user and his or her family and society, and treatment an emancipation,\" she said in a statement released Thursday by Las Vegas Sands Corp., a company owned by Sheldon Adelson that operates hotels and casinos around the world. \"Together, my husband, Sheldon, and I have dedicated our lives to freedom: to a free market that benefits the greater good and to philanthropic endeavors that succor those suffering from poverty and disease.\"\n\nE. Fletcher McClellan, a political science professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, said there are no limitations on who can receive the presidential honor.\n\n\"He has total discretion as to who and when and how,\" said McClellan, who has studied the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nChristopher Devine, a politics professor at the University of Dayton, questioned Miriam Adelson's impact on American culture or national interests as compared to past recipients like Oprah Winfrey or Bruce Springsteen. Both Winfrey and Springsteen received medals from President Barack Obama, whom they supported politically.\n\n\"This is what leaves many people wondering whether President Trump singled her out for an award as something of a thank-you for her and husband Sheldon Adelson's very substantial donations to Republican candidates and causes over the years, including ones in support of Trump's election in 2016,\" said Devine, who wrote a book about the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nDevine said that while Miriam Adelson isn't the first campaign contributor to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the size of her campaign contributions sets her apart from the rest."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jonathan Allen", "title": "The Florida recount is really about the 2020 presidential election", "description": "Analysis: Sure, Democrats want Bill Nelson to win.

It's about the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe small armies of Democratic and Republican lawyers, oodles of operatives and platoons of protesters who have descended on Florida all know that Republican Rick Scott, who led by more than 12,000 votes after the first and second rounds of balloting, will, in all likelihood, be the winner after a hand recount is complete.\n\nEven if Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson were to pull off a miracle comeback in the final round of tallies, the Senate seat hardly justifies the attention and expense the two parties have lavished on the fight.\n\nAnd whatever the outcome, Republicans will retain a narrow majority in the Senate that falls far short of the 60 votes needed to prevent Democrats from stopping their legislative agenda.\n\nWhat Floridians are watching isn't an all-out battle over a single Senate seat \u2014 or even a fight over that prize combined with a governor's race that Republican Ron DeSantis leads by a wide enough margin that it doesn't merit a manual recount under state law.\n\nInstead, they're seeing a dry run of what could be an epic legal, political and public relations war for Florida's electoral votes in the next presidential election if the state's voters continue to be almost evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nFlorida has sided with the winner of the presidential election in each of the last six contests, but they've all been close. It's been 30 years since a presidential candidate won more than 52.1 percent of Florida's vote, and the statewide winner in five of the last seven presidential elections totaled less than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nAnd, of course, the 537 votes that separated George W. Bush and Al Gore after a recount fight in 2000 put Bush in the White House and Gore on the speaking circuit.\n\nSince the polls closed on Nov. 6, Democratic lawyers have filed a series of lawsuits in federal and state courts challenging the actions of state officials and various aspects of election law, from the setting of deadlines for counting votes to how ballots are tallied.\n\n\"They want 2020 to be the Wild West in Florida,\" said Brad Todd, a senior adviser to Scott. \"Bill Nelson\u2019s lawyers have known from the beginning that nothing they could do was going to reverse this election but they took the opportunity to file as many lawsuits as they could to get rid of the fraud protection laws that they dislike.\"\n\nBut it's not just what Democrats are doing in Florida that helps put the Florida brawl in context. It's what Republicans are doing there.\n\nThe GOP tapped one of its top election lawyers, Jessica Furst Johnson, to manage a team of attorneys from white-shoe Washington law firms to counter the Democratic moves here. Volunteers were quickly recruited \u2014 and offered free flights, room and board \u2014 to descend on the state in defense of Scott.\n\nAnd party luminaries ranging all the way up to President Donald Trump have kept up a steady drumbeat of allegations that Democrats are trying to perpetrate a fraud on the voters of Florida \u2014 to steal an election.\n\n\"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles,\" Trump said in an interview with the Daily Caller. \"Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. ... It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u201d He did not cite evidence to back up his assertions.\n\nTrump would have won the 2016 election without Florida's 29 electoral votes \u2014 he carried the state by a little more than 1 percentage point \u2014 but not by much. He knows it is a key piece of his electoral college coalition, and losing it would make a Democratic nominee's path to the presidency far easier.\n\nThat's why the hand-to-hand combat, which is being waged in courtrooms and election supervisors' offices across the state, has much more meaning for the next presidential election than it does for the fate of Trump's agenda or his nominees in the next Congress.\n\nJessica Levinson, who teaches election law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the battle in Florida can be about two things at once.\n\n\"Like almost everything else concerning the 2018 midterms, the Florida recount is both about this year\u2019s big races and 2020,\" she wrote in a text exchange with NBC. \"The Florida recount feels like a stress test on the fault lines which are our voting laws. At some point they could break, and they have yet to be retrofitted.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "'Love will prevail': Costa Rica's same-sex couples can marry in 2020", "description": "Legalizing gay marriage was a major campaign promise by President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, who took office in May.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/love-will-prevail-costa-rica-s-same-sex-couples-can-n937106", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648936/181116-same-sex-marriage-costa-rica-cs-905a_a811c8c2c1c62302500166f626a460b3.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:11:00Z", "content": "Nov. 16, 2018 / 2:11 PM GMT / Source: Reuters SAN JOSE Same-sex couples in Costa Rica will have the right to get married by mid-2020, the nation's constitutional court has ruled, a first for socially conservative Central America.

Rather than helping us slow down, technology is forcing us to move even faster.\u201d\n\nConsequently, many of us (myself included) are eager to practice and learn patience \u2014 a trait that, as any infant or toddler will show you \u2014 we are not born with.\n\nTo break from the chaos, tune into traditional Japanese wisdom\n\nLevine has noted that in a response to the rapidly changing and demanding environment we\u2019re living in, there\u2019s been \u201ca counter-trend against the barrage of tasks and technology that we are inundated with everyday. Patience is the other side of the coin of speed and we\u2019re looking more to [integrate] that into our lives.\u201d\n\nLevine notes a spike of interest in ancient wisdom and practices that originated in Japan, one of the ancestral homes of Zen Buddhism. We\u2019ve compiled a roundup of some of these teachings and explored how they can help us exercise patience \u2014 and ultimately, restore our connection with the fleeting nature of life.\n\nWabi-Sabi: Embrace the perfectly imperfect\n\nAccepting and embracing transience and imperfection is key to wabi-sabi. Often we see this view applied to aesthetics, and one that can be found in some Japanese pottery, particularly the cups used in the Japanese tea ceremony, notes Sayaka Fujii, director of Japan National Tourism Organization.\n\n\u201cWe take the object as it is \u2014 the cracks, the age, the rot,\u201d says Fujii. \u201cWe accept it and try to see it as beautiful and as a reminder that nothing lasts. This philosophy reminds us that our bodies and all materials are transient.\u201d\n\nThe term, which Fujii notes is quite difficult to translate into English, embodies two separate philosophies: Wabi \u201cmeaning loneliness (internally)\u201d and sabi, meaning \u201cwithered, rustic (externally),\u201d she says. \u201cI think wabi is the heart/sense to feel the beauty of sabi, and when they are integrated, wabi-sabi is to feel the beauty in imperfection. Everything is transformable, impermanent, getting old and never lasts forever.\u201d\n\nPatience plays strongly into this merged viewpoint notes Kino MacGregor, an international yoga teacher and author who is half-Japanese and spent much of her childhood in Japan, because \u201cit takes a while to reach this point of acceptance in ourselves.\u201d\n\nThis is especially true when applying wabi-sabi to our bodies, which we may be constantly judging for perceived aesthetic flaws. \u201cWabi-sabi is about embracing the perfectly imperfect whole,\u201d says McGregor. \u201cSo, if you have a misshapen nose but it works perfectly, wabi-sabi would be embracing that and saying, \u2018I am perfectly imperfect. This isn\u2019t a one-and-done deal, but a daily process where you have to see the beauty in your crooked nose. [Visualizing] yourself from that paradigm takes a lot of patience as the world around you may be telling you a different story.\u201d\n\nKintsugi: Fill the cracks with gold. Your scars are beautiful.\n\nClosely tied to wabi-sabi, Kintsugi is, as Tiffany Ayuda explained in her piece on the subject, \u201cthe Japanese art of putting broken pottery pieces back together with gold \u2014 built on the idea that in embracing flaws and imperfections, you can create an even stronger, more beautiful piece of art.\u201d\n\nKintsugi means \u201cgolden joinery\u201d, says MacGregor, and it\u2019s a concept that we can apply not only to our broken dishes, but to any healing process or imperfection in our bodies.\n\n\u201cThis concept is so important to take to heart when we look at our bodies,\u201d says MacGregor. \u201cWe have scars, wounds and other body parts that might be considered \u2018cracked\u2019 or \u2018broken\u201d by the standards of big brands and mainstream beauty. But if we can fill those cracks with the golden embrace of love, then we can learn to celebrate ourselves in totality. Rather than our flaws being something to hide and disguise, how amazing would it be if we learned to truly love everything about ourselves?\u201d\n\nThis practice is one that cultivates patience because it defies our reliance on instant gratification and quick fixes.\n\n\u201cOur bodies are broken pieces of pottery that need to be embraced rather than say, put a mask on and lose 10 years in 5 minutes,\u201d says MacGregor. \u201cEmbrace the patience required for the healing process in any cracked or broken body part, community part or physical object. The pot gets filled in with gold and is then more valuable. Be patient with all the places you are cracked and find the material that will fill it. That message of patience and healing is one that we really need right now both as individuals and as a country.\u201d\n\nShankankan: The beauty in taking your time\n\nThe Japanese philosophy, Shankankan, is perhaps the one on this list that most emphatically speaks to the virtue of patience, meaning loosely, \u201cthere\u2019s beauty in taking your time.\u201d\n\n\u201cShankankan originates from an old Zen story about a young pupil who wanted to learn so fast, and asked the master monk over and over how to get enlightened,\u201d says MacGregor. \u201c The master monk said to him, basically, \u2018be calm, don\u2019t hurry, take your time.\u2019 That is perfect patience.\u201d\n\nMost everyone can, on some level, identify with this eager young pupil, especially in our fast-paced society and wants answers and solutions immediately.\n\n\u201cIn our American culture we want immediacy,\u201d says MacGregor. \u201cPatience is the understanding that this is a long journey and you can\u2019t rush the process, particularly in the Zen meditation tradition of spiritual ripening.\u201d\n\nMeditation is a great way to practice Shankankan, but you may also want to integrate this philosophy into your beauty regimen.\n\n\u201cTaking time, instead of rushing, is very important for skincare,\u201d says Koko Hayashi, an anti-aging expert from Japan who teaches facial yoga. \u201cThe Japanese believe that quick results don't last, but slow results last for a long time. Botox gives you instant results, but if we can control our facial muscles to cause less wrinkles and sagging, it's much better, as it's natural and long lasting. Waking up sleeping facial muscles, relaxing over-working facial muscles and fixing bad facial expressions habits fix the root cause of aging symptoms in the face. To the Japanese, [getting to] the fundamental problem is more important than just covering up with quick fixes.\u201d\n\nIkigai: Find your true purpose (beyond your career)\n\nWhat is my true purpose? This is probably one of the toughest questions we can ask ourselves, at least, it is if you\u2019re taking the way of Ikigai, which serves as an intersection between your values, cares and strengths and what the world needs.\n\n\u201cI think the western idea of purpose tends to be very focused on what your profession and livelihood are and how to make money,\u201d says MacGregor. \u201cIkigai is quite different. It\u2019s about finding what you love and what the world needs. That requires patience in the sense that it won\u2019t be revealed to you in one moment. You\u2019ll need space and time for those answers.\u201d\n\nConsistent meditation is integral to discovering or connecting with one\u2019s Ikigai.\n\n\u201cThis purpose has to organically arise in moments of deep reflection,\u201d MacGregor adds. \u201cWe need to be rooted in emptiness to find [Ikigai]. A classic Zen story [that speaks to Ikigai] tells of a student who goes to a Zen master and says, \u2018tell me exactly what my purpose is, where I should go, and how I can find peace.\u2019 The Zen master says, \u2018You\u2019ve come to me with a cup full of mud. Go empty your cup and then come back so I can pour fresh water in.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe all have to empty our cups \u2014 our fears, opinions and conditioning \u2014 to find our true purpose, a process that requires extensive meditation and possibly, quite a lot of hardship.\n\n\u201cAt what point do we find the wisdom? Only after we have suffered a lot and return to that state of emptiness,\u201d says MacGregor.\n\nWe all need a refresher on these aged pearls of wisdom\n\nMacGregor underscores that while all these wisdoms stem from Japan, one shouldn\u2019t assume that modern Japanese populations are practicing them to a tee.\n\n\u201cA lot of these Japanese philosophies that get fetishized in the western world are those that everyday Japanese people need reminding of, too,\u201d says MacGregor. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to recognize that there are certain cultural elements that being in a Japanese family will put in your consciousness, but that still, these principles are ancient Zen philosophies and that not everyone in Japan follows them. That would be like the Japanese believing that because many Americans worship Jesus, they\u2019re all mirroring his wisdoms exactly. That\u2019s far from the case. These are ancient philosophies that everyone can [benefit] from, no matter where you are, and I think many people in Japan could use the reminder, too.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM BETTER\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 During the last two months of the 2018 midterm campaign, as President Trump talked about the caravan and Brett Kavanaugh and as Democrats focused on pre-existing conditions, special counsel Robert Mueller stayed out of the news. Almost entirely.\n\nIndeed, the last major development in the Russia investigation took place on September 14, when former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manfort pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigative team. (That feels more like two years ago than two months ago, right?)\n\nBut count us among those who believe that the silence from the Russia probe is about to end. For starters, longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone and Jerome Corsi have been talking about upcoming indictments against them.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump rage-tweeted at Mueller on Thursday. \u201cThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don\u2019t... care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won\u2019t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\u201d (In fact, George W. Bush tapped Mueller to lead the FBI in 2001, and he worked there until 2013 \u2014 so barely into Obama\u2019s second term.)\n\nAnd Mueller was on Trump\u2019s mind when the conservative Daily Caller interviewed the president on Wednesday and asked him about acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\n\u201c\u2026[Whitaker] is just somebody that\u2019s very respected. I knew him only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions. And, you know, look, as far as I\u2019m concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had. It\u2019s something that should have never been brought. It\u2019s an illegal investigation. And you know, it\u2019s very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, Mueller\u2019s not Senate confirmed.\u201d\n\nHmmmmm. If Mueller is on the president\u2019s mind, you have to wonder if the special counsel is about to make some news.\n\nMajor events in the Mueller investigation\n\nBy the way, here\u2019s a helpful timeline of some of the major events in the Mueller/Russia probe \u2014 the indictments, the guilty pleas and the prison sentences.\n\nOct. 30, 2017: Paul Manafort and Rick Gates are indicted in Mueller probe; George Papadopoulos pleads guilty\n\nFeb. 16, 2018: Mueller indicts 13 Russians and three companies regarding Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election\n\nApril 9, 2018: FBI raids the offices and home of longtime Trump lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen, seizing business records, emails and documents\n\nJuly 13, 2018: Special counsel Robert Mueller indicts 12 Russian intelligence officials for hacking Democratic organizations and the Clinton campaign\n\nAug. 21, 2018: Cohen pleads guilty; jury finds Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty on eight counts\n\nSept. 7, 2018: Papadopoulos is sentenced to 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI early in inquiry on election interference\n\nSept. 14, 2018: Manafort pleads guilty, agrees to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigative team\n\nAssange to be indicted?\n\nSpeaking of indictments, NBC\u2019s Ken Dilanian reports: \u201cA court document filed by mistake has revealed that the Justice Department is preparing to criminally charge Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, months after Special Counsel Robert Mueller cited his organization\u2019s participation in Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. In a bizarre slip first unearthed by a former U.S. intelligence official and posted on Twitter, Assange\u2019s name appears twice in an August court filing by a federal prosecutor in Virginia\u2014an argument to keep sealed an unrelated case involving an accused child sex criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prosecutor wrote that the charges and arrest warrant \u2018would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter. At another point in the document, the prosecutor wrote that \u201cdue to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\u201d\n\nWith their win in ME-2, Democrats are now at 35 House pickups \u2014 and counting\n\nOn Thursday, NBC News declared Democrat Jared Golden the winner of the ME-2 congressional race \u2014 after the state\u2019s experiment in ranked-choice voting, per NBC\u2019s Ben Kamisar.\n\n\u201cGolden surged ahead thanks to an overwhelming edge among those who cast their ballots for one of the independent candidates but ranked Golden above [Republican Bruce] Poliquin. The Democrat finished with 50.53 percent of the vote, compared to the Republican's 49.47 percent, the secretary of state's office announced.\u201d\n\nThat brings Democrats to 35 House pickups.\n\nWhile the AP has called CA-45 for the Democrats, NBC News has yet to make that call. But assuming Dems win CA-45 and CA-39, it will be an Orange County sweep for the party. And the only GOP congressman south of Los Angeles will be indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.\n\nRecount in Florida nears its conclusion\n\n\u201cFlorida concluded the first phase of a tumultuous recount of its midterm election on Thursday, with state officials ordering a manual recount in the hotly contested Senate race between Rick Scott, the Republican governor, and the Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson,\u201d the New York Times writes. \u201cMr. Scott maintained a slim lead over his opponent. Ron DeSantis, a fiery conservative and enthusiastic ally of President Trump, held onto a more substantial lead in the race for governor, avoiding a next round of recounts despite the vow of his Democratic opponent, Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, to push the authorities to count additional ballots.\u201d\n\nThe uncalled Senate races (1)\n\nFL-SEN (Scott leads Nelson by 12,562 votes as the contest heads to a manual recount)\n\n(MS-SEN goes to runoff)\n\nThe uncalled GOV races (1)\n\nGA-GOV (GOPer Brian Kemp remains at 50.3 percent)\n\nThe uncalled House races (6)\n\nCA-39 (GOPer Young Kim barely leads Dem Gil Cisernos, 50.0 percent to 50.0 percent)\n\nCA-45 (Dem Katie Porter leads GOPer Mimi Walters, 50.8 percent to 49.2 percent)\n\nGA-7 (GOPer Rob Woodall is ahead, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\n-- ME-2 (Dem Jared Golden was the winner)\n\nNM-2 (NBC News retracted its earlier call in favor of the Republicans; Dem Xochitl Torres Small is ahead, 51 percent to 49 percent)\n\nNC-9 (GOPer Mark Harris is ahead, 49.4 percent to 48.8 percent)\n\nUT-4 (Dem Ben McAdams is ahead, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\nDo Pelosi\u2019s Dem critics have the votes to defeat her?\n\nNBC\u2019s Leigh Ann Caldwell, Alex Moe and Marianna Sotomayor: \u201cWhile Pelosi is remains the heavy favorite to be her party's choice when House Democrats hold their leadership elections in less than two weeks, the hurdles for her are higher than many expected\u2026 Making her position appear more perilous, many members \u2014 far more than are likely to oppose her \u2014 are withholding their public support and using this intense campaign period to extract concessions from leadership. After their meeting with Pelosi on Thursday, Congressional Progressive Caucus leaders Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, R-Wash., said they would discuss Pelosi's bid with the members of the CPC.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith caught on video appearing to advocate for voter suppression\n\n\u201cA video surfaced Thursday of Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi saying it might be a \u2018great idea\u2019 to make it harder for some people to vote, and her campaign quickly responded that she was \u2018obviously\u2019 joking,\u201d per NBC\u2019s Allan Smith.\n\n\u201c\u2018And then they remind me that there's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who ... maybe we don't want to vote,\u2019 Hyde-Smith is heard saying. \u2018Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult.

She would finish in just two years, graduating in 2015.\n\nWintersoul\u2019s journey is detailed in the documentary \u201cMemory Games,\u201d which made its world debut Sunday at the DOC NYC film festival. The film follows Wintersoul and three other competitors as they prepare for the 2017 World Memory Championships in Jakarta. At that competition, she would take home the gold in the names and faces category, which has competitors identify people in photos after a period of memorization.\n\nHer ability to easily remember complex concepts and scenes is a far cry from her struggles to recall math and physics formulas as an adolescent. Wintersoul attributes the difference between her academic performance in high school and college is solely due to the use of memory techniques.\n\n\u201cI honestly think that we as kids subconsciously learn to find joy and association techniques with some subjects but not others,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it's necessarily innate.\u201d\n\nThe key to remembering names and faces, according to Wintersoul, is to teach your brain how to make associations with objects and places that you are already familiar with. \u201cMost of us think we're terrible at remembering people's names, when we really didn't hear what they said in the first place,\u201d she said. \u201cThe basic process is just about linking what you do know with what you don't know.\"\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you meet someone new named Rose. Wintersoul said the best way to remember Rose\u2019s name is to begin connecting it to other things: Does her perfume smell like roses? Does she look like Rose McGowan or the main character of \u2018Titanic\u2019?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to build these thought bridges between whatever you know and what you want to know,\u201d Wintersoul said.\n\nYanjaa Wintersoul in \"Memory Games,\" a documentary following the 2017 World Memory Championships. Courtesy of Sierra Tango Productions\n\nWintersoul also credits a childhood growing up in different countries and cultures as a key part of her ability to remember and adapt to new things. Born in Mongolia, Wintersoul moved to Stockholm with her family at the age of five and would later move again to Kenya, where she attended high school. As a young child, Swedish was a mystery to her.\n\n\u201cI already knew as much English as a five year old could know, so at first I thought everybody spoke this funny version of English,\u201d she said about her first introduction to Scandinavia. \u201cThe immigrant experience does help because you are kind of flung into the environment where you just learn so much so fast just to survive.\u201d\n\nYanjaa Wintersoul Sundae Cruz\n\nWhen Wintersoul began making a name for herself in the world of memory competitions, reality shows like Sweden\u2019s Got Talent also began calling. But the viral segment she is perhaps most famous for is a 2017 promotional video she made for IKEA, in which she memorized the furniture giant\u2019s entire catalog in a week. \u201cThey originally said , \u2018We have this idea. Can you remember some IKEA products? I said, \u2018I think would be more fun if I just memorized the entire catalogue,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, can you do that though?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe did, committing 328 pages of about 5000 products to memory. While Wintersoul cannot remember every single item in the catalogue a year later, she noted that she does remember a good deal of it, particularly the pages featuring families and children.\n\n\u201cThe emotions stick with me. And I think that\u2019s the key to everybody\u2019s memory, you have to make things emotionally important,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember half of the things I learn in high school but I do remember that I had a crush on a boy named David. Because that was more emotionally interesting to me.\u201d\n\nMaking things emotionally compelling is a key part of creating a lasting memory \u2014 and something Wintersoul believes more schools and educators should be focusing on as they develop curriculum for children and high schoolers.\n\n\u201cThe human brain is the opposite of a computer. If you fill up your phone with 16 gigs of pictures, that means you are running out of storage capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with the human brain the more pictures you take and the more you try to remember, the more you will remember.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Imelda Marcos posts bail for graft conviction in Philippines", "description": "Marcos, 89, on Friday posted a $7,400 bail for provisional liberty after she was found guilty of graft and ordered imprisoned.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/imelda-marcos-posts-bail-graft-conviction-philippines-n937086", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648801/181116-imelda-marcos-al-0730_21065ec7bbf5ac8e17f70d1e42662ef3.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:44:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

She was ordered to serve 6 to 11 years in prison for each of the seven counts of violating an anti-corruption law.\n\nThe court accepted the bond while it decides on her motion to remain free while she appeals the conviction.\n\nMarcos appeared before the anti-graft Sandiganbayan court in Manila, accompanied by her children and grandsons. She said she failed to attend the reading of her verdict because she wasn\u2019t aware of it and also mentioned her frail health.\n\nThe presiding judge, Rafael Lagos, noted she was able to attend a birthday party of her daughter. Marcos responded by saying that she received a call from daughter Imee who was \u201ccrying ... (that) all the guests are already there.\u201d\n\nAnti-Marcos activists and human rights victims have welcomed the conviction as long overdue, although there are doubts she\u2019ll be forced to serve prison time given her age and social status.\n\nThe court disqualified Marcos from holding public office, but she can remain a member of the powerful House of Representatives while appealing the decision. Her congressional term will end next year but she has registered to run to replace her daughter as governor of northern Ilocos Norte province.\n\nThe cases against her were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors. She was once convicted of a graft case in 1993, but the Supreme Court later cleared her of any wrongdoing.\n\nFerdinand Marcos was ousted by an army-backed \u201cpeople power\u201d revolt in 1986.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Associated Press\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Stacey Abrams' campaign and legal team is preparing an unprecedented legal challenge in the unresolved Georgia governor's race that could leave the state's Supreme Court deciding whether to force another round of voting.\n\nThe Democrat's longshot strategy relies on a statute that's never been used in such a high-stakes contest. It is being discussed as Georgia elections officials appear to be on the cusp of certifying Republican Brian Kemp as the winner of a bitterly fought campaign that's been marred by charges of electoral malfeasance.\n\nTop Abrams advisers outlined her prospective case to The Associated Press, stressing that the Democratic candidate hasn't finalized a decision about whether to proceed once state officials certify Kemp as the victor. That could happen as early as Friday evening.\n\nWANT BREAKING ALERTS FROM NBC NEWS? SIGN UP HERE\n\nAllegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams' campaign chairwoman, is overseeing a team of almost three-dozen lawyers who in the coming days will draft the petition, along with a ream of affidavits from voters and would-be voters who say they were disenfranchised. Abrams would then decide whether to go to court under a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \"misconduct, fraud or irregularities ... sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\"\n\nThe legal team is \"considering all options,\" Lawrence-Hardy said, including federal court remedies. But the state challenge is the most drastic. And some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statutes that set a high bar for the court to intervene.\n\nShe already faces a narrow path to the governor's mansion. Unofficial returns show Kemp with about 50.2 percent of more than 3.9 million votes. That puts him about 18,000 votes above the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a Dec. 4 runoff. The Associated Press is not calling the race until state officials certify the results.\n\nAbrams would assert that enough irregularities occurred to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 Georgians either had their ballots thrown out or were not allowed to vote.\n\nLawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams will weigh legal considerations alongside her belief that many of her backers \u2014 particularly minority and poorer voters who don't regularly go to the polls \u2014 heeded her call to participate and ran into barriers.\n\n\"These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,\" said Lawrence-Hardy, who was among the army of lawyers who worked on the Bush v. Gore presidential election dispute in 2000. \"It's just a much bigger responsibility. I feel like our mandate has blossomed. ... Maybe this is our moment.\"\n\nKemp, who served as the state's chief elections officer until two days after the election when he resigned as secretary of state and declared victory, has maintained that any uncounted ballots won't change the outcome. His campaign has called Abrams' legal maneuvers so far a \"disgrace to democracy\" and an attempt to \"count illegal votes.\"\n\nThe circumstances leave Abrams, a 44-year-old rising Democratic star, with a tough decision. The former state lawmaker became a national political celebrity with her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor. Her strategy of running as an unapologetic liberal who attracts new voters to the polls resonated in a rapidly changing state. Yet Abrams also must consider her own political future and the consequences of a protracted legal fight she might not win.\n\nAll of that is playing out against the backdrop of Kemp's unabashed embrace of President Donald Trump's nationalism.\n\nSince Election Day, Abrams campaign workers have transitioned from get-out-the-vote efforts to helping voters determine whether their ballots were counted and documenting reported problems. The idea is to assemble a body of evidence to support the claim that the problems could account for Kemp's 18,000-vote margin above the runoff trigger.\n\nAffidavits from poll workers reviewed by the AP describe long lines that discouraged people from voting, poll workers failing to offer provisional ballots to people who didn't show up on the rolls or were at the wrong polling place and election equipment that froze and had to be rebooted.\n\nCathy Cox, a Democrat who served as secretary of state from 1999 through 2007 and is now the dean of Mercer University's law school, said Georgia law puts a heavy burden on candidates such as Abrams who ask a court to intervene.\n\n\"I would say with pretty great confidence there has probably never been an election ... without some irregularity, where some poll worker did not make some mistake,\" Cox said in an interview. The key, she said, is proving someone erred to the point that it could change the outcome.\n\nBrian Kemp, Georgia's Republican nominee for governor, on election night in Athens. Kevin C. Cox / Getty Images\n\nLawrence-Hardy agreed the law requires a quantitative analysis. She said Abrams' team doesn't have a list of 18,000 disenfranchised voters. The evidence, she said, would consist of hundreds, if not thousands of such examples, along with data analysis of projected lost votes based on other problems, such as a lack of paper ballots at precincts where voting machines broke down and voters left long lines.\n\nCox said courts must attempt to apply a nonpartisan standard of \"doubt\" to the election. \"Would a reasonable person have a reason to doubt this election? Not would a hard-core partisan Democrat doubt a partisan Republican opponent,\" she said.\n\nAbrams and voting rights activists have argued for months that Kemp mismanaged the elections system as secretary of state, with Abrams often calling Kemp \"an architect of suppression.\"\n\nUnder Georgia law, Abrams could file a challenge against Kemp or his successor as the secretary of state. The challenge must be filed within five days of certification in a trial court of the county where the chosen defendant resides. The defendant has between five and 10 days to respond, and the presiding judge sets a hearing within 20 days after that deadline, a calendar that could push a dispute well beyond what would have been a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nIf the judge determines the election is so defective that it casts doubt on the results, the judge can declare the election invalid and call a new vote among the same candidates. Cox called that \"the real extreme remedy.\"\n\nA more \"surgical\" course, she said, would be to affirm irregularities but only order that certified results be reopened and recertified once those problems are remedied. The judge could then declare a winner or order a runoff if the results are close enough.\n\nThe judge could also declare a winner after hearing the evidence, but Cox said that's unlikely because the case will probably hinge on uncounted votes and there's no way to know before a count which candidate won those votes.\n\nOnce the judge rules, the loser has 10 days to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "David Hockney painting sets record for work by a living artist", "description": "Hockney\u2019s 1972 piece \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\u201d easily broke the previous record when it sold for $90.3 million at auction in New York.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/david-hockney-painting-portrait-of-an-artist-sells-for-90-3-million-1372367427661", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/AFP_1AV8LM.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:58:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "David Hockney painting Portrait of an Artist sells for $90.3 million copied!\n\nHockney\u2019s 1972 piece \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\u201d easily broke the previous record when it sold for $90.3 million at auction in New York.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Julia Ainsley", "title": "Along southern border, numerous Army barricades, no sign of migrant 'invasion'", "description": "Army engineers are building barricades so they can seal the border along southern Arizona.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Julia Ainsley\n\nNOGALES, Ariz. \u2014 Wearing uniforms brandished with badges from deployments in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, 10 American soldiers dangled their legs off a concrete ledge, spitting out sunflower shells and tobacco juice, as they waited the better part of Thursday morning for their forklift to arrive.\n\nWhen it did, the soldiers, all trained as engineers, would begin constructing their 30th barricade, by stacking one shipping container on top of another and coiling concertina wire around its top. Most of the barricades they have made sit idly, waiting for a scenario where the Nogales border is so overrun with immigrants that U.S. Customs and Border Protection orders the Army to seal the border and stop all traffic.\n\nIt's the scenario President Donald Trump warned about when he sent 5,200 troops to the southern border to stop the approaching Honduran migrant caravan.\n\nThe only problem: The migrant caravan isn't headed anywhere near Arizona.\n\nA barricade, made with a shipping container and concertina wire, that's designed to stop migrants attempting to cross the border. Hannah Rappleye / NBC News\n\nAccording to internal DHS reports and officials tracking the caravan, the first wave of approximately 3,500 migrants is expected to arrive in Tijuana in the coming days and attempt to cross into California. Even there, they won't swarm the border crossing, but are instead expected to wait in a bottleneck for days before they can enter San Ysidro, California, to make an asylum claim.\n\nBorder crossings by undocumented immigrants have been on the rise in recent months, but no section of the border has been threatened by anything resembling an invasion. That is because immigrants arriving at designated border crossings, like the ones now ready to be barricaded, typically do so to make an asylum claim.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the soldiers were forced to wait for the forklift because it was being used by their fellow engineers who are just down the road, hanging concertina wire over a 25-foot fence along the border. There they have had to turn the forklift into a makeshift cherry picker by building a basket big enough to hold two soldiers out of two-by-fours fixated atop its two prongs.\n\nCol. Larry Dewey, the commander overseeing the Army's border mission in Arizona, said the engineers are still in the process of renting or contracting the equipment they need, including cherry pickers.\n\n\"Just one is not going to be enough for a border that stretches several miles. We are renting or contracting for several more,\" Dewey said. \"But I think that bodes well for the engineers, how adaptive they are and able to improvise.\"\n\nIn another sign of the rushed deployment, the soldiers had to spend their first few nights at the border in Nogales sleeping inside a warehouse used to store cold food during cargo inspections, but with the freon turned off, until CBP could provide them with sleeping quarters inside their offices at the border crossing.\n\nThe rush to deploy soldiers to the border, 1,500 of whom are in Arizona, has been criticized even by anonymous military officials, who have described it as a political ploy that drew on voters\u2019 fears of illegal immigration ahead of the midterms and resulted in an ill-defined mission without proper planning.\n\nHere in Nogales, commanders are reluctant to criticize the mission, but offer few answers about what doomsday scenario they seem to be preparing for.\n\nLt. Col. Chad Caldwell, battalion commander for the 62nd Engineer Battalion, who oversees the engineers hanging wire and building barricades in Arizona, told NBC News his team's job is solely to carry out the requests of Customs and Border Protection, not to make their own decisions about how to protect the border.\n\n\"Everything we're putting in is at their request,\" Caldwell said. \"There are some temporary measures in case there are some changes in what the caravan plans are. I think there's a large portion of [the caravan] who have not necessarily decided where they are going to go, so we are still here to support as long as we need to.\"\n\nTroops use concertina wire to reinforce the Deconcini Crossing in Nogales, Arizona. Hannah Rappleye / NBC News\n\nThe engineers waiting for their forklift to arrive to build more barricades call this their \"rehearsal.\" By Thursday morning, they had already built 29 barricades by stacking two shipping containers, welding them together, and topping them with more wire.\n\nTwo of the barricades have been moved to block two previously closed cargo lanes, one at the Mariposa border crossing and one at the Deconcini border crossing. The rest sit in what the engineers call their staging area.\n\nThough the 20-foot high structures they build now are sitting in storage, they are ready to act in a moment's notice to seal the border, if U.S. Customs and Border Protection asks them to do so.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited troops deployed to the Texas-Mexico border on Wednesday. Mattis, like Caldwell, reinforced the same message: The troops are here to serve DHS, no matter how long it takes or what they ask.\n\nWith Thanksgiving around the corner, the commanders have gotten used to being asked by media whether their troops will be eating MRE's over the holiday.\n\n\"We are working really hard to make sure everyone gets a Thanksgiving meal on Thanksgiving Day,\" Caldwell said. \"Of course we are all disappointed to not spend Thanksgiving with our families, that's just a natural human reaction.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "North Korean TV announces \u2018ultramodern tactical weapon\u2019 test", "description": "A North Korean anchorman said Kim Jong Un supervised the successful test, but did not go into detail about the type of weapon that has been developed.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/north-korean-tv-says-leader-kim-jong-un-supervised-tactical-weapon-test-1372361795578", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_mo_lon_nktv_181116.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:42:43Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "North Korean TV says leader Kim Jong Un supervised tactical weapon test copied!\n\nA North Korean anchorman said Kim Jong Un supervised the successful test, but did not go into detail about the type of weapon that has been developed.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dareh Gregorian", "title": "Arrests in GoFundMe homeless good Samaritan 'scam' show perils of crowdfunding", "description": "The arrests of a New Jersey couple and homeless veteran Johnny Bobbitt in an alleged GoFundMe scam shows how easily popular crowdfunding sites can be misused", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/arrests-gofundme-homeless-good-samaritan-scam-show-perils-crowdfunding-n936941", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648231/181115-scott-coffina-ew-605p_d5415f4cbd2de1e0ff3506b03c5831a2.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:35:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Dareh Gregorian\n\nThey've been used to help cancer victims, people in danger of losing their homes, businesses trying to stay afloat and communities trying to rebuild. And now internet crowdfunding sites are increasingly being used by scam artists trying to con well-meaning people out of their hard-earned money.\n\nCharges Thursday against a New Jersey couple and a homeless man whose ostensibly heartwarming encounter led to a $400,000 haul on GoFundMe show how hard it can be to differentiate real people in need from those motivated by greed.\n\nThe case against the trio \"is crazy,\" said Adrienne Gonzalez, founder of the watchdog website GoFraudMe, and it highlights the risks of giving to crowdfunding sites.\n\nStephanie Kalivas, an analyst for Charity Watch in Chicago, called the case, \"a perfect example of the inherent risks and weaknesses of giving over a crowdfunding site.\"\n\nThe couple, Mark D'Amico, 39, and Kate McClure, 28, melted hearts across the country when they described an encounter McClure had with a homeless Marine veteran named Johnny Bobbitt, Jr. 35.\n\nMcClure said she had run out of gas near the interstate in Philadelphia, and that Bobbitt trudged to a service station and spent his last $20 so she could make her way home. The couple launched a GoFundMe campaign last November entitled \"Paying It Forward,\" looking to raise $10,000 to rent Bobbitt an apartment and a car.\n\nTheir plea went viral, and within a month, more than14,000 people had donated a total of $402,706 to the cause.\n\nBut the \"entire campaign was predicated on a lie,\" Burlington County prosecutor Scott Coffina said Thursday.\n\nBurlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina speaks during a news conference in Mt. Holly, New Jersey on Nov. 15, 2018. Seth Wenig / AP\n\nThe scheme fell apart after Bobbitt, and his lawyers, complained publicly that the couple was hoarding the money, and that he'd only received $75,000 from the fundraising haul. Lawyers for the couple said they were withholding money because they were concerned Bobbitt would spend it on drugs.\n\nIn reality, prosecutors say, the money was gone because D'Amico and McClure had spent and gambled the cash away within months. Investigators then discovered their tale of Bobbitt's heroism was a fantasy \u2014 designed to garner 15 minutes of fame and tug on the public's sympathies.\n\nThe trio came close to getting away with it, too \u2014 police only started investigating after Bobbitt complained about not getting his cut, Coffina noted.\n\nA spokesman for GoFundMe, Bobby Withorne, said in a statement that, \"While this type of behavior by an individual is extremely rare, it's unacceptable and clearly it has consequences. Committing fraud, whether it takes place on or offline is against the law.\"\n\nHe said the company is completely repaying all of the donors to the \"Paying It Forward\" campaign.\n\nThe company estimates that campaigns with \"misuse\" of its platform \"make up less than one tenth of one percent of all campaigns.\"\n\nBut charity watchdogs are skeptical of that figure, and said the New Jersey case shows how easy it is to game the system. D'Amico and McClure posted numerous phony updates on their petition in a bid to increase donations, court papers say.\n\n\"There's no accountability on the back-end,\" Kalivas said. \"[Fundraisers] don't have any responsibility to report back and give proof they spent the money the way they said they were going to use it.\"\n\nAnd many donors practice \"drive-by activism,\" said GoFraudMe's Gonzalez. \"We give five dollars, move on and forget about it.\"\n\nIn the Bobbitt case, donors could have used more reflection.\n\n\"Let's say everything had worked out the way it seemed in this case. The people who started this fund aren't drug counselors, and you can\u2019t just throw money\" at someone with a drug problem, she said. \"People need to think when they're giving.\"\n\nKalivas agreed, noting \"there are plenty of legitimate charities to help homeless people and homeless veterans.\"\n\nGoFundMe does offer protections for duped donors \u2014 they can be repaid for donations of up to $1,000 if a campaign is found to be fraudulent \u2014 and has helped raise billions of dollars for people in need since its launch in 2010.\n\nWhile the company has become more proactive looking for fraud \u2014 it shut down several suspicious campaigns that popped up soon after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, earlier this year \u2014 it still mainly relies on users to point out suspicious activity.\n\n\"A lot of it boils down to, 'If you see something, say something,'\" Gonzalez said, echoing the slogan of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAnd while the platform will work with law-enforcement probing fraudulent campaigns, the most the company will do on its own is shutter a campaign, Gonzalez said.\n\n\"They're not contacting police and initiating investigations. That's up to the users to do,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, law-enforcement has gotten more aggressive in prosecuting crowdfunding cons.\n\n\"When I started doing this in 2016, there were very few prosecutions,\" Gonzalez said. Some police departments seemed to initially think of such cases as complicated computer crimes, but have come to realize \"that fraud is fraud and you don't need new laws,\" she said.\n\nKalivas recommended people give causes via a registered 501(c)3 charity because of the greater transparency, and said people should try only giving to a crowdfunding site if they know the people involved in the particular campaign.\n\nExperts have also recommended researching a campaign's manager or a fund organizer to look for any red flags.\n\nGonzalez said the most prevalent scams she's seen involve people faking illness.\n\n\"All it does is hurt people who need help,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe and Marianna Sotomayor", "title": "Pelosi's critics have the fight but do they have the votes to defeat her?", "description": "Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is working to win the support of her members while her opponents are still organizing against her with no clear outcome.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-s-critics-have-fight-do-they-have-votes-defeat-n936921", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648196/181115-nancy-pelosi-ew-543p_33fd2df24b82578819f8666a3bea7df1.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:00:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Leigh Ann Caldwell, Alex Moe and Marianna Sotomayor\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As members of Congress flee the capital for Thanksgiving break, a growing schism inside the Democratic Party is complicating Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bid to be the next speaker of the House.\n\nSince Democrats recaptured the House majority last week, the California congresswoman \u2014 who is already the first woman to serve as speaker \u2014 has been working overtime to win the support of her members for an encore while an increasingly vocal number of them are threatening to derail her.\n\nWhile Pelosi is remains the heavy favorite to be her party's choice when House Democrats hold their leadership elections in less than two weeks, the hurdles for her are higher than many expected.\n\nFor most of the week, even those Democrats who lobbied the loudest for new leadership were at a loss when asked who they might back as a challenger. On Wednesday, at least one name emerged when Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, said she was thinking about jumping in the race.\n\nAnd on Friday, Fudge said she would announce whether or not she would run after the Thanksgiving break.\n\nNewly elected members joined those who were re-elected in Washington this week for orientation, a gathering that also included numerous receptions and party meetings. Those events provided Pelosi the opportunity to campaign and make her pitch to members. She has met with the congressional caucus, the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus and with new members, and she\u2019s scheduled to meet with the New Democrat Coalition as well.\n\nBut it\u2019s also given opponents time to organize against her. Those critics insist that they have the support of more than two dozen members who will not support her, a number they say is enough to put her bid to be speaker in jeopardy.\n\nPelosi is trying to please a wide array of members, a difficult task considering the caucus just expanded to include members from solidly Republican districts as well as very liberal districts.\n\nMaking her position appear more perilous, many members \u2014 far more than are likely to oppose her \u2014 are withholding their public support and using this intense campaign period to extract concessions from leadership.\n\nAfter their meeting with Pelosi on Thursday, Congressional Progressive Caucus leaders Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said they would discuss Pelosi's bid with the members of the caucus.\n\n\"We are pleased that Leader Pelosi shares our commitment to ensuring that CPC members are represented proportionally on the key exclusive committees \u2014 including Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, Appropriations, Financial Services and Intelligence,\" they wrote. \"With the talent of the incoming class of new members, we agreed that there should be opportunities not only for seasoned CPC members, but also for our brand new CPC members, many of whom bring particular issue-area expertise.\"\n\nThe Problem Solvers Caucus wants new rules to give committees more power and to make it easier for bipartisan amendments to receive a vote. And the New Dems want the next leader to focus on supporting members from purple and red districts.\n\n\u201cWe believe that in order to build a sustainable majority, we need leadership that is focused on fostering a caucus and policy agenda that works for those who won seats to get us in the majority,\u201d said New Democrat Coalition Chair Jim Himes, D-Conn.\n\nThere is also a group of members, including Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who are demanding that climate change be a top priority for the new Congress.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, after participating in a climate change protest in Pelosi\u2019s office, said that she has spoken with Pelosi about the issue. While she said she has not decided on how she\u2019ll vote for speaker, she said she is encouraged by her discussions with Pelosi.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been very receptive on this climate issue, and I\u2019m very impressed in how she\u2019s authentically responding to this issue,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a superficial conversation at all. This is really getting to the meat of our discussions as a party, and I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d\n\nAnd others just say they want change, including Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., who says she will vote against Pelosi and is looking forward to more candidates jumping in the race.\n\n\u201cIt's nothing personal on any of the leaders that we have,\" Rice told reporters. \"They've been great, but they've been there for 16 years and it's time for a new generation of leaders to take over.\u201d\n\nStill, Pelosi is exuding confidence. \u201cI have overwhelming support in my caucus to be speaker of the house,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cI happen to think at this point I'm the best person for that.\u201d\n\nPelosi has her supporters. Eleven labor unions, including the AFL-CIO and the United Steelworkers, have announced their support of her. And her office released a letter by two new members who argue that Pelosi is the best choice.\n\n\u201cDuring this turbulent time in our nation\u2019s history, no one is better prepared to lead a diverse Democratic caucus,\u201d Katie Hill and Mike Levin, both of California, wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s unite. Let\u2019s move forward. Let\u2019s make change happen, together.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have two opportunities to vote for speaker. On Nov. 28, they will gather behind closed doors where individual votes remain secret unless members say publicly how they voted. Any candidate for speaker must get a majority.\n\nThere was an effort this week among some of the anti-Pelosi forces to win a rules change so that a speaker candidate would have to get the support of 218 Democrats, making it harder for Pelosi \u2014 or any candidate \u2014 to win the support of the caucus. The idea came up briefly but went nowhere.\n\nBut on the floor, the threshold is 218, or a majority of people who vote for a candidate. That\u2019s where the Pelosi opponents think she\u2019ll have a real problem because Democrats will have no fewer than 233 seats, leaving little margin for Pelosi to have many detractors.\n\nMembers can vote \"present,\" however, as a way to fulfill some members\u2019 campaign promise to not support Pelosi, and it also reduces the majority threshold.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 16, 2018, 12:35 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the party affiliation of Rep.

KCNA VIA KNS / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe announcement suggests that North Korea still wants to maintain the mood for dialogue with the United States despite stalled nuclear diplomacy. In the past, North Korean often held American citizens it arrested for similar charges for an extended period before high-profile U.S. figures travelled to Pyongyang to secure their freedom.\n\nOn Friday, the Korean Central News Agency said the U.S. citizen was detained on Oct. 16 for illegally entering the country from China. It said the U.S. citizen told investigators that he was under the direction of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIt said North Korea decided to deport him but did not say why and when. North Korea didn't immediately release the English spelling of the man's name.\n\nIn May, North Korea released three American detainees in a goodwill gesture weeks before leader Kim Jong Un's summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore in June. The three Americans returned home on a flight with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nTheir release was a striking contrast to the fate of Otto Warmbier, an American university student who died last year days after he was released from North Korea in a coma after 17 months in captivity. Warmbier and other previous American detainees in the North were imprisoned there over a variety of alleged crimes, including subversion, anti-state activities and spying.\n\nWarmbier was a rare Western detainee who was released in rough shape \u2014 the vast majority of Americans detained by the North came out in relatively good condition. The North has denied accusations that it tortured Warmbier, saying it provided medical care \"with all sincerity\" as his health worsened and was surprised by Warmbier's death. He had been accused of stealing a propaganda poster.\n\nThe United States, South Korea and others have accused North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions. Some foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt had been coerced while in North Korean custody.\n\nAfter a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests last year that fueled fears of war, North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea early this year with a vague commitment to nuclear disarmament. But nuclear diplomacy has reported no major breakthrough since the Kim-Trump summit, the first such meeting between North Korea and the United States."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Last Khmer Rouge leaders found guilty of genocide, get life terms", "description": "Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were sentenced to life in prison, the same punishment they are already serving after earlier convictions at a previous trial.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/last-khmer-rouge-leaders-found-guilty-genocide-get-life-terms-n937071", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648691/181116-khmer-rouge-0440_7dec0b39f61011fa5aa480e48b09ff5d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:13:54Z", "content": "The Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Heidi Przybyla\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos began receiving around-the-clock security from the U.S. Marshals Service days after being confirmed, an armed detail provided to no other cabinet member that could cost U.S. taxpayers $19.8 million through September of 2019, according to new figures provided by the Marshals Service to NBC News.\n\nWhile it remains unclear who specifically made the request, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions granted the protection on February 13, 2017, a few days after DeVos was heckled and blocked by a handful of protesters from entering the Jefferson Academy, a public middle school in Washington. DeVos was confirmed as education secretary on February 7 of that year.\n\n\"The order was issued after the Department of Education contacted administration officials regarding threats received by the Secretary of Education,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. \"The U.S.M.S. was identified to assist in this area based on its expertise and long experience providing executive protection.\"\n\nThe cost of security provided to DeVos was $5.3 million in fiscal year 2017 and $6.8 million for fiscal year 2018, according to the Marshals Service \u2014 an amount that is ultimately reimbursed by the Education Department. The estimated cost for fiscal year 2019 is $7.74 million.\n\nThat far exceeds the $3.5 million spent on security for former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned in July amid questions about lavish spending habits during his 17-month tenure at the agency. An EPA inspector general report, released Sept. 4, found the price tag for Pruitt\u2019s security detail was \"not justified\" and far exceeded the security costs incurred under past EPA heads.\n\nTypically, cabinet secretaries are protected by security arranged by their departments\u2019 internal enforcement units.\n\nDeVos\u2019s two immediate predecessors at the Education Department, Arne Duncan and John King Jr., each followed that model. Duncan and King, who served under President Barack Obama, were staffed by security agents who would escort them door to door.\n\nAfter receiving the Marshals' protection, DeVos spent less than 4 percent of her time visiting traditional public schools in the school year that began in September 2017, according to a tabulation by NBC News and the Watchdog group American Oversight, which was founded by lawyers, including several from the Obama administration, who focus on government ethics and conflicts of interest.\n\nNo other current cabinet official has been granted protection by the Marshals, the agency confirmed. In the past, only the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy received a detail from the agency.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service operates within the Justice Department and is tasked with duties that include \"protecting the federal judiciary, apprehending federal fugitives, managing and selling seized assets acquired by criminals through illegal activities, housing and transporting federal prisoners and operating the Witness Security Program,\" according to the agency's website.\n\nU.S. Marshals spokeswoman Nikki Credic-Barrett declined to comment on the nature of the threats against DeVos and whether they differ from those faced by other cabinet members. A former spokeswoman for Duncan said he had received death threats on the job but never received Marshals protection.\n\nEducation Department spokeswoman Liz Hill said DeVos had not personally requested the protection.\n\n\"We\u2019re obviously not at liberty to discuss the nature of the threats,\" Hill said. \"But it should be obvious that they are significant. Otherwise, the trained professionals who made the call to escalate her detail wouldn\u2019t have done so.\"\n\nAnthony Chapa, a retired assistant director of the Secret Service, told NBC News that government officials are at times temporarily granted enhanced security for a particular event or overseas trip. If a public official is facing a specific threat, Chapa said, he or she might receive more extensive security that is later downgraded once the threat has been mitigated.\n\n\"I personally don\u2019t know what the threats (against DeVos) may be,\" Chapa said, \"but somebody probably made that determination and felt, because of that particular level of threat, she has increased vulnerability.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"if someone made a decision outside of that scope, then that evaluation is worthy of review.\"\n\nDeVos, a charter school advocate whose brother, Erik Prince, founded the security company Blackwater USA, was among Trump\u2019s most controversial cabinet picks because of her lack of familiarity with public schools and her history as a GOP donor who\u2019d advocated widespread firing of public school teachers.\n\nVice President Mike Pence had to cast a tie-breaking vote to confirm DeVos in 2017 after Republicans Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine joined every Democrat in voting against her nomination.\n\nThe costly security arrangement for DeVos is the latest example of Trump cabinet members and other officials using far more taxpayer money than officials in past administrations did (although the Education Department contends that DeVos saves the government money by using her private jet for some travel).\n\nIn addition to Pruitt, they include Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, whose use of military jets for routine travel in the spring and fall of 2017 was estimated by a watchdog group to cost at least a $1 million; Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who spent $139,000 on three sets of double doors for his office and $53,000 on three helicopter trips; and Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who drew notice for his purchase of a $31,000 mahogany dining set as part of an office renovation.\n\nDeVos is among the wealthiest members of Trump\u2019s cabinet, which also includes Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a longtime investor and banker.\n\nDeVos\u2019s husband, Dick DeVos, is the son of the recently deceased Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, whose net worth Forbes estimated at $5.4 billion in March 2018. As one of Richard DeVos\u2019s four children, Dick DeVos is entitled to a quarter of his father\u2019s estate, according to Forbes. In her financial disclosures, DeVos listed assets of $580 million.\n\nWhile spending heavily on DeVos\u2019s personal security, the Trump administration has targeted the Education Department for deep budget cuts. Recently, the administration announced a blueprint to merge it with the Labor Department as a way to further slash costs.\n\nThe $12.1 million that U.S. taxpayers have already paid for the extra security DeVos receives would have paid for 1,968 Pell Grants for low-income college students for the upcoming school year or 268 new elementary teachers in Kansas, based on an NBC review of salary averages in the state.\n\nA Justice Department official told NBC that the government typically deploys Marshals Service protection when there is a threat that is \"specific\" and \"potentially temporary.\"\n\nYet the arrangement for DeVos has now lasted some 19 months, and the Education Department no longer employs the security officers used by previous agency heads, according to Hill, the department spokeswoman.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear who specifically ordered the Marshals protection for DeVos. Hill said DeVos did not demand it herself. A DOJ spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Sessions had any involvement beyond providing an official signature. The Marshals are under the attorney general\u2019s statutory authority."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Hockney painting breaks record for most expensive work by living artist", "description": "The previous record for a work by a living artist was held by Jeff Koons' sculpture \"Balloon Dog,\" which sold for $58.4 million in 2013.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/david-hockney-painting-sells-record-breaking-90-3-million-n937056", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648686/181116-hockney-0421_99f2bcff2b10c94cb46a656367f298a6.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:55:06Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

North Korea is saying 'If you don't listen to us, you will face political burdens,'\" said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems.\n\nYang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \"tactical weapon\" in North Korea refers to \"a weapon aimed at striking South Korea including U.S. military bases\" there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nThe only picture released by state media showed Kim standing on a beach surrounded by officials in military uniforms, but no weapons were visible.\n\nInternational weapons experts said the officials around Kim included a leader of the artillery corps of the Korean People's Army.\n\nKim this year declared his nuclear force \"complete\" and said he would focus on economic development.\n\nNorth Korea has continued to showcase its conventional military capabilities, including at a large military parade in Pyongyang, its capital, on September 9.\n\nBut any testing of new weapons threatens to raise tension with Washington, which has said there will be no easing in international sanctions until North Korea takes more concrete steps to abandon its nuclear weapons or long-range missiles.\n\nEven if the test was a message for Washington and Seoul, Friday's report from the North was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn't focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility.\n\nThe test may also have been a response to recent joint military drills by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang said violated recent pacts to halt to \"all hostile acts,\" said Yang Uk, an analyst at the Korea Defence and Security Forum.\n\nKim said the weapons system tested was one in which his father, Kim Jong Il, had taken a special interest during his lifetime, personally leading its development.\n\nKim's last publicized military inspection was the launch of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on November 29 last year, though he engaged in at least eight other military related activities this year, the South's Unification Ministry said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Saphora Smith", "title": "#ThisIsNotConsent protesters wave underwear after Ireland rape trial sparks fury", "description": "The protests organized under the hashtags #ThisIsNotConsent and #EndVictimBlaming were launched after a man was acquitted of rape in Ireland.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/thisisnotconsent-protesters-wave-underwear-after-ireland-rape-trial-sparks-fury-n936501", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2647086/181115-ireland-protest-mc-1016_2700168d9b8107fa5d1c7f0c7cecdfb2.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:23:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Ken Dilanian and Dennis Romero\n\nA court document filed by mistake has revealed that the Justice Department has filed undisclosed criminal charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nIn a slip unearthed by a former U.S. intelligence official and posted on Twitter, Assange\u2019s name appears twice in an August court filing by a federal prosecutor in Virginia \u2014 an argument to keep sealed an unrelated case involving an accused child sex criminal.\n\nThe prosecutor wrote that the charges and arrest warrant \u201cwould need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\u201d\n\nAt another point in the document, the prosecutor wrote that \u201cdue to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\u201d\n\nIt's not clear what allegations could be connected to the filing, which was a motion to seal a complaint and supporting documents in the unrelated case.\n\nHowever, special counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year cited WikiLeaks participation in Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence agencies have said that WikiLeaks disclosed thousands of emails stolen in a covert Russian intelligence operation to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, noticed that Assange's name was in the filing, and he tweeted about it. Hughes is also a former official at the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nOn Thursday night, WikiLeaks' Twitter account further publicized the filing.\n\nJoshua Stueve, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement that that court filing \"was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.\"\n\nThe filing was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nWikiLeaks and Assange loom large in the investigation of Russian influence on the election.\n\nThe website released unflattering Hillary Clinton campaign emails beginning Oct. 7, 2016, just weeks before the presidential election.\n\nMueller, who's directing a federal inquiry into election meddling, in July charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack Democratic National Committee computers in an effort to disrupt the 2016 election. The indictment referred to WikiLeaks as \u201cOrganization 1,\u201d and described its role in receiving and disseminating the emails, without addressing whether Assange knew the material came from the Russians.\n\nBarry Pollack, a U.S. lawyer representing Assange, criticized the move to charge the WikiLeaks founder.\n\n\u201cThe news that criminal charges have apparently been filed against Mr. Assange is even more troubling than the haphazard manner in which that information has been revealed,\u201d Pollack said in a statement. \u201cThe government bringing criminal charges against someone for publishing truthful information is a dangerous path for a democracy to take.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Friday the director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, Ben Wizner, seemed to agree.\n\n\"Any prosecution of Mr. Assange for Wikileaks\u2019 publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional, and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations,\" he said. \"Moreover, prosecuting a foreign publisher for violating U.S. secrecy laws would set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\"\n\nMueller has been investigating whether anyone close to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, including his longtime associate Roger Stone, acted as a conduit of stolen emails between WikiLeaks and the campaign.\n\nWikiLeaks communicated through Twitter with the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAssange came to prominence after WikiLeaks published secret military and diplomatic documents leaked in 2010 by Pvt. Chelsea Manning.\n\nManning served 7 years in prison, but WikiLeaks was not prosecuted. Justice Department lawyers concluded at the time that they could not charge Assange and WikiLeaks even as American newspapers, protected by the First Amendment, were publishing the leaked material.\n\nBut in recent years, U.S. officials have sought to distinguish WikiLeaks from journalists, as when then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo referred to it as a \"hostile non-state intelligence organization.\" American officials came to view WikiLeaks as working hand in glove with American adversaries, particularly Russia.\n\nIn 2017, WikiLeaks published information about CIA hacking exploits, and last year a former government software engineer was charged with leaking that information. Officials said the disclosures were damaging to U.S. national security, and computer security experts criticized WikiLeaks for providing criminal hackers with new tools.\n\nAssange, an Australian national, has lived at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since being granted asylum in 2012 as he tried to avoid extradition to Sweden. Sweden's top prosecutor later dropped a long-running inquiry into a rape allegation against him, saying there was no way to detain or charge him because of his protected status in the embassy.\n\nIn a recent lawsuit, Assange said that Ecuador is changing the terms of his protection there.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 15, 2018, 2:45 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated where Julian Assange is currently living.

Clark behind bars.\n\nThe clarification came in a pretrial detention memo filed after an NBC News analysis published Wednesday revealed that Clark posed that statement Oct. 26 \u2014 a day before the synagogue attack in Pittsburgh. The post rather was likely referring to the pipe bombs that were mailed to various high-profile critics of the Trump administration, the FBI filing indicated.\n\nClark, 30, was charged on Nov. 9 with transportation of a firearm across state lines and possession of illegal, high capacity magazines intended for use with AR-15 weapons after a search of his residence in Washington, D.C., turned up the items, according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nThe suspect lives with his father and sister, and the bureau described him as a neo-Nazi who praised Bowers as a \"hero.\" Bowers has pleaded not guilty to federal hate crime charges. The FBI said Clark posted on conservative social media site Gab that the synagogue victims \"deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse.\" His Gab account has since been deleted.\n\nBut the Thursday court filing by the U.S. Attorney's Office appeared to acknowledge that the \"dry run\" remark was a response to the Oct. 26 arrest of Cesar Sayoc, who is alleged to have mailed pipe bombs to several critics of President Donald Trump. In fact, the filing states that the remark was posted \"on or about October 26,\" a day before the synagogue tragedy.\n\nStill, the U.S. attorney argued, \"The court should not view this statement as simple hyperbole.\"\n\nProsecutors also said that the FBI's interpretation of an image posted to Clark's account Oct. 26 was \"incorrect.\" The FBI affidavit described it as \"a picture of Robert Bowers, armed with a gun, splattered in what appears to be blood.\"\n\nBut NBC News discovered it's actually a known alt-right meme.\n\nThe FBI said in its original affidavit that that \"dry run\" statement \"implies that Jeffery Clark did know more about the attack in the Tree-of-Life synagogue, and that there was more to come.\"\n\nThe NBC News analysis could not verify that Clark ever posted that Bowers was a hero or that the victims deserved their fate. But it did appear, in fact, that he and Bowers followed each other on Gab \u2014 without any known interaction.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington had no comment.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Phil McCausland\n\nOfficials from the Department of Veterans Affairs testified Thursday before a House committee that they still don't know when their information technology system will be updated to address issues preventing tens of thousand of veterans from receiving their GI Bill benefit payments on time, if at all.\n\nNBC News previously reported that technical glitches and other computer problems at VA have caused GI Bill benefit payments covering education and housing to be delayed for months or never be delivered, forcing some veterans to face debt or even the potential of homelessness.\n\nDr. Paul Lawrence, who is in charge of the Veteran Benefits Administration, testified in a fairly heated veterans affairs committee hearing Thursday evening, along with Gen. Robert Worley, director of education service, and two officials from the VA's Office of Information & Technology.\n\nFew conclusions came from some of the testy exchanges.\n\nA soldier salutes during ceremonies on Veteran's Day at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, on Nov. 11, 2018. Joshua Roberts / Reuters\n\nMembers of the committee attempted to push for a specific date when the federal agency would be able to send the correct benefit payments after the VBA blew past previous estimates, but the congressmen received few fulfilling answers.\n\n\u201cThat was a mistake to give you a day,\u201d Lawrence said, referring to previous congressional hearings where VBA had provided an estimate. \u201cWe did not understand the certainty around it. That is why we are not giving you a date.\u201d\n\nLawrence said on Thursday that the VBA was essentially caught off-guard by the IT issues, stating in his prepared remarks that 22 of the 34 sections in the Forever GI Bill signed by President Donald Trump last year required IT solutions. Two sections caused more trouble than others, he said, as they complicated how the VA calculates the GI Bill's housing allowance.\n\nCongressmen from both sides of the aisle expressed their frustration with the VBA at the hearing. They were particularly upset that none of the witnesses appeared to take full responsibility for the delay and that the VBA hadn\u2019t alerted them to the seriousness of the issue.\n\n\u201cWe feel powerless up here because we\u2019ve given you money, we\u2019ve given you the authority, we\u2019ve asked repeatedly for anything else \u2014 if there are barriers we\u2019re unaware of to remove,\u201d said Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Tex.\n\n\u201cIt feels like an exercise in futility,\u201d the congressman added.\n\nRanking Member Beto O\u2019Rourke, D-Tex., pressed the VA officials to provide a date and asked what the committee could help do to mitigate issues in the future.\n\n\"I think I speak for everyone in saying that we're all frustrated and want to see something happen,\" said O\u2019Rourke, who will depart Congress in a few weeks. \"You failed to account for the problem and minimized the problem.\"\n\nGen. Worley, who will depart his current position to head the VBA's regional office in Houston, shared that 1,000 veterans had gone more than 60 days without their checks, 10,000 had been waiting between 30 and 60 days and about 73,000 total were still delayed. He could not provide the number of veterans who had gone more than 90 days.\n\nBut officials with the VA insisted that despite not knowing when portions of the law would be addressed because of the ongoing IT issues, the VA had returned to a normal workload, and they did not expect payments to be delayed in the spring \u2014 though veterans may receive the wrong amount of money.\n\nIf veterans are paid more than they are owed, the VA would not attempt to recoup that money, Lawrence said. Though committee members appeared to approve of that decision, many questioned how much the overtime costs, additional contract workers and lost dollars due to incorrect payments would cost taxpayers.\n\n\"That was my concern,\" Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., the chairman of the veterans affairs committee, told NBC News after the hearing. \"Are we going to go down another rabbit hole with a bunch of money and find out next June that it's a whole debacle? I would not be shocked if that's true.\"\n\nLawrence appeared particularly upset over media reports that veterans couldn't pay their bills or faced homelessness. He said some stories misrepresented the facts, citing a Washington Post story published Thursday as an example, though he did not provide any specifics.\n\nRichard Crowe, the senior vice president of software company Booz Allen, also testified Thursday. The VBA contracted out software updates to Booz Allen, but Crowe insisted on Thursday that his company was not at fault.\n\nCrowe blamed the number of system dependencies and the age of the system itself for causing delays in implementing the changes in the Forever GI Bill.\n\n\u201cMany of the underlying IT systems required to implement the changes were past, at, or very near their intended dates for retirement,\u201d Crowe said.\n\nFrustrations with witnesses' answers extended into the room at large, particularly to the representatives from veteran service organizations who attended the hearing. Most work in close coordination with the VA, but they were dismayed by the officials' unwillingness to provide clearer answers, especially after Lawrence said he was confident the VBA would have a solution soon.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re very confident, then give us a month. Maybe not April 1, but how about just April? Or the March/April timeframe?\u201d Patrick Murray, deputy director of Veterans of Foreign Wars, said afterward. \u201cSome of those guys in there, they were so in cover-your-ass mode.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dennis Romero", "title": "California schools close as smoke from Camp Fire fills the skies", "description": "Smoky air from Northern California's Camp Fire has prompted officials to close Bay Area schools on Friday.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-schools-close-smoke-camp-fire-fills-skies-n936961", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648281/181115-san-francisco-fog-ew-632p_08e502682875842ea0038d98cb654239.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:43:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.
