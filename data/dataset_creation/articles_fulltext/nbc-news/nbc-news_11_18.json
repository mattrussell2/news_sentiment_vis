The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Allan Smith\n\nGeorgia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams refused to call Brian Kemp, the GOP governor-elect, the \"legitimate\" winner of their race during two Sunday interviews, though she did say Kemp was the \"legal\" victor of the governorship.\n\nSpeaking with MSNBC's Joy Reid on \"AM Joy,\" Abrams criticized Kemp's actions as secretary of state in the lead up to the election when asked by Reid whether she considered the result to be legitimate.\n\n\"I think that it's legal,\" Abrams said of Kemp's win. \"I think it's wrong. I think that what happened is that we have watched systematic erosion of our democracy and over the course of time that was overseen directly by my opponent in the race who also happened to be responsible for the administration of fair elections, and he didn't do so.\"\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams speaks to supporters in Atlanta on Nov. 6, 2018. Tami Chappell / EPA file\n\nDuring an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" Abrams said Kemp was \"the person who won an adequate number of votes to become the governor\" when the CNN anchor asked her a similar question.\n\n\"You're not using the word legitimate,\" Tapper said. \"Is he the legitimate governor-elect of Georgia?\"\n\n\"He is the legal governor of Georgia,\" Abrams said. \"And here's the thing, Jake. I want to be very clear. Words have meaning. And I have spent my lifetime not only as an attorney, but as a writer. And I'm very careful with the words I choose. And, yes, when he takes the oath of office, he will be the legal governor of the state of Georgia. He is the legal victor.\"\n\n\"But what you are looking for me to say is that there was no compromise of our democracy, and that there should be some political compromise in the language I use,\" she continued. \"And that's not right. What's not right is saying that something was done properly, when it was not. I will never deny ... the legal imprimatur that says that he is in this position. And I pray for his success. But will I say that this election was not tainted, was not a disinvestment and a disenfranchisement of thousands of voters? I will not say that.\u201d\n\nAbrams ended her candidacy on Friday, 10 days after Election Day. She refused to concede the race, however, and rebuked what she called a \"rotten and rigged\" election process. She alleged Kemp engaged in the \"systemic disenfranchisement\" of voters.\n\n\"So let's be clear, this is not a speech of concession because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper,\" she said in her Friday speech. \"As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that.\"\n\nThe final vote tally showed that Kemp won more than 50 percent of the vote, enough to avoid a runoff election against Abrams. Kemp resigned as secretary of state, a position that allowed him to oversee the election he was running in, following Election Day.\n\nIn October, an Associated Press investigation found that Kemp's office had more than 50,000 voter registration applicants still pending, most of which were from black voters. As a result, Abrams and civil rights groups alleged that Kemp was engaging in discriminatory practices.\n\nKemp denied disenfranchising voters, saying he was just following the law.\n\nFollowing Election Day, Abrams fought to have more ballots counted in hopes that Kemp's lead would narrow to the point that a recount or runoff was triggered, but it did not happen. During that time, the Abrams campaign accused the secretary of state's office of providing inaccurate and false information about the remaining votes."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jonathan Allen", "title": "Republicans had a secret weapon in the Florida recount fight", "description": "Jessica Furst Johnson was the low-profile GOP operative running the Florida recount operation for Senate Republicans", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-had-secret-weapon-florida-recount-fight-n937576", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2648211/181115-florida-recount-se-549p_dd434f3dee9fc3a25a2dd41d44a8a2b9.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:51:51Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Jonathan Allen\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Jessica Furst Johnson was supposed to fly from Washington to Orlando this week for a post-election Walt Disney World vacation with her husband and their two small children.\n\nInstead, Johnson, the 37-year-old general counsel to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, found herself in Tallahassee, quarterbacking the GOP's legal response to the two-recount Senate contest between the Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson, and Gov. Rick Scott, his Republican challenger.\n\nHer opposite number in this fight, Democratic super-lawyer Marc Elias, had more than 50,000 Twitter followers, a resume that includes serving as the general counsel on two presidential campaigns and a ream of profiles in national publications. Meanwhile, Johnson operated in relative obscurity.\n\nThe main stakes for the two lawyers \u2014 and their parties \u2014 were always the same: a U.S. Senate seat and the framework that will govern how Florida election laws are applied and interpreted in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut for Johnson \u2014 a Sarasota native, a University of Florida law school graduate and an admirer of Scott's \u2014 there was another dimension to the fight.\n\n\"This is personal for me,\" she said in a telephone interview with NBC News on Friday.\n\nJessica Furst Johnson led the Scott legal effort. Courtesy of the National Republican Senatorial Committee\n\nNow that Nelson has conceded, Scott can thank Johnson and her army of GOP lawyers for helping preserve his victory by largely turning back the sprawling Democratic legal effort to challenge the actions of election officials and various aspects of Florida statutes.\n\nThough Johnson is one of Washington's foremost experts on election law, she's quick to point out that she's not a litigator.\n\n\"I have mad respect for the people who have done the hand-to-hand combat,\" she said, spreading credit.\n\nInstead, as she downed almond-milk lattes, Johnson managed the battle plan, which Republicans say included more than 100 paid and volunteer lawyers working in courtrooms and at recount centers across the state. Except for a 28-hour roundtrip scramble back to Washington to see her children, Johnson choreographed the response from Scott's campaign headquarters.\n\nFriends say Johnson was the right person in the right place at the right time for Scott and the GOP because she's able to keep her cool in the midst of chaos, manage people and tasks, and analyze both legal and political questions with knowledge and judgment.\n\n\"She's very even-keeled and always easy to work with,\" said veteran political lawyer Elliot Berke, who is president of the Republican National Lawyers Association.\n\nBrad Todd, a senior adviser to the Scott campaign, said Johnson was a godsend as the battle for the Senate seat moved from voting booths to courtrooms and election supervisors' offices.\n\n\"The most important thing about Jessica is she is someone who can manage a lot of different projects with very different personalities and have none of them upset at her. Politics is full of people who create conflict as a tool, and Jessica does not create conflict,\" Todd said.\n\nEarly in her career, Johnson was a protege of Cleta Mitchell, one of the GOP's top election lawyers over the last quarter of a century. More recently, she worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee, where she started as general counsel but later added duties as deputy executive director and ultimately took charge of the group's independent expenditure arm.\n\nNRSC Communications Director Katie Martin, who also worked with Johnson at the NRCC, said her mix of political and legal talents is truly rare.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been watching her be a badass for a while now,\" Martin said. \"She's someone who has a political mind, who sees the optics of every situation.\"\n\nJohnson's political tuner went off on the morning of Nov. 8 \u2014 two days after Election Day \u2014 when she saw a cluster of tweets about Elias signing up to help Nelson. Though she had made preparations for potential legal skirmishes in tight races across the country over the previous several months, Johnson immediately grasped that his engagement signaled a war.\n\nIn short order, she called her husband, Todd, who works for the Republican Governors Association, to make sure the kids would be taken care of and booked a flight.\n\n\"I knew I was going to Florida,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Topless feminist activists clash with far-right protesters in Spain", "description": "Fights broke out between far-right protesters and feminist anti-fascist activists at a rally marking the death of the dictator Francisco Franco.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/topless-feminist-activists-clash-with-far-right-protesters-in-spain-1374243907842", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_lon_tov_spainfascistprotest_181118.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:11:52Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Topless feminist activists clash with far-right protesters in Spain copied!\n\nFights broke out between far-right protesters and feminist anti-fascist activists at a rally marking the death of the dictator Francisco Franco.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jenni Miller", "title": "'Widows' is terrific as a crime thriller \u2014 but it's so much more than that", "description": "\u201cWidows\u201d review: Directed by Steve McQueen and starring Viola Davis, this movie is terrific as a crime thriller \u2014\u00a0but it's so much more than that", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/widows-directed-steve-mcqueen-excellent-crime-thriller-it-s-so-ncna937751", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2650796/181118-widows-al-1111_722eca3433a79d5b60046c7c2a0acebe.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:05:00Z", "content": "Get the Think newsletter.

On paper, it sounds like the standard shallowly feminist action films Hollywood occasionally uses to placate one of its underserved audiences.\n\nTo be sure, these movies make a ton of money, but they generally aren\u2019t very good. Liking them feels like an obligation to me. As a straight white woman in her forties, I can only speak to my experience, but I would imagine it\u2019s even more frustrating for, well, anyone who isn\u2019t a white heterosexual cisgender man.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying the gorgeous trappings of a movie like \u201cOcean\u2019s Eight,\u201d even if it is just a gender-flipped version of a male-driven franchise. I also loved \u201cSalt,\u201d but that might as well take place on an alien planet. There are only so many sexy ladies wielding guns in each hand that I can get worked up about, you know?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying the gorgeous trappings of a movie like \u201cOcean\u2019s Eight,\u201d even if it is just a gender-flipped version of a male-driven franchise.\n\nSurprisingly \u2014 and luckily \u2014 \u201cWidows\u201d is much more than its synopsis. The women of \u201cWidows\u201d aren\u2019t just ex-wives or decoys or a lone cool girl among the guys. They\u2019re carefully constructed characters with wildly disparate backgrounds, played by a powerhouse ensemble comprised of Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo. Their former partners\u2019 criminal pasts are inextricably intertwined with a local race for the position of Alderman of Chicago\u2019s 18th Ward, which is its own parallel plot about redistricting and positioning old-guard Chicago politicians (Colin Ferrell and Robert Duvall) against a local community leader (Brian Tyree Henry). It is complicated but not convoluted, and somehow even makes local politics thrilling.\n\nTo the credit of both the cast and writers, nothing about \u201cWidows\u201d feels medicinal or self-righteous, even when Davis quips, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d marry a white man\u2026 or a criminal.\u201d That's just her character\u2019s truth, just as Debicki\u2019s character Alice can use her beauty to her advantage as a sugar baby and be equally annoyed when men only deign to talk to her because of that beauty.\n\nIndeed, despite presenting itself as an action movie, at least in the trailers, \u201cWidows\u201d was created by a team that boasts both Oscar and arthouse credentials. Even before director/co-writer Steve McQueen\u2019s film \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d snagged Best Picture in 2014, he was adored in critical circles for his films \u201cHunger\u201d and \u201cShame.\u201d Meanwhile Gillian Flynn, who wrote the screenplay with McQueen, has become a household name thanks to bestselling thrillers featuring a series of female protagonists who can be generously characterized as unlikeable. It turns out that if you care about great characters doing fascinating things, it\u2019s not hard to represent that on film. (The movie is based on a 1983 ITV series of the same name.)\n\nAs Davis declares in the trailer, \u201cThe best thing we have going for us is being who we are\u2026 because no one thinks we have the balls to pull this off.\u201d The trailer, as trailers do, emphasizes such proclamations, and yes, when she delivered this line in the theater it made me want to pump my fist. But there are so many layers to \u201cwho are are\u201d that it\u2019s dizzying. Underneath the heist plot, the film paints a much more layered portrait of Chicago, where class, race, gender, age and politics rub up against each other in complicated ways. Sometimes it\u2019s blunt in its depiction of racism and hypocrisy, but it can also be surprisingly subtle. A glance, an insulting toss of cash onto a coffee table, or even what one character is listening to on the radio all becoming meaningful indications of a larger theme in the skilled hands of McQueen and his team.\n\nUnderneath the heist plot, the film paints a much more layered portrait of Chicago, where class, race, gender, age and politics rub up against each other in complicated ways.\n\nAltogether, these efforts pay off; the audience goers around me gasped, teared up and cheered at such an artfully composed, gorgeously shot 35mm film presented for mainstream audiences. (The cinematographer is Sean Bobbitt, who worked on both \u201cHunger\u201d and \u201cShame\u201d with McQueen.) There are no accidents here, starting with the stark white bedding that Liam Neeson and Viola Davis kiss against in the very first scene. I could go on, but really the less you know about \u201cWidows,\u201d both the movie and the original TV show, the more you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\nUltimately \u201cWidows\u201d is terrific on its face as a crime thriller. It\u2019s violent, it\u2019s kinetic and it\u2019s beyond watchable. But if you want to pay a bit more attention \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to, you can just enjoy it \u2014 there\u2019s so much more happening under the surface."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Finland's president rakes memory for source of Trump remark", "description": "Finland's president isn't sure where U.S. President Donald Trump got the idea that raking is part of his country's routine for managing its forests.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/finland-s-president-rakes-memory-source-trump-remark-n937736", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2650856/181118-sauli-niinisto-donald-trump-se-258p_478385219e8dafbcb31d5b9b7c39b9d8.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:02:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Top Democrats called for Whitaker's \"immediate recusal,\" citing past commentary critical of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians to influence the election.\n\nOn Friday, opponents of the appointment asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that Whitaker is not legally qualified to serve as acting attorney general. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice last week offered an opinion defending the legality of Whitaker's appointment.\n\nTrump slid Whitaker, who was Sessions' chief of staff prior to his appointment, over to serve as acting attorney general by utilizing the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a statute that allows for the president to fill such a void until a permanent replacement is named. However, legal experts have said the law only allows for the president to appoint a Senate-confirmed official, which Whitaker was not.\n\nDuring a Sunday interview with Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, Trump said he \"did not know\" Whitaker \"took views on the Mueller investigation,\" adding that those views didn't have \"any effect\" on the appointment.

A U.S. official involved in negotiations said China was the only nation to hold out on voting in favor of the proposed text.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little concerning that it appears that China didn\u2019t really have any intention in the end of reaching consensus,\u201d the U.S. official said, rejecting reports that the breakdown in the meeting was centered on a rift between the U.S. and China.\n\n\u201cIt was between 20 countries and China \u2014 not the United States and China,\u201d the official added.\n\nPapua New Guinea's prime minister, Peter O'Neill, said that \"the entire world is worried\" about tensions between China and the U.S. O'Neill addressed a mob of reporters that surrounded him after he confirmed there was no communique from leaders.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: \"I don't think it will come as a huge surprise that there are differing visions. Those prevented there from being a full consensus on the communique.\"\n\nOver the course of the week, Pence repeatedly raised the specter of the slated formal meeting between Trump and Xi later this month at the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s showdown over language in a nonbinding communique, along with dueling speeches delivered by Pence and Xi at APEC on Saturday, left much skepticism over how the two sides will be able to make progress in talks.\n\nPence told reporters on Sunday that he spoke twice with Xi over the weekend \u201cbriefly and candidly.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. is interested in a better relationship \"but there has to be change\" from China's side, Pence said he told Xi, who responded that dialogue is important.\n\nThe vice president, however, stuck to the Trump administration\u2019s publicly blunt negotiating tactic in his speech to the APEC members in a theater aboard a cruise ship on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe United States, though, will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d he said in his speech.\n\nPence continued, implicitly taking shots at China while offering an alternative to the other member countries in the region. \u201cKnow that the United States offers a better option,\" he said.\n\n\"We don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt. We don\u2019t coerce or compromise your independence. The United States deals openly, fairly. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d\n\nPence called on China to pull back from its military expansion in the South China Sea, deal with its human rights violations and halt the theft of American intellectual property in its pursuit of its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan.\n\nChina's foreign ministry rejected the U.S. criticism that it was leading other developing nations into debt bondage.\n\n\"The assistance provided by China has been warmly welcomed by our partners in this region and beyond,\" Wang Xiaolong, a foreign ministry official, said at a news conference.\n\nChina is a relative newcomer to providing aid, and its loan-heavy, no-strings-attached approach has unsettled Western nations that have been the mainstay donors to developing nations and often use aid to nudge nations toward reforms.\n\nBut China has ramped up its investments in the Indo-Pacific region, putting billions of dollars into infrastructure projects as part of its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative.\u201d\n\nIn countries like Papua New Guinea, the development is apparent, from buildings to new roads and bridges. A sign lining a road outside of APEC read: \u201cThe Great \u2018One Belt and One Road\u2019 Is Not Only a Road of Cooperation and Win-Win Situation, But Also a Road of Hope and Peace!\u201d\n\nAnd negotiations continue among 16 nations, including China but not the United States, toward the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which would be the world\u2019s largest trade agreement.\n\nThe White House has vowed to focus on building bilateral trade agreements after pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to stay,\u201d Pence told reporters.\n\nHe said negotiations for a new deal between the U.S. and Japan are underway.\n\nThrough the week the vice president also worked to highlight new investment plans by the U.S., including a partnership with several ally nations to invest in electrical infrastructure in Papua New Guinea that would bring adequate power to 70 percent of the country\u2019s population by 2030.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that it will not back down from its standoff with China.\n\nThe U.S. initiated the trade war in March, implementing tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum. Trump cited the large trade deficit between the two countries.\n\nOver the summer, the Trump administration placed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods and threatened to double that. Xi, meanwhile, retaliated with $60 billion of his own tariffs on U.S. products.\n\nOn Sunday, as the vice president\u2019s motorcade entered Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby to depart the region, he drove past Xi's aircraft.\n\nBoth countries will now prepare for formal talks in Argentina that they will have to hope prove more productive."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Maggie Fox", "title": "In taking on vape companies and menthol, FDA faces determined foes", "description": "In its latest effort to limit teen tobacco use by limiting sales of flavored vape products and menthol cigarettes, the FDA faces ruthless corporate resistance.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/taking-vape-companies-menthol-fda-faces-determined-foes-n937371", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_20/549471/140707-vaper-jsw-934a_ccde3c4b441854f12d41ebb8e7eef109.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T17:04:49Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nWhen the Food and Drug Administration said this past week it will try to limit sales of flavored vapes to teenagers and will start the lengthy process of banning menthol flavored cigarettes, it sounded to many like a firm crackdown.\n\nBut anti-tobacco advocates know the agency faces an uphill battle against an experienced and determined set of industries. The tobacco companies have decades of practice in fighting off challenges to their marketing practices and even though tobacco is the single biggest killer globally, it remains legal everywhere.\n\nWith this week\u2019s announcement, the agency threw the gauntlet down to three large industries: traditional Big Tobacco, a growing e-cigarette industry, and retailers. All can be expected to push back.\n\n\u201cI never underestimate the power of the industry,\u201d said Gregg Haifley of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society.\n\nWhile anti-smoking advocacy groups all welcomed the FDA\u2019s announcements, many expressed doubt about whether the proposals go far enough and about whether the FDA will be able to pull them off. And the industry rolled out its lawyers immediately.\n\nTobacco giant Reynolds American issued a not-so-veiled threat immediately after FDA released its statements Thursday, saying any proposal to ban menthol cigarettes would \u201cbe subject to judicial review.\u201d\n\nMurray Garnick, general counsel and executive vice president of Altria Group, noted that the FDA must jump through several hoops to stop the use of menthol in cigarettes and to limit the sale of flavored vaping products. \u201cWe continue to believe that a total ban on menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars would be an extreme measure not supported by the science and evidence,\u201d Garnick said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe expect that establishing product standards on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars will be a multi-year, deliberative process, and we will be fully engaged throughout.\u201d\n\nThe National Association of Convenience Stores also expressed skepticism about the FDA\u2019s proposal that it can make retailers separate sales of flavored vape products to make them harder for teens to buy. \u201cWe urge the FDA to share any information they have demonstrating that its proposal will improve age verification on e-cigarette sales,\u201d the group\u2019s Lyle Beckwith said.\n\nIt\u2019s to be expected, Haifley said.\n\n\u201cAny time there\u2019s a significant, meaningful effective proposal to curb their behavior or reduce people\u2019s consumption of their product, they almost always turn to litigation to block, delay, obstruct,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\n\u201cAnd of course the delays caused by litigation can take more than a decade, and every day that passes during that time sees smokers continuing to smoke and more smokers becoming addicted to their products.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for vaping. While the industry and some supporters argue that e-cigarettes can be effective to help smokers reduce their use of deadly, combustible tobacco, advocates point out that the nicotine-heavy products are addicting a new generation. And they say vape products flavored with candy, fruit and other sweet tastes are aimed not at hardened smokers but at kids.\n\nThe FDA did not even get the power to regulate tobacco or tobacco products until 2009, when Congress passed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. It did not give the agency the authority to ban tobacco products outright, but did make some leeway for regulating new products.\n\nAnti-smoking advocates felt the FDA fell down on the job almost right away when it failed to step out in front the of the then-embryonic electronic cigarette industry.\n\nFDA did try calling e-cigarettes medical devices, which would have made for a more familiar route to forcing pre-marketing approval. But the tobacco companies challenged this and won in federal appeals courts, which said they should be regulated as tobacco products.\n\nWhile FDA worked to build its Center for Tobacco Products, vaping took off big-time. Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, 3.6 million middle and high school students use c-cigarettes \u2014 more than 20 percent of high school students. And 2.8 percent of adults use them.\n\nMany e-cigarette companies are subsidiaries of tobacco companies, but others are independent. The most successful companies, such as Juul, are already multi-billion dollar corporations and anti-smoking advocates say they\u2019ve shown how they want to engage with the FDA.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most politically sophisticated, savvy companies we have seen in years,\u201d said Matthew Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cThe unfortunate part is they are using that savvy to avoid regulation and to mass-produce a product that has addicted kids all across the country.\u201d\n\nE-cigarette companies including Juul and Blu say they welcome limits that would prevent teen vaping and say they've scaled back their marketing and advertising to youth.\n\nMyers does not trust them.\n\n\"Juul is smart enough to try to use FDA actions to falsely create an impression of it as a caring, responsible company,\" he said. \"A caring responsible company would never have run the social media campaign that Juul ran and continued to run until there began to be a public outcry.\"\n\nHaifley expects a skilled defense from the e-cigarette industry. \u201cThey have taken several pages out of the cigarette companies\u2019 playbook in terms of product manipulation, marketing strategies, litigation tactics, hiring an army of lobbyists and so on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have learned well, agreed Robin Koval, CEO of the Truth Initiative, a nonprofit established as part of a 1998 settlement agreement between major U.S. tobacco companies and 46 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories.\n\nGroups such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and the American Lung Association, as well as state governments, spent decades suing the tobacco companies. They never won outright, instead settling for several billion dollars in payouts and limits on tobacco marketing and advertising.\n\nA second round of suits has resulted in a series of advertisements in which tobacco companies must publicly admit they lied, conspired and deliberately worked to make cigarettes even more addictive than they already were. Even so, the statements are bland and boring, thanks to extensive litigation by those same tobacco companies.\n\n\u201cIn fact, tobacco companies have fought for more than 11 years to weaken and delay the corrective statements, underscoring how little they have changed,\u201d the cancer and heart associations, along with others, said in a joint statement Friday.\n\nThe FDA was also just plain slow in using what powers it does have, Haifley said. It took until 2014 to issue its plans for regulating tobacco products and moved even more slowly to do anything about e-cigarettes. \u201cBy the time they got around to saying they were going to assert their authority over these products, the market was flooded with them,\u201d Haifley said.\n\n\u201cThis is the mess that we are in now.\u201d\n\nTobacco companies also have allies in Congress who will help slow FDA\u2019s efforts. \u201cAll you have to do is look at each Congress and you see bills that would scale back or strip the FDA of authority over some of these products,\u201d Haifley said.\n\nAny new FDA moves will have to make their way through a slow, bureaucratic process that actively invites the public, but also industry, to weigh in. Corporate lawyers and lobbyists will make use of the process, Haifley said. There will be points all along the way for special interests to work to block proposals, he said \u2014 right up to the White House Office of Management and Budget."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Picasso painting stolen six years ago resurfaces in Romania", "description": "Prosecutors believe they have uncovered the \"T\u00eate d\u2019Arlequin\" by Pablo Picasso, after it was stolen in 2012 heist in Rotterdam.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/stolen-picasso-painting-resurfaces-romania-six-years-later-n937676", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2650776/181118-stolen-art-al-1038_d5d7189eecaa6358d2baf589a0f223a4.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:42:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

If he said that there\u2019s no collusion, he\u2019s right.\"\n\nWhitaker's appointment has been the subject much controversy, particularly as it relates to his role overseeing Mueller's probe. Top Democrats have called for his \"immediate recusal,\" citing his past commentary critical of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians to influence the election.\n\nOn Friday, opponents of the appointment asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that Whitaker is not legally qualified to serve as acting attorney general. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice offered an opinion defending the legality of Whitaker's appointment last week.\n\nIn an interview with \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of the president, said he had \"nothing against\" Whitaker, adding, however, \"I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s the best choice.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of choices out there,\" Graham added. The senator said he \"would encourage the president to pick someone\" to nominate as attorney general \"very soon.\"\n\nSpeaking to Wallace, Trump said it's up to Whitaker to decide on curtailing Mueller's probe in any way.\n\n\"I think he\u2019s very well aware politically,\" Trump said of Whitaker. \"I think he\u2019s astute politically. He\u2019s a very smart person. A very respected person. He\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right. I really believe he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right.\"\n\nOn Mueller, Trump all but shut down the idea that he would sit for an interview with the special counsel, adding that he will turn over his answers to written questions to the special counsel \"at some point very soon.\"\n\nAsked if there would be \"no interview\" with Mueller, Trump said he thought \"we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we\u2019re finished\" after he submits the written answers.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" Wallace asked of an interview. \"One in a hundred?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t do odds,\" Trump responded before Wallace cut in to point out that, \"You ran a casino sir.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re right, and very successfully actually,\" Trump said. \"We gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn\u2019t have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem. I hope it solves the problem, if it doesn\u2019t, you know, I\u2019ll be told and we\u2019ll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end.\"\n\nNBC News reported earlier Sunday that the president's legal team plans to submit answers to Mueller by Thanksgiving, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Fox News interview, Wallace asked Trump if he ever second-guesses any of his decisions as president.\n\n\"Yes, oh, all the time,\" Trump said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Claude Fischer", "title": "Have millennials killed phone calls?

Certainly, a lot of practical business and just checking in is now done by text rather than by call. But these funereal descriptions of phoning overlook one lasting feature of the call: It\u2019s a way people can have heart-to-hearts when they cannot be face to face.\n\nIn the early days of the telephone, in the late 19th century, its major uses were not unlike major uses of email and texting today: business matters, practical arrangements, emergencies, and the like. But then Americans, particularly American women, started increasingly using the telephone for a range of social purposes\u2013to stay connected to family, to sustain friendships.\n\nFounders of the telephone industry were dismayed by social uses of the telephone, what one executive angrily called \u201cidle gossip.\u201d But by the 1920s, new leadership had realized that customers calling personal intimates was not an annoyance, but a profit center. In its ads, the industry increasingly suggested that the telephone call was ideal for getting family news, giving friends holiday greetings, and just to chat. Falling costs for long-distance calls increased popular use of the technology for such personal matters.\n\nThen came the internet.\n\nFounders of the telephone industry were dismayed by social uses of the telephone, what one executive angrily called \u201cidle gossip.\u201d\n\nThe number of landline phones in America peaked at about 193 million around 2000, according to the World Bank, when Americans already had nearly 110 million mobile phone subscriptions. Landline connections have now dropped to under 120 million, while mobile phone accounts have soared to 396 million (which, yes, is greater than the actual number of Americans). And we all know that the mobile \u201cphone\u201d is used for far more than making phone calls.\n\nAmericans use their smartphones for many practical purposes such as looking up health symptoms and traffic guidance, according to the Pew Research Center for Internet & Technology. And, almost everyone uses it for texting, although about 90 percent of people actually do call, too. By volume, Americans send about five times as many texts as the number of calls they make and spend about five times as many minutes per day texting as calling, according to Infomate, a mobile data company.\n\nNow, about a century on after Americans commandeered the old phone for personal chit-chat, what is left for the phone call? Personal chit-chat \u2014 very personal chit-chat. It would appear, from some research that we have been doing at Berkeley, that the phone has found a special niche as the preferred media for intimacy.\n\nIt would appear, from some research that we have been doing at Berkeley, that the phone has found a special niche as the preferred media for intimacy.\n\nIn a several-year project funded by the National Institutes of Health, we have followed about 1000 residents of the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 about half in their 20s and about half in their 50s and 60s \u2014 learning about their personal networks, including about how they stayed in touch with people who matter to them.\n\nOne big difference between the two cohorts: Landlines. Almost none of the 20-somethings used landlines as a major way to stay in touch with family or friends, while about a fourth of the older respondents still did. Another big difference: Email. Most older respondents used email as a main way of staying in touch, while fewer than a quarter of the younger people did.\n\nBut when it comes to phone calls, over 80 percent of both age groups report using calls, whether by cell or by landline, as a main way they stayed in touch with family. The groups do differ when it comes to staying in touch with friends: About 80 percent of the mature adults relied on phone calls, but just under half of the young adults did. (More relied on texting and, as national data also show, much more than the older respondents, on social media.) Nonetheless, both old and young still do call sometimes.\n\nWe can appreciate why even young people still make phone calls when we consider who is contacted often and how.\n\nIn another part of our study, we asked respondents how often they were in contact, and in what ways, with specific people in their social lives. The people whom respondents saw in person were basically people who were nearby, into whom they easily ran. But the people with whom respondents talked often on the phone were especially likely to be intimates \u2014 parents, adult children, people in whom they confided, people to whom they felt \u201cclose.\u201d These findings are consistent with other studies showing that intimacy is more common in personal phone calls than in personal emails or even in face-to-face meetings.\n\nWhen access to the telephone spread, more people were able to more quickly, easily and cheaply converse with those whom they cared about \u2014 annoying interruptions by unwanted callers notwithstanding. As access to the internet has spread, that capacity to converse has multiplied in method and volume, the dark side of the internet notwithstanding.\n\nStill, there appears to be something still special about voice-to-voice that makes people turn to the phone call when it matters most."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Nbc News", "title": "Florida sues Walgreens, CVS over opioid sales", "description": "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has added the companies to a state-court lawsuit filed against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and several opioid distributors.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/florida-sues-walgreens-cvs-over-opioid-sales-n937656", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_29/2505106/180721-cvs-pharmacy-al-1139_34cce89c449ca382b267525b33cbead4.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:47:42Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He said the company trains its pharmacists and their assistants about their responsibilities when dispensing controlled substances and gives them tools to detect potentially illegal sales.\n\nIn a lawsuit, Florida has accused CVS of selling 700 million opioid dosages between 2006 and 2014. Shannon Stapleton / Reuters file\n\n\"Over the past several years, CVS has taken numerous actions to strengthen our existing safeguards to help address the nation's opioid epidemic,\" DeAnglelis said.\n\nWalgreens said Saturday it doesn't comment on pending lawsuits.\n\nUntil a law enforcement crackdown at the beginning of the decade, Florida was known for its so-called pain mills. Drug dealers from throughout the country would send associates to store-front clinics where unscrupulous doctors would write opioid prescriptions for bogus injuries and illnesses. At one point, 90 of the nation's top 100 opioid prescribers were Florida doctors, according to federal officials.\n\nAfter receiving the prescriptions, the phony patients would buy the pills from Florida pharmacies \u2014 state law says pharmacists must refuse to fill prescriptions they suspect are not for a valid purpose. Most of the opioids would then be taken out of state to be resold illegally at huge markups, creating a drug crisis in many communities throughout the Eastern United States.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Walgreens has dispensed billions of opioid dosages from its Florida pharmacies since 2006. The Illinois-based chain is the nation's largest drugstore chain and has more than 13,200 stores globally.\n\nThe company distributed 2.2 million opioid tablets from its store in Hudson, a Tampa-area town of 12,000, and in one unidentified town of 3,000, sold 285,000 pills in a month, the lawsuit says. In some stores, its opioid sales jumped six-fold in two years. The company paid $80 million five years ago to resolve a federal investigation that centered on inadequate record keeping of its Florida opioid sales that allowed the pills to reach the black market.\n\nFlorida's accusations against CVS were more general, saying it sold 700 million opioid dosages between 2006 and 2014, including outsized sales in Hudson and two other nearby towns.

He told me that, I would say, maybe five times at different points.\u201d\n\nThe president also asked, \u201cWill anybody really know?

Department of Public Health. Advocates say the case paved the way for the Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges, which 12 years later guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide.\n\n\u201cIt was hugely important,\u201d said Brian Silva, former executive director of Marriage Equality. \u201cYou can\u2019t underscore enough how critical it was.\u201d\n\nDavid Wilson, left, and Robert Compton on their wedding day in May 2004. Courtesy of Robert Compton and David Wilson\n\nCompton and Wilson, who live in Provincetown, Massachusetts, were eager to enlist in the fight for marriage equality. The men had both previously been married to women for over 20 years, and had five children between them. They came out late, and were excited to get a new start on life.\n\nWhen they met in 1997 at a convention for gay fathers in Boston, there was an instant connection. They went on their first date \u2014 a dinner and a movie \u2014 and were soon in love. A year later, they purchased a home together. They made their vows during a commitment ceremony at Boston\u2019s Arlington Street Church in 2000 in front of friends and family.\n\nIn 2001, the Massachusetts-based gay rights organization Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD, asked the pair to be a part of the Goodridge lawsuit. At the time, it hardly felt like a choice to the couple.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about retirement \u2014 knew it was about a decade away, but we were thinking about how can we protect each other, especially in medical situations,\u201d Wilson recalled.\n\nRobert Compton and David Wilson with other Goodridge v. Department of Public Health plaintiffs and members of GLAD. Susan R Symonds for Infinity Portrait Design\n\nCompton had endured several hospitalizations for kidney stones and other ailments. Yet each time, Wilson was kept from his bedside because they were not legally wed.\n\n\u201cIt was things like that that made me aware that you might not have all the rights you think you do,\u201d Compton said.\n\nAfter the ruling, same-sex couples in Massachusetts could finally marry. Those who didn\u2019t live happily ever after got something else they hadn\u2019t enjoyed previously \u2014 the right to divorce, which allowed them to legally settle disputes over children and property. Julie and Hillary Goodridge, the main plaintiffs in the historic case, amicably divorced in 2009. But most of the couples who were plaintiffs remain married to this day.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed for us,\u201d said Wilson, \u201cis we don\u2019t think about \u2018Well, we\u2019re not married, we don\u2019t have the rights.\u2019 We assume that we do.\u201d\n\nThose rights didn\u2019t come easily. The men received death threats during the highly publicized case, which wound its way into the state's Supreme Judicial Court, where it was ultimately determined. The couple recalled anti-gay-marriage protesters outside the courthouse waving picket signs with hateful slogans like \u201cGod hates fags.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seemed like everybody did not like the LGBT community,\u201d remembered Compton. \u201cIt seemed very personal to us.\u201d\n\nAfter Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage, the battle for marriage equality only seemed to intensify, the couple recalled. Then- Republican Gov. Mitt Romney called for an amendment to the state constitution that would define a marriage between a man and a woman, and a number of conservative groups filed lawsuits against the decision in state court. It would be another 6 months before same-sex couples could officially marry, but for Wilson and Compton, it was well worth the wait.\n\n\u201cYou finally could breath again,\u201d Compton recalled. \u201cYou could take a breath and just enjoy it.\u201d\n\nDavid Wilson, left, and Robert Compton on their wedding day in May 2004. Courtesy of Robert Compton and David Wilson\n\nOn May 17, 2004, Compton and Wilson wed in the same church where they had held their commitment ceremony four years earlier \u2014 this time in front of a jam-packed room of friends, family, and hundreds of strangers and news media who had all come to hear them say \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were probably 500 plus people in church, many of them we didn\u2019t know,\u201d Wilson remembered with a laugh.\n\nYet marriage equality remained a contentious issue. A decade after the Massachusetts decision, 17 states and the District of Columbia had legalized same-sex marriage, while other states passed constitutional bans against the unions.\n\nWhile the legal cases were significant, the real battle was fought outside the courtroom \u2014 in the arena of public opinion, according to Silva.\n\n\u201cWhen you actually started to see your family, friends, neighbors get married and live their lives, and see just how similar our families are to other married families, it really started to destroy the wall of myths that our opponents had tried to create around the alleged negative effects of marriage equality, because it was there in person, right in front of you,\u201d Silva explained.\n\nNow, three years after the Supreme Court's 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage across the nation \u2014 and 15 years after Massachusetts did so for its residents \u2014 two in three Americans support gay marriage, according to a recent Gallup pole.\n\nThese days, marriage equality feels more or less normal to Wilson and Compton, who will celebrate their 15th anniversary in May.\n\nThe broader fight for LGBTQ equality, however, continues, warned Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ rights group.\n\n\u201cRight before marriage equality and through marriage equality, we have had more than 500 bills in 40 states aimed at undermining the rights of LGBTQ people,\u201d she said.\n\nWarbelow also pointed to recent bills in Kansas and Oklahoma that would give faith-based adoption agencies the ability to deny adoption to gay and lesbian couples.\n\n\u201cThat is the nature of the attacks that we are seeing percolating in state legislatures through the federal court system,\u201d she said. Proponents of such bills argue they protect the liberties of those who hold sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\nWilson, a longtime activist and a member of GLAD\u2019s board of directors, is making a second vow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking nothing for granted,\u201d Wilson said, \u201cand we are going to continue to work as hard as we can to make sure that the rights we\u2019ve worked hard for don\u2019t get rolled back.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misquoted Sarah Warbelow. She said we've had \"more than 500 bills in 40 states aimed at undermining the rights of LGBTQ people\" \u2014 not \"four states.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Full Panel: Government shutdown looms over Mueller probe", "description": "John Harwood, Hallie Jackson, Rich Lowry and Yamiche Alcindor discuss the challenges facing a bill to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-panel-government-shutdown-looms-over-mueller-probe-1374065219760", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/mtp_full_panel_181118_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:09:28Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Full Gardner: 'We have evidence that the state constitution of Florida was violated' 08:42"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "President expected to submit Mueller answers 'before Thanksgiving'", "description": "NBC's Chief White House Correspondent, Hallie Jackson, reports on the next steps for the White House and the Special Counsel investigation.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/president-expected-to-submit-mueller-answers-before-thanksgiving-1374064707870", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/mtp_clip_hallie_181118_1920x1080.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:08:45Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Leiter: McRaven would 'take himself out of the conversation' if Trump focused on military issues 01:07"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Corky Siemaszko", "title": "How the Catholic 'alt-right' aims to purge LGBTQ members from the church", "description": "Websites like Church Militant, LifeSite News and the Lepanto Institute are ratcheting up the rhetoric with personal attacks on supporters of gay Catholics.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/how-catholic-alt-right-aims-purge-homosexuals-church-n934681", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646286/181114-dublin-world-meeting-of-families-lgbtq-choir-ew-122p_c17caa1549d7f66abc4c2df76a7f5bed.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:00:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Just this month, a group of Dominican nuns in suburban Milwaukee hired security guards to keep more than two dozen anti-gay protesters off their property where they were hosting a retreat for gay clergy.\n\nFordham University theologian Jason Steidl has coined a name for them.\n\n\u201cI call them the 'Catholic alt-right,'\u201d Steidl told NBC News. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this before.

He once compared Trump to Constantine, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity.\n\nVoris agreed that conservative Catholics are more focused now on the LGBTQ community, but said it\u2019s because \u201cthe news [of the Pennsylvania grand jury report] has certainly multiplied under Pope Francis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t whip up crowds to stone them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bunch of Muslims in Saudi Arabia chopping peoples\u2019 heads off.\u201d\n\nBut the gay lifestyle is a sin, Voris said, and he\u2019s speaking from personal experience.\n\n\u201cI lived a gay lifestyle for a number of years,\u201d said Voris, who said he is now celibate.\n\nMike Hichborn of the Lepanto Institute also bristled at the Catholic alt-right label.\n\n\"The Lepanto Institute does not stand for anything beyond the absolute and immutable teachings of the Catholic Church,\" Hichborn wrote in an email. \"That does not make us 'alt-right' but fully faithful.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Sherrod Brown: 'Populism is not racist, it\u2019s not anti-Semitic'", "description": "In an exclusive interview with Meet the Press, Sen.

He places a filter-lined funnel atop a glass flask and carefully doles out the speciality coffee \u2014 produced and roasted locally \u2014 in the centre of the filter paper, before pouring the hot water over the top and watching the dark brown brew drip down.\n\nFor now, Juli\u00e1n is learning the skills just for fun, but there\u2019s a larger goal in mind: Low coffee prices, climate change and a rapidly-aging coffee work force mean it's more important than ever to get kids excited and invested in keeping the coffee industry here thriving.\n\nIf kids like Juli\u00e1n don't stay on the land, Colombia's smooth Arabica coffee, served by cafe chains around the globe, could disappear \u2014 but if programs like these succeed, the next generation could preserve Colombia\u2019s centuries-old culture while providing better local jobs and better-tasting coffee for local consumers.\n\nThe library in this town about 130 miles south of Medell\u00edn is housed in the corner of a massive colonial building. One overcast October day, nearly a dozen kids between the ages of 6 and 12 filled the common area used by the Cafeteritos, which is Spanish for little coffee makers.\n\n\u201cI want to run my own coffee shop one day,\u201d says Juli\u00e1n, as he makes the pour-over coffee. \u201cAnd I want kids from all over the world to come and share this coffee with me.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of class, the kids and their instructor sample the final product \u2014 in comparison to the U.S., Colombia has a more relaxed attitude toward childhood caffeine consumption. Colombia is in the top 25 in the world for cola consumption and some doctors there say coffee for kids like Juli\u00e1n is permissible in moderation. As they arrive at the library, parents start to get involved, too \u2014 one parent describes picking more than 400 pounds of coffee berries daily during the harvest season. Later another parent, a farmer, spontaneously bursts into a traditional regional song.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about coffee from my boy,\u201d said Arelis Murillo, Juli\u00e1n\u2019s mother. \u201cHe also has a lot of confidence now.\u201d She explains that she sent originally Juli\u00e1n to the program to keep him occupied while learning something new, after hearing about Cafeteritos from the organizers of a previous program involving girls\u2019 soccer.\n\nCafeteritos grew from a 2016 pilot program started by philanthropist Javier S\u00e1nchez Embid from Guadalajara, Spain, local coffee grower Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez Salazar and local library head Adriana Grisales with the intent of providing an educational after-school program that would appeal to both boys and girls. Now, the kids compete in brewing competitions and go on field trips to processing centers and coffee farms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing together not only the generations, but different parts of the production chain,\u201d said Wilson Fl\u00f3rez Valencia, cultural center and library coordinator for Comfamilar Risaralda, a compensation fund that runs the library and 17 others across the Risaralda region."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Graham: Mohammad bin Salman is 'irrational...unhinged'", "description": "In an exclusive interview with Meet the Press, Sen.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Rebecca Shabad and Daniel Barnes\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the midterms home stretch last month, President Donald Trump's stump speech featured a string of notably ambitious campaign promises \u2014 tall orders even by the standards of election-year politicking.\n\nMost had a few things in common. They tended to feature stunningly swift due dates \u2014 movement on some, the president pledged, would begin even before Election Day. They tended to require congressional action from lawmakers busy running for reelection. Some of the most headline-grabbing pledges were relatively new additions to his standard political pitch.\n\nAnd for the most part, it isn't clear they're anywhere near making the leap from stump fodder to substantive action \u2014 or whether they ever will be.\n\nDelivering a 10 percent tax cut\n\nRepublicans spent much of the year tossing around the concept of a second round of tax reform that would make the Trump tax cuts permanent. In October, Trump himself went a bit further: Not only would there be a bill, he told journalists before a campaign rally \u2014 it would be a 10 percent tax cut, \u201ca very major tax cut for middle income people.\u201d And if it happened, it would be \"sometime prior...to November.\u201d\n\nThat was news to reporters. It was news to voters. It was also was news to the Republican congressional leaders whose task it would have been to turn that sort of promise into reality.\n\nOne major problem for GOP leadership: at that point, none of the lawmakers who would provide the votes for such a measure were on Capitol Hill \u2014 for weeks, they had been back on the campaign trail in their home districts.\n\nAn even bigger problem: even if those lawmakers had been in Washington, and willing to vote for such a measure, it didn't actually exist yet. Midway through November, it still doesn't.\n\nAt several rallies the day before the election, the president again said that Congress would \u201csoon\u201d follow last year\u2019s tax reform package with a \u201canother 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's going to be a tax reduction of 10 percent for the middle class. Business will not enter into it. And this will be on top of the tax reduction that the middle class has already gotten. And we're putting in a resolution probably this week. I think these folks know about it. And Kevin Brady has been working on it very hard, really, for a couple of months. We'll put that in, and we'll start the work after the \u2014 sometime after the midterms,\u201d Trump said at a bill-signing event on Oct. 23.\n\nThe resolution didn't hit that week. And with a Democratic House takeover just weeks away, and a lame-duck session crammed with must-pass legislation, the likelihood that \"sometime\" is enough time to push through such a measure grows more remote by the day.\n\nBuilding a border wall\n\nSince Trump entered office nearly two years ago, he has tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to get a GOP Congress to pass significant federal funding for the wall he\u2019s promised along the U.S.-Mexico border. It's fair to say the incoming Democratic Congress isn't likely to make it a priority.\n\nAnd so the current lame-duck congressional session is the president\u2019s last chance to secure significant funding before he's a lame duck himself, or out of office entirely.\n\nAt his post-election White House press conference, Trump was asked if he was prepared to pursue a shutdown strategy at the end of this year in order to get the wall money since this could be his last chance to secure funding. He didn't rule it out.\n\n\u201cI mean, we'll be fighting for it,\" he said. \"...But [Democrats\u2019] whole agenda has been to try not giving me anything for the wall. I really believe, politically, they're hurting themselves. I actually think, politically, that's a good thing for me.\u201d\n\nAt a Trump rally in Fort Myers, Florida on Oct. 31, he told his supporters, \u201cThe wall is being built. We just spent $1.6 billion on a big section. Another $1.6 billion now. We have another $1.6 billion coming, but we want to build it all at one time. All at one time.\u201d\n\nBut on the trail, he seemed to recognize that Congress looks roughly as likely to fully fund a border wall as Mexico has proven to be. At a campaign rally a day before the election, Trump again seemed to suggest that he may not need an actual wall: \u201cAlthough, barbed wire looks like it's going to be very effective, too. With soldiers standing in front of it.\u201d\n\nStopping birthright citizenship\n\nTrump made headlines a week before the midterm elections when he claimed, during an interview with Axios, that he was looking at eliminating birthright citizenship with an executive order.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump made a number of questionable or inaccurate claims, starting with his statement that the U.S. was the only nation which grants citizenship to all babies born within its borders.\n\n\u201cNow, how ridiculous \u2014 we're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d Around 30 other nations, including Mexico and Canada, offer birthright citizenship.\n\nThe other eyebrow-raising constitutional claim: His insistence that he had the power to end birthright citizenship with an executive order. Most legal experts agree than a constitutional amendment \u2014 which would involve congressional action from the president's Hill allies \u2014 would be needed.\n\nIn the final week of the midterm campaign, Trump pushed the issue heavily, tweeting and using it as an applause line at rallies. During a press conference the day after the elections, he told reporters he was looking at the issue \u201cvery seriously.\u201d Two days later, the president assured reporters that an executive order was coming shortly, blaming the delay on continuing election recounts in Florida.\n\nThus far, no executive order or draft amendment has emerged.\n\nCutting off U.S. aid to Central American nations\n\nIn the closing weeks of the midterm elections, Trump made the approaching caravan of Central Americans intending to seek U.S. asylum a key part of his campaign messaging, threatening to deploy troops to the southern border and punish Central American countries by cutting foreign aid.\n\n\u201cGuatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them,\u201d Trump tweeted on October 22, almost two weeks before the midterms.\n\nAlmost a month later, there has been no indication that the U.S. will cut foreign aid to the three countries. Since foreign aid is allocated in the federal budget \u2014 which is passed by Congress \u2014 it is unclear how Trump would be able to independently enforce his threat.\n\nTrump\u2019s characterization of the aid given to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala as \u201cmassive\u201d is also inaccurate. In 2018, the three countries received a combined $284 million, less than 2 percent of total foreign aid spending this year.\n\nAs part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to foreign policy, the president has long called for the U.S. to decrease the amount of aid it sends to other countries. Multiple White House budgets have proposed dramatic cuts in foreign aid, but those cuts have never been approved by Congress.\n\nProtecting pre-existing conditions\n\nThe president repeatedly told his base at \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies that he and Republicans would protect people with pre-existing conditions, even as their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the House as well as through legal action have sought to unravel those protections. Late in the campaign, they became a particular focus.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to health care, Republicans will protect patients with preexisting conditions. They're going to protect pre-existing conditions. I will always protect pre-existing conditions...\u201d Trump said at a rally in September.\n\nBut even as he made the pledge, his administration backed a lawsuit filed by 20 Republican state attorneys general that calls for the courts to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act \u2014 including its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. It still does. And there remains no plan from the administration or its congressional allies to push through any measure that would specifically guarantee those protections."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Graham on criminal justice reform: 'The Republicans are the problem here, not the Democrats.'", "description": "Sen.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Dante Chinni and Sally Bronston\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The 2018 midterms remade Congress for the next two years, but they also hinted at a changing electoral map for the next presidential race. Broad gaps in exit poll numbers combined with the results from the midterm elections suggest that the battleground states of 2020 may look a bit different than they did in 2016.\n\nThree numbers jump out of the national House exit poll data: The Republican edge with white voters, the growing Democratic advantage with voters who hold a bachelor\u2019s degree and the consistent Democratic lean among Hispanics.\n\nEven in a year where Democrats picked up more than 35 seats in the House, Republicans still won white voters by a solid 10 percentage points.\n\nBut Democrats won college-educated voters by an even more substantial 20 points (continuing a trend that\u2019s been underway for some years). And Hispanic/Latino voters went to Democrats by a massive 40 points, an even bigger edge than the party usually has with that group of voters.\n\nThose are big numbers, but they can seem abstract until you combine them with geography. Consider the results this past election out of Ohio, a state President Donald Trump won by 8 points in 2016.\n\nOhio had two Republican-held competitive House seats in 2018 \u2014 one \u201ctossup\u201d and one \u201clean Republican\u201d according to the Cook Political Report \u2014 and both wound up going for the Republican candidate fairly comfortably. And in the state\u2019s gubernatorial race, an open seat to replace Republican John Kasich, the GOP\u2019s Mike DeWine won in a race that, again, was forecasted as a tossup.\n\nConsidering the Democratic pickups this year, those results stand out. But they make more sense when you look at the state\u2019s demographic picture.\n\nWith a population that is 79 percent white, non-Hispanic, Ohio stands far above the national average of about 61 percent. The percentage of people with a bachelor\u2019s degree, about 27 percent, is three points below the national average. And the Hispanic population, about 4 percent, is 14 points below the national figure.\n\nIn short, on the factors that mattered in the exit polls, Ohio looks Republican. So much so, that the perpetual battleground seems less and less likely to be in play in 2020.\n\nBut Democrats also have some good 2020 news out of the midterm results. Look at Colorado, a state that Democrat Hillary Clinton won by 5 points in 2016.\n\nThis year there was one competitive Republican House seat in the state \u2014 the seemingly always-endangered Mike Coffman \u2014 and the Democrat beat the GOP incumbent by 11 points. In the governor\u2019s race, Democrat Jared Polis walked to a victory, carrying the state by 10 points in an open race to replace outgoing Democrat John Hickenlooper.\n\nAnd when you look at the demographic picture you can see why.\n\nColorado\u2019s population is a little more white than the nation as a whole, 68 percent compared to 61 percent nationally. But the state also has a much higher percentage of college graduates, 39 percent compared to the national figure of 30 percent. And the Hispanic population, 22 percent, is four points above the national average.\n\nWhen you add those numbers to this year\u2019s midterm results, Colorado looks less and less like a swing state. It appears to have swung pretty firmly toward the Democrats \u2013 at least with the direction the parties are currently moving.\n\nIf Ohio and Colorado are coming off the board of battleground states, are there any states that look like they may be sliding in to take their place?\n\nThe numbers suggest Georgia and Arizona might be coming onto the board. Both are below the national average for white, non-Hispanic population, less than 55 percent. Both are just under the national average for the population with a bachelor\u2019s degree. And both had very close statewide races this year \u2013 Senate in Arizona and gubernatorial in Georgia.\n\nThose points suggest a few campaign dollars will be spent in those states in the next presidential race.\n\nTaken together all the shuffling around the question of what is and what isn\u2019t a battleground state is just more evidence that this past election wasn\u2019t a wave as much as it was the continuation of a political realignment. The 2020 election may still be 720 days away, but our understanding of politics and the political landscape is changing."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "New election map: Ohio, Colorado no longer swing states", "description": "The results for November 6th, suggest that the battleground states of 2020 may look a bit different than they did in the 2016 campaign.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/new-election-map-ohio-colorado-no-longer-swing-states-1374022723883", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/mtp_data_download_181118.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T13:29:29Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New election map: Ohio, Colorado no longer swing states copied!\n\nThe results for November 6th suggest that the battleground states of 2020 may look a bit different than they did in the 2016 campaign.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Brandi Vincent", "title": "'I've seen a lot of tears' \u2014 Electric scooter invasion generates safety concerns", "description": "The widespread adoption of electric scooters have left startups as well as hospitals and city governments to grapple with questions about safety \u2014 particularly the use of helmets.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/i-ve-seen-lot-tears-electric-scooter-invasion-generates-safety-n937376", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2491731/180709-bird-scooter-san-francisco-njs-1541_7a7cdcd4c89dfd39b215535d1cd7d841.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T12:29:51Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Brandi Vincent\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After electric scooters suddenly appeared on the streets of Los Angeles about a year ago, Dr. Lisa Dabby began receiving injured riders in the emergency room of UCLA\u2019s Nethercutt Emergency Center.\n\n\u201cSince scooters launched in Santa Monica, I\u2019ve seen a large number of people who\u2019ve lost their teeth, who come in with broken bones, head injuries, skull and facial fractures,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen a lot of tears, because it\u2019s a really big deal to need surgery or new teeth.\u201d\n\nThe sudden rise of scooter startups in cities across the U.S. has fueled optimism for a future of urban transportation with easier commutes and fewer cars. Last month, Bird, one of the biggest of the scooter startups, said it had already surpassed 10 million rides, and Lime, a rival to Bird, claimed more than 11.5 million rides on its shared bikes and scooters.\n\nBut widespread adoption and few regulations have left scooter startups as well as hospitals and city governments to grapple with questions about safety \u2014 particularly the use of helmets. So far this year, at least two people have died as a result of injuries they sustained while riding scooters from the new rental companies.\n\nThe scooters, which can be unlocked through a smartphone app and then left anywhere, can go up to 15 miles per hour and operate in 10 countries and more than 125 U.S. cities. Users must accept lengthy terms of service agreements that exempt scooter companies from legal liability if riders are hurt using them.\n\nThere is also no national database tracking all scooter-related injuries, making it difficult to measure the total harm that\u2019s occurred, though some initial research around scooter safety found relatively low injury rates.\n\nDabby and her team at the UCLA Medical Center have started keeping their own records to share with city officials, as has the Santa Monica fire department.\n\n\u201cWe needed to start tracking these injuries because there was just so many coming in,\u201d Dabby said.\n\nA quick Twitter search turns up no shortage of riders documenting their injuries.\n\nHighway to helmet\n\nCounting patients who were hurt from crashing on scooters \u2014 as well as those who were crashed into by people on scooters \u2014 Dabby\u2019s team recorded more than 200 scooter-related injuries since the beginning of June. She said in the summer months they were seeing up to seven scooter-related patients a day. And while she says the numbers slowly dropped as summer ended, the main issue comes down to the lack of helmet use.\n\n\u201cNot one of the patients I\u2019ve seen in the ER after a scooter accident was wearing a helmet,\u201d Dabby said. \u201cI always ask.\u201d\n\nDr. Oscar Guillamondegui, medical director of the trauma intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the lack of helmet use by scooter riders has led to serious injuries, including facial fractures and traumatic brain injuries.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is that every injury would be avoided by wearing a helmet,\u201d Guillamondegui said.\n\nDoctors aren\u2019t the only profession seeing an uptick in interest from scooter injuries. Lawyers are also seeing opportunities to represent hurt riders. A group of eight people recently filed a class-action lawsuit, accusing the scooter companies of \u201cgross negligence,\u201d and billboards from lawyers looking to represent injured riders are starting to pop up.\n\nPeople are having accidents on electric scooters, lawyers are ready to sue! Saw this billboard in downtown Austin! https://t.co/tPLKkdCXGD pic.twitter.com/lh94NKC24R \u2014 Neville Medhora (@nevmed) November 6, 2018\n\nScooter startups have launched safety campaigns in an effort to get people to begin following their rules and wearing helmets while also arguing that focusing on scooter safety misses the broader impact of reducing reliance on automobiles.\n\n\u201cThe true danger on our roads is cars,\u201d a Bird spokesperson said. \u201cThe fewer cars on the road, the safer our city streets become.\u201d\n\nRules of the road\n\nWith scooters now littering some of their cities, local officials said they have been performing something of a balancing act \u2014 creating new regulations to make riders safer while still attracting startups they see as the future of urban transportation.\n\nJon Larsen, director of Salt Lake City\u2019s transportation division, said his team has been working closely with scooter vendors to raise awareness and promote safety. Last month, city staff joined representatives from Lime and Bird on downtown sidewalks to pass out helmets and safety leaflets.\n\n\u201cWe have actually been pushing the vendors pretty hard to really emphasize safety because it\u2019s in their best interests, as well,\u201d Larsen said.\n\nIn September, ER doctors in Salt Lake City reported a 161 percent increase in scooter-related injuries. Still, Larsen said scooters have already done more good than harm by spurring important conversations and adding a new level of urgency to complete the city\u2019s planned bike network.\n\n\u201cYou can just feel that momentum building for new ways of getting around and kind of re-thinking how the system works,\u201d Larsen said.\n\nLarsen said that his team definitely encourages people to wear helmets, but he isn\u2019t convinced mandatory helmet laws are the best route. He said one concern is whether it would be worth it to allocate resources towards enforcing helmet laws when police are \u201calready stretched thin.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, we\u2019re treating scooters similar to bikes, but that may be something we\u2019ll have to reevaluate in the coming months and years,\u201d he said.\n\nTariq Bokhari, a city council member in Charlotte, North Carolina, said he felt cities were limited in what kind of regulations they could introduce, even after witnessing a serious scooter injury himself.\n\n\u201cI realized I could no more prevent that from happening than I could prevent somebody from looking at their phone while walking into a crosswalk into traffic,\u201d Bokhari said.\n\nHe said that with 800 scooters deployed in Charlotte, on average each is ridden about six times a day, which to him, indicates the city\u2019s market can actually handle even more scooters.\n\n\u201cThe cities that are creating the best and most innovative environments for these types of alternative mobility companies to thrive, that\u2019s where they are going to set up shop and really pilot some incredible new technology,\u201d Bokhari said.\n\nBokhari said Charlotte has yet to finalize its position on helmet safety regulations, but for him, the decision comes down to implementing laws that are actually enforceable \u2014 and laws that are in line with those that already exist for cyclists in the city.\n\n\u201cUs asking our police officers to pull over and ticket anyone without a helmet, it\u2019s just not a good use of their time,\u201d he said.\n\nSafety first\n\nThe scooter companies have also launched safety campaigns just as some cities have placed temporary bans on the devices as they determine how to regulate them.\n\nIn November, Lime announced its \u201cRespect the Ride\u201d campaign, in which the company said it\u2019s investing more than $3 million \u201cto empower people to exhibit safe and responsible riding behaviors.\u201d\n\nTaylor Bennett, Lime\u2019s director of public affairs, also said that the company is organizing a first-of-its-kind safety summit, \u201cbringing together experts, thought leaders and stakeholders throughout the industry for a constructive conversation around the safety implications of shared mobility.\u201d\n\nPerson at work: \"Friend of mine got hurt on one of those e-scooters\"\n\n\n\nMe: \"Oh yeah? What happened?\"\n\n\n\nThem: \"Car ran a 4-way stop and he crashed the scooter into a parked car trying to not get ran over. Those things are so dangerous\"\n\n\n\nMe: \"Scooter or cars?\"\n\n\n\nThem: \"Scooters\"\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd2c \u2014 \u26d1\ufe0fCar Helmets\u26d1\ufe0f (@CarHelmets) September 9, 2018\n\nA spokesperson from Bird said safety is a top priority and that the company has given away more than 50,000 helmets. It also established a safety advisory board in August. And last week, the company introduced a new \u201cCommunity Mode\u201d feature, which allows anyone with the app to report damaged devices or irresponsible parking that may pose a danger.\n\nBut Bird also sponsored a bill in California that reversed the original helmet requirement for people over the age of 18. Bird\u2019s newly-introduced legislation permits non-minors to legally ride scooters without wearing helmets, consistent with rules already in place for cyclists. Governor Jerry Brown signed off on the new law in late September.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this legislative process will not change Bird's ongoing efforts to promote the safe riding of our vehicles,\u201d a company spokesperson said. \u201cWe strongly encourage all riders to wear helmets.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ousted Sri Lankan Prime Minister's party asks Facebook to protect its supporters", "description": "The ousted Sri Lankan prime minister's party urged Facebook to safeguard the identity of its supporters on the social media platform, fearing information sharing with what it calls the country's \"illegal\" government can lead to a crackdown against the users.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ousted-sri-lankan-prime-minister-s-party-asks-facebook-protect-n937641", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2650586/afp_1av1vk_1_3192ff539f0df71d14a69f9710be7380.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T12:14:14Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Very, very bad situation... It should have never happened.\"\n\nAsked if the CIA had assessed whether the crown prince \u2014 Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler \u2014 was behind the killing, Trump said, \"They have not assessed anything yet. It's too early. That was a very premature report.\"\n\nThe president added that the report coming early next week is expected to shed more light on \"what we think the overall impact was, who caused it and who did it.\"\n\n\u201cIn the meantime,\" Trump continued, \"we are doing things to some people that we know for a fact were involved and we\u2019re being very tough on a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. announced sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials over Khashoggi's killing on Thursday.\n\nThe State Department on Saturday also said the U.S. government has not made a final conclusion on who was involved in the killing.\n\n\u201cRecent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. \u201cThere remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \"We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable who planned, led and were connected to the murder. And, we will do that while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nKhashoggi's killing resulted in worldwide criticism and condemnation of the kingdom, presenting Trump with a difficult dilemma \u2014 ensuring those who are responsible are punished while trying to maintain strong ties with its important trading partner and ally in the Middle East.\n\nTrump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nBefore leaving on his trip to California on Saturday, Trump told reporters Saudi Arabia was \"a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development,\" but the CIA's assessment could add more pressure on Trump to further punish Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing people familiar with the matter, first reported Friday the CIA's assessment of Khashoggi's death, stating that the agency made its conclusion with \"high confidence.\" NBC News was unable to confirm the agency's description of its confidence level.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington said in a statement, \"The claims in this purported assessment are false. We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations.\"\n\nThe Saudis have repeatedly denied that crown prince was in any way involved in Khashoggi's killing, calling the journalist's death a \"rogue operation\" in which individuals exceeded their authority.\n\nNBC News reported previously that the U.S. intelligence community believes it's inconceivable that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could have had no connection to Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nKhashoggi, a U.S. resident from Saudi Arabia, was a Washington Post opinion contributor critical of the crown prince's regime. He was killed after he entered the Saudi consulate in Turkey's capital Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\nTurkish sources have said previously that authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting his murder. Last week, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the recording was given to the United States and a number of other countries. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said earlier this week that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing do not think it implicates the crown prince.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News which aired on Sunday, Trump said he had been briefed on the recording but hasn't listened to it.\n\n\"I don't want to hear the tape,\" Trump said. \"It's a suffering tape. I've been briefed on the tape. It was very vicious and terrible.\"\n\nThe sanctions the U.S. announced on Thursday came shortly after Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor recommended the death penalty for five suspects in the murder of the former regime insider. Twenty-one suspects had been arrested in connection with the case, of which 11 were charged with his killing.\n\nAccording to the prosecutor, a plot to kill Khashoggi was hatched on Sept. 29 \u2014 three days before the journalist\u2019s disappearance \u2014 for the team to kill Khashoggi if negotiators failed to persuade him to return home.\n\nThe prosecutor said the loyalist-turned-dissident was killed by a lethal injection of narcotics.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 An acrimonious meeting of world leaders in Papua New Guinea failed to agree Sunday on a final communique, highlighting widening divisions between global powers the U.S. and China.\n\nThe 21 nations at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Port Moresby struggled to bridge differences on the role of the World Trade Organization, which governs international trade. A statement was to be issued instead by the meeting's chair, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill.\n\n\"The entire world is worried\" about tensions between China and the U.S., O'Neill told a mob of reporters that descended on him after he confirmed there was no communique from leaders.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were differences between several nations, including China and the U.S.\n\nVice President Mike Pence speaks to the media while standing next to a traditional mask display, at the end of meetings at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit on Sunday. SAEED KHAN / AFP - Getty Images\n\nDraft versions of the communique seen by The Associated Press showed the U.S wanted strong language against unfair trade practices that it accuses of China. China, meanwhile, wanted a reaffirmation of opposition to protectionism and unilateralism it says the U.S. is engaging in.\n\n\"I don't think it will come as a huge surprise that there are differing visions on particular elements in regard to trade and those prevented there from being a full consensus on the communique,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThe two-day summit was punctuated by acrimony and underlined a rising rivalry between China and the West for influence in the usually neglected South Pacific. China is a relative newcomer to providing aid, and its loan-heavy, no-strings attached approach has unsettled Western nations that have been the mainstay donors to developing nations and often use aid to nudge nations towards reforms.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping traded barbs in speeches on Saturday.\n\nPence professed respect for Xi and China but also harshly criticized the world's No. 2 economy for intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and unfair trading practices.\n\nThe U.S. has this year imposed additional tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and Beijing has retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. products.\n\nThe world, according to Xi's speech, is facing a choice between cooperation and confrontation as protectionism and unilateralism grows. He said the rules of global institutions set up after World War II such as the World Trade Organisation should not be bent for selfish agendas.\n\nPence told reporters that during the weekend he had two \"candid\" conversations with Xi, who is expected to meet President Donald Trump at a Group of 20 summit at the end of this month in Buenos Aires.\n\n\"There are differences today. They begin with trade practices, with tariffs and quotas, forced technology transfers, the theft of intellectual property. It goes beyond that to freedom of navigation in the seas, concerns about human rights,\" Pence said.\n\nThe U.S. is interested in a better relationship \"but there has to be change\" from China's side, Pence said he told Xi, who responded that dialogue is important.\n\nChina's foreign ministry rejected the U.S. criticism that it was leading other developing nations into debt bondage.\n\n\"The assistance provided by China has been warmly welcomed by our partners in this region and beyond,\" Wang Xiaolong, a foreign ministry official, told a news conference.\n\n\"No country either in this region or in other regions has fallen into a so called debt trap because of its cooperation with China. Give me one example,\" he said.\n\nIn Port Moresby, the impact of China's aid and loans is highly visible. But the U.S. and allies are countering with efforts to finance infrastructure in Papua New Guinea and other island states. The U.S. has also said it will be involved in ally Australia's plan to develop a naval base with Papua New Guinea.\n\nOn Sunday, the U.S., New Zealand, Japan and Australia said they'd work with Papua New Guinea's government to bring electricity to 70 percent of its people by 2030. Less than 20 percent have a reliable electricity supply.\n\n\"The commitment of the United States of America to this region of the world has never been stronger,\" Pence said at a signing ceremony. A separate statement from his office said other countries are welcome to join the electrification initiative provided they support the U.S. vision of a free and open Pacific.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has promised $4 billion of finance to build the the first national road network in Papua New Guinea, among the least urbanized countries in the world."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Phil Helsel", "title": "'SNL' parodies Fox News trying to explain away blue midterm wave", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" used a parody of Fox News programming to poke fun at attempts to claim conspiracies in the midterm elections in which Democrats took control of the House.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/saturday-night-live-parodies-fox-news-trying-explain-away-blue-n937596", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2650521/snl_f3089e5c8d2d829cd51e64e7d17fae61.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T05:59:05Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He summarizes Tijuana\u2019s response: \u201cThe United States couldn\u2019t do anything for them, but we did.\u201d\n\nMexico has long been a welcoming crossroads of the Americas with Tijuana its northern beacon. But this time, with an estimated 10,000 Central American migrants aiming to cross the U.S. border, good will is fading and hostility is growing.\n\nWorkers reinforce the security on the US side of the border fence with Mexico, as seen from Playas de Tijuana, Mexico, on November 15, 2018. Pedro Pardo / AFP - Getty Images\n\nTijuana\u2019s conservative mayor, Juan Manuel Gastelum, has complained bitterly about the influx, local news outlets have asked who organized the caravan and social media platforms have spread stories of Central Americans using drugs.\n\n\u201cHuman rights should be reserved for righteous humans,\u201d Gastelum said last week.\n\nLike many places in the world, Tijuana has been infatuated with the kind of neo-nationalism embraced by President Donald Trump, and some political leaders are all too willing to tap it for headlines, Meade said.\n\n\u201cTrump has infected the mayor of Tijuana,\u201d said Enrique Morones, founder of Border Angels, a pro-migrant group with members in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nLast Wednesday, not-in-my-backyard residents in the upper-middle-class Playas de Tijuana neighborhood, where some migrants are staying, clashed physically with some of the newcomers.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of expressions of xenophobia against them,\u201d said Victor Clark-Alfaro, a professor of Latin American studies at San Diego State University who lives in Tijuana.\" There\u2019s a division in our society because there are more people who residents don\u2019t want to be here.\"\n\nProtesters rallied Sunday at the monument to Aztec ruler Cuauht\u00e9moc in the city\u2019s Zona Rio shopping and nightlife district against the estimated 2,600 migrants in Tijuana\n\nAt a news conference Saturday outside Border Angels' migrant shelter right on the beach, the group\u2019s president emeritus, Sara Gurling, called the mayor\u2019s quip on human rights \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople of good conscience need to be calling on this mayor to stop these words,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s calling on the worst of the human spirit to rise up against the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nMigrants, part of a caravan of thousands traveling from Central America en route to the United States, stand in a line to receive cups of coffee in a makeshift camp at a gas station where the migrants wait for buses which take them to the Mexican border city of Tijuana, in Navojoa, Mexico November 16, 2018. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters\n\nBut the mayor found an issue that resonates. He has generated headlines in the United States, where the conservative Daily Caller noted that Gastelum describes the Central American migrants as an unwelcome \u201chorde.\u201d\n\nSantiago Alvarado, 29, watched the pro-migrant news conference with skepticism.\n\n\u201cPeople are afraid to come here,\u201d he said, surveying a beach divided by bollards that mark the border. Alvarado said the caravan was filled with \"mara salvatruchas\" \u2014 MS-13 gang members, a claim discounted by those traveling with the migrants.\n\nHe echoed another claim among some of the migrants\u2019 critics in Tijuana: \u201cThey\u2019re not thankful for what people have done for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country is not yours,\u201d he said.\n\nMeade of the Trans-Border Institute said that while local and state governments might not have the resources to help the migrants, it won\u2019t likely become a humanitarian crisis in Tijuana, as some have predicted.\n\nHe said there are thousands of job openings, particularly in the manufacturing and construction industries, in Tijuana, a metro area with up to 2 million residents.\n\n\u201cAnyone can work in Tijuana right now,\u201d he said.\n\nSome in Playas de Tijuana are upset because the caravan inspired Trump to harden border crossings by closing lanes at the Southwest ports of entry, making life miserable for an estimated 30,000 Tijuana residents who work in the United States.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Tijuana,\u201d said resident Marco-Antonio Gonzalez, 47, who said his two sons were living in the United States as citizens. \u201cThe way this [caravan] was done was disrespectful. They cause trouble. We don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s seen migrants toss unwanted food and discard donated clothing that\u2019s not brand-name.\n\n\u201cYou have to be humble,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nMembers of the U.S. military install multiple tiers of concertina wire along the banks of the Rio Grande near the Juarez-Lincoln Bridge at the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas on Nov. 16, 2018.

He emphasized he was thankful even though he\u2019s faced \u201ca lot of criticism\u201d here.\n\n\u201cYo soy muy agradecido,\u201d he said \u2014 \"I am very grateful.\"\n\nAs migrants set up tents at a local sports park and others stayed in churches and the half-dozen shelters in the area, Border Angels\u2019 leader in Tijuana, Hugo Castro, said, \u201cThere\u2019s an environment of fear.\u201d\n\nThe travelers have been on foot for weeks, sometimes for 12 or more hours a day, he said, and that might mean they don't appear to be enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cThey are very tired,\u201d Castro said.\n\nOn the beach, families frolicked in the water.

He was hoping to apply for asylum in the U.S.\n\nAsked if it was true that migrants were doing drugs and displaying ungrateful attitudes, Lagos, who appeared to be exhausted as he slumped on the beach, surrounded by the curious, shrugged.\n\n\u201cI just got here,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the migrants will be granted asylum, experts say, but those who make it to the border crossing will be greeted with a sculpture, modeled after Philadelphia\u2019s Robert Indiana LOVE sculpture.

Four of the remains were discovered in homes in Paradise, and one was found outside of a structure in Concow.\n\nIn Southern California, three people have been killed in another wildfire, bringing the deaths from the two fires statewide to at least 79.\n\nThe number of names on a list of people unaccounted for in the wake of the Camp Fire grew to 1,276, up from 1,011 on Friday, but Honea said some of those reports may be duplicates or people who survived but who have not looked at the list or notified authorities.

Another 7,000 are not far behind.\n\nThe tents in Mapa Park were given to families by organizers from a nearby shelter, Juventud 2000, after it reached capacity and they had nowhere else to send people because all the other shelters also were full.\n\nDown the street, authorities opened Benito Juarez Sports Center to the migrants, who are camping on the baseball field and a concrete playground. Families have set up tents on any spare patch of land they can find.\n\nPeople watch a fireworks display in July through the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Tijuana, Mexico.
