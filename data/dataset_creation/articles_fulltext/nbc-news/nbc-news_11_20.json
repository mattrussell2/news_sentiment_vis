N\u2026 [+2318 chars]", "fulltext": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Leigh Ann Caldwell\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The only potential Democratic challenger to publicly consider challenging Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for speaker of the House on Tuesday threw her weight instead behind the California congresswoman.\n\nAs Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio announced her decision as Pelosi announced she would reinstate a subcommittee on elections, naming Fudge chair of that panel.\n\nFudge said in a statement Pelosi had guaranteed her that black women, a loyal Democratic constituency, would be at \u201cthe decision-making table\u201d and that as chair of the new subcommittee, she will be able to work to uphold the Voting Rights Act.\n\nFudge\u2019s decision perhaps makes Pelosi\u2019s path to the speakership easier, dealing a blow to efforts to topple the leader who has served as top House Democrat since 2002.\n\n\"My consideration (to challenge Pelosi) was due in large part to the lack of sustained efforts that ensure diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the House. Further, despite the great success we experienced on November 6, voter protection and voter integrity are still at risk,\u201d Fudge said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI am now confident that we will move forward together and that the 117th Congress will be a Congress of which we can all be proud. I now join my colleagues in support of the leadership team of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn,\" she added.\n\nFudge and Pelosi met last week, with Fudge saying after that meeting that she would take some time to determine if she wanted to challenge Pelosi.\n\nSixteen Democrats signed a letter that was released Monday saying they would not vote for Pelosi as speaker. Fudge did not sign that letter. No other candidate has come forward to challenge Pelosi.\n\nThe sixteen Democrats still pose a numeric challenge for Pelosi, who can only afford to lose the support of about 15 Democrats while retaining hopes of winning the speakership. Opponents are holding on to hope a new challenger steps up.\n\nBut in another boon to Pelosi, former President Barack Obama said in an interview on Tuesday that Pelosi will be considered among \"the most effective legislative leaders that this country\u2019s ever seen.\"\n\n\"Her skill, tenacity, toughness, vision is remarkable. Her stamina, her ability to see around corners, her ability to stand her ground and do hard things,\" he said in an interview in a podcast \"The Axe Files,\" hosted by his former campaign manager David Axelrod. \"And to suffer unpopularity to get the right thing done, I think, stands up against any person that I\u2019ve observed or worked directly with in Washington during my lifetime.\"\n\nThe House Administration Subcommittee on Elections has oversight of the country\u2019s voting laws and the country\u2019s election agencies, including the Federal Election Commission. Pelosi said Republicans eliminated the subcommittee in 2013.\n\n\u201cChairwoman Fudge will play a critical role in our Democratic Majority\u2019s efforts to ensure access to the ballot box for all Americans,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement on the new committee and Fudge\u2019s new role.\n\n\u201cAnd sadly, the appalling conduct we have witnessed in Florida, Georgia and too many other places during this election have once again underscored the absolute necessity of this subcommittee\u2019s establishment in the first place: to combat brazenly partisan efforts to turn back the clock and erect barriers to voting for historically disenfranchised communities.\u201d\n\nPelosi spent much of Thursday and Friday of last week holding individual meetings with new members. She has also met with groups of Democrats as part of her outreach efforts, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, and members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\n\"I've been very vocal about the need for leadership change. It's nothing personal on any of the leaders that we have, they've been great, but they've been there for 16 years and it's time for a new generation of leaders to take over,\u201d Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., who organized the letter, said last week. \u201cThe first thing is that we have to show is that the leader cannot get to 218, which she won't be able to.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted over the weekend that Pelosi \"deserves\" to be speaker, adding that he \"can get as many votes as she wants.\" He tagged Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., the Republican leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, who indicated he would consider voting for Pelosi for speaker if she agreed to rule changes that would dilute power from leadership."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Dow plunges 552 points, Nasdaq off five percent", "description": "The White House is dismissing talk of a potential economic slowdown despite the stock market slide, with President Trump saying today: \u201dOur unemployment is at an all-time low.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Phil Helsel\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Tuesday in part blamed \"radical environmental groups\" for contributing to wildfire conditions.\n\nZinke, in a conference call on Tuesday, said \"every time there is a thinning project out, who's suing?\" when he was asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s much-derided tweets and comments about \"forest management\" made as the deadly Camp and Woolsey fires raged and during a visit to the state last weekend.\n\n\"When lawsuit after lawsuit by, yes, the radical environmental groups that would rather burn down the entire forest than, than cut a single tree or thin the forest,\" Zinke told reporters. \"And it's easy to find who, who is suing, and who promulgates these destructive policies.\"\n\nHis comments came as as firefighters were making progress in battling two major wildfires in California, one of which is the deadliest in recorded state history with at least 79 dead.\n\nTrump first made comments about poor \"forest management\" on Twitter on Nov. 10 as the Camp Fire in Butte County in Northern California and two fires near Los Angeles raged. California firefighter's groups and scientists quickly criticized the characterization as wrong.\n\nSome noted that the fires in Southern California were not in logged areas, but rather in areas full of shrubs and human-made structures.\n\n\"It's not about forest management,\" University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison said last week. \"These aren't forests.\n\nBut after the secretary's comments on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the Department of Interior, Heather Swift, said Zinke was speaking about the larger national issue of environmental groups suing over timber management and prescribed burn projects \u2014 not necessarily the two fires currently burning in the West.\n\nShe said \"that is not a California-only problem, we have seen this over and over again across the West,\" and highlighted objections to timber sales in Oregon.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke visits the decimated Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills, California, on Nov. 15, 2018. The landmark film location was burned to the ground by the Woolsey Fire. Jae C. Hong / AP file\n\nZinke has cast blame on environmental groups for creating fire-prone conditions before. He did so in August, and there was substantial blowback from environmental groups, one of which said the interior secretary lacked knowledge of \"basic fire science.\"\n\nZinke said in Tuesday's call that \"I don\u2019t want to finger point,\" and \"there's a lot of variables in this.\"\n\n\"And yes, the season is getting longer, the temperatures are getting hotter, we've had a drought condition and historic drought condition in California,\" Zinke said. \"The dead and dying trees from beetle kills, the density of trees, the amount of underbrush. And, and those things can be mitigated, but we have to work together.\"\n\nThe questions on Tuesday were following up on comments Zinke made about environmental groups in an interview with Breitbart on Sunday, in which he talked about a recent visit to the California fire zones.\n\n\"It's not time for finger pointing. We know the problem, it's been years of neglect, and in many cases it's been these radical environmentalists that want nature to take its course,\" Zinke said on the Breitbart radio program.\n\nThe Sierra Club, one of the nation\u2019s largest and oldest environmental organizations, said in a statement on Monday that Zinke was seeking to blame environmental groups for the devastating Camp and Woolsey fires, and said the interior secretary \"still doesn't understand wildfires.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Trump reportedly asked DOJ to prosecute Hillary Clinton, James Comey", "description": "An explosive new report by the New York Times claims that the White House counsel told President Trump he had no authority to order that Clinton and Comey be prosecuted, and that such a move could put him at risk of impeachment.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/trump-reportedly-asked-doj-to-prosecute-hillary-clinton-james-comey-1376329283692", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/nn_kwe_trump_comey_clinton_181120_1542758734916.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:37:40Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Trump reportedly asked DOJ to prosecute Hillary Clinton, James Comey copied!\n\nAn explosive new report by the New York Times claims that the White House counsel told President Trump he had no authority to order that Clinton and Comey be prosecuted, and that such a move could put him at risk of impeachment.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Sec.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Brandy Zadrozny and Corky Siemaszko\n\n\"The Proud Boys\" \u2014 a combative, far-right group of self-described \"western chauvinists\" \u2014 have been branded an \"extremist group with ties to white nationalism\" by the FBI, according to internal law enforcement documents, which also note they've spawned a sinister sister organization called \"The Proud Boys' Girls.\"\n\nThe new federal designation was revealed in an internal affairs report by a sheriff\u2019s department in Washington state, which was obtained by a watchdog group called Property of the People.\n\n\u201cThe FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses,\u201d the report, dated July 5, states.\n\nThe Proud Boys have became known for their unapologetic misogyny, opposition to Muslims, and violent street brawls with so-called anti-fascist groups that made headlines.\n\nWhile group founder Gavin McInnes \u2014 who also co-founded the now-mainstream Vice Media \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment on the FBI's move, the Proud Boys have long denied any connection to the racist elements of the alt-right, and maintain they are a fraternal group opposed to political correctness and are open to \"all races, religions and sexual preferences.\"\n\nThe FBI said in a statement distributed by spokeswoman Kelsey Pietranton that it does not \"police ideology.\"\n\n\"Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security,\" the FBI statement said. \"When it comes to domestic terrorism, our investigations focus solely on criminal activity of individuals \u2014 regardless of group membership \u2014 which appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion.\"\n\nIn the report, the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office detailed that it had fired a deputy named Erin Willey on July 17 for failing to disclose that she was member of the Proud Boys' Girls.\n\n\"The Proud Boy (sic) Girls are believed to be an affiliate group of women who openly support the ideology of the Proud Boys,\" the report states. \u201cThe FBI Seattle office is unsure of how many female members are active in the Pacific Northwest.\u201d\n\nThe Proud Boys\u2019 Girls group, which was founded in 2016, is mentioned on the Proud Boys website and, until recently, had a dedicated Facebook page with 3,200 likes.\n\nAnd the Proud Boys even admit on their site that \u201cit may seem counterintuitive that a men-only group would have such a big female following.\"\n\nThat admission follows with a testimonial from purported PBG member identified on the site as Gabriela Finch who claims \"Proud Boys saved my marriage.\"\n\n\"I was completely done with it, but he won me back and fought hard for it,\" said Finch, who NBC News has been trying to locate for comment.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said the FBI designation does not come as a surprise to them.\n\n\"Their disavowals of bigotry are belied by their actions,\" the SPLC states on their website. \"Rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists.\"\n\nMcInnes himself has ties to the racist right, the SPLC maintains.\n\nBut the phenomenon of the Proud Boys' Girls is apparently so new there is no mention of the sorority on the SPLC's description of the Proud Boys.\n\n\"We honestly don\u2019t know a whole lot about them,\" SPLC research analyst Keegan Hankes told NBC News on Tuesday.\n\nWilley, 26, was a cadet with the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, from 2012 to 2014 and a probationary deputy from June 2017 until she was fired in July, according to the department.\n\nWriting in the report, Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Commander Michael McCabe said the department had no inkling Willey was involved with the group until The Columbian newspaper in Vancouver reached out for the ex-deputy\u2019s work history.\n\nThe department later learned the newspaper had gotten a photo of Willey wearing \u201cProud Boy Girls\u2019 apparel,\u201d most likely from a spurned boyfriend identified in the report as Graham Jorgensen.\n\nUnder questioning, Willey admitted she videotaped Jorgensen being pummeled as part of his initiation into the Proud Boys. But investigators \"found no direct link to Erin actively participating \u2014 on or off-duty \u2014in any overt forms of hate speech or discrimination, beyond wearing and selling their merchandise.\"\n\n\u201cErin Willey comes across as a tolerant person and someone who would not promote hate speech,\u201d the report states.\n\nStill, Willey acknowledged that she did not disclose that she was a member of Proud Boys\u2019 Girls when she was hired as a deputy sheriff.\n\n\"Erin either knew or should have known that any affiliation with and promotion of the group Proud Boys and Proud Boy (sic) Girls would be prohibited by the Sheriff\u2019s Office,\" the report states.\n\nReached by telephone, Willey said, \"If you have any questions about this you can talk to my attorney.\" She then hung up without giving the name or number of her lawyer."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Brooke Sopelsa", "title": "Fundraiser for NCAA athlete disowned by family surpasses $100,000", "description": "\u201cI never expected this amount of support,\u201d said Division I athlete Emily Scheck, who was disowned by her family due to her sexuality.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/fundraiser-ncaa-athlete-disowned-family-surpasses-100-000-n938686", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2653616/181120-emily-scheck-cs-453p_34d525fcd518aa8e191ff7f30b2ac87c.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:39:00Z", "content": "Nov. 20, 2018 / 10:39 PM GMT A GoFundMe campaign to support college athlete Emily Scheck, who was disowned by her family after they discovered she has a girlfriend, surpassed $100,000 on Tuesday well over the initial $5,000 goal.

She is accused of making two false and misleading statements \u2014 that she was unaware of the nature of a sexual misconduct complaint that sparked the school's 2014 Title IX probe of Nassar, and that she only knew a sports medicine doctor, not Nassar himself, was under investigation at that time.\n\nIf convicted of two felony and two misdemeanor counts of lying to a peace officer, the 71-year-old Simon faces up to four years in prison. The Mason resident is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday in Eaton County near Lansing.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message seeking comment from Simon's attorney, Lee Silver. University spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said Simon \u2014 who remains on faculty despite resigning as president \u2014 is taking an immediate leave of absence, without pay \"to focus on her legal situation.\"\n\nSimon is the fifth person to be criminally charged in the wake of Nassar's convictions for molesting young female athletes under the guise of treatment. Numerous other people have lost their jobs or have been sued.\n\nIn August, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette charged former MSU gymnastics head coach Kathie Klages with lying to an investigator when she denied that witnesses told her years ago about being sexually assaulted by Nassar. In March, the ex-dean of the osteopathic medicine school, William Strampel, was charged with neglecting his duty to enforce examining-room restrictions imposed on Nassar after the 2014 Title IX investigation.\n\nThat probe, initiated by a patient, resulted in the school clearing Nassar.\n\nIn Texas, former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny was charged last month with tampering with evidence while a former sports medicine trainer, Debra Van Horn, was charged in June with \"acting as a party\" with Nassar in the sexual assault of a child.\n\nHundreds of girls and women have said Nassar molested them when he was a physician, including while he worked at Michigan State and Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics, which trains U.S. Olympians. Nassar, 55, last year pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting nine victims and possessing child pornography, and his sentences equate to life in prison."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Allan Smith", "title": "Trump submits written answers to Robert Mueller's questions", "description": "President Donald Trump's legal team submitted the written answers on Tuesday.

But having a strategy to avoid it could tip the scales in your favor \u2014 not just come the new year, but over the course of your life. Here\u2019s why: On average, we pack on around 1 to 2 pounds during the holiday season and while that sounds like no big deal, studies suggest we don\u2019t take it off. Ever. That means we enter each year a couple of pounds heavier \u2014 which can add up over the decades.\n\nAnd if you enter the holiday season already overweight, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll gain even more, say researchers who've investigated the matter. But as they say, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure so here are some expert-backed pointers for avoiding the typical holiday weight gain.\n\nKeep moving. When holiday activities ramp up and we\u2019re gearing up for some out of office time, workouts are one of the first things to slip. But even if you don\u2019t have time for an hour-long spin class or your typical yoga session, put in what you can. Exercise has a number of mental and physical benefits, and the science suggests it can counter some of the metabolic effects of overeating, even if it doesn\u2019t wash out all those extra calories you\u2019re consuming. Resist the all-or-nothing mentality when it comes to workouts and do what you can when you can \u2014 even if that\u2019s just a quick routine in your living room. It may be especially helpful to enlist a friend. One study found that doing so led to increased activity, particularly if the workout partner provided encouragement and support. So grab a pal and go for a quick walk or make a weekly date to attend a group class. If you can\u2019t meet up in person, have a virtual check in to encourage each other to keep moving.\n\nBe picky about splurges. Chances are, you don\u2019t love all holiday food equally so consider which ones are worth it to you and which ones you can live without (or at least, live with just a little bit). In other words, it\u2019s fine to have a food thrill or two so between the mashed potatoes, the stuffing, the pies, fruitcake, eggnog, gingerbread cookies and other holiday fare, but decide which ones deserve a spot on your plate and enjoy them mindfully. Don\u2019t reserve an equal spot for the stuff that doesn\u2019t totally wow you. If the stuffing is your thing, have a spoonful, but if you\u2019re not all about apple pie, you might want to skip that or just have a bite or two.\n\nDon\u2019t save your calories. It\u2019s common to try to eat lightly in an effort to save calories for the holiday meal, but this plan can backfire quickly because when you\u2019re beyond hungry, it\u2019s hard to stay in control of your food choices. (Real talk: When you enter a party starving, do you make a bee line for the crudit\u00e9? I don\u2019t!) Instead of eating ultra-lightly or even fasting, try having a late but satisfying breakfast or brunch. Since holiday meals tend to be on the early side, you may not need to eat on your normal schedule so a meaningful brunch might be enough to keep you content and energized until you hit the main affair. Your non-holiday meal should include the winning combo of protein and fiber \u2014 the nutrient duo that helps tame hunger. Some examples: A yogurt parfait or smoothie made with Greek yogurt, berries and a portion of nuts or nut butter; a salad made with greens, leftover roasted veggies, canned tuna, and a drizzle of dressing; a grain bowl with the grain and veggie portions reversed (to boost your veggie intake) made with chicken or turkey. This format keeps things light but filling so you can stay in control of your holiday choices. It\u2019s also a good structure for meals on your non-party days.\n\nDrink wisely. Alcohol can weaken your inhibitions so while you might have intended to skip the baked brie, a couple of drinks might spur you to change your mind. Beyond that, alcohol can disrupt your sleep (which can impact your appetite and food choices), and leave you with a next day reminder (hello, hangover) that could also sway your food choices. (Have you ever craved leafy greens while hungover?) When possible, stick with the recommended caps of one drink a day for women, two for men, and try to avoid sugary mix-ins, which can worsen the impact of alcohol, among other things.\n\nRemember your hunger/fullness cues. Just as it\u2019s important not to enter a holiday affair starving, it\u2019s also important to stay tuned to when you\u2019re feeling content. Feeling content means you\u2019ve satisfied your physical hunger and you\u2019ve shown your taste buds some love. It\u2019s not just about one or the other; you need to check both boxes to feel a state of contentment. Let\u2019s assume your holiday food is doing its job of keeping your taste buds happy. Now it\u2019s your job to figure out when you\u2019ve had enough to eat. It\u2019s a good idea to check in with yourself about mid-way through your meal to make a mental note of how you\u2019re feeling. Just thinking this through helps you connect to what you\u2019ve eaten and assess what\u2019s left on your plate. And remember, there\u2019s no need to finish what\u2019s on your plate just because it\u2019s there. When you\u2019ve reached a point of contentment, show your body some respect by not pushing it past the point of fullness.\n\nJust as it\u2019s important not to enter a holiday affair starving, it\u2019s also important to stay tuned to when you\u2019re feeling content.

After each party, you have two choices: Continue with the holiday fare or revert to your healthy habits. Having one festive meal is no big deal, but having two, three, four and five can lead to weight gain. I always ask my clients this question: What do you do when your phone screen cracks \u2014handle it gently from then on or throw it across the room and cause more damage? Inevitably, there will be some big meals and indulgent desserts during the holidays but there\u2019s no reason why there can\u2019t be healthy and lighter meals in between.\n\nAfter each party, you have two choices: Continue with the holiday fare or revert to your healthy habits.

I repeat: One meal won\u2019t make much of a difference, but consistently splurging can really add up! A holiday meal is just that \u2014 one meal. Enjoy it, but try to leave the leftovers alone.\n\nWeigh yourself. It\u2019s hard to notice when you\u2019ve gained a pound or two, but your scale can pick up these small gains, which is why weight monitoring can be such an effective way to prevent weight gain. In one new study among more than 1,000 adults, daily weigh-ins over the course of a year led to small, but significant weight loss, even though participants weren\u2019t instructed to lose weight. Another study among college freshman found that routinely hopping on the scale wasn\u2019t linked with any difference in mood, body dissatisfaction or unhealthy weight control behaviors (like excessive exercise or food restriction). Certainly, If the scale produces anxiety, makes you question your worth or causes any disturbances to your emotional well-being, it\u2019s not the right tool for you. But if you can look at the numbers without judgment, the scale can provide useful feedback and help prevent weight gain.\n\nKeep calm. The holidays can be a stressful time of year. The extra events \u2014 even if fun \u2014 can put a strain on your schedule that can be overwhelming, and family dynamics might also be challenging. Research suggests that stress can lead to less healthy food choices, and it also impacts hormones that can prompt you to store belly fat. A mindfulness practice can help dial down the stress (and the hormones), and help reduce cravings, according to recent research. Carve out a few minutes to do some deep breathing or a guided meditation to cope with holiday or family stress.\n\nGet sufficient sleep. Insufficient and poor quality sleep really take a toll on your metabolism and health. In one study, sleep deprivation resulted in changes in brain activity up your desire for unhealthy, high calorie food\u2014the type of fare that cause your clothes to feel tight. Researchers speculate that lack of sleep dampens your motivation to stay on track while also amplifying your cravings, making it doubly difficult to eat well. Know when to call it a night and aim for the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each evening.\n\nWHAT A NUTRITIONIST WANTS YOU TO KNOW\n\nWant more tips like these?

Yet earlier this afternoon, President Donald Trump issued a remarkable statement siding with the kingdom over his own intelligence agencies, speculating \"we may never know all the facts\" about the murder, and insisting the United States \u201cintends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Yemen, the Saudi military is perpetrating one of the worst humanitarian crises in our lifetime. As Trump waffles between meek calls for a ceasefire and flattery of our \u201ctruly spectacular ally,\u201d Mohammed reportedly boasted he has Trump\u2019s son-in-law and Middle East advisor \u201cin his pocket.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia, long a problematic U.S. partner, has gone rogue, and Washington\u2019s stubborn support for it is increasingly indefensible.\n\nSaudi Arabia, long a problematic U.S. partner, has gone rogue, and Washington\u2019s stubborn support for it is increasingly indefensible. If the new Democratic majority in Congress wants to hold Trump to account, not to mention stand up for America\u2019s national interests, it could start by ending our support for the murderous regime in Riyadh.\n\nAfter all, some of the bombs being dropped on poor Yemenis \u2014 including on the school bus where 40 children died in August 2018 \u2014 were made in America. So were the planes from which they are being dropped. Any moral leadership the United States can still claim internationally is being squandered by our state sponsorship of a regime which terrorizes its neighbors and wreaks havoc on one of the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nWhen civil war in Yemen broke out in 2015, western aid groups had been improving literacy rates and food security, helping Yemen climb out of poverty. Since then, however, starvation has soared, as have preventable deaths from kidney disease and diabetes, since Saudi blockades make it hard for dialysis and insulin to reach patients. The rate of child marriage for girls has nearly tripled to about 65 percent because, according to one UNICEF official, parents \u201cneed to get rid of girls because they cannot feed them.\u201d This war is Saudi-led but it is U.S.-enabled.\n\nHow did the United States end up in this unholy alliance with Saudi Arabia? Why did Donald Trump make it the site of his first overseas trip as president? When did we start subverting America\u2019s national interests to protect those of this theocratic dictatorship which imprisons its critics, tries to shut down independent media outlets, detains the prime minister of a U.S. ally, and exports a brand of Islamic extremism barely distinguishable from that of ISIS? Why does this cozy relationship persist?\n\nForeign policy experts typically give three main reasons why we continue to boost Saudi Arabia: oil, Iran, and terrorism. None of these holds water. First, thanks to advances in fracking, the U.S. has overtaken Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s top petroleum producer. Fretting about Arab oil embargoes is so last century. Canada now sells us four times more petroleum than Saudi Arabia does. The kingdom has a greater need to export to us than we have to import from it. As renewable energy technologies improve, our independence from Saudi oil should only strengthen.\n\nSecond, some think Iran is poised to dominate the Middle East if the U.S. withdraws military support for Saudi Arabia. They are wrong. As Harvard\u2019s Stephen Walt points out, the defense spending of Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates is, in aggregate, \u201cat least five times greater than Iran\u2019s,\u201d the U.S. would likely support any of these countries if attacked and so the argument that Iran \u201cis on the brink of regional hegemony defies reason.\u201d\n\nFinally, the notion that Saudi Arabia is a bulwark against terrorism seems downright foolish when one considers that 15 of the 19 September 11th hijackers were Saudi citizens, and the lead attorney for the 9/11 plaintiffs claimed there is evidence demonstrating a \u201clongstanding and close relationships between al Qaeda and the religious components of the Saudi government.\u201d Yes, many of the Saudi people are affluent and cosmopolitan, but the Wahhabism proselytized by Saudi clerics has been criticized for exporting extremism. Finally, the specter of American bombs killing civilians in Yemen is only creating new opportunities for anti-American radicalization. So supporting the Saudi-led coalition actually undermines U.S. national security.\n\nThwarted in reclaiming their constitutional power to declare war, the new Congress will still have the opportunity to end U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia through its power of the proverbial purse.\n\nA war powers resolution co-sponsored by Congressman Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Ken Buck, R-Colo., which sought to compel Trump to get Congressional authorization before committing American service members to the war in Yemen, was spiked by a lame duck Congress on Nov. 13. With 14 million souls at the risk of famine, the kingdom\u2019s apologists in Congress decided to abandon their consciences and the prerogatives granted to them by Article I of the Constitution to placate the president and, perhaps, satisfy their own sponsors in the military industrial complex.\n\nThwarted in reclaiming their constitutional power to declare war, the new Congress will still have the opportunity to end U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia through its power of the proverbial purse. Democrats should team up with libertarian-leaning, foreign policy realists in the Republican party to present a bipartisan front against the Trump administration\u2019s reckless support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war.\n\nThere is precedent for doing so. In 1986, Democrats in Congress tried to block President Ronald Reagan from selling Stinger missiles to the Saudis. While they couldn\u2019t muster the veto-proof majority needed to block or amend arms sales, Reagan caved to the public pressure this created and quietly removed the Stingers from the deal. The House of Representatives cannot block treaties, but it can stop appropriations bills from aiding and abetting Saudi. The Trump administration\u2019s complicity will only become a political liability if Congress keeps this issue in the public eye.\n\nWhile ending the catastrophe in Yemen must be the first priority, difficult discussions about America\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia must follow. It is long past time to start rethinking our foreign policy in the Middle East, which is centered around unnecessary and untenable support for one of the world\u2019s most repressive autocracies. The new Congress must put a stop to an alliance that has become a strategic liability and moral catastrophe."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Trump says U.S. stands with Saudi Arabia following Khashoggi murder", "description": "President Donald Trump defended his statement siding with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-says-u-s-stands-with-saudi-arabia-following-khashoggi-murder-1376197699615", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_mo_dc_potusaudiarabia_181120.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:21:34Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Trump says troops will use 'lethal force' at the border 'if they have to' 01:31"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Daniel Barnes", "title": "Trump says Ivanka's personal email use in government not like Clinton's", "description": "\"They weren\u2019t classified like Hillary Clinton.

Officers in West Los Angeles detained him Wednesday while taking an incident report. He was booked but released on $50,000 bond. He maintains his innocence, saying, \"I have done nothing wrong.\"\n\nActress Mareli Miniutti, who filed for a temporary restraining order against Avenatti on Monday, said in the request the she has been living with him since January. She said she and Avenatti got in an argument over money on the evening of Nov. 13 and the lawyer became verbally abusive, calling her an \"ungrateful f****** b****.\"\n\nMiniutti said she retreated to the apartment's guest bedroom, but Avenatti eventually followed her and got \"very close to me in a threatening manner that made me feel afraid.\" He started hitting her with pillows and told her \"Do not disrespect me. You don't get to sleep in my house tonight.\"\n\nHe then grabbed her right wrist and attempted to pull her out of the bed, she said. When she started to text a friend, Avenatti grabbed her cell phone, Miniutti said in the filing for a restraining order.\n\nOnce he was successful in pulling her out of bed, he dragged her through the apartment and into the hallway, she said. But he pulled Miniutti back inside when she started ringing a neighbor\u2019s doorbell.\n\nThe actress said she was wearing underwear and a T-shirt during the altercation and was scratched in the process. Photos she submitted with her request show red marks on her skin.\n\nOnce she pulled on pants and got out of the apartment, Miniutti wrote that Avenatti followed her, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do this ... don\u2019t involve them.\u201d\n\nMiniutti said she went to a friend\u2019s house, and when she noticed the red marks on her body, she called police to report the incident. Avenatti was arrested the next day.\n\n\"I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated,\" Avenatti said in a statement at the time. He has since repeatedly denied the accusations on Twitter, and claims he has surveillance footage that shows he is innocent.\n\nOn Tuesday, he tweeted his request to have the building where the alleged incident happened turn over footage from Nov. 13 and Nov. 14 to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nAvenatti told NBC News Tuesday that he will be proven innocent when all the facts come out.\n\n\"I have not been charged with any crime,\" Avenatti said. \"When all of the facts and evidence, including the security footage, the Instagram posts, and physical evidence is disclosed \u2014 which I desperately want \u2014 I will be proven innocent.

Just before Christmas in 2014, the company surfaced houses on fire and dead relatives for some users in a feature known as Year in Review.\n\nFor many on Twitter, Facebook\u2019s suggested comments feature experiment felt like another failure in automated responses to national tragedies.\n\n\u201cThis wins for most dystopian thing I've seen all day (and I live in the smoke-drenched Bay Area where everyone is wearing masks, so that's saying a lot),\u201d tweeted one user.\n\n\"So glad we've automated the process of having thoughts and feelings about that, because doing it manually was f****** exhausting,\u201d tweeted another.\n\nBut the Facebook experiment may also be a natural next step for automated responses that have become commonplace on social media and personal tech.\n\nGoogle first rolled out its suggested responses for Gmail in May 2017. Called \u201cSmart Reply,\u201d the company touted the feature as a time saver by offering users three responses based off the content received. The system learns from a user\u2019s responses, slowly tailoring itself over time to a person\u2019s linguistic cues.\n\nAfter a two-year rollout, \u201cSmarty Reply\u201d became a default feature from Google last month. Early hiccups (the system used to favor \"I love you,\u201d as a reply to most emails), were tweaked by Google\u2019s developers, and now some 10 percent of Gmail replies contain the suggestions, according the the company.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Google. LinkedIn now offers suggested replies for its InMail; Instagram suggests emojis in the comment field; and Apple has been predicting text replies via its QuickType keyboard since 2014.\n\nSherry Turkle, founding director of MIT\u2019s Initiative on Technology and Self and author of several books including \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s suggested comment feature was the Hallmark card of our times.\n\n\u201cWe expect our technology to give us prepackaged responses to devastation, to carnage, to tragedy. Not just emojis now, but words,\u201d Turkle said, citing the comment feature as well as Facebook\u2019s suggested responses to users\u2019 birthdays and deaths of loved ones.\n\n\u201cDigital technology wants to make the world friction-free,\u201d Turkle said. \u2018But life is full of friction. To just hit the button, or the emoji, starts to make the response friction-free and that\u2019s why it\u2019s disturbing. Not because of the lack of creativity in the words, but because so little is asked of us.

Another problem was that investigators only had partial DNA evidence, Ryan said.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to remember that DNA was not being used in any widespread way in Massachusetts until about 27 years ago,\" Ryan told reporters.\n\nThis police photo shows the outside of Jane Britton's apartment building near Harvard Square shortly after she was found dead in January 1969.

Medical examiners determined that Britton had been raped and struck multiple times by a blunt object after a night out with her boyfriend and friends.\n\nInvestigators now feel confident that Sumpter snuck in through a window and attacked Britton shortly after she came home. Sumpter died about a year after finishing his prison sentence for a 1975 rape. Since his death authorities have tied Sumpter to four other rapes, two of which also resulted in death.\n\nBritton's murder is the oldest cold case the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office has solved to date, according to Ryan."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Tim Fitzsimons", "title": "LGBTQ candidates had 57 percent success rate on Election Day, report finds", "description": "A new report from the LGBTQ Victory Fund breaks down the demographic data and statistics behind the midterm election's \"rainbow wave.\"", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-candidates-had-57-percent-success-rate-election-day-report-n938611", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_45/2637581/181107-main-sharice-davids-jared-polis-angie-craig-election-midterm-cs-302p_61c60843175b1c78028e9ac3f50e050f.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:35:00Z", "content": "The area with perhaps the least candidate diversity was political affiliation.

As a direct response to the outbreaks we have seen, the agency will also begin a special effort to sample and test romaine lettuce for contamination throughout the market.\"\n\nThere's not enough information to identify a specific supplier yet, the FDA said, so it's safest to just thrown out all romaine lettuce for now.\n\nE. coli is a common bacteria but there is a strain called 0157:H7 that can make people sick.

Always happens.\"\n\nCourts in the Ninth Circuit have, at various times, put holds on versions of Trump's travel bans, his effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for individuals brought to the United States without legal status as children, and his push to force tougher immigration enforcement in so-called \"sanctuary\" cities.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Peas and Carrots will travel to the nearby campus of Virginia Tech University where they will live out the rest of their days in \u201cGobbler\u2019s Rest,\u201d an enclosure managed by the university\u2019s Animal and Poultry Sciences Department.\n\n\u201cGobbler's Rest\u201d has housed pardoned turkeys for the past three years, starting with President Barack Obama's final birds, Tater and Tot. The pair was later joined by Trump's first pair of pardons, Drumstick and Wishbone. All four birds have since died.\n\nThe tradition of presidential turkey pardons can be traced back as far as 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln spared a Christmas turkey\u2019s life after a plea from his son Tad, according to the White House Historical Association."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Trump pardons 'Peas' and 'Carrots' the turkeys while joking about subpoenas", "description": "President Trump pardoned 'Peas' and 'Carrots' \u2013 the turkeys  part of this year\u2019s annual tradition \u2013 while joking that House Democrats may issue them subpoenas.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-pardons-peas-and-carrots-the-turkeys-while-joking-about-subpoenas-1376080963943", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_mo_dc_turkeypardon_181120.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:31:54Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Trump pardons 'Peas' and 'Carrots' the turkeys while joking about subpoenas copied!\n\nPresident Trump pardoned 'Peas' and 'Carrots' \u2013 the turkeys part of this year\u2019s annual tradition \u2013 while joking that House Democrats may issue them subpoenas.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Airbnb West Bank decision both condemned and lauded", "description": "Israel\u2019s tourism minister said it was a racist decision, and threatened legal action.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Adam Edelman and F. Brinley Bruton\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in exclamation point-filled formal presidential statement, said Tuesday that his administration would stand by Saudi Arabia's rulers and take no actions against them over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nIn the extraordinary statement, which featured six exclamation points from the president, Trump called the \"crime\" against Khashoggi \"terrible\" and \"one that our country does not condone.\"\n\nBut he again stopped well short of pointing blame at Saudi Arabia \u2014 despite NBC News and other reports last week that the CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's killing \u2014 and cast questions over who killed the journalist.\n\n\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said in the statement, which featured a subheading that read \"America First!\"\n\n\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\" he continued. \"In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nLater Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the U.S. relationship with Saudia Arabia and the fallout over Khashoggi's murder was \"a shame, but it is what it is.\" He also said he would be willing to meet with the crown prince at next week's G-20 summit in Argentina.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s gonna be there, but if he is, I will,\" Trump said.\n\nFormer CIA director John Brennan responded to Trump's statement by saying that Congress should obtain and make public the CIA's findings about Khashoggi's death.\n\n\"Since Mr. Trump excels in dishonesty, it is now up to members of Congress to obtain & declassify the CIA findings on Jamal Khashoggi's death,\" said Brennan, a scathing critic of Trump. \"No one in Saudi Arabia most especially the Crown Prince \u2014 should escape accountability for such a heinous act.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties, and experts, also reacted critically.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted that, \"You can't just throw in some exclamations (!!!!), yell that the world is dangerous, and call it a press release. That's not how a U.S. President responds to the murder of a journalist and American resident.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calf., said that \"to allow this to happen with no consequences is offensive to every value the United States holds dear.\"\n\n\"Human rights is more than just a phrase, it has to mean something. And that means standing up and condemning a brazen murder by a foreign government,\" added Feinstein, who said she would vote against all future arms deals with the Saudis and urged sanctions against the country's rulers. \"Everyone who played a role in this killing must be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a jab at Trump's \"America First\" justification.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First. I'm also pretty sure John Bolton wrote it,\" he said on Twitter, referring to the president's national security adviser.\n\nKristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University's Baker Institute and an expert on Saudi Arabia, told NBC News that Trump's statement was \"one of the most extraordinary\" he'd \"ever seen,\" adding that it \"bears the imprint of John Bolton.\"\n\nKhashoggi, a U.S. resident from Saudi Arabia, was a Washington Post opinion contributor critical of the crown prince's regime.\n\nHis former employer also issued a scathing statement about Trump's remarks, with Washington Post Publisher and CEO Fred Ryan calling the president's response \"a betrayal of long-established American values of respect for human rights and the expectation of trust and honesty in our strategic relationships.\"\n\n\"He is placing personal relationships and commercial interests above American interests in his desire to continue to do business as usual with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,\" Ryan said.\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists Executive Director Joel Simon added in his own statement that, \"if you boil the White House statement down to its essence, President Trump has just asserted that if you do enough business with the U.S., you are free to murder journalists.\"\n\n\"That's an appalling message to send to Saudi Arabia and the world,\" he added.\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters later Tuesday, said he had no commercial interests in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI don't get money from Saudi Arabia,\" he said. \"Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with me.\"\n\nThe CIA's assessment had been expected to add pressure on the Trump administration to unleash further punishment on Saudi Arabia despite the president's cordial ties to the royal family there.\n\nThe latest statement seems to all but rule that out.\n\n\u201cThe United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\" Trump said in the statement.\n\nTrump, in the statement, which was titled, \"Statement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia,\" also repeats unsubstantiated smears against Khashoggi that have been perpetuated by the Saudi government, including that Khashoggi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and spreads the Saudi government claim that Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly derided the U.S. press as \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nIn an interview with reporters, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu responded to Trump's reference to Khashoggi asking, \"Do you think the US would allow him to come here if he was a terrorist?\" Cavusoglu also pointed out that the Muslim Brotherhood was not a terrorist organization and then asked, \"Suppose that he is linked with the Muslim Brotherhood or another organization like this, does this mean he has to be killed like this?\"\n\nTrump, in his Tuesday statement, repeats denials from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi King Salman that they had \"any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe statement makes it clear there will be no additional consequences for Saudi Arabia. Trump reiterated that his administration had already announced sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials over Khashoggi's killing and explained that he would not be cancelling a massive arms deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, despite pressure from some lawmakers to do so.\n\n\"If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\" Trump wrote.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, at a press conference held after the White House statement was released, repeated much of Trump said, telling reporters that \"the United States will continue to have a relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n\"They are an important partner of ours,\" he said. \"That is the commitment the president made today\u2026 it\u2019s that straightforward.\"\n\n\"It's a mean, nasty world out there. The Middle East in particular. There are important American interests to keep the American people safe, to protect Americans,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in his statement, Trump used inaccurate figures to describe the arms sale. For example, he writes that the Saudis had \"agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States\" and that of that amount, \"$110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\"\n\nBut according to a study of the deal published Monday by the Center for International Policy, the deal with Saudi Arabia is actually a mixture of orders approved during the Obama administration, a few new offers, and tens of billions in speculative deals. Actual deals implemented since Trump took office total just $14.5 billion, the study found.\n\nIn addition, Trump, in the statement, essentially outlined how the U.S. needed Saudi support to help combat Iranian involvement in the war in Yemen, to help fight terrorism internationally and to help keep oil prices low.\n\n\"The world is a very dangerous place!\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn closing, Trump took aim at \"members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction.\"\n\n\"I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added, \"America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Phil Rogers and David K.

The samples included bits of quartz with internal structures that were deformed by intense pressure.\n\nThis so-called shocked quartz has been found in other impact craters as well as in areas where underground nuclear tests have been conducted.

He said in an email that while it was \"plausible that the feature is an impact crater,\" it was hard to tell for sure because the landform is buried so deep beneath the ice and can't be directly reached.\n\nIn response to the criticism, MacGregor said the researchers hope to return to the area to conduct additional research but acknowledged the difficulty of drilling through the ice and into the underlying bedrock to obtain more evidence. That would be a difficult process that could take several years, he said.\n\nBut he said the existing evidence was sufficient and that \u2014 given the shape of the geologic feature under the ice and the sediment samples recovered nearby \u2014 there was only a \"very slim\" chance that the feature under the ice is not an impact crater.\n\n\"The simplest explanation of our observations is that the glacier overlies an impact crater,\" he said.\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT METEORITES AND ASTEROIDS?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Julia Ainsley", "title": "Feds have paid undercover informants in migrant caravan", "description": "\"I find it hard to believe that the highest risk facing this nation comes from this caravan,\" said John Cohen, ex-acting undersecretary of intelligence for DHS.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/feds-have-paid-undercover-informants-migrant-caravan-n938416", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2653266/181120-migrants-caravan-se-1245p_a148cff67e8b5c282d708bf23e0d3604.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:59:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Why? Because Trump is seeking, and to a startling degree succeeding, in discrediting the entire media profession by declaring the press to be \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d\n\nStill, years before the 24-hour cable news cycle, the Nixon administration\u2019s attacks on journalists constituted a serious presidential abuse of power. Some of this animosity was public. In November of 1969, for example, then-Vice President Spiro Agnew openly challenged the alleged bias of network television coverage by \u201cprivileged men\u201d whose broadcasts \u201cdo not, and I repeat not, represent the views of America.\u201d\n\nAgnew\u2019s rhetoric was far less harmful than Nixon\u2019s secret suspicious, however. In June 1969, for example, a few months after Nixon took office, his key adviser John Ehrlichman authorized non-governmental employees to install wiretaps in the home of newspaper columnist Joseph Kraft. Similarly, after CBS journalist Daniel Schorr broadcast an unfavorable analysis of a Nixon speech, the White House launched an FBI investigation of Schorr which included interviews with his neighbors, his employer and family members. When news of the FBI inquiry leaked, the president\u2019s aides invented a fabricated story that Schorr was being considered for federal employment to cover up the misconduct \u2014 a lie which Nixon approved.\n\nIn that same year, Nixon authorized the FBI to wiretap two additional journalists, as well as government employees, following news accounts about U.S. bombings in Cambodia. In one instance, Attorney General John Mitchell directed that a wiretap be installed in the residence of a TV network correspondent and that the journalist be placed under 24-hour surveillance, even though the reporter had no known connection with any classified material. The FBI persuaded Mitchell to withdraw the physical surveillance directive, but the FBI wiretap remained in place for two months.\n\nEach of these episodes was cited in the final report of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee as evidence supporting the committee\u2019s passage of Article II of the Articles of Impeachment charging Nixon with abuse of power.\n\nNixon\u2019s former White House counsel John Dean testified before Sen. Sam Ervin\u2019s committee investigating Watergate that the White House maintained a political \u201cenemies list\u201d and an early version of that list included the Los Angeles Times managing editor. Later additions to that list, which became an exhibit in the Senate hearings, included TV network journalists at NBC and CBS and print journalists at the New York Times, Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, news magazines and regional newspapers.\n\nBut a primary object of Nixon\u2019s personal vendetta was then-major syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, whose columns were printed in newspapers nationwide. Before cable TV and the internet, Anderson was one of the most influential political journalists in the country. In late 1971 and early 1972, White House tapes reveal that Nixon, Attorney General John Mitchell and senior White House adviser John Ehrlichman discussed prosecuting Anderson for allegedly receiving leaked classified information. Ehrlichman\u2019s notes of these meetings read, \u201cWe\u2019ll prosecute Anderson, et al. after the election.\u201d They never did, but that was the least of it.\n\nUnlike the Nixon White House, Trump operates in the open in attacking the media. Character assassination of journalists is the hallmark of his campaign-style rallies.\n\nG. Gordon Liddy, an employee of Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign, admitted that he went so far as to explore the possibility of killing Anderson. Liddy said he had discussed various techniques including poisoning Anderson or killing him in an automobile crash. These far-fetched schemes were abandoned, and Anderson was not harmed. Instead Liddy received another assignment \u2014 to oversee the burglary of the Democratic National Party headquarters in the Watergate in June 1972.\n\nUnlike the Nixon White House, Trump operates in the open in attacking the media. Character assassination of journalists is the hallmark of his campaign-style rallies. This barrage is working.\n\nA Monmouth University poll published in April 2018 reported that 31 percent of Americans believe that major media and print outlets publish \u201cfake news\u201d regularly and another 46 percent believe that the media publishes \u201cfake news\u201d occasionally. Monmouth University reported that this 77 percent response rate represented a 12 percent increase from the results of a 2017 poll.\n\nThe media is finally starting to fight back, however. CNN recently filed a lawsuit on behalf of Acosta claiming that the revocation of his White House press privileges violates the First Amendment. An array of other media organizations, including Fox News, announced their intentions to file legal briefs in support of the CNN position. After a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order reinstating Acosta\u2019s White House press privileges, the White House backed down, but not before posting a new set of rules for White House reporters to follow in the briefing room.\n\nMeanwhile Charles Whitaker, interim dean of Northwestern\u2019s Medill School of Journalism (where I am also an adjunct instructor), recently issued a public statement that \u201cwe cannot turn a blind eye to the encroachment on press freedom.\u201d Whitaker added that Medill must \u201cinsist that our students and our professional colleagues are allowed to perform their roles honorably and without being declared \u2018enemies of the state.\u2019\u201d Whitaker joins other leaders in the media community who have also spoken out about this administration\u2019s efforts to discredit the profession.\n\nNixon\u2019s war on the press crossed the line into grave misconduct \u2014 and he was punished as a result. While Trump\u2019s public attacks have not run afoul of criminal law (that we know of), their impact may have a more dangerous and lasting effect on press freedom than Nixon\u2019s secret crimes perpetrated ever did. Poisoning the American people against the press may have short-term advantages for an embattled Trump, but his anti-press campaign will mostly be remembered for the long-term damage it did to this cornerstone of our democracy."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Nude photo leak ends councilman's career", "description": "Voters in Groves, Texas have voted to remove openly gay city councilman Cross Coburn after nude photos of Coburn from a dating site were leaked.

A separate court document said he was now considered a fugitive.\n\nGorrin helped purchase Globovision in 2013 and softened anti-government coverage after becoming president of the popular TV network.\n\nProsecutors in Miami said in the August indictment that beginning around 2010, Gorrin paid bribes to two finance officials in exchange for the right to conduct foreign currency transactions for the government.\n\nThe headquarters of Globovision TV in Caracas, Venezuela, on May 16, 2017.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nDoctors need to be thinking about whether their patients have a risk of becoming infected with the AIDS virus and, if they do, should recommend a daily pill to protect themselves, a federal task force said Tuesday\n\nIt\u2019s the first time the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended what\u2019s called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP to help stop the spread of HIV.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is clear: when taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV,\u201d Dr. Seth Landefeld, a member of the USPSTF, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cTo make a difference in the lives of people at high risk for HIV, clinicians need to identify patients who would benefit and offer them PrEP, added Landefeld, who chairs the department of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.\n\nThe USPSTF also renewed its 2013 recommendation that doctors test all teens and adults aged 15 to 65 for HIV, especially pregnant women. HIV experts say universal screening can reduce the stigma associated with getting HIV testing and can also catch cases that would otherwise go undetected.\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus infects 36 million people globally and it has killed 35 million people since it began spreading in the 1970s, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIn the United States, more than 1.2 million people have HIV, and close to 40,000 people are newly infected each year.\n\nPrEP can reduce the risk of catching HIV by 90 percent if people use it consistently. It's been on the market since 2012 and has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2014.\n\nIn the U.S., researchers have estimated that 1.1 million people should be taking PrEP. But a CDC study published in October showed that only 78,000 Americans are actually taking it.\n\nThe USPSTF says those at high risk who should be offered PrEP include:\n\nAnyone without HIV who has an HIV-positive sex partner\n\nGay, bisexual or transgender men who have had a recent sexually transmitted infection\n\nGay and bisexual men who do not use condoms every time they have sex\n\nHeterosexual or transgender women who do not consistently use condoms with a high-risk sex partner, such as a bisexual man or someone who injects drugs\n\nWomen who have had a recent STI\n\nInjecting drug users who share equipment\n\n\"Consistent use of condoms decreases risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 80 percent and also decreases the risk of other STIs,\" the USPSTF said.\n\n\"However, condoms are often used inconsistently by sexually active adults. PrEP should be considered as an option to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in persons who use condoms inconsistently, while continuing to encourage and support consistent condom use.\"\n\nThere's also evidence that HIV-positive people are less likely to transmit the virus to their sexual partners if they have the virus controlled using drug cocktails. The USPSTF said there's not enough evidence to say whether giving PrEP to the uninfected partner reduces the risk even more.\n\nOne product, Gilead\u2019s two-drug combination pill Truvada, is approved for use as PrEP. But the USPSTF noted that several studies have found that a pill called tenofovir, used alone, is also effective as PrEP, and can be considered as an alternative for high-risk heterosexual men and women and drug users."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Mark Bittman thinks you're bad at eating", "description": "Food writer Mark Bittman discovered a new rule for a better diet.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/better/video/mark-bittman-how-to-eat-a-better-diet-1270619203830", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201807/d_better_2min_Bittman_180705.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:00:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "How exercise benefits your brain as well as your body 02:03"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Erik Ortiz", "title": "Saks accused of race and age discrimination: 'He did not have \"the look\"'", "description": "The plaintiffs, who include floor salesmen, say they were also subject to a hostile work environment and unlawful retaliation at the luxury retailer.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/saks-fifth-avenue-accused-race-age-discrimination-lawsuit-n938351", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2652821/181120-saks-fifth-avenue-mc-1350_d67f0df92cee658f4abd25a59275d3cd.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:59:00Z", "content": "Nov. 20, 2018 / 4:59 PM GMT Eight men, the majority of whom are older and black, say they were subject to age and race discrimination while employed at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City, alleging in a lawsuit filed Tuesday that they couldn't advance because \u2026 [+4392 chars]", "fulltext": "/ Updated By Erik Ortiz\n\nEight men, the majority of whom are older and black, say they were subject to age and race discrimination while employed at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City, alleging in a lawsuit filed Tuesday that they couldn't advance because of a \"glass ceiling\" for people of color.\n\nThe ex-employees, who are represented by the Cochran Firm, worked at the high-end department store's flagship location in midtown Manhattan. Some of them were hired back in 2010 and 2011, and were placed in sales in the men's department with \"limited customer traffic and far removed from the department's front entrance\" \u2014 putting them at a disadvantage, according to the suit.\n\n\"Although they were each committed to maintaining SAKS' reputation as a luxury retailer by providing stellar customer service, their respective managers deliberately targeted them because of their race and/or age,\" said the suit, filed in state Supreme Court in Bronx County.\n\nCanada-based Hudson's Bay Company, which took over operations of the Saks brand in 2013, said Tuesday that it does not comment on pending litigation, although \"we take these allegations seriously as we are committed to diversity and inclusion across our organization.\"\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday morning, Cochran attorney Derek Sells said a lack of black employees in senior management positions was \"very disturbing and it needs to change.\"\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Derick Longley, who is black, joined the store in August 2016 and was a sales associate for Ralph Lauren's Purple Label.\n\nLongley said one of his colleagues, a \"brand ambassador\" for Ralph Lauren, \"accused him of speaking 'ghetto' and 'Ebonics'\" to black customers, and \"told him he needed to refrain from doing so.\" In addition, Longley said, that same colleague hindered him from advancing as a brand ambassador at Saks, \"claiming that he did not have the 'look' clearly referring to the fact that he is African-American.\"\n\nLongley said he \"excelled\" at his job and surpassed his sales goal of $300,000 within the first six months of hiring, but was still subjected to a hostile work environment that included another sales associate yelling at him while he was engaged in a potential sale of an $80,000 bag.\n\n\"None of Plaintiff Longley's similarly-situated Caucasian counterparts were treated in this fashion,\" according to the suit. Longley was later terminated in September 2017.\n\nAnother black employee, Kenneth Taylor, 55, was hired in July 2017 and said the director of Saks' men's luxury collections continually singled him out and berated him. Taylor said he was having a meeting with a manager with Ermenegildo Zegna, the Italian fashion house, when the director told the manager \"he was wasting his time on Plaintiff Taylor because he was not going to remember anything,\" according to the suit.\n\nTaylor, however, said he was a competent sales associate, having \"just sold an $8,000 suit and completed a $12,000 sale in another department.\"\n\nAnother black plaintiff, Nixson McCray, 57, said despite racking up nearly $700,000 in sales each year after he was hired in 2014, one selling director would \"falsely accuse him of engaging in unprofessional conduct.\"\n\nThe director \"mocked him and would condescendingly comment: 'You think you are a professional?'\" the suit said, adding that white employees were not treated similarly.\n\nIt wasn't only older minority employees who said they suffered discrimination.\n\nTwo white employees, ages 68 and 70, said their younger counterparts were helped by supervisors, and despite keeping up their sales, they were \"set up for failure\" and unjustly terminated.\n\nIn addition, two of the eight plaintiffs are Hispanic. In the suit, one of the men, Pablo Orozco, 54, accused managers of making false accusations against him, including that a customer complained that Orozco had touched him inappropriately in a dressing room.\n\nBlack plaintiff Charles Blocker, 60, said at the news conference that working conditions at the store became increasingly \"tense\" after Hudson's Bay took over and he went through \"at least six or seven managers within a year.\"\n\nSaks has been at the center of past complaints of discrimination.\n\nIn 2016, five former female servers at the restaurants located within the flagship store in New York sued claiming women over the age of 40 were unfairly terminated in favor of younger, more attractive male servers, reported the New York Daily News. Saks, which had been leasing out its restaurant operations, declined to comment at the time.\n\nA year earlier, Saks settled a lawsuit with a transgender employee at its Houston store who claimed she was harassed by male colleagues who repeatedly asked if she was a prostitute."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reynaldo Leanos, Jr. and Max Parrott", "title": "Through border 'Bling-O,' drag queens, church help migrants, asylum seekers", "description": "In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, drag queens gathered at an LGBT church on the U.S.-Mexico border to help raise money for a shelter that houses refugees and asylum seekers.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/border-bling-o-drag-queens-churches-activists-raise-money-migrants-n938361", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2652941/181120-beatrix-lestrange-cs-940a_d9b566d718a0ed3cd2f861dbf1041e8b.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:53:00Z", "content": "Nov. 20, 2018 / 4:53 PM GMT By Reynaldo Leanos, Jr. and Max Parrott HARLINGEN, Texas Drag queen Beatrix Lestrange, whose real name is Joe Uvalles, is wearing a neon multi-colored dress, a red wig and a pair of black pumps.

She\u2019s standing in front of a full room of mostly baby boomers and is ready to call out numbers for bingo.\n\n\u201cCan we kill these lights?\u201d Lestrange laughs. \u201cThese are not drag queen friendly.\u201d\n\nLestrange, a self-proclaimed \u2018dragtivist,\u2019 was hosting a game of bingo, but it was slightly different. In this \"Bling-o,\" the players competed for donated jewelry instead of cash.\n\n\u201cBingo, to me, sounded kind of boring,\u201d said Andi Atkinson, the organizer of the event and executive director of La Posada Providencia, a shelter for asylum seekers and refugees. \u201cWe decided, why not give away bling?\u201d\n\nBling-O was the result of a web of unorthodox partnerships. Lestrange was invited to support La Posada Providencia at an LGBT-friendly Christian church in the Rio Grande Valley of south Texas on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWhat brought the groups together? A shared crusade for immigrant justice, where participants paid a fee at the door, which all went to the shelter.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley has been in the national spotlight after President Donald Trump deployed thousands of soldiers along the U.S-Mexico border and has installed barbed wire on some parts along the southern border.\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection data, Border Patrol has apprehended more people in the Rio Grande Valley sector, though the numbers are drastically lower than those in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDrag performer Ariel C. Brooks, a member of Drag out H.I.V., takes tips from an enthusiastic crowd. Max Parrott\n\nMost of La Posada\u2019s clients come from detention facilities in the Rio Grande valley, though some could have been transferred to those facilities from any port of entry in the U.S.\n\nAtkinson said the shelter provides a safe place for immigrants seeking asylum to locate and make plans to travel to friends and family after they are released from detention.\n\n\u201cAt La Posada, basically what we do is we help people finish their journey,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nBefore working for the shelter, Atkinson began her immigration activism through a United Methodist Women group. She explained that her idea to ask a drag queen to host the event came after she saw Lestrange marching at an ACLU rally protesting the separation of parents from their children at the border.\n\n\u201cIt just makes sense that the LGBT community would want to support refugees. It just makes perfect sense because they are [also] discriminated against,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cIt's all about people standing together\u2013all types of people standing together.\u201d\n\nAfter Lestrange agreed to host the Bling-O, Atkinson needed a location to host the event. She reached out to Pastor Ali Lopez of Mount Calvary, a church run by LGBT people.\n\nPastor Lopez said she never hesitated to say yes to Atkinson\u2019s request and wanted to help the migrants in La Posada\u2019s shelter.\n\nAli Lopez is the pastor of Mount Calvary, an LGBT-friendly church in Harlingen, Texas. Max Parrott\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what God called us to do,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThrough the Bible, that\u2019s one of the things that God talks about, that we need to be a hand to the stranger.\u201d\n\nLestrange is no newcomer to activism in the Rio Grande Valley. Last year she created Drag Out HIV where she and other local drag queens used their platforms to raise awareness about the high rate of HIV in the area. She says she jumped on board this event because, for her, the issue of immigration is especially personal.\n\n\"That could have been any of us\"\n\n\u201cI grew up with my grandmother raising me and my siblings and she would tell us stories of how she had to cross the river, the Rio Grande, to come and find work here in the U.S. and the struggles and sacrifices she made,\u201d Lestrange said. \u201cThat could have been any of us and unfortunately as Latinos there\u2019s a lot of internalized racism.\u201d\n\nThrough Lestrange\u2019s activism in the Rio Grande Valley she says she\u2019s heard other local Latinos and Mexicans talk down about the situation on the border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Yo, your parents or your grandparents did the same thing and why are you any different?\u2019\u201d Lestrange said. \u201cHow does that give you any power to say that their journey and their experiences are any less important than your own because that\u2019s how you got here too.\u201d\n\nAmong the attendees was Eunice Lerma, an associate professor in counseling at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, who came to the event with friends. Lerma said she felt inspired about how a largely senior crowd responded to the drag performances of Lestrange and her guest Ariel C. Brooks.\n\n\u201cTo come here and see these older generations, just embracing and loving and clapping, they put this together, this is awesome,\u201d Lerma said.\n\nThe work isn\u2019t over for Lestrange after the \u201cBling-O\u201d event. She says she will continue to mobilize within her community to help immigrants seeking refuge and hopes people will follow her philosophy.\n\n\u201cIf I can do this work in wig and heels, then anyone can do this work,\u201d Lestrange said.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Didi Martinez", "title": "Kansas official who said he was part of 'master race' resigns", "description": "A Kansas county commissioner whose Nov.13 comment saying he was part of \"the master race\" sparked backlash nationwide, resigned from his post Tuesday morning.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kansas-official-who-said-he-was-part-master-race-resigns-n938456", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651531/181119-louis-klemp-kansas-master-race-1005a_8ce90c9e4fc42d8ce394efe2dff02d2f.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:48:54Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

From New York to Sydney, vigils will pay tribute to the many transgender people who have lost their lives to violence.\n\nViolence against the trans community has risen steadily in recent years, according to a grim report released Monday by the Human Right Campaign, a national LGBTQ advocacy group. The HRC report found at least 22 people were killed so far this year due to anti-transgender violence, and the organization has tracked 128 anti-transgender homicides in the U.S. since 2013.\n\nCourtesy of Human Rights Campaign\n\nThe 73-page report documents the 22 lives lost since the beginning of 2018: The victims are mostly young, mostly female-identified and mostly black. Of those killed, 82 percent of the victims were transgender women of color, and 64 percent were under the age of 35.\n\nThe victims include 35-year-old Tonya \u201cKita\u201d Harvey from Buffalo, New York, described by friends as having \u201ca loving heart,\u201d and 31-year-old Ciara Minaj Carter Frazier from Chicago, whom a friend described as \u201cone of the sweetest people [she] had ever met.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Human Rights Campaign\n\nCourtesy of Human Rights Campaign\n\nLourdes Hunter, executive director of the social justice group Trans Women of Color Collective, said that as a black trans woman, she worries about violence every day.\n\n\u201cGoing to the market, going to the store,\u201d Hunter told NBC News, \"simple things like that, you could lose your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cEPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Campaign National Press Secretary Sarah McBride said there is an \u201cepidemic of violence\u201d that is targeting the transgender community.\n\n\u201cWhile every year is a little bit different, overall, we are seeing an upward trend in hate-based violence against the transgender community as well as other marginalized communities in this country,\u201d McBride told NBC News. \u201cAnd the upward trend, I think, reinforces the urgency of combating this violence against LGBTQ people.\u201d\n\nTransgender women of color are particularly vulnerable, according to McBride, \u201dbecause they exist at the intersection of misogyny and racism.\u201d The consequences, she said, are often \u201cdeadly.\u201d\n\nTransgender people are three times more likely to be unemployed compared to the general population, according to the HRC report, and 30 percent of those surveyed reported having been fired, denied a promotion or subjected to mistreatment at work due to their gender identity. High unemployment and workplace hostility often push transgender people to the margins \u2014 at least 10 of the known trans homicide victims in 2018 engaged in sex work to survive, the report found.\n\nHunter, 42, said she co-founded the Trans Women of Color Collective in 2014 because she felt more needed to be done to help her community. She said the Washington, D.C.-based group helps members of her community access the educational and employment opportunities they desperately need.\n\n\u201cWe can bring down the numbers of unemployment, we can bring down the numbers of homelessness in our community, because all of those \u2014 homelessness, violence, murder, discrimination \u2014 they\u2019re inexplicably linked,\u201d Hunter explained.\n\nHATE CRIMES ON THE RISE\n\nThe HRC report comes on the heels of an FBI report released last week that found anti-LGBTQ hate crimes rose 3 percent in 2017, with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people comprising more than 16 percent all 8,828 known hate crime victims. The data found federally reported hate crime incidents targeting the LGBTQ community have risen steadily since 2014, totaling 1,249 last year.\n\nAdvocates see the rising wave of violence against the trans community as part of this trend. They attribute it, in part, to a lack of LGBTQ legal protections when it comes to housing, education, employment and health care, which they say exacerbates poverty and exposes trans people to violence. Twenty-nine states, for example, do not have laws protecting against employment discrimination based on gender identity, according to HRC.\n\n\u201cThis failure to protect and serve some of the most vulnerable people in our country today encourages this violence,\u201d Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, told NBC News.\n\nAdvocates also lament the fact that it is currently not mandatory for law enforcement agencies to report hate crimes to the FBI. The annual FBI hate crimes report is based on statistics reported to the FBI by state and local law enforcement agencies. However, Frank Pezzella, a criminology professor at New York\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said only 75 percent of the approximately 18,5000 police agencies participate in hate crime reporting, and of those who do participate, nearly 90 percent \u201creport zero hate crimes every year.\u201d\n\nMOVING FORWARD\n\nDespite the grim statistics and reports about violence against trans people, Hunter said she is optimistic that this hate violence will decrease.\n\n\u201cEvery day I wake up, I have hope,\u201d she said. But she stressed that advocates need to focus on what the community needs most: greater employment and educational opportunities.\n\nTransgender activist Lourdes Hunter at the 2017 Transgender Day of Remembrance rally in Washington, D.C. Courtesy of Lourdes Hunter\n\n\u201cThis is how we contribute to expanding the conversation beyond murder and death and violence and discrimination towards encouragement, empowerment, support and sustainable uplifting and economic empowerment in our community,\u201d she said.\n\nThe activist said she will speak Tuesday night in honor of Transgender Day of Remembrance at the Metropolitan Community Church in the nation\u2019s capital. She said the dozens of vigils held across the country will honor not only those who lost their lives, but those who still live and struggle every day with violence and discrimination.\n\n\u201cWe honor their contribution to the movement,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt\u2019s because of them \u2014 their energy, their presence, their existence \u2014 that we are here today, still moving forward.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dartunorro Clark", "title": "Walmart withdraws donation to Cindy Hyde-Smith after criticism", "description": "Walmart on Tuesday said it withdrew its $2,000 donation from the campaign of GOP Sen.

Cindy Hyde-Smith after the company came under pressure to distance itself from the Mississippi lawmaker's \"public hanging\" remark.\n\nCampaign finance records show that the company made a $2,000 donation on Nov. 18, nearly a week after a video of Hyde-Smith saying she would be \"on the front row\" if a supporter invited her to \"a public hanging\" went viral. Records also show the company gave a $1,000 contribution to her campaign this past June.\n\nThe retail giant announced its decision to withdraw its support from Hyde-Smith in response to actress Debra Messing, who tweeted about the issue on Monday.\n\n\"Hi Debra. Completely understand your concern. Sen. Hyde-Smith\u2019s recent comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates. As a result, we are withdrawing our support and requesting a refund of all campaign donations,\" the company said in a tweet.\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Hyde-Smith has previously denied there was any negative connotation to her \"public hanging\" remark, which drew sharp rebuke from both sides. Critics noted that the comments were especially hurtful given Mississippi's history of racial violence and lynching against African Americans.\n\nHyde-Smith faces a runoff election on Nov. 27 against former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy, who is African-American.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Espy's campaign said Walmart's decision to withdraw its support shows why Hyde-Smith \"can't be trusted to work with the businesses\" Mississippi wants to attract.\n\n\"Cindy Hyde-Smith's comments have embarrassed Mississippi, and shown why she can\u2019t be trusted to work with the businesses Mississippi needs to grow good paying jobs,\" said Danny Blanton, the campaign's communication director. \"We're confident that voters will follow Walmart's lead and dump Cindy Hyde-Smith before she has the power to do real damage to our economy.\"\n\nPopular Info, a progressive newsletter, was the first to report Walmart's donation to her campaign.\n\nHer campaign has also been rocked allegations of supporting voter suppression after another video surfaced last week of her saying it might be a \"great idea\" to make it harder for some people to vote. Her campaign, however, quickly responded that the senator \"obviously\" was \"making a joke and clearly the video was selectively edited.\"\n\nThen, on Friday in a since-deleted tweet, Hyde-Smith's account posted a picture apparently aimed at quelling criticism of the episode, but it soon prompted further backlash.\n\nThe picture of two students smiling was accompanied by a caption that read, \"It's ok to still have a sense of humor in America isn\u2019t it. These students enjoyed a laugh with Cindy despite out of state social media posts trying to mislead Mississippians.\"\n\nHowever, a young black man who said that he was one of the students in the photo excoriated the senator for posting the picture, claiming she only posted it because he is black.\n\n\u201cAs a Political Science major I want to understand and inform myself about every candidate. But I do not, however, support Cindy Hyde Smith. I am disgusted,\u201d a Twitter user with the name JR Coleman tweeted on Friday. \u201cWe were not laughing in regards to her terrible statements, and I don\u2019t appreciate this post trying to make it seem so.\u201d\n\nHer campaign account has removed the tweet.\n\nThen on Monday, her campaign was forced to return a $2,700 donation from a Seattle businessman who was sued for discriminating against Muslims."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Alyssa Newcomb", "title": "Tech stocks plunge as investors brace for 'major white knuckle period'", "description": "Apple and Facebook pulled down the Nasdaq by 3 percent on Monday as Wall Street continued to weather what has been a six-week slide for the tech giants.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/tech-stocks-plunge-investors-brace-major-white-knuckle-period-n938366", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2652826/181120-facebook-stock-exchange-cs-849a_e0267884404208c75ab028b85b526bfe.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:45:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Carlos Giusti / AP\n\nIn the tropical forest of El Yunque, only two of the 56 wild birds that once lived there survived the Category 4 storm that pummeled the U.S. territory in September 2017. Meanwhile, only 4 of 31 wild birds in a forest in the western town of Maricao survived, along with 75 out of 134 wild parrots living in the Rio Abajo forest in the central mountains of Puerto Rico, scientists said.\n\nAnd while several dozen new parrots have been born in captivity and in the wild since Maria, the species is still in danger, according to scientists.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Gustavo Olivieri, parrot recovery program coordinator for Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources.\n\nFederal and local scientists will meet next month to debate how best to revive a species that numbered more than 1 million in the 1800s but dwindled to 13 birds during the 1970s after decades of forest clearing.\n\nThe U.S. and Puerto Rican governments launched a program in 1972 that eventually led to the creation of three breeding centers. Just weeks before Maria hit, scientists reported 56 wild birds at El Yunque, the highest since the program was launched.\n\nBut the population decline is now especially worrisome because the parrots that vanished from El Yunque were some of the last remaining wild ones, said Marisel Lopez, who oversees the parrot recovery program at El Yunque for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\n\"It was devastating. After so many years of having worked on this project...,\" she stopped talking and sighed.\n\nMarisel Lopez, director of the parrot recovery program follows biological scientist technician Wilfredo Abreua through a forest area near to the facilities of the Iguaca Aviary at El Yunque. Carlos Giusti / AP\n\nThe Puerto Rican Amazon is Puerto Rico's only remaining native parrot and is one of roughly 30 species of Amazon parrots found in the Americas. The red-foreheaded birds grow to nearly a foot in length, are known for their secrecy and usually mate for life, reproducing once a year.\n\nMore than 460 birds remain captive at the breeding centers in El Yunque and Rio Abajo forests, but scientists have not released any of them since Hurricane Maria. A third breeding center in a forest in the western rural town of Maricao has not operated since the storm. Scientists are now trying to determine the best way to prepare the parrots for release since there are such few birds in the wild they can interact with, and whether Puerto Rico's damaged forests can sustain them.\n\nA Honduran mahogany tree, at center, will hold an observation point near to the facilities of the Iguaca Aviary at El Yunque. Carlos Giusti / AP\n\nOne proposal scientists will consider is whether to capture some of the remaining wild parrots in the Rio Abajo forest and place them into the same cage as birds that will be released into the wild, so they can learn to emulate their social behavior to ensure their survival, said Jafet Velez, a wildlife biologist with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\nScientists are tentatively planning to release 20 birds next year in Rio Abajo.\n\nAnother proposal is to release more parrots in Maricao, which was not as heavily damaged by Maria.\n\n\"Our priority now is not reproduction...it's to start releasing them,\" Lopez said, adding that breeding centers can hold only so many parrots.\n\nBiological scientist technician Iris Rodriguez gives food and water to Puerto Rican parrots inside one of the flying cages in the Iguaca Aviary at El Yunque. Carlos Giusti / AP\n\nBut first, scientists need to make sure the forests can offer food and safe shelter.\n\nJessica Ilse, a forest biologist at el Yunque for the U.S. Forest Service, said scientists are collecting data about the amount of fruit falling from trees and the number of leaves shed. She said the canopy still has not grown back since Maria and warned that invasive species have taken root since more sunlight now shines through. Ilse said that many of the large trees where parrots used to nest are now gone and noted that it took 14 months for El Yunque's canopy to close after Hurricane Hugo hit Puerto Rico in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.\n\nScientists also are now collecting new data on the number of predators at El Yunque, including el guaraguao, a red-tailed hawk that hunts Puerto Rico parrots. Without a canopy and proper camouflage, wild parrots have become an easy target.\n\nIlse said local and federal scientists plan to help the forest recover through planting. By the end of November, they expect to have a map detailing the most damaged areas in El Yunque and a list of tree species they can plant that are more resistant to hurricanes.\n\n\"People keep asking us, 'How long is it going to take?'\" Ilse said.\n\nBut scientists don't know, she added.\n\n\"The damage is more extensive than (hurricanes) Hugo and Georges...It's been a complete change to the ecosystem.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Elisha Fieldstadt", "title": "Thanksgiving Day temperatures may be among coldest ever in New York and elsewhere in Northeast - NBCNews.com", "description": "NBCNews.com Thanksgiving Day temperatures may be among coldest ever in New York and elsewhere in Northeast NBCNews.com Plan to go to that famous parade on Thanksgiving?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Saphora Smith\n\nAn Italian prosecutor has ordered the seizure of a ship that has rescued 30,000 migrants from the Mediterranean Sea, a move seen by aid workers as the latest example of how European countries are taking steps to \u201ccriminalize\u201d their operations.\n\nKarline Kleijer, the head of emergencies at M\u00e9decins Sans Frontiers (MSF) which jointly operates the Aquarius vessel, described the order as a \"sinister\" attempt to \"stop humanitarian lifesaving search and rescue capacity at any cost.\"\n\nItalian authorities have also ordered bank accounts belonging to MSF \u2014 which is also known as Doctors Without Borders \u2014 to be frozen.\n\nCrew members aboard the Aquarius are accused of contravening rules for the disposal of waste.\n\nFollowing an investigation into how food leftovers, clothes and medical waste were dealt with, a prosecutor in the Sicilian port city of Catania on Monday ordered that the Aquarius be seized.\n\nHowever, it remained docked in Marseille, France, on Tuesday. Its operators plan to appeal the decision.\n\nThe Aquarius became a symbol of how governments are imposing restrictions on aid groups helping migrants trying to reach Europe when it was stranded at sea for 10 days in July after being repeatedly refused permission to dock by Italy and Malta.\n\nSOS Mediterranee, which operates the vessel alongside MSF, \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d what it described as a new attempt to \u201ccriminalize humanitarian aid at sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe categorically refute all accusations of participating in illegal activities,\u201d the aid group said in a statement, adding that the Aquarius had always followed rigorous procedures in port.\n\nThe Aquarius is not the first rescue vessel to attract the attention of Italian authorities.\n\nThe Aquarius rescue ship arrives in Senglea, Malta, in August. Matthew Mirabelli / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nIn August 2017, the Iuventa was seized under suspicion of providing \u201cassistance\u201d to illegal migrants and allegedly colluding with smugglers.\n\nSeveral other ships have subsequently been detained by Italian and Maltese authorities on charges ranging from illegally aiding migrants from Libya to not being properly registered.\n\nThese cases, combined with Italy and Malta barring such vessels from allowing migrants to disembark on their soil, have effectively halted rescue operations in the central Mediterranean.\n\nItalian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on Tuesday highlighted his decision to restrict rescue ship operations in the waters off Libya.\n\n\u201cI have done well to block the NGO boats,\u201d the far-right populist politician tweeted. \u201cNot only have I stopped illegal immigrants but also, it would appear, toxic waste,\" he said, linking to a story on the order for the Aquarius to be seized.\n\nSalvini has previously argued that restrictions on rescue operations exist to prevent Italy from becoming complicit with traffickers who send migrants out to sea knowing that they will have to be rescued.\n\nMeanwhile, the death rate among migrants attempting to cross the central Mediterranean has doubled year-on-year, according to the U.N.'s refugee agency.\n\nA report published by UNHCR in September found that in the first six months of 2018 around one in 18 people trying to complete the sea crossing from Libya to Europe either died or vanished. That compares to a figure of one in 42 people during the same period in 2017, the UNCHR added.\n\nJulia Black, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, said that with fewer dedicated search-and-rescue operations in the waters off Libya, it was \"extremely likely\" vessels carrying migrants have gone missing without a trace.\n\nLuigi Scazzieri, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, pointed out that the Italian judiciary is independent and that the prosecutor's decision should not be seen as an order from the anti-immigration populist government."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Nigel Chiwaya", "title": "Cook carefully: Thanksgiving is the worst day of the year for home fires", "description": "Cook carefully: Thanksgiving is the worst day of the year for home fires", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/turkey-safety-other-baste-practices-n938206", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2652731/181120-burnt-food-mc-1254_9cc9bf6b2f9f9e3093ca3bc1f55dd7be.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:14:37Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Nigel Chiwaya\n\nPay close attention while prepping your turkey, and exercise extreme care when setting up your holiday decorations. Statistically, you'll be playing with fire.\n\nThere are more in-home fires during the holiday season than at any other time of the year, according to data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Thanksgiving is the single worst day for fires.\n\nAn estimated 2,090 home fires were reported to fire departments around the United States on Thanksgiving 2016, according to the association. That\u2019s more than twice the daily average for the rest of the year. Of the Thanksgiving fires, three-quarters were cooking-related.\n\nOn average, Thanksgiving fires killed five people, injured 25 and caused $19 million in property loss from 2014 to 2016, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.\n\nDistractions are the main cause of cooking fires, said the NFPA's research manager for fire analysis, Marty Ahrens.\n\n\"One of the things on Thanksgiving is that you've got a lot more cooking going on and a lot more company coming over,\" Ahrens said. \"It's so easy to get distracted.\"\n\nBut it's not just Thanksgiving Day. Reports of fires also rise on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's and even Super Bowl Sunday.\n\n\"When people are gathered, we want to talk to them. We want to get together with them, and we get pulled away from the kitchen,\" said Minnesota's state fire marshal, Bruce West. \"It's so quick. A fire in the kitchen can happen in an instant.\"\n\nFirefighters in Minnesota responded to 96 fires last Thanksgiving Day weekend, West said.\n\nWhile most of them were cooking related, Christmas and New Year's fires tend to be caused by candles igniting decorations, Ahern said.\n\nTo stay safe during the holidays, experts suggest keeping combustible items like aprons and towels away from flames; installing, or checking, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors; and paying attention while cooking.\n\n\"You could be frying bacon,\" West said. \"You turn around and that grease starts on fire.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Minyvonne Burke", "title": "Martha Stewart took her first Uber ride \u2014 and hated it", "description": "Martha Stewart said she took her first Uber ride on Monday and didn\u2019t enjoy it because the car stopped halfway up the block and was messy.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/martha-stewart-took-her-first-uber-ride-hated-it-n938346", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2652781/181120-martha-stewart-mn-0830_aa2a25aae061a418f6c93de1754406bd.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:13:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nInfamous Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, armed with a diamond-encrusted pistol, relied on rampant bloodshed and bribery to protect his multibillion-dollar drug smuggling operation and his hold on power, a former lieutenant for his cartel testified on Monday at his Guzman's U.S. trial.\n\nDuring his third day on the stand as a government witness, Jesus Zambada told the jury that the gunplay and cash payoffs were key components of the Sinaloa cartel's business model. The jurors were shown a photo of the pistol decorated with Guzman's initials as the witness described the brutal way the cartel dealt with various violent threats and personal slights.\n\nAccording to Zambada, he was told by his older brother, Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, that a 2004 meeting between Guzman and a competitor named Rodolfo Fuentes ended poorly when Fuentes didn't shake his hand. The brother claimed afterward that Guzman made it clear he wanted Fuentes dead, and ended up ordering his killing.\n\nAlso assassinated were a corrupt police commander in 2008 for telling people \"that he was going to finish off my brother and Chapo,\" and another drug dealer who was struck down by \"a hail of bullets from Ak-47\" that nearly took off his head, the witness said.\n\nZambada described being told by one of his paid informants within law enforcement that authorities were close to capturing Guzman. It was suggested that the cartel should give a $250,000 bribe to a ranking officer, after which, \"The operation was aborted. There was no problem,\" he said.\n\nThe defense has argued that cooperators like Zambada are framing Guzman to win favor from the court in their own criminal cases. On cross-examination Monday, the defense sought to suggest Zambada was minimizing his own role in the cartel and exaggerating that of Guzman as a mythical kingpin known for escaping Mexican prisons, when really they say he was in hiding most of his life of crime and not calling the shots.\n\nDefense attorney William Purpura asked Zambada how it was possible Guzman outranked him when there was evidence Guzman needed to go through him to get his supplies of cocaine. For emphasis, the lawyer pulled down Zambada's mugshot from a lower portion of a cartel organizational chart on display in the courtroom and held it above one of Guzman.\n\n\"How does that look?\" the lawyer asked.\n\n\"Fine,\" the witness said with a smirk before quickly qualifying the answer by adding, \"I'm below him.\"\n\nGuzman, who was extradited to New York City early last year, has pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges. If convicted, he would face a possible life term.\n\nZambada was to resume testifying on Tuesday."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Agnes Constante", "title": "For U.S. islands' guest workers, storm recovery happens without government cash", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t want to live on Saipan if this is always what\u2019s going to happen.

But Raguindin said Super Typhoon Yutu, which hit the U.S. commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in October, was unlike anything he had ever experienced.\n\n\u201cI've never experienced a typhoon this strong, even in the Philippines,\u201d he said in Filipino. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve experienced a typhoon where I felt really scared.\u201d\n\nWith maximum sustained winds of 180 miles per hour, Super Typhoon Yutu may be the strongest storm to ever hit the Northern Mariana Islands \u2014 an archipelago of 14 islands in the Western Pacific \u2014 according to NASA.\n\nAfter the storm died down, Raguindin returned home to find an unsalvageable pile of rubble. His house\u2019s walls had collapsed, he said, the roof was gone and all his belongings had been blown away.\n\nRaguindin is among at least a few thousand commonwealth residents who lost their homes in the storm and are ineligible for some forms of recovery assistance because of their immigration status.\n\nSonny Raguindin's home after Super Typhoon Yutu, which hit the Northern Mariana Islands in October. Courtesy Sonny Raguindin\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands, which became a U.S. territory in 1975, is home to more than 52,000 people who live primarily on three islands: Saipan, Tinian and Rota, according to 2015 data.\n\nIn 2018, 8,228 guest workers received special permits, according to Department of Homeland Security data. More than 5,000 were from the Philippines.\n\nThose guest workers work primarily in construction and hospitality. The group is a large component of the islands\u2019 economy: The U.S. Government Accountability Office projected in 2015 that if all those workers \u2014 about 45 percent of the workforce \u2014 were eliminated, the GDP of the commonwealth would suffer a 26 to 62 percent reduction.\n\nBut those in the program aren't eligible for a federal program that helps disaster victims repair and rebuild their homes.\n\nFEMA's Individuals and Households Program offers U.S. citizens and some qualified non-citizens (such as those with green cards) various services after disasters, including cash assistance, home repair and construction, and reimbursement for short-term housing. Guest workers are ineligible for the program.\n\nAccording to the American Red Cross, more than 3,000 homes across Saipan and Tinian were totally or majorly damaged, while about 2,100 sustained minor damage. It is unknown how many of those housed guest workers.\n\nThose with U.S. citizen children can apply for the program on their children's behalf. A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson said the agency does not track how many CNMI guest workers have U.S. citizen children.\n\nWendi Herring, general manager of Fiesta Resort and Spa, a hotel on Saipan, said in an email that guest workers are critical to the region's tourism industry. She added that they account for 35 percent of the hotel's employees.\n\n\u201cWithout them, we would not be able to operate and further develop tourism because there are simply not enough US qualified resident workers available to sustain the industry,\u201d she said.\n\nMany guest workers have lived in the islands for three decades, according to Steven Pixley, chief legal counsel for Tan Holdings Corporation, which employs more than 400 of those employees. But Bruce Mailman, an immigration attorney on Saipan, said their visas don't provide a path to U.S. citizenship.\n\nFor guest workers who don't have U.S. citizen children, other non-cash emergency assistance is available, according to FEMA spokesman David Gervino, such as shelter, meals, water and emergency medical care.\n\nOther groups are also helping residents regardless of immigration status, including the American Red Cross, the U.S. military, Salvation Army, local organizations and grassroots donation drives across the U.S. mainland.\n\nStill, getting aid for U.S. citizen children and from non-government groups can be challenging.\n\nBheng Tanghal, a Philippine national who lives on Saipan as a dependent of her guest worker husband, said in Filipino that she was discouraged from applying for government aid for her U.S. citizen sons after being denied years ago.\n\nShe added that the Red Cross offered her materials to fix her home after an earlier typhoon, but the family could not afford the cost of labor.\n\nRaguindin said he has received $50 from the Philippine Consulate in Guam, food from the U.S. military, and a solar light, tarp and water filter from international relief organization Samaritan Purse.\n\nBut three weeks after the storm, he and his daughter are still homeless and remain at the church that sheltered them from the typhoon.\n\nRaguindin added that when Typhoon Soudelor slammed the region in 2015, he didn't qualify for FEMA cash assistance. Because of that, he said he's questioning whether he wants to stay in the commonwealth, where he has worked as an air conditioning technician for the last 16 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to live on Saipan if this is always what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work so hard here if my house is going to be destroyed by typhoons.\u201d\n\nJenny Hegland, liaison for national partnerships and former director at Commonwealth Advocates for Recovery Efforts, a nonprofit dedicated to serving families with long-term unmet needs from disasters, estimates that, based on Red Cross figures, at least 12,400 residents are displaced.\n\nHegland noted that most guest workers rent rather than own homes. Given that, a crucial piece of recovery involves working with landlords to repair and rebuild housing. Rebuilding is an expensive component of the recovery process, she added, as it costs at least $25,000 to build a safe structure that can withstand typhoons the region experiences.\n\nBased on the time it took the commonwealth to rebuild after Typhoon Soudelor in 2015 and the extent of the damage this time around, Hegland anticipates it will take between three to five years at minimum to fully restore the islands after Typhoon Yutu.\n\nMultiple commonwealth residents and leaders said the storm affected residents indiscriminately, so it's important for everyone \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 to get the aid they need to rebuild and recover.\n\n\u201cThe CNMI\u2019s CW-1 workers are part of our island community and are suffering alongside US residents in the wake of this monster storm,\u201d Herring, the general manager of Fiesta Resort and Spa, said, referring to the guest workers. \u201cShould they not receive some form of assistance. ...

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Phil McCausland\n\nLess than two days after a House committee demanded answers on why computer problems were delaying veterans' GI Bill payments, the Veterans Benefits Administration unexpectedly canceled its weekend work at three regional processing centers at the last minute on Saturday morning.\n\nA VA spokesman said a system update stymied the agency's attempts to work on its backlog of benefit claims, putting a halt to the mandatory overtime ordered to address the problem. NBC News previously reported that computer problems have caused GI Bill benefit payments that cover education and housing to be delayed or made incorrectly, forcing some veterans to face dire financial circumstances.\n\nIn response to the delays, the Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) Education Service placed the regional processing centers on mandatory overtime, including weekend work, and hired 202 additional workers.\n\nAt Thursday's hearing before the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, VA officials were unwilling to offer a concrete date \u2014 or even an estimate \u2014 for when the problem might be fully resolved, but said they would continue with mandatory overtime to address the issue.\n\n\u201cThe plan going forward is to continue our overtime work, continue to have the improved processing provided by 200 additional processors,\u201d Gen. Robert Worley, the director of VBA\u2019s education service, testified on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing, as I said, on the old work first. We\u2019re handling hardships as they come in. And that\u2019s the ongoing effort that we\u2019ve gone through since the peak of this fall, which was 207,000 claims on Sept. 4.\u201d\n\nThe VA confirmed that it alerted employees at 9 a.m. ET on Saturday that all overtime work on education claims would be canceled at the three regional offices, but it did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the number of workers who were told to stay home.\n\nStars and Stripes reported last week that overtime has cost about $300,000 every week since the beginning of August, totaling about $4.5 million.\n\nThe House Veterans' Affairs Committee, which held Thursday's hearing, began to investigate the matter on Saturday after they found out about the canceled work, a committee aide told NBC News.\n\nThe committee believed it was \"an internal communication issue\" at the federal agency, the aide said, as VA officials told them the system was not \"down.\" However, the payment system became \"unavailable\" when they input new compensation and pension rates that are to take effect Dec. 1.\n\n\"Education staff were told that this wouldn\u2019t impact processing of education claims but they were wrong,\" the committee aide said. \"As such, they canceled overtime this past weekend.\u201d\n\nCurt Cashour, a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, said that full operations at the regional offices resumed Monday morning and that the canceled overtime would \"have little effect on VA's overall education claims processing, as the department's education claims inventory is trending downward.\"\n\nCashour denied that thousands of veterans had waited months for payment or been made homeless by the delayed payments.\n\nSen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, however, sent a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie on Friday, asking him to address the multiple reports that the delayed payments have put student veterans in difficult financial circumstances.\n\nThe chairman also asked how much money VA had spent to address its computer system, the number of employees working on it, the status of the IT upgrades, the amount of time it will take VA to correct its payments and send them to veterans, how much is owed to student veterans and how VA is communicating with students and schools about the delays.\n\n\u201cThese problems have forced our veterans to go without money to pay for basic necessities like food and rent, with some facing potential eviction or the prospect of getting kicked out of school,\u201d Enzi said in a statement. \u201cThey deserve better.\u201d\n\nThe VA said as of Saturday that it had approximately 51,000 pending post-9/11 GI Bill claims. According to Cashour, each education claim is processed in 24.3 days for original claims and 17.3 days for supplemental claims.\n\n\"VA\u2019s education claims inventory includes claims that are as new as one day old, and not all involve payments, such as initial applications or changes of programs,\" Cashour said in an email to NBC News on Saturday. \"Approximately 1-percent or fewer of VA\u2019s education claims are more than 60 days old.

All three of the red-to-blue flips for Republicans were won by Republican men.\n\n\u2022 Of the 103 women so far slated to serve in the House next year, 90 are Democrats.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s more, the share of Republican women in the House will be significantly down in the new Congress, falling from 23 currently serving to just 13 next session. (That number will increase to 14 if Love wins re-election in Utah, though she\u2019s back to trailing Democratic Ben McAdams.)\n\n\u2022 On election night, 23 women were elected to the Senate, just six of them Republicans.\n\n\u2022 Combining the House and Senate data: Women next year will make up a bit more than 40 percent of Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill but less than 8 percent of Republican lawmakers.\n\n\u2022 And of the nine women elected governor in 2018, six are Democrats and just three are Republicans. This past year, just two Democratic women served as governor, while four Republican women held the post.\n\nDems lead the House popular vote now approaching 8 points\n\nAccording to the Cook Political Report\u2019s David Wasserman, Democrats now have a 7.8-point lead in the House popular vote, 53.0 percent to 45.2 percent.\n\nWhat were the national House vote margins in the midterm wave years of 1994, 2006 and 2010? Try R+7 points, D+6.4 points and R+6.6 points, respectively.\n\nThe uncalled House races (two)\n\nGA-7 (Republican Rob Woodall is ahead, 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent)\n\nUT-4 (Democrat Ben McAdams is ahead of Republican Mia Love, 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent)\n\n\u2014 NM-2 (NBC News declared Democrat Xochitl Torres Small the apparent winner)\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 win in NM-2 brings their net gain in the House to 38 seats \u2014 and counting.\n\nIvanka Trump used a personal email for government matters\n\nLock her up?\n\nThe Washington Post: \u201cIvanka Trump sent hundreds of emails last year to White House aides, Cabinet officials and her assistants using a personal account, many of them in violation of federal records rules, according to people familiar with a White House examination of her correspondence. White House ethics officials learned of Trump\u2019s repeated use of personal email when reviewing emails gathered last fall by five Cabinet agencies to respond to a public records lawsuit. That review revealed that throughout much of 2017, she often discussed or relayed official White House business using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner.\u201d\n\nPeter Mirijanian, spokesperson for Abbe Lowell, ethics counsel for Ivanka Trump, gave this statement to NBC\u2019s Ken Dilanian: \u201cTo address misinformation being peddled about Ms. Trump\u2019s personal email, she did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Ivanka Trump followed the law. \u201cUsing personal emails for government business could violate the Presidential Records Act, which requires that all official White House communications and records be preserved as a permanent archive of each administration,\u201d the Post writes.\n\nAnd with Democrats controlling the House next year, this is exactly the kind of story that could produce more problematic headlines for the Trump White House.\n\nTrump admin can't deny asylum to migrants who enter U.S. illegally, judge rules\n\n\u201cA federal judge barred the Trump administration on Monday from refusing asylum to immigrants who cross the southern border illegally,\u201d the AP says. \u201cU.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar issued a temporary restraining order after hearing arguments in San Francisco. The request was made by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which quickly sued after President Donald Trump issued the ban this month in response to the caravans of migrants that have started to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that said anyone who crossed the southern border would be ineligible for asylum.\u201d\n\n16 Democrats sign letter opposing Pelosi as speaker\n\nNBC\u2019s Leigh Ann Caldwell and Garrett Haake: \u201cSixteen Democrats on Monday released a letter announcing their opposition to electing Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaker of the House, presenting her a narrow path to reclaiming the speaker\u2019s gavel in the next Congress. The letter is the first concrete expression of opposition from current Democratic lawmakers and incoming members of Congress since the party won control of the House in the midterm elections.\u201d\n\nBut if the opposition is limited to these 16 Democrats \u2013 and not anyone else \u2013 then the Pelosi critics might not have the votes to stop her. If Ben McAdams (one of the 16 opponents here) wins in UT-4, Democrats will be at 234 members. And if there are 16 \u201cno\u201d votes for Pelosi, you still have a majority of 218 votes.\n\nSo the question is whether there are more than 16 Pelosi opponents, because 16 aren\u2019t enough to defeat her.\n\nThe Senate runoff in Mississippi is now one week away\n\n\u201cRepublicans hoped to spend the final days of the special election in Mississippi coronating Cindy Hyde-Smith as the first woman to represent the state in the Senate. Instead, the race has become a bare-knuckle brawl infused with ugly racial politics,\u201d per Politico.\n\n\u201cHyde-Smith\u2019s comments about attending a public hanging and suppressing liberal votes \u2014 remarks she maintained were made in jest \u2014 have upended a contest that a week ago was seen as a mere formality for the GOP. Democrats and allied outside groups have seized on Hyde Smith\u2019s musings to spur black voters to the polls and paint her as an embarrassment to the state. They\u2019re trying to crack open a narrow path for Democrat Mike Espy \u2014 a Cabinet secretary under Bill Clinton who would be the first African-American to represent Mississippi in the Senate since Reconstruction \u2014 as a viable alternative.\u201d\n\nThe Hyde-Smith vs. Espy runoff is on Nov. 27.\n\nA reminder from last month\u2019s NBC/Marist poll of Mississippi: President Donald Trump\u2019s job rating among likely voters in the state was 60 percent and Hyde-Smith led Espy in a hypothetical runoff by 14 points, 50 percent to 36 percent.\n\n2020 Watch\n\nThe New Hampshire Democratic Party announced yesterday that Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., will headline a post-election victory celebration in the Granite State on Dec. 8.\n\nNBC\u2019s Mike Memoli reports that Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 plans remain \u201cin a holding pattern.\"\n\nAnd Politico says that Tom Steyer is taking steps towards a presidential bid. \u201cThat will include a six-figure web ad buy on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, along with a full-page ad in USA Today and other Gannett newspapers outlining a political platform, a revamped TomSteyer.com and the announcement of five town halls across the country, the first of which will be in the crucial early primary state of South Carolina.\u201d\n\nHappy Thanksgiving\n\nThis will be our last First Read newsletter of the week.

Brinley Bruton\n\nTextbooks for high school students in Saudi Arabia promote hatred against Jews, Christians, women, homosexual men and other Muslim sects despite repeated promises to return the country to a more moderate form of Islam, according to a report released Tuesday.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League highlighted that some textbooks include anti-Semitic stereotypes.\n\nAmong the goals of Zionism is a \u201cglobal Jewish government to control the entire world,\" one excerpt states.\n\nAnother example reads: \u201cThe hour will not come until Muslims fight the Jews, so that the Muslims kill them, until the Jew hides behind rock and tree, so the rock or the tree says: \u2018Oh Muslim, oh servant of God, this Jew is behind me, so kill him.\u2019\u201d\n\nA third passage suggests that \u201cbeating [women] is permitted when necessary.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and for decades has exported a strict Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam that views Shiite Muslims as heretics.\n\nIntolerance in the kingdom came under particular scrutiny after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks when it emerged that 15 out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi.\n\nSenior clergy subsequently denounced militant Islamist groups like al Qaeda or Islamic State and the government has fired many religious leaders.\n\nHowever, hard-line views endure in some books taught in high schools.\n\nSecondary school students sit for an exam at a government school in Riyadh. Fahad Shadeed / Reuters file\n\nWhile the report notes some improvements, \u201cmuch of the incitement evident in today\u2019s textbooks is still alarmingly similar to what was included in the kingdom\u2019s curriculum around the time of the 9/11 attacks.\u201d\n\nADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt called on U.S. officials to hold Saudi Arabia to a \"higher standard.\"\n\n\u201cThe U.S. cannot look the other way while Saudi Arabia features anti-Semitic hate speech year after year in the educational material it gives to its children,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe ADL also called for \"greater scrutiny of the kingdom's textbooks by the American government.\"\n\nMany of the excerpts highlighted by the ADL are based on hadiths, or accounts of the sayings, actions or habits of the Prophet Muhammad that are used by preachers and jurists, as opposed to the Quran.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's de facto ruler, have been embraced by President Donald Trump as crucial for his administration's regional ambitions.\n\nIn October 2017, Saudi Arabia's King Salman decreed the government would monitor interpretations of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s teachings to prevent them being used to justify violence or terrorism.\n\nAnd as part of a worldwide rebranding effort, Prince Mohammed promised to return the country to \u201cmoderate\" Islam.\n\nIn 2004, the State Department designated Saudi Arabia a \u201ccountry of particular concern\u201d under the International Religious Freedom Act for particularly severe violations. It has done so annually since. The act imposes measures on countries for having \"engaged in or tolerated egregious violations of religious freedom.\"\n\nSuch a designation should trigger penalties, including economic sanctions, arms embargoes, and travel and visa restrictions. But the U.S. government had a waiver on penalties in place since 2006, allowing Washington to continue economic and security cooperation with Riyadh, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nOn May 29, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback called out Saudi Arabia for not recognizing the right of non-Muslims to \u201cpractice their religion in public\" stating that it \"imprisons, lashes, and fines individuals for apostasy, blasphemy, and insulting the state\u2019s interpretation of Islam.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "France moves to oust Ghosn from Renault, after charges he secretly pocketed millions", "description": "France owns 15 percent of Renault, which in turn holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan \u2014 an alliance that some analysts think could now fall apart.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/france-moves-oust-ghosn-renault-defends-alliance-n938321", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_02/1375911/160114-renault-mn-0950_47a9fda54b54d29f5c84f6d973fe93c5.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:37:06Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And for the first time since Bobby Fischer in 1972, an American is in contention to become world champion.\n\nBrooklyn-raised grandmaster Fabiano Caruana will bring the prestigious title back to U.S. soil if he can beat Magnus Carlsen, a Norwegian prodigy ranked the world\u2019s No. 1 for eight straight years.\n\nFabiano Caruana Facundo Arrizabalaga / EPA\n\nThe intensity of their rivalry has cemented the evolution of chess from a old-fashioned game of theory to a pay-per-view spectator sport to rival the likes of boxing.\n\nOne-day tickets for the 2018 World Chess Championship final start at $60 \u2014 roughly the price of a typical Premier League soccer game in London \u2014 but many have paid far more for extras like VIP access to players or expert commentary.\n\nThere are no beers, hot dogs or cheerleaders and the pace is slow; the best-of-12 final is scheduled to continue until Nov. 28.\n\nThere are long lines to get inside the 200-capacity venue in London\u2019s Holborn area. The total cumulative global television and online audience is expected to exceed the 2016 record of 1.5 billion.\n\nThe action resumes Wednesday when the players will try to break a deadlock after eight games.\n\nChess has been boosted in particular by the rise of technology and Silicon Valley. Smartphones allow it to be enjoyed by anyone, anywhere, and the governing F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs (FIDE), or World Chess Federation, says an estimated 600 million people play chess each year \u2014 more than any other game.\n\n\u201cSmart is sexy again,\u201d says Ilya Merenzon, the Russian promoter who is World Chess president and runs FIDE's competitions. \u201cIt is cool to be clever.\u201d\n\nGame of equals\n\nThe last time an American became World Chess champion, Richard Nixon was president, Elvis was in concert and it was the height of the Cold War.\n\nFischer\u2019s 1972 clash with Russian Boris Spassky in Reykjavik was an ideological clash of East versus West and his victory ended a 24-year Soviet winning streak. Fischer had publicly decried the Soviet dominance of the game.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s personal. Italian-American dual citizen Caruana, 26, is the official world No. 2 and is ranked almost the same as Carlsen, 27, on ability and performance.\n\nBoth are fashion conscious, have sizable fan followings on Instagram and are far from the stereotype of misfit child geniuses.\n\nIn Norway, where chess is so popular that championship games are shown live on TV, Carlsen is a celebrity and part-time model who in 2013 was voted one of Cosmopolitan\u2019s Sexiest Men.\n\n\u201cEven his dog is famous,\u201d says Merenzon, a softly-spoken doctor of economics with piercing green eyes.\n\nCaruana, who moved to St. Louis in 2014 after growing up in Brooklyn and Italy, enjoys swimming and yoga and listens to Kendrick Lamar and Killah Priest.\n\n\u201cThey are equal, very equal indeed, which is relatively rare at a world championship final,\u201d says Ukrainian chess grandmaster and author Mikhail Golubev. \u201cIt\u2019s 50-50, either of them could win, which makes it really interesting.\u201d\n\nIt also means personal preparation, stamina and style of play will be the deciding factors in the competiton.\n\n\u201cPsychology will play a huge part,\u201d Caruana told The Guardian before the showdown began.

The first-person account of Biden\u2019s closing months as vice president is centered around his eldest son Beau\u2019s brain cancer diagnosis, and the impact Beau\u2019s death had \u2014 and continues to have \u2014 on the Biden family.\n\nIt's the single biggest factor that kept Joe Biden out of the 2016 presidential race, and aides say it may keep him out of 2020 contention, as well.\n\nNext month, the same weekend that New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker travels to New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation-primary state, Biden will be in neighboring Vermont closing out a promotional tour for the paperback. It will be his main public engagement until he makes a final decision about his political future.\n\n\u201cIt will be a family decision. And we have time,\u201d Biden said after casting his ballot in Delaware earlier this month.\n\nIn a new afterword to the book, Biden describes a grieving process that evolved and improved in fits and starts. His first year outside the White House \u201chad been more satisfying than I had hoped in most ways: busy, and consequential, and full of purpose.\u201d\n\nHe also said he remains committed to keeping the promise he made to his son: \"Be engaged, Dad, he was saying.

A close-knit team of aides has been working quietly to put Biden in position to wage a presidential campaign if he chooses to do so. But their preparations can only go so far without a final decision, expected by mid-January.\n\nA top Biden aide told NBC News that Democratic operatives eager to join a Biden campaign have been reaching out to the political team. Some say they\u2019ve received offers from other potential contenders \u2014 Booker was interviewing potential campaign managers just last week \u2014 but that they would hold out for Biden if he\u2019s going to make the jump. No commitments are being made, the aide said.\n\n\u201cHe has a timeline. We\u2019re operating under that timeline,\u201d the aide said.\n\nBiden campaigned in the midterms with gusto, holding a dozen events in the closing week. He made calls throughout election night from to some 40 candidates he had campaigned for or endorsed \u2014 and at least one to a prominent Republican: Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah.\n\nHe also placed a call to Iowa Rep.-elect Abby Finkenauer, for whom Biden had made his only trip to the first-in-the-nation presidential state. A top Iowa Democratic operative called his rally in Cedar Rapids for Finkenauer \u201cthe best, most energized political event of the midterm season.\u201d\n\nBiden has many other advantages with key early state activists, said the operative \u2014 who has been in touch with multiple potential campaigns and requested anonymity in discussing the field.\n\n\u201cHe does not have to be first in and he knows that,\u201d the operative said. \u201cThere's only really one question, and that's tell me how you win.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Josh Lederman and Andrea Mitchell\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The mother of a U.S. diplomat who fell ill after suspected \"health attacks\" in China is speaking out, sharing her family's harrowing story publicly in hopes of raising awareness about the potential danger facing American diplomats and other workers around the world.\n\nLaura Hughes, an Air Force veteran, says her daughter Catherine Werner is struggling with the effects of traumatic brain injury after experiencing strange sounds and sensations at her apartment in Guangzhou, where Werner was a foreign trade officer until being medevaced out earlier this year.\n\nShe's calling on the State Department to do more to solve the mystery that has eluded investigators since U.S. diplomats and spies starting getting sick in Cuba in late 2016.\n\n\"I do not believe that our military, our diplomats around the world or here at home are safe,\" Hughes says in an interview with NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell. \"Because this this weapon system is creating havoc.\"\n\nLaura Hughes says her daughter Catherine Werner wanted to stay at her U.S. diplomatic post in China even after she started showing symptoms of a mysterious illness. Nightly News\n\nAsked whether she fears that what happened to her daughter could happen in other countries, Hughes says, \"That's why I'm here.\"\n\nWerner is the only American diplomat who served in China who the U.S. says is \"medically confirmed\" to have the same symptoms and findings as the 26 U.S. embassy workers who fell ill in Havana. The U.S. government has called what happened in Cuba targeted \"health attacks\" but says it can't identify the cause or culprit.\n\nLast month, NBC News revealed key details about Werner's case and the extraordinary chain of events triggered by a suspected \"health attack\" on a U.S. worker abroad. Now Hughes is coming forward publicly because she says her daughter and the other government workers cannot.\n\n\"It's devastated our lives,\" Hughes says. \"We'll never be the same.\"\n\nWerner is the only U.S. worker in either Cuba or China whose identity is publicly known. None of the Cuba patients have come forward and the U.S. has not named them. Neither Hughes nor her daughter's lawyer, Mark Zaid, objected to her story being made public.\n\nCatherine Werner returned to the U.S. from her diplomatic post in China after reporting symptoms and experiences similar to those of State Department employees evacuated from Cuba. LinkedIn\n\nHughes, too, fell ill and was diagnosed with brain injury after spending time with her daughter in China, medical records reviewed by NBC News show. Hughes is being evaluated by the same doctor in Philadelphia overseeing care for Werner and the Havana diplomats, and is part of a National Institutes of Health study aiming to learn more about the mysterious syndrome.\n\nFor Hughes, the saga started nearly a year ago when she said her daughter's health started declining: nausea, unbearable headaches, and problems with balance, vision and memory.\n\n\"Just struggling and just a shell of what she was,\" Hughes said, recalling how Werner looked during video-chats from Guangzhou. \"She was ashen. Her complexion was off. She looked very, very fatigued.\"\n\nWerner had been hearing unexplained sounds in her upscale apartment and feeling waves of pressure, but didn't connect the dots. Instead, she thought the sounds may have resulted from a malfunctioning air-conditioning unit.\n\nWhen Werner's health worsened, her mother grew so alarmed that she quickly flew to China. She arrived and set about buying new air filters and imported food and water, thinking the city's pollution may have been harming her daughter's health. Nothing worked.\n\nThen Laura started experiencing the sounds and sensations, too.\n\n\"We heard a very high-pitched sound in Catherine's bedroom. And we heard a very low, pulsing sound in the living room,\" Hughes said. \"Our heads would pulse. You would feel like you would want to regurgitate. You could become instantly paralyzed, instantaneously fatigued.\"\n\nBoth Hughes and her daughter also believed they were being surveilled, having noticed signs that their apartment had been broken into. Hughes said they'd discover lights turned on that had been left off, or furniture and other items moved around in obvious signs of an intrusion.\n\nThey adopted a pair of dogs, hoping they would ward off intruders. Soon after, the dogs began acting strangely.\n\nCatherine Werner adopted dogs began experiencing strange symptoms, too. NBC News\n\n\"They would be shivering under the bed when we'd return to the apartment. They would vomit blood,\" Hughes recalled. On one occasion, she said, they came home to find the dogs locked in a room they hadn't been in when Hughes and Werner left the apartment.\n\nHughes starting getting sick, too. She described the feeling as a mental \"fog\" in which everything moved in slow motion.\n\n\"You vomit. You get sick. You feel so sick,\" Hughes said. \"Your head is splitting. You're dizzy. It's a horrible feeling. It's indescribable.\"\n\nAfter three months, Hughes felt she was unable to tolerate it any longer. She headed back to the United States and pleaded with her daughter to come with her. But she said Werner wanted to stay on at her post.\n\nSoon after, embassy security officials started connecting the dots when Werner reported the ongoing suspected harassment and also mentioned the sounds and her symptoms. She was given a series of medical tests, developed after the Cuba incidents to screen potential cases, and her results showed reason for alarm.\n\nSo Werner was evacuated back to the U.S., where doctors at the University of Pennsylvania found vision, balance and hearing problems along with an organic brain injury, medical records show.\n\n\"Their findings were the same as they found for the U.S. diplomats from Cuba,\" Hughes said.\n\nDoctors have said many of the Havana diplomats have brain injuries that look like concussions, except with no known blow to the head. Internal government documents obtained by NBC News show doctors discussing what they're calling a new \"Brain Network Disorder\" acquired by U.S. diplomats overseas, with unique traits never seen before.\n\nAfter Werner's case was confirmed, the State Department tested about 300 more workers in China and evacuated 15 of them to the U.S. for further testing. But other than Werner, the U.S. says none of them is considered a confirmed case.\n\nHughes says that's one reason she is concerned that the U.S. is downplaying what happened in China. She says rather than conducting a transparent investigation, some State Department officials have been \"misinforming and they've been suppressing information.\"\n\n\"Our whole lives are uprooted,\" Hughes said. \"And instead of being helped by the State Department, it's an atrocity how they're taking care of this.\"\n\nStill, Hughes said that on the whole, the U.S. has a \u201cgreat government\u201d that her family has been proud to serve. She expressed gratitude to her and Werner\u2019s doctors at Penn and at Veterans Affairs for their diligence in treating and researching their conditions.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. took \"quick and decisive action\" after a case in China was confirmed.\n\n\"The State Department continues to provide our employees with access to the best medical facilities and doctors in the United States,\" Nauert said. \"We remain vigilant across the globe for any threat to the safety and health of our personnel, their families and U.S. citizens.\"\n\nThe State Department says it still doesn't know \"who or what is responsible for the symptoms that some of our colleagues are suffering.\"\n\nThe strange sounds heard by many of the diplomats in Cuba and China led investigators to initially suspect a sonic weapon. But an FBI report this year ruled out that theory. Now U.S. officials tell NBC News they're considering the possibility of an electromagnetic weapon, possibly involving microwave technology.\n\nBoth Hughes and her daughter remain in intensive rehabilitation to overcome help with balance, vision and cognitive functioning. Hughes says that doctors have told Werner that for the time being, she's unable to work.\n\nSince the Cuba incidents were first reported, skeptics in Congress and elsewhere have suggested they could be psychosomatic symptoms or an outbreak of \"mass hysteria.\" But the U.S. government has said publicly that the concrete medical findings prove that something harmed its workers.\n\n\"Science doesn't lie. These scientists and these doctors and specialists have been working very hard and long on us,\" Hughes said. \"There is no way you can fake this.\"\n\nThe Cuban and Chinese embassies in Washington did not respond to NBC News inquiries about the Werner case. Both Cuba and China have strongly denied knowledge of or involvement in any attacks on diplomats. Cuba has also offered to help the U.S. investigate the alleged attacks."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Three Australians accused of planning attack targeting 'crowded place'", "description": "Prosecutors say the police investigation involved intercepts of 17,000 phone calls and 10,500 text messages plus 7,800 hours of other covert recordings.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/three-australians-accused-planning-attack-targeting-crowded-place-n938301", "urlToImage": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/3446498/1000x563_3446498.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:37:39Z", "content": "CANBERRA, Australia Three men inspired by the Islamic State group were charged on Tuesday with planning a mass-casualty attack in Australia's second-largest city, police said.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Adam Edelman and Dartunorro Clark\n\nThe White House on Tuesday blasted a federal judge for temporarily blocking the Trump administration from refusing asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\nIn a sharply worded statement late Tuesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders excoriated the ruling as \"yet another example of activist judges imposing their open borders policy preferences.\" She vowed that the administration \"will take all necessary action\" to fight the decision.\n\n\"This decision will open the floodgates, inviting countless illegal aliens to pour into our country on the American taxpayer's dime,\" Sanders claimed.\n\nIn a ruling issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar, who is based in San Francisco, wrote that President Donald Trump's \"rule barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country\" outside a port of entry \u201cirreconcilably conflicts\u201d with federal immigration laws and \"the expressed intent of Congress.\"\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the President's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" Tigar, who was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by President Barack Obama, wrote.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also condemned the ruling Tuesday at a press conference near the U.S. border in southern California.\n\n\"This is a dangerous ruling and, given last year's Supreme Court ruling on this issue, will undoubtedly be overturned,\" Nielsen said.\n\nThough she said she would follow the judge's order, she said that the country's \"generous asylum system\" is being abused and pledged to vigorously secure the border from a caravan of migrants, mostly from Honduras, traveling toward the U.S.\n\nShe estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 migrants are attempting to gain entry in the U.S., and that roughly 500 are criminals or gang members.\n\n\"The crisis is real and it is just on the other side of this wall,\" she said. \"DHS and the administration will continue to take all possible actions to stop the caravan from entering the United States illegally without just cause and to ensure our borders are secure.\"\n\nShe also claimed, citing \"historical trends\" and \"intel\" but no specific evidence, that majority of those in the caravan have \"frivolous or unsubstantiated claims of asylum\" and are seeking to exploit legal loopholes to gain entry into the U.S.\n\n\"Wanting a job is not a basis for asylum under U.S. law,\" she said. \"Wanting to live in the U.S (is) not a basis of asylum under U.S. law.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trump signed a proclamation that will make it harder for immigrants to claim asylum if they are caught crossing the border between designated ports of entry, fulfilling a key midterm promise to crack down on undocumented immigrants crossing the Southwest border ahead of the expected arrival of migrant caravans heading for the U.S.\n\nAs a result of the Nov. 9 order, asylum-seekers who do not go through ports of entry were apprehended, detained and deported unless they met a higher bar, such as proving they would be tortured if they were sent home. Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union sued to block the new restrictions, calling it \"the asylum ban.\"\n\nSenior administration officials told reporters on a conference call after the order was issued that the president had the legal authority to issue the order because of sections of immigration law that allow the president discretion over who is admitted into the United States \u2014 the same language the administration used to support its travel ban in court.\n\nUnder international law, however, asylum-seekers are permitted to make a claim regardless of where they enter.\n\nIn his ruling Monday \u2014 which will remain in effect for one month barring an appeal \u2014 Tigar said the Trump administration misused its authority to issue emergency regulations, and agreed with legal groups that had sued the Trump administration claiming that U.S. immigration law allows people to seek asylum even if they enter the country between official ports of entry.\n\nTigar also agreed with claims made by the groups that immigrants affected by the ban would \u201csuffer irreparable injury if the rule goes into effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsylum seekers will be put at increased risk of violence and other harms at the border, and many will be deprived of meritorious asylum claims. The government offers nothing in support of the new rule that outweighs the need to avoid these harms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a statement on the ruling, DHS defended Trump's executive action as \"lawful and appropriate\" in the face of an asylum system that is \"broken\" and \"being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year.\"\n\n\"And it is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled,\" the statement continued.\n\nAs of Monday, 107 people detained between official crossings have sought asylum since Trump's order went into effect, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection.\n\nTrump has argued that the recent caravans are a threat to national security.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, around 3,000 people from the first of the caravans have arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Some Saudi royals turn against crown prince, Reuters sources say", "description": "The House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes.

He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family's senior members, who opposed MBS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead the kingdom\u2019s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MBS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA\u2019s assessment that MBS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MBS ordered Khashoggi's killing \"very premature\" but \"possible\", and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \"nothing else to add at this time.\"\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed's rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi\u2019s security and intelligence agencies.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MBS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MBS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman's wish to make MBS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MBS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Judge bars U.S. from enforcing Trump's asylum ban", "description": "\"Individuals are entitled to asylum if they cross between ports of entry,\" said Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights. \"It couldn't be clearer.\"", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-bars-trump-administration-denying-asylum-migrants-who-enter-illegally-n938271", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_45/2640616/181109-donald-trump-al-1341_d1246b86ca6d21f8b94c116f62b37de9.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T07:15:35Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Adam Edelman and Dartunorro Clark\n\nThe White House on Tuesday blasted a federal judge for temporarily blocking the Trump administration from refusing asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\nIn a sharply worded statement late Tuesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders excoriated the ruling as \"yet another example of activist judges imposing their open borders policy preferences.\" She vowed that the administration \"will take all necessary action\" to fight the decision.\n\n\"This decision will open the floodgates, inviting countless illegal aliens to pour into our country on the American taxpayer's dime,\" Sanders claimed.\n\nIn a ruling issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar, who is based in San Francisco, wrote that President Donald Trump's \"rule barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country\" outside a port of entry \u201cirreconcilably conflicts\u201d with federal immigration laws and \"the expressed intent of Congress.\"\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the President's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" Tigar, who was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by President Barack Obama, wrote.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen also condemned the ruling Tuesday at a press conference near the U.S. border in southern California.\n\n\"This is a dangerous ruling and, given last year's Supreme Court ruling on this issue, will undoubtedly be overturned,\" Nielsen said.\n\nThough she said she would follow the judge's order, she said that the country's \"generous asylum system\" is being abused and pledged to vigorously secure the border from a caravan of migrants, mostly from Honduras, traveling toward the U.S.\n\nShe estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 migrants are attempting to gain entry in the U.S., and that roughly 500 are criminals or gang members.\n\n\"The crisis is real and it is just on the other side of this wall,\" she said. \"DHS and the administration will continue to take all possible actions to stop the caravan from entering the United States illegally without just cause and to ensure our borders are secure.\"\n\nShe also claimed, citing \"historical trends\" and \"intel\" but no specific evidence, that majority of those in the caravan have \"frivolous or unsubstantiated claims of asylum\" and are seeking to exploit legal loopholes to gain entry into the U.S.\n\n\"Wanting a job is not a basis for asylum under U.S. law,\" she said. \"Wanting to live in the U.S (is) not a basis of asylum under U.S. law.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trump signed a proclamation that will make it harder for immigrants to claim asylum if they are caught crossing the border between designated ports of entry, fulfilling a key midterm promise to crack down on undocumented immigrants crossing the Southwest border ahead of the expected arrival of migrant caravans heading for the U.S.\n\nAs a result of the Nov. 9 order, asylum-seekers who do not go through ports of entry were apprehended, detained and deported unless they met a higher bar, such as proving they would be tortured if they were sent home. Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union sued to block the new restrictions, calling it \"the asylum ban.\"\n\nSenior administration officials told reporters on a conference call after the order was issued that the president had the legal authority to issue the order because of sections of immigration law that allow the president discretion over who is admitted into the United States \u2014 the same language the administration used to support its travel ban in court.\n\nUnder international law, however, asylum-seekers are permitted to make a claim regardless of where they enter.\n\nIn his ruling Monday \u2014 which will remain in effect for one month barring an appeal \u2014 Tigar said the Trump administration misused its authority to issue emergency regulations, and agreed with legal groups that had sued the Trump administration claiming that U.S. immigration law allows people to seek asylum even if they enter the country between official ports of entry.\n\nTigar also agreed with claims made by the groups that immigrants affected by the ban would \u201csuffer irreparable injury if the rule goes into effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsylum seekers will be put at increased risk of violence and other harms at the border, and many will be deprived of meritorious asylum claims. The government offers nothing in support of the new rule that outweighs the need to avoid these harms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a statement on the ruling, DHS defended Trump's executive action as \"lawful and appropriate\" in the face of an asylum system that is \"broken\" and \"being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year.\"\n\n\"And it is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled,\" the statement continued.\n\nAs of Monday, 107 people detained between official crossings have sought asylum since Trump's order went into effect, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection.\n\nTrump has argued that the recent caravans are a threat to national security.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, around 3,000 people from the first of the caravans have arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Doha Madani, Alex Johnson", "title": "Police officer, 2 staffers killed in shooting at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, gunman also dead - NBCNews.com", "description": "Orlando Sentinel Police officer, 2 staffers killed in shooting at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, gunman also dead NBCNews.com Breaking News Emails.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Reuters\n\nPeople who are bullied or exposed to violence on the job may be more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than individuals who don't deal with these challenges at work, a European study suggests.\n\nResearchers examined survey data from more than 79,000 working men and women between 19 and 65 years old who didn't have a history of heart disease. Overall, about 9 percent of them reported being bullied and 13 percent said they had been exposed to violence on the job in the last year.\n\nAfter an average follow-up period of more than 12 years, 3,229 people, or about 4 percent of the workers in the study, were diagnosed with heart disease or hospitalized for related events like a heart attack or stroke.\n\nWorkers who were bullied on the job were 59 percent more likely to be diagnosed with heart disease or hospitalized for heart attacks or strokes than those who were not bullied, the study found. And workers who were exposed to violence had 25 percent higher likelihood of developing heart disease or being hospitalized for related events.\n\n\"If we can eliminate workplace bullying and workplace violence, the impact on cardiovascular disease prevention would be similar to if we prevent diabetes and risky alcohol drinking,\" said lead study author Tianwei Xu of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\nDifficult work conditions, including job strain and excessive hours, have long been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but research to date hasn't offered a clear picture of what role might be played by exposure to bullying and violence, the researchers write in the European Heart Journal.\n\nStill, stressors like bullying and violence might contribute to mood disorders like anxiety or depression or fuel unhealthy behaviors like smoking or eating and drinking too much, the study authors note.\n\nSevere stress may also contribute to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease.\n\nBullying, or psychologically aggressive behavior, affected from 8 percent to 13 percent of workers across three different surveys examined in the study.\n\nMost bullies were colleagues, supervisors or subordinates, rather than clients or other individuals outside the workplace.\n\nAbout 7 percent to 17 percent of workers were exposed to violence, which included both threatened and actual physical harms. Most perpetrators of physical violence were clients or people served by workers, not supervisors or colleagues.\n\nCertain professions appeared to have an outsize risk of physical violence: more than 47 percent of social workers experienced this, as did more than 29 percent of personal and protective service workers, more than 25 percent of healthcare workers and more than 16 percent of teachers.\n\nFor the analysis, researchers looked at workers in Denmark and Sweden who were participants in three studies that began between 1995 and 2011. Researchers examined national health registry data for evidence of heart disease.\n\nThe new analysis wasn't designed to prove whether or how exposure to bullying or violence at work might directly cause heart disease or related events like heart attacks or strokes.\n\nAnother limitation is that researchers only assessed exposure to bullying and violence once, when people joined the study, and were unable to see how changes in exposure over time might impact heart health. Researchers also lacked complete data on tobacco use and some other factors that can affect heart disease risk, like marital stress and personality.\n\nPre-existing psychological conditions, childhood experiences and coping skills may all influence whether or how much workplace exposure to bullying or violence might contribute to the risk for heart disease, said the author of an accompanying editorial, Christoph Herrmann-Lingen of the University of Gottingen Medical Center in Germany.\n\nBut that doesn't mean workers should ignore these problems, Herrmann-Lingen said by email.\n\n\"Workers who feel bullied or those who experience threat of violence or actual violence should take these events seriously and seek support for solving the underlying conflicts and obtaining support in dealing with the resulting emotional distress,\" he advised."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Daniella Silva, Ezra Kaplan", "title": "Massachusetts to make history as first legal marijuana shops on East Coast set to open Tuesday", "description": "The Bay State will make history Tuesday with the launch of the first recreational marijuana stores on the East Coast \u2014 more than two years after voters decided to legalize non-medical cannabis.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/massachusetts-make-history-first-legal-marijuana-shops-east-coast-set-n938136", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_47/2651761/181119-marijuana-massachusetts-se-114p_37a13f0b4e48d5b407b20076a3ca4fa7.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:10:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Daniella Silva and Ezra Kaplan\n\nNORTHAMPTON, Mass. \u2014 The Bay State made history Tuesday with the launch of the first recreational marijuana stores on the East Coast \u2014 more than two years after voters decided to legalize non-medical cannabis.\n\nMedical marijuana facilities Cultivate Holdings, in Leicester, and New England Treatment Access (NETA), in Northampton, opened their doors at 8 a.m. to kick off the state's first legal recreational marijuana sales to people over the age of 21.\n\nTwo U.S. military veterans, one of whom is the mayor here, became the first customers to kick off a new, green era. Massachusetts first voted to legalize medical marijuana in 2012 and then voted to legalize recreational pot in 2016.\n\nNorthampton Mayor David Narkewicz, who was in the Air Force, told reporters on Tuesday that he made a \"symbolic\" purchase of a cannabis-infused chocolate bar, which he would be preserving instead of consuming.\n\nStore employees clapped and cheered after Narkewicz made his purchase at NETA.\n\n\"I'm proud that Northampton is playing a role in this historic day ending some 80 years of prohibition here in the commonwealth of Massachusetts and moving into a new modern era where we have safe, tested, well-regulated adult use of marijuana and cannabis,\" he said, to more cheers.\n\nAt a news conference on the eve of the recreational sales, the mayor said he planned to preserve his purchase.\n\n\"My plan actually will be to preserve it and display it because it will be a historic purchase here in the city,\" he said.\n\nStephen Mandile, an Army veteran who served in Iraq \u2014 and medical marijuana advocate \u2014 was the first to buy cannabis at the second store, Cultivate Holdings, in Leicester, on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I probably dreamed about it back in high school that this day would happen sometime, but to be actually able to do it today is amazing,\" he said, according to NBC Boston. \"To have veterans be recognized, not just myself, but to bring other veterans with me and to have it focused around that, it's super special to me.\"\n\nLeicester Police Chief Jim Hurley told NBC News Tuesday afternoon that officials \"saw a much larger crowd than we had anticipated\" at Cultivate.\n\n\"We had figured we could see between 600 and 1000 people and we were at the top end of that,\" he said, adding that there were conservatively still 200 to 300 people in line when he left the facility just after 1:30 p.m.\n\n\"What really made it successful day was we planned ahead but everyone who came was very well behaved,\" he said. \"The crowd was excellent.\"\n\nBy the time the doors opened at NETA Tuesday morning, the line wrapped around the building with hundreds of people stood in the cold rain and snow. Workers from the dispensary gave out hot coffee, donuts, and muffins.\n\nA spokesperson for NETA said Tuesday afternoon that about a thousand purchases had been made at the business so far.\n\nAmanda Rositano, NETA's director of organizational compliance, said at the Monday news conference with the mayor that the business was still prioritizing its medical marijuana patients amid the recreational sales and would be working to inform customers about marijuana use as well as the rules and regulations for consumption.\n\nMitch Rosenfield, owner of nearby store The Hempest, which sells hemp, cannabidiol/CBD products and smoking accessories, said he welcomed the move.\n\nCustomers wait outside the Cultivate cannabis dispensary on Nov. 20. Steven Senne / AP\n\n\"Being the first state on the East Coast to do this, I think we'll see a lot of people from New York, from all over the Northeast who want to check what this is all about,\" he said.\n\nRosenfield said he was glad the state took the time to get things right but noted a few things may have been overthought and \"we've missed out on a lot of tax revenue\" with the delay.\n\nHis store did signature drives, fundraisers and education initiatives in support of legalizing marijuana ahead of the vote, he said.\n\n\"We've been trying to make this happen we fought pretty hard,\" he said. \"We're thrilled to actually see it come to light.\"\n\nKaitlin Scutari, the manager of Pinch Curated Crafted Goods, which sells artisanal housewares, jewelry and other items, said she hoped the sales would bring in more business.\n\n\"It\u2019s supposed to bring a lot of new people in Northampton maybe people who haven't been here before so we're looking to seeing some new faces in our shop,\" she said.\n\nSteven Hoffman, the chairman of the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, told NBC News it had been a \"pretty intense\" and \"nonstop\" process to get to this point since the commission was appointed in September 2017.\n\n\"I think the biggest challenge is just trying to get it right there\u2019s no road map here, plus this is a very controversial issue,\" he said.\n\nA humidity indicator rests in a bowl of a strain of cannabis called \"Walker Kush\" at New England Treatment Access medical cannabis dispensary, in Northampton, Massachusetts, on Oct. 17. Steven Senne / AP\n\nHoffman added the commission were working to \"balance the will of the voters in terms of accessibility, with public health and public safety issues.\"\n\n\"It's not going to be in every city and town in the state, it's not gonna be on every street corner, but it's going to be accessible,\" he said.\n\nHoffman said Massachusetts \"benefited enormously\" from the lessons learned by the states who legalized recreational marijuana before, but that all states were different in demographics and laws.\n\n\"So you can\u2019t just lift and shift from other states, but we certainly can learn lessons about things that they\u2019ve done that worked well and things that they wish they could have done differently,\" he said.\n\nIn Massachusetts, pot shops will be limited in how much they can sell in a single purchase \u2014 one ounce of flower or five grams of concentrate \u2014 and both public consumption and driving under the influence of marijuana are still illegal.\n\nSam Barber, president of Cultivate, said the store would be following those amount regulations for its opening day and it could not make any guarantees on how long its supplies would last. Meanwhile, NETA has set its initial purchase limit at an eighth-ounce of flower per customer.\n\nHoffman said one thing he believed set Massachusetts' law apart was strict requirements for diversity \"not just in terms of employment in the industry but in terms of equity ownership.\" That also includes a requirement to \"help those communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the previous war on drugs to make sure they\u2019re full participants,\" he added.\n\nBritte McBride, the commissioner of the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, told NBC News that while the industry would be expanding, the state required a multi-step application process which included stringent background checks and inspections to ensure new business would be compliant with the law.\n\nMandile, the Army veteran had previously told the Boston Globe that he was able to kick a crippling painkiller addiction by using marijuana to treat his PTSD, traumatic brain injury and chronic pain.\n\n\u201cI get to make history,\u201d Mandile told the Globe. \u201cIt means a lot, and I never expected this would be the outcome of my advocacy \u2014 I was just trying to go about helping people. I\u2019m pumped to break the stigma and the weird, scary aura people want to put around cannabis.\u201d\n\nEzra Kaplan reported from Northampton, Mass., and Daniella Silva from New York."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Trump has repeatedly broken his oath of office.
