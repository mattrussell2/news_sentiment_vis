Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox every weekday.\n\nHere's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:\n\nSome pro curlers had too much to drink\n\nThe team of Jamie Koe, Ryan Fry, Chris Schille and D.J. Kidby was kicked out of a tournament on Sunday after organizers received complaints from other curlers and fans about their behaviour on the ice. \"They were extremely drunk and breaking brooms and swearing,\" Red Deer Curling Classic spokesman Wade Thurber told CBC Sports' Devin Heroux. \"There was some damage in the locker room and other teams complaining about their stuff being kicked around in the locker room.\"\n\nFry won an Olympic gold medal in 2014 with skip Brad Jacobs. He still curls for Jacobs's team but was filling in as a spare for Koe at the World Curling Tour event, which had a $35,000 purse. In a statement he sent to Heroux, Fry apologized for his behaviour: \"My actions were truly disrespectful and embarrassing \u2014 the committee was right to disqualify us from play.\"\n\nFor many, curling and drinking still go together. At your local curling club, a round of post-game beers can almost seem like part of the game itself. The Brier \u2014 Canada's men's championship tournament \u2014 was sponsored by Labatt for years. Before that, it was a tobacco company, and curlers back in the day could even smoke during games (check out this early-'70s clip from the CBC Archives).\n\nBut the old stereotype of the beer-drinking, dart-hacking curler is going the way of the corn broom. As the game becomes more professionalized (and more lucrative) at the elite level, most of today's top pros are handling themselves like other world-class athletes. They're training year-round and watching what they eat \u2014 and drink. But Sunday's incident is a reminder that curling hasn't gone completely dry.\n\nHere are your weekend winners and losers\n\nWinners: The Calgary Stampeders and Ottawa Redblacks\n\nThese two teams will meet in the 106th Grey Cup game next Sunday in Edmonton after their victories in the CFL's divisional finals. Ottawa overwhelmed Hamilton 46-27 in the East final on the strength of six touchdown passes by Trevor Harris \u2014 a CFL playoff record. Calgary is off to its third straight Grey Cup game after beating Winnipeg 22-14 in the West final.\n\nOddsmakers installed the Stampeders as four-point favourites and the pressure will be on them \u2014 they were also favoured to win in 2016 and '17 before losing to, respectively, Ottawa and Toronto.\n\nLoser: People with weak stomachs\n\nThis is crazy. Thirty-three years to the day that Joe Theismann suffered the most famous injury in football history, an eerily similar (and gross) thing happened to the man playing the same position for the same team.\n\nWashington quarterback Alex Smith broke two bones in his right leg after multiple players sacked him, leaving his ankle bent at an impossible angle. As if it wasn't strange enough already, Theismann was in attendance. \"It was surreal,\" said the man whose career ended at the hands of Lawrence Taylor. \"You see him go down in a pile and then there's a shot that showed his leg bent and I turned away right after that. I feel so bad for him.\"\n\nWinners: Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints\n\nThe hottest team in football won its ninth game in a row, routing defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia 48-7. Brees threw four touchdown passes and now has 25 this year \u2014 against only one interception. If he keeps this up, pro football's all-time passing yards leader could finally snag his first NFL MVP award.\n\nWinner: Brooke Henderson\n\nOK, she didn't quite win. But with her 10th-place showing in the final LPGA tournament of the year, the 21-year-old Canadian finished second in the tour's season-long points competition. Henderson posted 11 top-10s and a pair of wins in 2018, including the crowning achievement of her career so far \u2014 her victory in the CP Women's Open. She's the first Canadian woman in 45 years to win her national golf championship.\n\nWinners: LeBron James\u2026 and everyone laying eyes on those Heat uniforms\n\nLeBron scored 51 last night in the Lakers' 113-97 victory over the Heat. It was his first win in Miami since he left there in 2014 to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers (who he then ditched \u2014 again \u2014 this summer to head to L.A.). It was the 13th 50-burger of James's career. We're all winners, though, for getting to feast our eyes on the Heat's Miami Vice-inspired uniforms:\n\nWe're floored too by the Heat's new uniforms. (Brynn Anderson/Associated Press)\n\nQuickly...\n\nCalgary's Olympic bid is officially dead. City council voted unanimously today to stop efforts to land the 2026 Winter Games. The move was basically a formality \u2014 the bid all but died last week when a clear majority of Calgarians who voted in a special plebiscite said no to the Games. Two bids are left in the running: Stockholm and a joint Italian bid from Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nMembers of a high school football team were charged in connection with an alleged gang sexual assault. Toronto police charged six students in connection with the alleged assault, which occurred at St. Michael's College School and was captured on camera and shared on social media. The Canadian Press reported that the charges filed today involved a group of students on the football team at the private, all-boys Catholic school allegedly pinning down another student in a locker room and sexually assaulting him with a broom handle.\n\nRoy Halladay is on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot. The late Toronto Blue Jays pitcher was one of 20 new candidates put up for consideration today. Mariano Rivera, the best closer of all time, was also added to the ballot. Halladay died just over a year ago at the age of 40 when the small airplane he was flying crashed. He won two Cy Young awards, including one with Toronto in 2003.\n\nRemember When...\n\nToday we're starting a new regular feature where we look back at a memorable moment in sports history.\n\nSo... remember when an American team won the Canadian Football League championship? It happened on Nov. 19, 1995, when the Baltimore Stallions beat the Calgary Stampeders to capture the Grey Cup. This affront to Canadian pride never occurred again and probably never will \u2014 by the time the '96 season kicked off, the CFL had ditched its ill-advised three-year experiment with U.S. expansion.\n\nThe Stallions drew well (none of the other four American teams really did) but their fate was sealed just weeks after the Grey Cup when the NFL agreed to let Art Modell move the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, where they became the Ravens. The Stallions packed up for Montreal and became the Alouettes.\n\nYou're up to speed.

Rob Pizzo looks back at nine that are famous for their names. 2:11\n\nThe current Flyers may still carry the \"Bullies\" nickname but they are hardly bullying anyone: They are one of only two teams in the NHL that has not been assessed a fighting major a quarter of the way through the season.\n\nThe old Bullies can hardly believe it.\n\n'Biggest thing you're given is a face wash'\n\n\"They're two different animals, the way the game is today,\" Kelly said. \"With the rules today, you can't hit anybody, you can't verbally intimidate anybody, so that takes a lot out of it. You don't have to fight anybody. The biggest thing you're given is a face wash.\"\n\nIt's no secret that fighting has been weeded out of the game over the years, but nobody expected the Flyers to be on the leading edge of the anti-pugilistic trend. With tough players like Wayne Simmonds, Radko Gudas and Dale Weise, Philadelphia isn't exactly a group of shrinking violets. Even general manager Ron Hextall fought five times during his playing career and he was a goaltender.\n\nThis is the latest in a season the Flyers have ever gone without an official NHL fighting penalty, eclipsing the previous record from 1967. That was the first year of existence for the franchise and it was before the players were beaten up in a brawl against the St. Louis Blues, an incident that prompted founder Ed Snider to demand a tough-as-nails approach.\n\n\"We have a new mascot called Gritty now, and I think the Flyers' fans expect that from then players to play like Gritty because of the name he has,\" said Bullies-era defenceman Joe Watson, who believes the current team is more about finesse. \"Fighting is a form of intimidation. ... Players think twice of going in the corner with this guy or that guy because they might get a punch in the face or hit severely or so on and so forth, and it just doesn't seem to happen right now. We do have guys that can handle themselves. I don't know why it has happened this way. It's hard to believe.\"\n\nPhiladelphia has no fighting majors and a 9-9-2 record through 20 games. While the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers lead the league with seven fights apiece, the Flyers and Arizona Coyotes are the only ones stuck on zero.\n\n\"I think we're team tough,\" Weise said. \"I don't think anyone takes advantage of us. I think if the situation arose, we've got a lot of guys that can handle themselves. But I just think the way hockey is going, you can't take a stupid penalty (if you) go and get an instigator or something like that or get a roughing and put (another) team on the power play.\"\n\nPhiladelphia isn't a small team, with players averaging 6-1 and 198 pounds, but Jakub Voracek said: \"I really cannot say that we are big and tough if we don't have a fight yet.\"\n\nMaybe the answer lies in some of that size and toughness.\n\n\"When you have a Wayne Simmonds on your team, I don't think people want to fight him and it's always good to have a guy like that who can play,\" said Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet, who holds the Flyers' all-time penalty minutes record with 1,815 and 171 fights during his career. \"If there had to be a fight, he's a pretty good deterrent guy to have. I just don't think anybody wants to fight Wayne Simmonds. That's probably why there's no fights.\"\n\nNo willing dance partners?\n\nSimmonds and his teammates have tried to goad opponents into fights and a handful of times have dropped their gloves only to find no willing dance partner. According to HockeyFights.com, less than 16 per cent of games league-wide this season have had a fight, down from 41 per cent as recently as 2009-10.\n\nThe NHL years ago sought to curb staged fights between enforcers, and even a lot of the fighting following big hits has decreased.\n\nIn 2009-10, 171 games included more than one fight. Last season, only 41 games had more than one.\n\n\"I don't feel there's any hate in the league anymore,\" said Kelly, who dropped the gloves 97 times in the NHL. \"The rules have definitely changed the whole game, the whole approach and it's holding back a lot of the physicality that players used to play with. It's not worth the fight, and unfortunately you have to watch your teammate skate off hurt or something because somebody got cheap shot or did something and you just can't afford to want to jump in and help out.\"\n\nFlyers coach Dave Hakstol said people can debate whether the sport is better with less fighting, but most agree there is still a purpose for it. Commissioner Gary Bettman has suggested an occasional fight keeps tensions from boiling over, something Tocchet agreed with.\n\n\"The league's trying to take control of the head injuries, the hitting from behind, the cheap stuff, sticking a guy behind his knee,\" Tocchet said. \"The NHL's trying to clean that up, so you don't need that deterrent of a guy going in there and policing (the game) himself. I still think that there's still a need for fighting in certain places ... The odd time a guy needs to be reminded that he can't do the stuff he's doing on the ice if things aren't being called.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Fatality inquiry report into sledding deaths at WinSport released", "description": "Jordan and Evan Caldwell died from blunt force trauma and neck trauma when they snuck onto the Calgary sliding track at the facility at night with plastic sleds.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/winsport-sledding-deaths-fatality-inquiry-1.4911604", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3439279.1454969837!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/calgary-bobsled-accident-victims-jordan-and-evan-caldwell.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:49:00Z", "content": "The Alberta government has released the results of a fatality inquiry into the deaths of two Calgary brothers who were killed in an after-hours tobogganing stunt at Canada Olympic Park in 2016.

Pepler's work has shown \"pro-social\" intervention is about as effective as \"aggressive\" intervention toward the bully.\n\nMany children and youth don't know how to intervene, even if they sense that what's happening is wrong, she said.\n\nHaving discussions around the dinner table, watching films that address the issues, or talking about possible scenarios can help young people think about what to do about bullying, she said.\n\nIt's also important to make sure kids understand they have safe options other than getting directly involved, like talking to a friend or adult, she said.\n\nPepler said if a young person speaks up alone, it's usually someone with a higher social status, as a common fear is that whoever challenges the bully could become the next victim.\n\n\"We as adults play a very significant role in helping children understand not only how to avoid using their power negatively, but how it feels like to use it positively,\" Pepler said.\n\nWhen a school implements a bullying prevention plan, Pepler said, the intervention rate goes up for both teachers and peers.\n\nAdvocacy group People First Nova Scotia visits junior high school classes to talk about the importance of respecting people with disabilities and how to speak up when witnessing abuse and discrimination.\n\nCindy Carruthers of People First said students and teachers often thank the group for giving them the words to stand up to a bully, either in the school yard or at home.\n\n\"We often say to the kids, if you hear older brothers and sisters or your parents using language they shouldn't use, educate them,\" Carruthers said.\n\nShe said parents should also be educated about these issues, and she often senses her group's anti-bullying themes haven't been discussed with kids at home before.\n\n\"Kids don't just make this stuff up.

Mockford said Monday they live in four separate areas around the province: Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site, McGowan Lake, Pleasant River and Bang's Falls.\n\nHe also said since they were first mentioned in Nova Scotia in the 1950s, their numbers have always been low. Mockford estimates there are fewer than 500 adult Blanding's turtles left in the province.\n\nSteve Mockford, associate professor of biology at Acadia, says there's hope for the reptile species at risk. (Submitted by Steve Mockford)\n\nTurtles are a challenge for conservationists because their long lifespan includes a 15- to 20-year period before maturity. Waiting for them to gain maturity before they reproduce means growth in population takes a long time.\n\n\"So here's both the excitement and the frustration of working with something like a turtle,\" said Mockford. \"The very first nest that we protected [17 years ago], those individuals are only just coming into sexual maturity now.\"\n\nAnd reaching maturity comes with challenges of its own.\n\nMany other animals, like raccoons, target the nests for eggs or prey on the young turtles. But Mockford said efforts to increase juvenile recruitment have been working well in Nova Scotia.\n\nHowever, once the turtles are mature, they face another obstacle.\n\nThe endangered Blanding's turtle lives in four small pockets in Nova Scotia. (Jeffie McNeil)\n\nSome of their habitats \u2014 boggy areas like the edges of lakes and streams \u2014 face modification that challenges the species' survival when humans come along.\n\n\"As cottage development increases, then so does modification of lakefront habitat,\" said Mockford.\n\nConservationists and scientists work to educate homeowners about how they can modify their property while still maintaining a viable habitat for wildlife.\n\nAdding or removing sand from an area, clearing brush, and lawn mowing are all human activities that threaten at-risk reptiles in these areas\n\nThe soil on the side of the road is an ideal place for a turtle to lay eggs. But while the sand is good for nesting, Mockford said the location puts the turtles at greater risk for interaction with vehicles.\n\nThe Eastern ribbonsnake is considered a threatened species. (Jeffie McNeil)\n\nAnd while people may be sympathetic to the well-being of turtles, other reptiles such as snakes can be an entirely different matter. Nova Scotia is home to five snake species, including the Eastern ribbonsnake, which is also at risk.\n\n\"People will swerve on roads to run over snakes,\" Mockford said.\n\nDespite this, Mockford said he's hopeful about conservation efforts for turtles and snakes.\n\nHe cited a common conservation adage: \"Wildlife management is really people management.\"\n\nAnd he said the work they've done with the Blanding's turtles might be working \u2014 it's just too soon to know for sure.\n\nMockford believes educating the public about the role wildlife plays in the environment and about harmful human behaviours is a good way to help at-risk species.\n\n\"They're an integral part of the system. It's a mistake to think we can let this species go or that species go,\" said Mockford. \"These things have inherent value, too.

(Submitted by the Prieston family)\n\nPrieston died of gunshot wounds, as did a dog in the yard. Contois was initially charged with an animal cruelty offence, but the Crown later stayed that charge. Court heard the dog was injured when police arrived, and an officer shot it again to end its suffering.\n\nPoitra and Ducharme pleaded guilty to manslaughter in March and were sentenced to 13 years each, Desautels\u200b told CBC News.\n\nThere was a cop standing over [a] dog shooting [it]. I was like, 'What the f--k happened.' - Witness\n\nThe first-degree murder charge was dropped to second-degree murder for Contois. He is also charged with conspiring to commit robbery with a weapon.\n\nOne of Prieston's loved ones let out a quiet sigh as Contois pleaded not guilty to both charges.\n\nDesautels said in his opening statement that Ducharme and Poitra, then 25, hatched a plan to steal back a gold chain that had been stolen from Ducharme during a drug deal.\n\nThey enlisted help from Contois, then 21, who had an AK-47 style assault rifle, Desautels\u200b said.\n\nThey traced the suspected thieves to a home on Wellington, which they scouted out earlier on the day of the shooting, Desautels said.\n\nThey bought meat from a nearby store, which was caught on camera, said Desautels, to toss to a dog in the yard and keep it from getting in the way.\n\nRushed to hospital\n\nCourt heard they planned to work their way into the house and possibly hold someone hostage there until the chain was turned over. They didn't expect the tall, roughly 260-pound Prieston to be there and \"put up a fight,\" Desautels said.\n\nContois fired more than one shot toward Prieston\u200b before taking off, the courtroom was told. Prieston, 29, was rushed to hospital with gunshot injuries but died.\n\nOfficers arrested Ducharme and Poitra about two days after the shooting; Contois wasn't apprehended until six months later.\n\nDuring those months, Contois allegedly told three others about the shooting and that he had no choice, Desautels said. All three are expected to testify, and Toews granted a publication ban restricting the use of their names.\n\n'Felt disrespected' after chain stolen\n\nWitnesses in the neighbourhood of the shooting recorded video of a black car and its license plate outside the home that helped police make arrests. It led them to an apartment on Talbot Avenue.\n\nPolice recovered fingerprints from two vehicles, as well as evidence from the Talbot apartment.\n\nThat apartment is where Ducharme was beaten and robbed of his chain earlier the same day of the shooting, and surveillance footage of the fight was played in court.\n\nOne of the men involved in the robbery told court he was also a drug dealer and gang member, and he was with Prieston the day he was killed.\n\nHe is currently in custody but was brought in to testify. His identity is protected under a publication ban.\n\nHe said he was high when he went to the apartment with a female friend and a man to buy cocaine from a drug dealer he didn't know. When they got there, he said money changed hands but he was never given the cocaine. Then, he \"felt disrespected\" by something the dealer said and the group stole his chain during a fight, he said.\n\n'Everything happened so fast'\n\nHe and Prieston then went to a home to drink and do drugs. While there, he received a call from a woman the pair knew, saying someone had thrown rocks through the Wellington Avenue window of her home.\n\nThe man said he and Prieston raced to the home in a cab, but he got dropped off a few blocks early to stash some crack cocaine he had just acquired.\n\nAs he neared the home on foot, the sight of three men outside sent him off running in the other direction. Then, he says he heard gunshots.\n\nWhen he circled back minutes later, police were already on the scene.\n\n\"There was a cop standing over [a] dog shooting [it],\" the man said. \"I was like, 'What the f--k happened.' Everything happened so fast.\"\n\n'Yelling and pointing at the house'\n\nOfficers testified that three rifle shell casings were found in the yard, and a bullet was pulled out of the wall near the front of the home. Large rocks and shards of glass were found inside near a side window that was smashed, court heard.\n\n\"There was numerous people outside, all yelling and pointing at the house,\" said Det.-Sgt. Rick Hordijk, who was among the first to arrive.\n\nNow-retired Winnipeg police Const. David Mathews testified that a shell casing, blood-stained front step, chipped concrete, bits of hotdogs and a vomit pile on a patio stone appeared to be from when the dog was originally shot.\n\nHordijk said a woman inside was hysterical and asked police to help save Prieston, who was lying on his back in the foyer next to a non-lethal air-soft gun. The gun was moved into the living room when paramedics arrived.\n\n2 gunshots\n\nAs the paramedics tended to Prieston, the sound of two gunshots rang out just outside, alarming the paramedics.\n\nAnother officer, Const. Erin Sesak, had shot the injured dog to end its suffering, Hordijk said.\n\n\"He's a dog lover and thought just for the sake of the dog he would, you know, put the dog down and put it out of its misery,\" said Hordijk.\n\n\"I said maybe next time voice that so we know it's coming.\"\n\nSesak, a seven-year member of the force, told Mitch Enright, one of Contois' defence lawyers, that he does not recall that conversation with Hordijk.\n\nHe said he noticed what looked like a trail of blood leading from the suspected vomit pile, hotdogs and blood-stained front steps and followed it to the side of the building where he found the injured dog.\n\nHis supervisor gave him the OK to do the \"humane thing,\" Sesak said. He believed his supervisor then over the radio announced the imminent shooting to other police in the area, though he couldn't be sure.\n\nA 40-calibre shell from the officer's gun was found outside near where the dog was killed, court heard.\n\nContois' trial is expected to last about two weeks."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Highway 2 interchange at Red Deer open to traffic after two years", "description": "After two years and two months of construction, the new Highway 2/Gaetz Avenue interchange in Red Deer is fully open to traffic.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/gaetz-ave-highway-2-interchange-red-deer-1.4911857", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911870.1542658895!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/highway-2-interchange-gaetz-ave-red-deer.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:35:03Z", "content": "After two years and two months of construction, the new Highway 2/Gaetz Avenue interchange in Red Deer is fully open to traffic. \"This section of the QEll has always been a pinch-point for motorists,\" Brian Mason, minister of transportation, said in a news re\u2026 [+719 chars]", "fulltext": "After two years and two months of construction, the new Highway 2/Gaetz Avenue interchange in Red Deer is fully open to traffic.\n\n\"This section of the QEll has always been a pinch-point for motorists,\" Brian Mason, minister of transportation, said in a news release Monday.\n\n\"This new interchange improves the flow of traffic and increases safety on a heavily travelled stretch of highway.\"\n\nConstruction of the $80-million interchange began in 2016.\n\nThe project includes five new bridges, new on and off ramps for northbound and southbound traffic, the widening and realignment of Highway 2, and the integration of the Taylor Drive and Gaetz Avenue interchanges.\n\n\"This was a massive project, and in only two years we have completely changed the way that motorists access Gasoline Alley and the City of Red Deer,\" Jim Wood, mayor of Red Deer County, said in the release.\n\nFinishing work such as final paving, signage, guardrail installation and landscaping will be completed in 2019."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jean Laroche", "title": "Longtime Nova Scotia politician Gerald O'Malley dies", "description": "Gerald O'Malley, whose political influence loomed large in Halifax during the 80s and 90s, has died just a week shy of his 91st birthday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/gerald-gerry-o-malley-politics-municipal-provincial-halifax-nova-scotia-1.4911631", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911849.1542658384!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/gerald-o-malley.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:31:34Z", "content": "One-time Halifax deputy mayor and former Liberal cabinet minister Gerald O'Malley has died.

And could something prevent that parliamentary vote happening in the first place?\n\nIf Britain's immediate future were made into a book, it would break records for the possible multiple endings.\n\nMuch of the uncertainty is driven by the strong opposition to May's \"soft\" EU divorce deal from all political parties, including from many members of her own Conservative Party.\n\nThe draft deal includes a withdrawal agreement that sets out the divorce terms, and also includes the outlines of an agreement on the future relationship between the E.U. and the U.K. \u2014 still to be fully fleshed out.\n\nCritics have poked holes in several parts of it.

(Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nMay has given British lawmakers an ultimatum: vote for her deal or face chaos \u2014 perhaps even a government led by Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThere is a chance that ultimatum is enough to persuade nervous MPs to support the agreement on the table. Britain would then exit the EU on March 29, as planned.\n\nBut there are politicians of all stripes on Britain's fractious political landscape who have other ideas \u2014 starting with members of May's own Conservative Party.\n\nTories hold a no-confidence vote\n\nTo scuttle a deal they don't like, more than a few Tories want to topple May as leader.\n\nThe Sun reports that 42 MPs have submitted letters to a party committee demanding a leadership confidence vote. The rules say 48 MPs have to send in letters before the vote is held.\n\nSo far, they are six letters shy. If they do, and they challenge May but she retains her leadership, she continues on her path as planned towards a vote in the Commons.\n\nIf she loses a leadership vote, both she and her deal are finished.\n\n\"What it will do is mean there is a delay to those negotiations and that's a risk that Brexit gets delayed or frustrated,\" she told Sky News on Sunday.\n\n\"This isn't about me. This is about the national interest. The next seven days are critical.\"\n\nRemoving May \"will send shockwaves through the entire country,\" says Joe Twyman, director of Deltapoll UK, which has done extensive polling on the Brexit pulse.\n\n\"The panic will inevitably set in and then the question will be: 'What happens now, with only a few weeks remaining \u2014 can anything be done?' \"\n\nThe answer right now is unclear.\n\nWhat if the House of Commons votes and rejects the deal?\n\nIf May is unchallenged by her party or if she wins a no-confidence vote, the deal is likely to go to the House of Commons for a vote as she planned.\n\nLarge elements of the Conservative Party, the Labour Party and the Democratic Unionist Party \u2014 which is propping up May's government \u2014 are opposed to the deal as it stands.

There are no guarantees the EU would be sympathetic to requests for changes.\n\nIf a new deal fails, May's government could also face a no-confidence vote in Parliament, and if it loses that, it could mean a snap election.\n\nThat brings on a whole slew of other possible Brexit outcomes.\n\nCan Brexit be delayed?\n\nThe date can be changed if both sides agree. It may be necessary especially if a general election is called \u2014 but it could be done now if the prime minister chooses.\n\nThe current date for Brexit is March 29, 2019. If a general election is called, that leaves little room for a new government to be formed and for making any tweaks to the deal necessary for it to win parliamentary and EU approval.\n\nBrexit but with no deal\n\nBoth the EU and the U.K. agree this is the worst of all possible options because it risks chaos \u2014 so all efforts now are on trying to avoid it.\n\nStill, both sides have put in contingency plans in the event Britain crashes out of the EU, although they have not yet triggered full-scale preparation.\n\nThe existing deal isn't perfect, John Allen, head of the Confederation of British Industry, said Monday in a speech ahead of May's remarks pitching it to their members.\n\nBut it prevents \"the nightmare scenario of a no-deal departure, which would be a wrecking ball for our economy.\"\n\nA new referendum\n\nA sizable number of MPs and a growing national movement have been pushing for a new vote.\n\nThey believe British people should have a final say on whether to leave the EU now that they have more complete information on what it will look like.\n\nMay has been adamant that this isn't an option because the people have already spoken and the will of the majority must be respected.\n\nOthers have warned a new vote risks instability and a loss of faith in the democratic process.\n\nA rain-damaged placard in favour of a second Brexit referendum features pictures of former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and former transport minister Jo Johnson in London on Nov. 12.

So far, the province has one public retailer and one private store. (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)\n\nThe process required Weber's full-time commitment, with the application form alone running to 70 pages.\n\n\"There was a lot of paperwork. A lot of going back and forth with AGLC [Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis] and to lawyers and accountants and what not \u2014 so, yeah, sure learned how to use a computer.\"\n\nThe upshot is that business for Weber has settled at a steady pace of more than 100 customers a day, he says.\n\nHowever, Alberta hasn't been immune to the nationwide supply shortages of cannabis, and the AGLC says it's been diverting much of its supply away from online sales and offering it to retail outlets, to try to compensate.\n\nPackaging panned\n\nB.C.'s only currently-operating private retailer says once more stores are licensed, business should be steady.\n\nBut Tamarack Cannabis Boutique in Kimberley, B.C., which had a lineup on its first day, is reporting another perceived downside of legalization.\n\nOwner Tamara Duggan says her customers, who are from all walks of life, have been surprised by the volume of packaging involved with any legal purchase.\n\nHealth Canada mandates that cannabis \"be packaged in an immediate container that is tamper-evident, child-resistant, prevents contamination and keeps cannabis dry.\"\n\nThat means that loose marijuana is generally sold in a plastic-sealed bottle inside a cardboard box that also contains an information sheet \u2014 and this has led to complaints of unnecessary waste.\n\n\"Many, many times every single day, it's like, 'What is going on here, and why is this necessary?'\" said Duggan, referring to customers' comments about packaging.\n\n\"Say, a year from now, I hope what the product looks like is significantly smaller than what we're dealing with right now.\"\n\nA year from now, Bob Kay just hopes to be in business. He can't quite believe that it's now easier to buy pot one province over than it is in the land of B.C. bud.\n\n\"Alberta, eh,\" he says. \"Who would have thought?\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "How a new bracelet can help searchers find lost dementia patients", "description": "A search and rescue group in the Fredericton area has adopted a new program to help track down people who have cognitive disabilities if they wander off and get lost.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-dementia-tracking-bracelets-1.4911513", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911536.1542648037!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/project-lifesaver-kit.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:10:47Z", "content": "A search and rescue group in the Fredericton area has adopted a new program to help track down people who have cognitive disabilities if they wander off and get lost. \"Primarily we're focusing on those who have Alzheimer's, dementia, autism, or traumatic brai\u2026 [+3160 chars]", "fulltext": "A search and rescue group in the Fredericton area has adopted a new program to help track down people who have cognitive disabilities if they wander off and get lost.\n\n\"Primarily we're focusing on those who have Alzheimer's, dementia, autism, or traumatic brain injuries \u2014 anyone who might be more prone to wandering away or not having the cognitive ability perhaps to find their own way back if they were to become lost,\" said Eric Ferguson, chair of York Sunbury Search and Rescue .\n\nProject Lifesaver uses radio transmitter cuffs that can be worn on the wrist or ankle.\n\n\"Each of these transmitters will broadcast at an individual frequency and if one of these clients will go missing, we can come out with our specialized receivers tuned to that frequency and find them quickly,\" Ferguson said.\n\nEric Ferguson, chair of York Sunbury Search and Rescue, is urging caregivers of people with Alzheimer's, dementia, autism or traumatic brain injury to purchase a $300 tracking bracelet to help find them if they get lost.

The next year, she started the collection and founded MakeItMerry, the group that organizes the effort.\n\n\"Because I know how much I love that, and so it sort of went from there,\" she said.\n\nShe's received cards from as far away as China, and school kids in Alberta send in handmade ones as a class.\n\nAny surplus cards are taken to shelters in other cities or saved for the next year, Marshall said.\n\nMakeItMerry organizer Barb Marshall says the cards from kids are especially popular. (Make It Merry)\n\nIf you'd like to send a card but you're not sure what to write, Marshall has a few tips:\n\nStart your card with a general but personal greeting, such as \"dear friend,\" or \"hi, how are you.\"\n\nSay something about yourself, like if you're a teacher or have three kids.\n\nIf a kid is making a card, consider telling a joke or drawing a picture.\n\nKeep the message friendly with thoughts like you hope they have a nice Christmas, that they stay warm and have a great New Year.\n\nSign the card by hand with your first name.\n\nThe group also asks that you send the card in an unsealed envelope as all cards are read by volunteers to ensure the messages are positive.\n\n\"There's this invisibility factor with those that are homeless, so the purpose of the card is to make someone who deserves some merry at Christmas to feel loved and cared for,\" Marshall said.\n\nSome teachers around Alberta have their students make cards, like these ones, for the project. (Make It Merry)\n\nOn Sunday, the group is holding a card-making session for people who are homeless who want to write or make a card for their family and friends. The organization, which is a non-profit, will mail those cards for them.\n\nThe event, which will be held at Feed the Hungry in Mission, will provide stamps, cards and pens. A laptop will be available to look up postal codes.\n\nThe group is not a charity, so it can't provide receipts, but it does accept blank cards, craft supplies and stamps. Another session will be held in December at the Drop-In Centre, Marshall said.\n\nCompleted cards can be mailed to: MakeItMerry, P.O. Box 96107, West Springs, Calgary, AB, T3H 0L3, or dropped off at participating ATB locations around Calgary.\n\nWith files from Angela Knight and the Calgary Eyeopener."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Steve Rukavina", "title": "'A prisoner in my own life': Alleged assault victim testifies at trial of Fr.

He sponsored the boy for his confirmation.\n\nThe witness testified that a few days after a high school dance, while driving him home, Boucher said someone had told him that the boy had been \"grinding\" with a girl on the dance floor.\n\nHe said Boucher questioned him about that, then took him to the rectory where he lived and told him to remove all his clothes.\n\n\"He told me to get completely naked so I could be completely honest,\" he testified.\n\nHe said he hadn't wanted to remove his clothes, but Boucher threatened to tell his parents about the \"grinding\" episode if he didn't.\n\n\"I'm small. He's tall and imposing. When he says there are consequences, it's easy to see that would be the case,\" the witness said.\n\nHe says he removed his clothes, and Boucher touched his genitals and other parts of his body.\n\nHe says after that incident, Boucher would question him \"aggressively\" about his masturbation habits, and the alleged assaults continued and escalated.\n\n'I was ashamed of what happened to me'\n\nThe witness said he was an altar boy who was at the church often, and by the time he was in his second year of high school, Boucher began regularly forcing him to give and receive oral sex while at the rectory.\n\n\"He would congratulate me, even though I didn't like it, even though I was sad, even though I was uncomfortable,\" he testified.\n\nHe said in the third year of high school Boucher took him to his bedroom at the rectory and penetrated him anally on three occasions.\n\n\"I was squirming and asking him what he was doing. I was not comfortable. I didn't like what was happening. He just continued. He said he was doing a trick,\" he testified.\n\nThe witness said the alleged assaults stopped when he was 15. He couldn't remember why.\n\nHe said he never told his parents of the alleged assaults at the time.\n\n\"I was ashamed of what happened to me. I was afraid of their reaction,\" he said.\n\nHe decided to file a complaint with police when he was in his first year of university.\n\n\"I was tired of it.

It shouldn't be something anyone else has to go through,\" he said.\n\nJudge scolds defendant\n\nAt one point during the witness's testimony, the judge interrupted and asked Boucher's lawyer to speak to his client about \"curtailing his reactions\" to the testimony, saying she found it distracting. It's not clear what Boucher had been doing.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Boucher's lawyer, James Cocciardi, asked the witness if he understood what sexuality was when he was 12 and the alleged assaults began.\n\n\"Not really. I come from a conservative family,\" he responded.\n\nCocciardi asked if what was happening to him felt strange or odd, or if he felt violated.\n\n\"I was in fear the entire time. I just shut down. I decided to lessen my pain,\" he responded.\n\nThe witness admitted that he went on three trips alone with Boucher after the abuse had ended. He said they went alone together to Mexico for a week while he was a CEGEP student.\n\n\n\n\"I pleaded with my mother not to go. I cried when he told me. My mother told me to go,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe also said he went to Charlevoix on one occasion with Boucher, and later, when he was 18, he visited Boucher in Washington, D.C., where Boucher was pursuing theological studies at the time.\n\nThe cross-examination continues.\n\nBoucher's trial is expected to last a week."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Nathalie Sturgeon", "title": "Kids Help Phone launches nationwide texting program for youth in crisis", "description": "Kids Help Phone, a helpline for youth under the age of 18 seeking counselling, has added texting to its online and telephone services.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/kids-help-phone-texting-program-1.4911609", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4889137.1542324846!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kids-help-phone-crisis-text-line.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:31:57Z", "content": "Kids Help Phone, an organization that offers online and telephone counselling to Canadian youth, has launched a new nationwide texting service.

Watch it here.\n\nUnrest in Haiti\n\nHaiti's government is under siege as public anger grows over allegations that billions in foreign aid has been pocketed by corrupt politicians.\n\nYesterday, six people were killed and at least a half-dozen more wounded amid protests and clashes with police as the country marked the 215th anniversary of the Battle of Verti\u00e8res, a major victory in the slave uprising against the French army that won the island its independence.\n\nMore demonstrations are planned for today.\n\nHaitians protest Sunday in Port-au-Prince, their anger aimed primarily at the misuse of funds from the Petrocaribe program. Through Petrocaribe, Venezuela for years supplied Haiti and other Caribbean and Central American countries with oil at cut-rate prices and on easy credit terms. (Estailove St. Val/EPA-EFE)\n\nIn Port-au-Prince, a crowd of several thousand blocked roads, setting alight bonfires of tires and garbage as they chanted anti-government slogans and waved the old black-and-red flag that Haiti replaced after the Duvalier dictatorship was ousted from power in 1987.\n\nAt one point, protesters threw rocks at police protecting the offices of Prime Minister Jean Henry C\u00e9ant. And there were reports of gunmen in unmarked cars firing indiscriminately into the crowds.\n\nIt's the second round of violent clashes in less than a month, and the unpopular President Jovenel Moise appears to be running scared. He cancelled a planned visit to Verti\u00e9res yesterday and zipped through a wreath-laying ceremony in the capital in under 10 minutes.\n\nHaitians are demanding action after a corruption probe implicated government officials. (Estailove St. Val/EPA-EFE)\n\nThe anger stems from widespread public suspicion of corruption surrounding some $3.8 billion US in money and discount oil that Haiti received from Venezuela starting in 2005 as part of a regional Petrocaribe aid program.\n\nThe Haitian Senate produced reports in 2016 and 2017 alleging that nearly $2 billion of the money, which was intended for infrastructure and economic development projects, was embezzled or misappropriated.\n\nThe probes implicated 14 senior members of the government of former President Michel Martelly in the alleged fraud, but to date no one has been charged. And Moise, who succeeded Martelly as leader of the T\u00e8t Kale [Baldhead] party, is perceived to be doing little to advance the investigation.\n\nThe protests have been spurred by the viral \"Kot Kob Petwo Karibe a?\" campaign, with Haitians from all walks of life taking to social media and demanding to know what happened to the PetroCaribe money.\n\nHaitian Police block anti-corruption demonstrators Sunday in Port-au-Prince. Investigations by the Haitian Senate in 2016 and 2017 concluded that nearly $2 billion US from a Venezuelan aid program called Petrocaribe was misused. (Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMoise's administration has been on dangerous ground since July, when its plan to end government subsidies for gasoline, diesel and kerosene \u2014 hiking prices by almost 50 per cent overnight \u2014 touched off a week of nationwide protests and rioting. The proposal was quickly abandoned and then-Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant resigned, but the dissatisfaction has persisted.\n\nMoise, who barely eked out a victory in the disputed 2016 general election, has said that corruption is the biggest issue facing his nation. But he himself faces unresolved allegations of money laundering, and since coming to office has replaced the heads of both government fiscal watchdogs with his own hand-picked men.\n\nMeanwhile, the country's economic situation grows ever more precarious. The foreign aid that flowed in following 2010 earthquake and subsequent hurricanes has all but dried up, and the government has few domestic revenue sources to tap.\n\nThis year's budget deficit is forecast to be as much as $470 million Cdn. And more than six million of its 10.5 million citizens live on less than $3.15 a day, solidifying Haiti's status as the poorest country in the Americas.\n\nA demonstrator in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, raises his fist Sunday. At least six were killed during the protests. (Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCanadian and American diplomats have reportedly been busy trying to defuse the situation, holding meetings with Moise and parliamentarians, and urging restraint in the face of the protests.\n\nBut the reality is that Haiti remains a basket case, sharing the same rank as Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan and Burundi on the global corruption index, tied for 157th place among 180 nations.\n\nAnd there has been little sign of improvement, regardless of who holds power.\n\nAlthough this weekend's protests brought a fitting close to the official week of \"the audit, corruption and good governance.\"\n\nPower to the North\n\nReporter Nick Purdon and producer Leonardo Palleja travelled to Kingfisher Lake in northern Ontario to look at a project aimed at bringing both electrical power and jobs to remote First Nations communities.\n\nIt's hard to believe that in 2018 there are entire communities in northern Ontario that are powered by unreliable diesel generators.\n\nThat has serious consequences.\n\nIt means reliable health care is a challenge.\n\nIt means even if you build new houses in many remote First Nations, there's often not enough power to hook them up with electricity.\n\nAnd in the community of Pikangikum, there are so many blackouts it can take up to an extra year to graduate from high school.\n\nJethro Moskotaywenene, 28, of Bearskin Lake First Nation, learns to put poles in the ground in Thunder Bay as part of a four-month Line Crew Ground Support training program. He hopes to land a job on the 1,800-kilometre power line project. (Nick Purdon/CBC)\n\nThose power failures can even make travel a problem. When our CBC News crew was waiting to fly north a few weeks ago, we learned that planes couldn't land in Pikangikum because the generators were down and there were no lights at the airport.\n\nNow there's a plan to change all that.\n\nIt involves $1.6 billion of federal and provincial money, and 1,800 kilometres of transmission line. Called the Wataynikaneyap Transmission Project, it will extend Ontario's power grid to 17 remote fly-in First Nations communities by 2023.\n\nThe first phase of the project, connecting Pikangikum to the grid, will be completed sometime around Christmas.\n\nTo fully understand the project's impact, The National travelled to Kingfisher Lake, Ont. \u2014 a remote fly-in community 500 km north of Thunder Bay.\n\nIt's fair to say that even though the transmission line won't get to Kingfisher Lake for a few years, there's a new hope in town. Community members are already being trained to work on the project.\n\nThe stakes are particularly high for 24-year-old Anthony Begg, who dropped out of school part-way through Grade 11.\n\nAnthony Begg of Kingfisher Lake, Ont.

The repair delays have only added to his anxiety, leaving him feeling frustrated and helpless.\n\nSome of the repairs would be cheap and easy, he said: $200 in plywood would repair the dangling soffit above Foulds's door, for example, and would buy his neighbour some piece of mind.\n\nBut under condo board rules, owners are prevented from making repairs themselves.\n\n\"Perhaps that's the law, but that's ludicrous,\" Dacey said.\n\nShannon Hiemstra and Chris Dacey went nearly two months without hot water after their rented condo was damaged by the tornado in September. They and their neighbours are still waiting for other important repairs. 0:36\n\nDacey and his girlfriend Shannon Hiemstra were without hot water for eight weeks after the tornado severed a gas line to their building. Service was finally restored Thursday.\n\n\"Depressing is the best word,\" Hiemstra said. \"No hot water, so no dishes, no clean house, no clean counters. You don't notice it till it's gone.\"\n\nBoiling water on the stove and plugging in space heaters to battle the chill has pushed the couple's utility bill up by about $120 this month, Dacey said.\n\nGrowing impatient\n\nAnother neighbour, Donna Yarrow, is also growing impatient.\n\nYarrow is the only remaining inhabitant of the four-unit condo building that abuts Dacey and Hiemstra's.\n\n\"How could it take so long?\" she asked. \"Nobody's showing up! I know roofers are busy and there's priorities, but these people have had to move out.\"\n\n'Nobody\u2019s showing up!' said frustrated Arlington Court resident Donna Yarrow. (Stu Mills/CBC)\n\nPat Gosson, president of the Arlington Court condo board, said in some cases repairs are needed to roof trusses and other structural damage, work that can't be completed until spring.\n\n\"It's very nice if some people have all day to do nothing but complain about their roof,\" he said.\n\nGosson blamed a shortage of contractors, but also denied that work at Arlington Court has lagged behind.\n\n\"I'm not just a volunteer guy, I'm an owner. I'm not a contractor, I'm not an engineer, I don't go up on roofs,\" Gosson said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Machete, sawed-off shotgun used during home invasion in Winnipeg", "description": "Officers were called to a home in Winnipeg's North End on the weekend after several males armed with weapons forced their way in, police said Monday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/home-invasion-stella-north-end-1.4911523", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898401.1541725057!/fileImage/httpImage/image.PNG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/police.PNG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:02:33Z", "content": "Officers were called to a home in Winnipeg's North End on the weekend after several males armed with weapons forced their way in, police said Monday.

It belongs to the people of Alberta.\"\n\nKenney said he's not ready to rule out government action to force production cuts, but would prefer to see it happen with voluntary measures because \"most Albertans believe markets should try to protect themselves.\"\n\nIf prices don't recover in the long term, the province could experience \"a total failure of investor confidence,\" he said.\n\n'A non-partisan way'\n\nKenney said he wrote a letter to Notley on Monday afternoon, offering to work with her and her new envoys \"in a non-partisan way\" to find solutions to the oil-price problem.

Francis said her peers would call her 'Pocahontas' or ask if she lived in a teepee. She said she was so disheartened by those interactions that she was hesitant to identify as Indigenous.\n\nIn July 2017 she took over as director of Nutsihpiluwewicik, UNB's Indigenous nursing program. Nutsihpiluwewicik is Wolastoqiyik for \"healing clan.\"\n\nThe program's main goal is to help Indigenous nursing students succeed, but Francis said non-Indigenous nurses can take courses on Indigenous health through the program, as well.\n\n'Culturally safe care'\n\n\"Whether the nurse is Indigenous or not, when they see an Indigenous person accessing the health-care system they will be able to provide culturally safe care for that Indigenous person so they don't have to re-experience trauma through systemic racism in the health-care system,\" said Francis.\n\nShe hopes more culturally aware nurses can better serve Indigenous patients.\n\nDarline Augustine is a licensed practical nurse for the Elsipogtog Health Centre and agrees nurses need to understand Indigenous perspectives.\n\n\"The health-care system needs to know the background of Native people,\" said Augustine.\n\nShe has worked in the health-care field since 1993. Augustine said some residential school survivors who suffered abuse might not want to disrobe or participate in other invasive procedures and medical staff need to be aware of it.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Mi'kmaw nurse said the barrier between Indigenous people and medical personnel is a personal one for her. Her father, who speaks Mi'kmaw, has heart trouble and needed to be treated in Saint John at the heart centre.\n\n\"He was so scared that he wouldn't understand what they were saying,\" said Augustine.\n\nHer family was able to go with him. She worries that other elders won't always have that option and wants more Indigenous people to work in the medical field.\n\n\"We need more Native nurses and doctors at the hospitals,\" said Augustine.\n\nComplaint about smudging\n\nFrancis's course on Indigenous perspectives on health and wellness teaches Indigenous history, the history and legacy of residential schools and Indigenous ways of healing.\n\nShe also smudges her students, with their permission, before every class and hopes to bring them to a land-based education class in the upcoming weeks.\n\nBut it hasn't been easy. Francis gets permission to smudge from the university's facilities management but a complaint was made one night recently. Despite having permission to smudge, security forced her to open a window. Francis said she felt humiliated and said interactions like that are another barrier for Indigenous people.\n\nAnother barrier is cost. This summer with the help of another professor she secured $80,000 in funding which went to pay for the land-based education, rawhides so nurses could make medicine pouches, drums and Indigenous medicines, along with honorariums for elders. Francis said elders have a lot of knowledge to offer and should be paid like other professionals coming in to speak.\n\n\"Teaching these nursing students about the connection to Indigenous land and Indigenous health and wellness is important,\" said Francis, adding it's important for everyone to work together toward reconciliation.\n\n\"Every health-care provider needs this education,\" said Francis."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Late pitcher Halladay among new names on Hall of Fame ballot", "description": "Career saves leader Mariano Rivera and late pitcher Roy Halladay are among 20 new candidates on the Hall of Fame ballot for the Baseball Writers' Association of America, joined by 15 holdovers headed by Edgar Martinez.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/roy-halladay-hall-of-fame-ballot-1.4911569", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911576.1542649664!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/halladay-roy-040303-1180.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:50:26Z", "content": "Career saves leader Mariano Rivera and late pitcher Roy Halladay are among 20 new candidates on the Hall of Fame ballot for the Baseball Writers' Association of America, joined by 15 holdovers headed by Edgar Martinez.

And within that star system lies a ticking bomb: a large star that could one day produce one of the most powerful explosions in the universe, known as a gamma-ray burst.\n\nGamma-ray bursts have been observed in other galaxies, but never in our own. These powerful explosions come in two types: long-duration and short-duration. They can give off more energy in a few seconds than our sun will in its entire lifetime. They are so powerful, that it's believed a gamma-ray burst could be behind an extinction event on Earth about 450 million years ago.\n\nThe objects responsible for this poorly understood phenomenon are just as interesting as the gamma-ray bursts themselves. Wolf-Rayet stars are massive, more than 20 times that of our sun. These titans live only a few million years \u2014 a blink of an eye when you consider stars like our own sun live for 10 billion years.\n\nIn a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, an international team of researchers reveals their findings on this new object, dubbed Apep.\n\nApep had been seen in X-ray and radio observations more than 20 years ago, but had never been studied in-depth.\n\nIn 2012, astronomer Joe Callingham, then working on his Ph.D at the University of Sydney, came across the observations. It left him scratching his head. There was clearly something unusual going on.\n\nIn a gamma-ray burst, depicted here, powerful flashes of energetic gamma rays release a tremendous amount of energy in a short time. (ESO/A. Roquette)\n\nHoping to get more data, he booked time on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. What he got back stunned him. There, as clear as day, was an image unlike anything ever seen before: a beautiful pinwheel.\n\n\"This is kind of a once-in-a-career image \u2026 that's just nature right there,\" Callingham said. \"And it kind of captures something special, almost poetic or artistic, rather than just scientific.\"\n\nIt's believed that the curved tails of Apep form as the two stars orbiting at the centre throw dust into the expanding winds, almost like a rotating lawn sprinkler.\n\nWhat the researchers suggest in Monday's paper is that at the heart of the pinwheel are two massive Wolf-Rayet stars (with a third much further away) with winds that collide in the centre and produce dust.\n\nThey calculate the winds are travelling at almost 12 million kilometres an hour, or one per cent of the speed of light. One of the stars is at the end of its life, and will undoubtedly die in a powerful explosion, called a supernova.\n\n\"There's no doubt it will explode. It will go supernova, probably in 100,000 years,\" Callingham said. \"The question is, will it go in a gamma-ray burst? Well, at the moment, if it exploded today, yes, it would.\"\n\nBut whether or not the conditions will remain, astronomers can't say for certain.\n\nThe good news is that, even if it does, it looks like Earth isn't in the line of fire.\n\nCuriouser and curiouser\n\nThe more the researchers studied these stars, the stranger it became.\n\nIt's believed that gamma-ray bursts can only occur in stars with low metallicity, as metals produced in a star's core would slow its rotation.\n\nBut this rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet star is turning that theory on its head, as our young galaxy holds stars with high metallicity.\n\n\"It's an oddball in every way,\" Callingham said.\n\nThis chart shows the location of 2XMM J160050.7-514245, nicknamed Apep, in the constellation of Norma (The Carpenter's Square). (ESO, IAU and Sky & Telescope)\n\nExcited by these findings, Callingham and his team of researchers decided to conduct further observations, hoping to see the dust that would be released from the star moving over time.\n\nOnce again, this weird little star system left astronomers scratching their heads. The dust barely moved.\n\nThe researchers theorize that one star is rapidly rotating, producing fast winds at poles, but not at the equator where the dust would be.\n\nBut another possibility is the system is farther away than believed. Still, that would make it the brightest object in our galaxy.\n\n\"We say that the best model is that it's a long gamma-ray burst progenitor, but actually it's a really unique system that we don't understand, and that's our best model,\" said Benjamin Pope, a co-author and astronomer at New York University.\n\n\"But we need more data. Whatever it is is a highly unusual stellar system \u2026 and that's our best model for it.\"\n\nThe research team hopes to do follow-up observations with other telescopes, and believe that this is just the start of Apep's story.\n\n\"I think people are going to be writing about this star for years,\" Pope said. \"This has baffled all the experts in the field that we've shown it to, which is essentially all of them. I think we're at the beginning of a really interesting story.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Calgary cab driver convicted of sexual assault fails to show for sentencing", "description": "Muhammad Nadeem Irshad, 37, was convicted in June of sexually assaulting passed-out fare.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-taxi-driver-sexual-assault-sentence-1.4911463", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911492.1542648409!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/muhammad-nadeem-irshad.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:29:15Z", "content": "A Canada-wide warrant has been issued for a Calgary cab driver who failed for show for sentencing after being convicted of sexual assault on a passed-out fare.

But he promised to beef up corporate governance, adding that the problems may have happened because too much power was concentrated in one person.\n\n\"We need to really look back at what happened, take it seriously and take fundamental countermeasures,\" he said.\n\nAlready at Nissan for 19 years, Ghosn signed a contract earlier this year that would have run through 2022. His compensation, high by Japan's moderate standards for executive pay, has been an issue over the years.\n\nAccording to NHK and the Kyodo News Service, Nissan paid Ghosn nearly 10 billion yen ($89 million) over five years through March 2015, including salary and other income from the company, but reported as if he only made 5 billion yen ($44 million), or half of what he had received.\n\nNissan's annual securities report shows Ghosn received annual remuneration exceeding 1 billion yen ($117 million Cdn) until fiscal 2016, when shareholders voted against his pay package and his annual pay dropped to 735 million yen ($8.6 million) in 2017, down more than 30 per cent.\n\nShares in Renault SA of France plunged 14 per cent early Monday. The news of Ghosn's troubles broke after Japanese markets had closed for the day.\n\nThe allegations are a serious blow at a time when Nissan and Mitsubishi Motor Co. are still overcoming scandals over their quality testing reporting.\n\nGhosn is credited with helping engineer a remarkable turnaround at Nissan over the past two decades, resuscitating the Japanese automaker from near bankruptcy after he was sent in by Renault.\n\nFor the past two decades, he has maintained an unusually high profile in a nation where foreign chief executives of major Japanese companies are still relatively rare.\n\nHe looms similarly large in France, where the business world saw him as a trailblazer from outside the traditional French mould who turned Renault around and made it into a global player, notably in electric vehicles. He also led the French carmaker through massive job cuts and a costly, contentious bailout amid the world financial meltdown a decade ago and what he called a \"crisis of massive proportions\" for the auto industry.\n\nNemesis for unions\n\nGhosn has also been a nemesis for French unions and left-wing politicians, who saw him as a symbol of globalized, U.S.-driven capitalism and its excesses \u2014 and notably its executive pay packages.\n\nShareholders at Renault voted in 2016 against Ghosn's pay package, seeing it as too generous \u2014 but the board ignored the vote. That prompted the ire of then-President Francois Hollande.

Higgs is relying on the Alliance's three MLAs to keep his minority government in power.\n\n\"We must not let unnecessary language requirements supercede common sense,\" Austin said to a crowd of paramedics and officials, including his two fellow Alliance MLAs.\n\nAt the same time, Lord, a former PC premier who won strong support from francophone voters, is now the CEO of Medavie working with Higgs to resolve the controversy.\n\nLord, whose government made some of the updates to the Official Languages Act that Austin has criticized, was the only non-elected official who spoke and was the one who talked most emphatically about bilingual service.\n\n\"This is an important commitment for us,\" Lord told reporters. \"At ANB we are committed, and at Medavie we are committed through ANB, to providing services in both official languages.\"\n\nWon't pursue judicial review\n\nHiggs said Monday the government still has \"the intention of\" withdrawing a judicial review of a 2018 labour arbitrator's ruling that delved into the language issue.\n\nThe ruling discussed options including lowering the bilingualism staffing requirement in regions of the province where there is less demand for second-language service, or using a \"language line\" device connected to a central interpretation service.\n\nThe previous Liberal government asked for the judicial review of the decision because it appeared to contradict a binding consent order by a judge.\n\nIn that order, the province and Ambulance New Brunswick agreed to provide ambulance service \"of equal quality\" in both languages in all areas of the province.\n\nWants options\n\nHiggs said the province wants to end the judicial review so it can implement the labour ruling, in case it turns out that the transfer system still doesn't free up enough paramedics to meet bilingual requirements.\n\n\"There is a possibility,\" Higgs said. \"We keep that option open, not losing sight of health care being the number one goal.\"\n\nLord said he didn't want to discuss the legal cases in detail, but he said the labour ruling's discussion of a \"language line\" and weaker regional bilingualism requirements were \"recommendations and observations,\" not part of the actual order.\n\n\"The order doesn't touch any of those things,\" he said.\n\nThe only order by the arbitrator was that Ambulance New Brunswick review language requirements for vacant positions and repost the ones where bilingualism is required, using seniority for hiring decisions.\n\nRetired Moncton law professor Michel Doucet, who represented the two Moncton-area patients whose complaint led to the consent order, said he would ask the province and Ambulance New Brunswick to explain how the announcement complies with the order.\n\nSlow response by paramedics\n\nIn October, former health minister Beno\u00ee\u200bt Bourque said a discussion paper on ambulance service revealed a drastic shortage of trained bilingual paramedics and a lack of language training to fill the need where bilingual service is required.\n\nThe document said 51 out of 61 vacant full-time paramedic positions are bilingual jobs, as are 31 of 40 part-time vacancies.\n\nToday's announcement comes more than three weeks after a 13-year-old boy died in an ATV crash in Haut-Lam\u00e8que after family, police and firefighters waited about 45 minutes for paramedics to arrive at the scene.\n\nMedavie recently announced a second ambulance for Saint-Quentin, which fought for two years to get better coverage.\n\nThat announcement came after a cyclist was struck and injured by a vehicle and waited more than 40 minutes before being taken to hospital three blocks away by a passerby."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Laura Glowacki", "title": "Man faces 2nd-degree murder charge after 20-year-old woman shot, killed", "description": "A man faces a second-degree murder charge and seven attempted murder charges after a 20-year-old woman was fatally shot Saturday night near Fraserwood, Man.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/jesse-paluk-1.4911340", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911358.1542644389!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/manitoba-rcmp.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:20:18Z", "content": "A man faces a\u00a0second-degree murder charge and seven attempted murder charges after a 20-year-old woman was fatally shot Saturday night near Fraserwood, Man.

Males and females are similar in appearance, but males are larger, weighing up to 20 kilograms, while adult females grow up to 14 kilograms.\n\nThe animals are listed as a species of concern in the province, which means they are susceptible to human activity.\n\nSpringinotic says wolverines are a part of British Columbia's natural heritage, and seen as mythical creatures that are fearless, tireless and something to be respected.\n\n\"Long before there were movies and comic books about wolverines, First Nations had a real image and myth and story around wolverines because they are such an iconic and quite elusive creature in B.C.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Graham Dunbar", "title": "Olympic powerbroker indicted, faces Swiss forgery trial", "description": "Olympic powerbroker Sheikh Ahmad al Fahad al Sabah temporarily stepped aside from his IOC work on Monday.

A Russian presidential commission concluded that he had been beaten and denied medical care. Two prison doctors were charged with negligence leading to his death, but one was acquitted by a court in 2013 and the other didn't face justice because of a statute of limitations.\n\nU.S.-born Browder, who owned a major investment fund in Russia, has mounted a campaign to bring Magnitsky's killers to justice. He pushed through legislation, named after Magnitsky, in the United States imposing travel and financial sanctions on top Russian officials, including prosecutors. Several other countries have since adopted the Magnitsky Act, including Canada.\n\nRussian prosecutors on Monday announced new charges against Browder, accusing him of forming a criminal group to embezzle funds in Russia.

(CHEK News)\n\nIt's been been more than 15 years since the province last attempted to fix traffic problems at Cathedral Grove. The previous attempt didn't solve the safety issues at the popular site, which brings tourists from around the globe. About 500,000 people visit the site each year.\n\n'It's hairy'\n\nIn the early-2000s, a government plan to cut down some of the ancient trees to make space for a parking lot was met with fierce opposition. Those opposed wrote angry letters, attended public forums and protested at the park.\n\nAnnette Tanner and her husband Scott worked to protect the park during that time with the Western Canada Wilderness Committee.\n\n\"It's very fragile,\" said Tanner about the ecosystem of the park which is surrounded by logging areas and is susceptible to strong winds.\n\nA pathway in Cathedral Grove, which is part of MacMillan Provincial Park. In 1944, forester H.R. MacMillan donated 136 hectares of land to be preserved for its unique stand of trees, mostly giant Douglas firs. (Alberni Valley Chamber of Commerce)\n\nThe province did set up traffic-calming measures, such as lights and reduced speed limits, but the problem along Highway 4 has continued to fester as the number of visits rise. Drivers park along the highway and others get annoyed with delays in getting through the area.\n\nSafety is also still a problem as people often cross the two-lane highway to access trails that showcase the trees, some which are nine metres in diameter and 800 years old.\n\nGet the highway out of the forest\n\nGary and Ronda Murdock have been taking tourists to Cathedral Grove with their company, Pacific Rainforest Adventure Tours, for 18 years. The couple knows the traffic issues well and say some drivers still don't slow down.\n\n\"It's hairy,\" said Gary Murdock. \"I do see a lot of very impatient people.\"\n\nThe Tanners and Murdocks want the province to reroute the highway around the park. They say this option would make Cathedral Grove a destination, rather than a thoroughfare.\n\nThe province said in a release that the aim of the new engagement is to determine how best to address safety and parking concerns at Cathedral Grove, \"while protecting environmental, social and cultural values.\"\n\nExploring Cathedral Grove <a href=\"https://t.co/H1Fs48AZuS\">pic.twitter.com/H1Fs48AZuS</a> \u2014@kylefmacdonald\n\nJohn Jack, who lives near the area, often goes to the site with his children.

Ottawa flies in Aboriginal hunters into the park, and helps them remove the carcass, with the food distributed to Mi'kmaq communities and food banks across Nova Scotia.\n\nThe five-year Bring Back The Boreal Forest reforestation and hunting pilot program saw its budget double from $1 million to $2.1 million, Parks Canada says.\n\nHelicopters used to help hunt\n\nPark conservation manager Rob Howey argues the harvest of 122 animals from an estimated herd of 1,800 since the fall of 2015 has been a worthwhile expenditure.\n\n\"Parks Canada has a proven track record of effective ecosystem management and population reduction is only used in situations where it's absolutely considered necessary,\" he said in an interview.\n\nThe current hunt is expected to conclude in the first week of December.\n\nHe said the use of helicopters is an efficient method for about six Mi'kmaq harvesters to hunt them and then remove the carcass from rugged terrain in the 20-square-kilometre pilot project.\n\nHe says early monitoring of the twigs of balsam fir and spruce the moose feed on in the experimental area has shown a significant decrease in the numbers of trees being eaten before they have a chance to grow.\n\nPreliminary results from a study area showed about half of the twigs were being eaten four years ago, while this year 90 per cent of the twigs being studied were untouched \u2014 increasing the chances the forest will regenerate.\n\nHowever, Rose Courage, a retiree who owns a craft shop in northern Cape Breton, says her access-to-information research applications have led her to view the hunt as overly costly to taxpayers.\n\nPolicing costs added $233K to bill\n\nParks Canada's total cost for the first three harvests was $731,000 with 122 moose harvested, with the biggest ticket items being travel and overtime costs for park wardens, helicopter flights into the remote area, and the cost of airborne moose surveys.\n\nMeanwhile, documents Courage obtained from the RCMP through access to information for the fall period of 2015 and 2016 added about $233,000 in policing costs, with an added $7,141 for overtime last fall. The total doesn't include the basic salary costs of Mounties for the last hunting season, which the RCMP says is not available.\n\nThe Mounties point out in an email that in early years there were protests and opposition that needed police resources, and the costs have fallen since then.\n\nOverall, the average cost of just over $7,900 per moose death is obtained by dividing the Parks and RCMP totals with the 122 moose the park says it had killed in the study area up until last year.\n\nOther access-to-information documents indicate that in Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland, the estimated cost to hunt moose is $1,000 to $1,500 plus the cost of meat distribution, for a program with a similar purpose of forest regeneration, though where terrain and access may differ.\n\nKilling moose 'should be a last resort'\n\nCourage suggests increasing the use of fenced enclosures to keep moose out of certain areas of the park \u2014 a tactic the park is also using \u2014 is preferable to the intensive hunting methods.\n\n\"Cost doesn't seem to be a huge issue as they've already spent close to $1 million killing moose. I believe killing an animal in a national park should be a last resort and it seems to me there are other options,\" she said.\n\nA spokesman for the volunteer Mi'kmaq hunters say there are significant benefits to their communities and to food banks from the thousands of kilograms of meat regarded as a delicacy by the First Nation.\n\nThe moose are among the most prized animals in traditional Mi'kmaq culture, hunted for millennia and with every part of the animal used for food, tools and cultural artifacts.\n\nThe Cape Breton hunt has provided meat for Mi'kmaq communities across the province, and some hides were turned into drums by an elder for distribution to schools, says Clifford Paul, moose management co-ordinator at Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources.\n\nOver three years, the harvest of moose represented over 56,000 pounds of meat, representing 168,000 meals.\n\n\"From a Mi'kmaq point of view we're out there to provide and we're out there to share,\" said Paul.\n\nCost has declined\n\nMeanwhile, some of the costs in the early years are decreasing, say the RCMP and Parks Canada. Howey estimated this year's cost for the harvest is approximately $150,000. In 2015, the cost was $292,000.\n\nHowey said it's not yet known if further harvesting will continue.\n\n\"We're going to take back all the results analyze and determine what the best approach might be to restore the boreal forest.

This photo was sent to CBC News to illustrate an example. (Submitted)\n\nCall centre evolution\n\nThe Calgary Police Service used to run its own communication centre, staffed with civilians who answered calls from citizens and dispatched to sworn members. A staff sergeant and a senior communications manager supervised the call-takers.\n\nCPS says that in order to save money, its call centre was merged with fire and EMS in 2007. After that, police emergency and non-emergency calls were handled by the Public Safety Communications (PSC) centre.\n\nThe same civilians worked in this tri-service model, but oversight by the Calgary Police Service was eliminated.\n\nA few years later, a senior police officer was brought in to help field police-related calls.\n\nThe PSC was then changed to Calgary 911 in 2016, again with no police oversight. CPS says it was a cost-savings move. Instead, each district sergeant is supposed to go through the list of pending service calls to determine the type of response.\n\nHowever, many of the officers who spoke to CBC News confidentially say that's not happening as much as it should because the sergeants are too busy.\n\nThe union that represents the communications officers within Calgary 911 says that as the police call centre evolved over the years, so did the ability of communications officers to act as gatekeepers.\n\n\"What was a police matter, what wasn't a police matter, when you send a car, when you don't \u2014 there were policies in place so it was relatively straightforward when you would or would not send a police unit to a call,\" said Karen Stoshnof, a spokeswoman for the union representing call-takers, on the way the system worked previously.\n\n\"There was much latitude back then. Today, it's different.\"\n\nThis is an example of the scripted cards read by the communications officers at Calgary 911 showing they must ask at the end of a call if the caller would still like to see police. (Submitted)\n\nStoshnof says that at one time, when the call centre was run by CPS, communications officers followed a policy and procedural manual but were able to dig more deeply into the conversation in order to understand the problem.\n\nThese days, Stoshnof says, everything is scripted. She says call-takers must follow a list of questions printed out on a card and the questions vary depending on the issue.\n\nInstead of the latitude of telling the caller 'you don't need the police,' that doesn't really happen so much anymore.

(Monty Kruger/CBC)\n\nPrioritize calls\n\nManagement within Calgary 911 concedes it's an issue and is looking at ways to divert these lower priority calls away from front-line police officers to more appropriate agencies.\n\n\"There are some calls that could be handled differently,\" said Doug Odney, commander of Calgary 911.\n\n\"Whether it's to 311 or to bylaw or to other agencies to assist with those types of events, I agree we have to do some more work with Calgary Police Service to make sure that citizens are getting the proper response. But it needs to be the appropriate response.\"\n\nOdney says Calgary 911 is changing its phone system to better track all of its calls. It is also changing the way it processes calls to prioritize them more efficiently.\n\n\"Is there more work that we can do to make sure that citizens' incidents are responded to more appropriately? Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nOdney says Ottawa faced a similar problem with dispatching calls that weren't police-related matters before coming up with a solution which Calgary is currently studying.\n\nHe says Ottawa's emergency call centre now redirects calls that don't meet the 911 or non-emergency criteria to another area within its call centre where staff take reports, provide information and referrals, freeing up the emergency communications officers to handle the higher priority calls.\n\n\"So that's work that we're looking at right now,\" said Odney.\n\nFront-line patrol members say they have to waste valuable time on 'ridiculous' calls that could be dealt with differently. (Evelyne Asselin/CBC)\n\nCPS is proposing to go to fewer non-emergency calls, such as non-injury crashes, in order to free up more front-line officers as part of its latest budget proposal to city council. The police budget is still pending approval.\n\nBut as for the specific complaints about having to go to \"time-wasting\" calls, Deputy Chief Ray Robitaille says CPS doesn't have any evidence that is happening. So far, he says, he's heard anecdotes.\n\n\"I absolutely understand and agree that we need to have a deeper dive into this issue so that we can see where the data is, because we're hearing that with the loss of sergeants out of there (dispatch), officers are now going to calls that they shouldn't,\" said Robitaille.\n\nCPS has seen its calls spike over the past few years.\n\nSix years ago, 299,918 calls came through dispatch, compared with 379,400 in 2017. But that's a fraction of the service's total call volume. They also get requests online, at the district office or in person.\n\nRobitaille says calls are not only increasing in number but in complexity, too.\n\n\"Oftentimes, it takes a police officer on the ground at the call having those discussions, looking at the scene to make that judgment call, that 'OK, it's nothing more serious than a bylaw call,'\" said Robitaille.\n\nCitizens' responsibility\n\nCPS is in the process of hiring more officers to try to boost the number of front-line patrols to deal with mounting calls and increasing demands on the job.\n\nBut according to one of the officers who spoke with CBC News, he doesn't think that will resolve the underlying issue.\n\n\"To me, the service right now is so scared of saying, actually, 'you don't need a police officer.' They'd rather hedge on the side of caution and send us and let us tell the person, rather than say 'we can't help you,'\" he said.\n\nAt some time you have to be a parent, at some time you have to tolerate a neighbour that blows leaves on your grass.

There's where your frustration is coming from,\" he said.\n\nAnother experienced officer says it wasn't always this way, but over time he's seen a change in the types of calls police are expected to respond to.\n\n\"Fire go to fire, EMS go to people who are sick, police go to everything,\" he said.\n\nSome Calgary police are frustrated by the non-police related calls they are expected to attend during their shift, taking them away from police-related matters. This photo was sent to CBC News to illustrate an example. (Submitted)\n\nCall centre evolution\n\nThe Calgary Police Service used to run its own communication centre, staffed with civilians who answered calls from citizens and dispatched to sworn members. A staff sergeant and a senior communications manager supervised the call-takers.\n\nCPS says that in order to save money, its call centre was merged with fire and EMS in 2007. After that, police emergency and non-emergency calls were handled by the Public Safety Communications (PSC) centre.\n\nThe same civilians worked in this tri-service model, but oversight by the Calgary Police Service was eliminated.\n\nA few years later, a senior police officer was brought in to help field police-related calls.\n\nThe PSC was then changed to Calgary 911 in 2016, again with no police oversight. CPS says it was a cost-savings move. Instead, each district sergeant is supposed to go through the list of pending service calls to determine the type of response.\n\nHowever, many of the officers who spoke to CBC News confidentially say that's not happening as much as it should because the sergeants are too busy.\n\nThe union that represents the communications officers within Calgary 911 says that as the police call centre evolved over the years, so did the ability of communications officers to act as gatekeepers.\n\n\"What was a police matter, what wasn't a police matter, when you send a car, when you don't \u2014 there were policies in place so it was relatively straightforward when you would or would not send a police unit to a call,\" said Karen Stoshnof, a spokeswoman for the union representing call-takers, on the way the system worked previously.\n\n\"There was much latitude back then. Today, it's different.\"\n\nThis is an example of the scripted cards read by the communications officers at Calgary 911 showing they must ask at the end of a call if the caller would still like to see police. (Submitted)\n\nStoshnof says that at one time, when the call centre was run by CPS, communications officers followed a policy and procedural manual but were able to dig more deeply into the conversation in order to understand the problem.\n\nThese days, Stoshnof says, everything is scripted. She says call-takers must follow a list of questions printed out on a card and the questions vary depending on the issue.\n\nInstead of the latitude of telling the caller 'you don't need the police,' that doesn't really happen so much anymore. It's now our people asking the caller 'do you want to see the police today?' - Karen Stoshnof\n\n\"Instead of the latitude of telling the caller 'you don't need the police,' that doesn't really happen so much anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"It's now our people asking the caller 'do you want to see the police today?'\"\n\nStoshnof says that when the scripted cards were brought in several years ago, CPS also changed its protocols requiring the communications officers to ask citizens if they want to see a police officer at the end of each call.\n\n\"Because most people are going to think 'yeah, like I do want to see somebody, I feel better talking to somebody in person,' and that's what the police service decided they wanted,\" said Stoshnof.\n\n\"That is definitely causing a glut.\"\n\nPrior to the change in the service's protocols, she says, call-takers might have been able to resolve an issue by phone, through a referral, or by sending the caller to the nearest district office at their convenience.\n\nNow, she says, police make that decision, often in person.\n\nStoshnof says the downside for citizens is that they can wait for days to get a response because police are just so busy.\n\nDeputy Chief Ray Robitaille says CPS needs to analyze the nature of calls before making any changes. (Monty Kruger/CBC)\n\nPrioritize calls\n\nManagement within Calgary 911 concedes it's an issue and is looking at ways to divert these lower priority calls away from front-line police officers to more appropriate agencies.\n\n\"There are some calls that could be handled differently,\" said Doug Odney, commander of Calgary 911.\n\n\"Whether it's to 311 or to bylaw or to other agencies to assist with those types of events, I agree we have to do some more work with Calgary Police Service to make sure that citizens are getting the proper response. But it needs to be the appropriate response.\"\n\nOdney says Calgary 911 is changing its phone system to better track all of its calls. It is also changing the way it processes calls to prioritize them more efficiently.\n\n\"Is there more work that we can do to make sure that citizens' incidents are responded to more appropriately? Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nOdney says Ottawa faced a similar problem with dispatching calls that weren't police-related matters before coming up with a solution which Calgary is currently studying.\n\nHe says Ottawa's emergency call centre now redirects calls that don't meet the 911 or non-emergency criteria to another area within its call centre where staff take reports, provide information and referrals, freeing up the emergency communications officers to handle the higher priority calls.\n\n\"So that's work that we're looking at right now,\" said Odney.\n\nFront-line patrol members say they have to waste valuable time on 'ridiculous' calls that could be dealt with differently. (Evelyne Asselin/CBC)\n\nCPS is proposing to go to fewer non-emergency calls, such as non-injury crashes, in order to free up more front-line officers as part of its latest budget proposal to city council. The police budget is still pending approval.\n\nBut as for the specific complaints about having to go to \"time-wasting\" calls, Deputy Chief Ray Robitaille says CPS doesn't have any evidence that is happening. So far, he says, he's heard anecdotes.\n\n\"I absolutely understand and agree that we need to have a deeper dive into this issue so that we can see where the data is, because we're hearing that with the loss of sergeants out of there (dispatch), officers are now going to calls that they shouldn't,\" said Robitaille.\n\nCPS has seen its calls spike over the past few years.\n\nSix years ago, 299,918 calls came through dispatch, compared with 379,400 in 2017. But that's a fraction of the service's total call volume. They also get requests online, at the district office or in person.\n\nRobitaille says calls are not only increasing in number but in complexity, too.\n\n\"Oftentimes, it takes a police officer on the ground at the call having those discussions, looking at the scene to make that judgment call, that 'OK, it's nothing more serious than a bylaw call,'\" said Robitaille.\n\nCitizens' responsibility\n\nCPS is in the process of hiring more officers to try to boost the number of front-line patrols to deal with mounting calls and increasing demands on the job.\n\nBut according to one of the officers who spoke with CBC News, he doesn't think that will resolve the underlying issue.\n\n\"To me, the service right now is so scared of saying, actually, 'you don't need a police officer.' They'd rather hedge on the side of caution and send us and let us tell the person, rather than say 'we can't help you,'\" he said.\n\nAt some time you have to be a parent, at some time you have to tolerate a neighbour that blows leaves on your grass. It's just, it's just part of life.\n\nIn the end, he says, providing an \"all-to-everyone\" type of service is hurting morale.\n\n\"Every time we go to work, the board is full and full of calls. Before we even start, we're kind of on our back foot.\"\n\nAnother officer says Calgarians need to realize police can't solve every problem.\n\n\"At some time you have to be a parent, at some time you have to tolerate a neighbour that blows leaves on your grass. It's just, it's just part of life.\"\n\nOne officer even goes so far to say that if it's not an emergency situation, Calgarians should take a few minutes to ask themselves if they are overreacting before making a call to police.\n\n\"Do police really need to go? There are thousand of people every day going through dumpsters in the city,\" they said.\n\n\"I think most people, if they just gave themselves 10 minutes to kind of reflect, I think they would realize this is not something that police, or not something that they would even want their police service to waste their money or resources on.\"\n\nOther patrol members say they're simply uncomfortable responding to calls outside of their training \u2014 for example, being asked for legal advice in a child custody dispute.\n\nCommunications officers handle huge volumes of calls every day. (City of Calgary)\n\nOr disciplining a child in the throes of a major tantrum.\n\n\"And you literally show up and explain for an hour that there is nothing we can do, it's not in our powers. A lot of times police don't even have kids when they show up to these calls,\" said one officer.\n\nBetter gatekeeping\n\nCollectively, the officers who spoke to CBC News agreed something needs to change, whether it's Calgarians' expectations, CPS oversight, scope of police response, a call-taker's authority or dispatch oversight.\n\nOne officer says he has been around since CPS used to run its own dispatch centre, pre-2007.\n\nHe believes the old model worked better.\n\n\"If we go back and look at what we did right back then, and give our dispatchers and call-takers that authority and that knowledge base to say we trust you to do the right thing and we trust that the calls that are put on our board are the right calls, which they used to be, I think that would alleviate a lot of the issues,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the union representing the call-takers says regardless of who is in charge, or where the centre is housed, it's still the communications officers who are the initial gatekeepers.\n\nAnd it appears, she says, that while the police front-line members want the communications officers to do a better job of screening calls, that's not what the upper management within the Calgary Police Service wants.\n\n\"What really impacts the street is the decisions by upper management to tell Calgary 911 'if a citizen wants a car, that's what we want,'\" said Stoshnof.\n\nStoshnof says the service could change its requirements for the way it wants low priority calls handled, and then give this directive to Calgary 911, because right now the communications officers are only following the service level agreement.\n\nShe says that would mean allowing experienced call evaluators to veer off the scripted cards to better assess an individual's issue.\n\nOther police officers say it's not a failure in call-taking but a failure in call supervision by the district sergeants. They are the ones who are supposed to weed through the calls once they've been put through by dispatch and decide what is a police matter or not.\n\nRobitaille says that, regardless, the first step is to analyze the nature of these \"ridiculous\" calls.\n\nThe next step would be to consult with the police commission to see whether these questionable calls still fall within the mandate of the CPS.\n\n\"And if it is, then our options of whether we do it or not are pretty clear: that's our job,\" said Robitaille."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Police chief set to respond to gun violence as Toronto exceeds homicide record set in 1991", "description": "Police Chief Mark Saunders is set to weigh-in Monday on the force's struggle to curb gun violence in Toronto as the city marked its 90th homicide this year \u2014 surpassing a grisly record that stood unbroken for nearly three decades.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/mark-saunders-fatal-toronto-shootings-1.4911083", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4587585.1521723290!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/saunders-toronto-police-chief.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:44:01Z", "content": "Police Chief Mark Saunders is set to weigh-in Monday on the force's struggle to curb gun violence in Toronto as the city marked its 90th homicide this year surpassing a grisly record that stood unbroken for nearly three decades.

(Submitted by Cameron Adams)\n\nCameron Adams is all about building, whether it's building houses around the world with Habitat for Humanity, or his latest project \u2014 building an app to help preserve a traditional Indigenous language.\n\n\"Right now, I'm developing a Swampy Cree language app,\" says the 19-year-old, who is an Indigenous studies student at the University of Winnipeg.\n\nHis accomplishments and dedication to volunteering would be impressive for anyone \u2014 but Adams has done it all while living with a brain injury he suffered as a child.\n\nThat hasn't stopped him from working on his new language app, which will focus on providing English-Swampy Cree translations. His interest in Swampy Cree was inspired by his great-grandmother, who learned some of the language \u2014 a Cree dialect spoken mostly in northern Manitoba \u2014 growing up in Norway House.\n\n\"She's what I would say is a passive language speaker, which means that she understands more of the language than she speaks,\" he said.\n\n\"I've always wanted to learn but it was really hard in my family to learn, because nobody really speaks it [fluently] regularly. \u2026 People speak it every once in a while, but not very often.\"\n\nCameron Adams (front row, left) at a Habitat for Humanity build in Halifax in 2018. 'I like building relationships with people,' the Future 40 finalist says. (Submitted by Cameron Adams)\n\nWhen he was in high school, he became part of a Facebook group called Cree Simon Says, where he learned a few words of the language. From there, he took on a few basic translations, including translating the daily cafeteria special at his high school from English into Cree.\n\nHis interest in learning the language continued after high school, when he enrolled in an introductory Swampy Cree language course at the U of W. But he noticed a lack of resources for learning the language \u2014 so he decided to develop his own.\n\nHe has connected with University of Winnipeg elder Margaret Osborne to work as a translator, and Kevin Waddell, a computer science instructor at Saskatoon's Indian Institute of Technologies, who is working on the technical aspects of the app.\n\nWorking on a team as part of a big project isn't new for Adams \u2014 he travels each year to work on a Habitat for Humanity build (he'll head to Macedonia for his sixth build this spring).\n\nTo fundraise for the builds during his high-school years, he sold tuques that he knitted himself.\n\nThe knitting had a personal side benefit for Adams. \"It helped me de-stress from school because of my anxiety with my brain injury,\" he said.\n\nI like building relationships with people. That's \u2026 kind of who I am.\" - Cameron Adams\n\nThat brain injury stems back to his infancy. When he was six weeks old, he had surgery to address hydrocephalus \u2014 a build-up of fluid on the brain. He was fine until he was 11 years old, when it was discovered the hydrocephalus has returned and he once more needed surgery.\n\n\"Basically, I was given an acquired brain injury due to the pressure built up on my head,\" he said.\n\nEven that led to another volunteer opportunity \u2014 he curls, and volunteers with Special Olympics.\n\nA spreadsheet showing some of the English-Swampy Cree translations for Cameron Adams's tranlation app. 'It's important to bring those languages back to the community, just to inspire youth just like I have been inspired,' he says. (Submitted by Cameron Adams)\n\nFor now, though, his main focus is on his Cree language app \u2014 which he hopes will be part of something bigger.\n\n\"I want to get into Indigenous language revitalization across Canada,\" he said.\n\n\"My goal would be to see immersion schools in every Indigenous language, and immersion camps\u2026. It's important to bring those languages back to the community, just to inspire youth just like I have been inspired.\"\n\nBut whether working on the app, knitting tuques or building a Habitat house, there's one thing that's always in the back of Adams's mind.\n\n\"I like building relationships with people. That's \u2026 kind of who I am.\"\n\nFuture 40 finalist biographies and photos below were submitted by nominators.

(Submitted by Karly Tardiff)\n\nKarly Tardiff never ceases to amaze people around her. She dreams big, like when she organized a fundraiser for CancerCare Manitoba \u2014 it became a world record-breaking event. She also organized the longest chain of ice skaters to raise $146,000 for the charity \u2014 without any marketing budget.\n\nQuickly dispelling any notion that her event and fundraising talents were a fluke, Tardiff organized the #winnipegisgood campaign for Siloam Mission. The campaign drew on the Winnipeg Jets' success in 2018, which boosted city pride to unprecedented levels. In all, she sold 400 sweaters and donated $11,000 to Siloam Mission.\n\nShe continued with the campaign by adapting #winnipegisgood to raise funds for the Rainbow Resource Centre and brought on Project 11 to support the organization's efforts in mental health awareness.\n\nTardiff is more than just a charity virtuoso.

(Submitted by Serenity Joo)\n\nJill Zdunich is owner of Take Care Everyone consignment clothing store, affectionately called Take Care by customers. She is a young, visionary entrepreneur who is leading the way in redefining how people shop and what a neighbourhood shop can be.\n\nTake Care celebrates LGBTQ2S people and body diversity. Her clothing store is organized by colour, and deliberately avoids organization by gender (men's and women's) or size. By collapsing conventional gender divisions, the store allows people of all sexes and gender expressions to shop in comfort equally. At the demand of her customers, Zdunich sometimes curates a \"handsome\" section (as opposed to a \"men's\" section) that appeals to a wider variety of people.\n\nBy ignoring sizes, the store encourages customers to try on items by style. Though these may seem like small details, they have led to a loyal and growing customer base, as the store is well know as a safer space with an inclusive atmosphere.\n\nTake Care Everyone lives up to its name, and the success of it is testament to her inclusive business model that refuses to divorce entrepreneurship and social justice.\n\nWith files from Laurie Hoogstraten."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Alana Cole", "title": "Faster access to drug used to treat alcohol abuse could improve treatment: MD", "description": "When Arlene Last-Kolb's son Jessie, 24, died of a drug overdose a little more than four years ago, she turned to alcohol to help with her grief.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/naltrexone-manitoba-addiction-alcohol-1.4909232", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4909312.1542395772!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/arlene-last-kolb-stands-beside-a-stained-glass-window-her-family-had-made-to-honour-her-son.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:00:00Z", "content": "When Arlene Last-Kolb's son Jessie, 24, died from a drug overdose a little more than four years ago, she turned to alcohol to help with her grief.

Within a two-hour visit, she says, she was able to speak with specialists and was a given a prescription for naltrexone, a medication that is used in treating alcohol use disorder. The drug can reduce the euphoria that is experienced when people consume alcohol and can be effective in helping to reduce cravings.\n\nLast-Kolb was impressed with the treatment she received at the RAAM clinic, but was surprised to find out she'd have to wait to see whether the naltrexone she had been prescribed would be covered by Manitoba's pharmacare program.\n\nShe wanted to start treatment immediately and opted to pay the $95 to fill the prescription that day, but she realizes that might not be an option for everyone. She wants the drug to be more accessible for those who need it.\n\n\"If I couldn't have afforded my prescription that day, I'm positive I would have went home and drank quite heavily for two more days and who knows if I would have came back,\" she said.\n\nNaltrexone is a medication that is used in treating alcohol use disorder. (Rudy Gauer/CBC)\n\nNaltrexone is on a provincial list of drugs that requires the person prescribing the medication to apply for approval through the Part 3 exception drug status (EDS) program in order for it to be covered by Manitoba's pharmacare program. For it to be approved the patient must meet certain criteria.\n\nDr. Ginette Poulin, medical director at the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba, sees cases where it takes up to a week for coverage to be approved.\n\nPoulin says when it comes to addictions, timely access to treatment is crucial for people who are looking to get help.\n\n\"When they walk through that door they're wanting the treatment and if they express that, we really need to make all our efforts to be the most adaptable and receptive,\" she said.\n\n\"We also know the moment they walk out that door is an opportunity lost where follow through might not happen. Sometimes their worlds are very chaotic, they're at risk for relapse, and so we want to do as much things as possible to ensure that we're putting all the cards in their favour.\"\n\nDr. Ginette Poulin, medical director at the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba, spends time working with clients at Winnipeg's new rapid access to addictions medicine (RAAM) clinics. (Alana Cole/CBC)\n\nPoulin describes naltrexone as a front-line medication in treating alcohol use disorder. None of the requests she has submitted for approval have been denied. She says that on a personal level and from the patient perspective she doesn't see why the drug should still be listed on the EDS program.\n\n\"Certainly anything that we could do to reduce that extra paperwork or time barriers certainly is something that we would want to help advocate for,\" she said.\n\nThe province says there have been calls to remove the drug from the EDS program since the opening of the RAAM clinics this fall. In the case of naltrexone, a spokesman said, the potential that an increased number of patients will be prescribed this treatment now that the RAAM clinics are open triggers a review of the current status to improve access for patients.\n\nHowever, there is no timeline on when a change could happen.\n\nPoulin says she's in the process of writing a case to present to government to consider when they're making the decision regarding naltrexone's status.\n\n\"Certainly we've got the ball rolling now,\" she said.\n\nPoulin would also like to see more awareness about the drug and how it can work for some patients.\n\nShe says while opioids and crystal meth are major problems in Manitoba, alcohol is not getting the attention it deserves.\n\n\"When we look at the literature that is out there \u2014 numbers that are provided on a national level, as well as on a provincial level and certainly locally even here at Addictions Foundation of Manitoba \u2014 alcohol is a No. 1 reason in terms of substance use where many of our adults are accessing treatment here at the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba,\" Poulin said.\n\nSince Last-Kolb's son died of a fentanyl overdose in July of 2014, she has worked hard to raise awareness about the need for better treatment and support for those facing addiction.\n\n\"The bottom line is that when people go for help, they need help right away and not that afternoon, not two days, not a week, not a month.\" she said, adding she has contacted the provincial health minister's office to share her story.\n\nLast-Kolb says naltrexone has helped with her recovery.\n\n\n\n\"If this can work for other people the same way it can work for me, well then we need to let people know about it and we need to let people know they can go and access it.\"\n\nLast-Kolb shares memories of her son through art:"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "Low-income bus passes would cost Winnipeg $6M to $15M a year", "description": "Low-income transit passes would cost Winnipeg $6 million to $15 million a year, according to a report that lays out how the city could introduce the discounts favoured by Mayor Brian Bowman.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/low-income-bus-pass-winnipeg-1.4910809", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2552823.1393455348!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bus-pass.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:00:00Z", "content": "Low-income transit passes would cost Winnipeg $6 million to $15 million a year, according to a report that lays out how the city could introduce the discounts favoured by Mayor Brian Bowman.

In response, executive policy committee asked Winnipeg Transit to examine the prospects of creating a low-income transit program similar to discounts offered by the City of Ottawa.\n\nBowman re-committed to the idea of a low-income bus pass on Oct. 1, during an election-campaign appearance.\n\nWinnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman has expressed support for a low-income bus pass. (Lyzaville Sale/CBC)\n\nThe idea ought to be considered as part of budget talks for 2019, Winnipeg Transit finance manager Laurie Fisher recommends in a report that comes before council's public works committee on Tuesday.\n\nThe report estimates no fewer than 13,100 Winnipeg adults in this city would be eligible for the proposed program, based on the number of adults who earn less than Statistics Canada's low-income cut-off and are not also eligible for student or senior discounts.\n\nIn the report, Fisher offers three options for council to consider. Offering 50-per-cent discounts on monthly bus passes to low-income transit users would cost the city $5.9 million a year, based on 2018 prices. Right now, a 50-per-cent discount on a regular monthly adult bus pass would be $50.05.\n\nOffering the same percentage discount to children of low-income adults would cost the city an additional $7.5 million a year, the report states. Adding low-cost single rides to the program would cost another $1.4 million.\n\nThe report does not say where the city would find the money to pay for the program, though it does suggest speaking to the province about the possibility of sharing the cost.\n\nIt also suggests phasing in the discounts over three years, in order to reduce the impact on the city budget.\n\nBowman's office said in a statement the mayor remains committed to this idea.\n\n\"The option to phase in the pass should allow for more manageable costs, which will ultimately need to be considered in the 2019 budget,\" Bowman spokesperson Jeremy Davis said in a statement.\n\nThe mayor's office also noted Winnipeg Transit remains underfunded due to a provincial decision to freeze its funding for transit at 2016 levels.\n\nIn 2017, the province ended a longstanding commitment to cover half of Winnipeg Transit operating costs that are not covered by revenue from transit fares.\n\nThe report was met with guarded optimism by Winnipeg non-profit organizations that advocate on behalf of people with low incomes.\n\n'Where is the funding for this going to come from?'\n\nJosh Brandon, a policy analyst at the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg, said it's encouraging to see Winnipeg take the low-income pass seriously but questioned how effective the program would be.\n\nA 20-per-cent discount in the first year won't do much to help transit riders who are struggling to deal with the 25-cent fare hike this year, which worked out to a nine-per-cent hike, Brandon said Sunday in a telephone interview.\n\nHe also expressed concern transit service would be cut back to pay for the program.\n\n\"Where is the funding for this going to come from? If it comes from existing transit resources, then that's going to be a real concern for bus riders across the city,\" Brandon said.\n\n\"We know right now the buses are overcrowded, we need to have more affordability and better service in routes right across the city.\"\n\nEllen Smirl of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said a sliding scale based on income would be more effective than a 50 per cent discount for low-income transit users. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\nThe Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a left-of-centre think tank, urged the city to consider an even greater discount.\n\n\"While a discount of 50 per cent of regular fare is a positive step forward, even at $50 [per] month, a monthly bus pass is out of reach for many,\" said Ellen Smirl, who authored a CCPA report on transit affordability.\n\n\"Therefore a sliding scale based on income would be more effective at addressing transit poverty. For example, Calgary has a sliding scale of $5 to $50 so that cost is not a barrier.\"\n\nThe union representing Winnipeg Transit drivers said a low-income pass would also reduce incidents of violence on buses.\n\n\"We know that far too often, working people are facing rising bus fares brought upon by the chronic underfunding of Winnipeg Transit, coupled with the elimination of the 50/50 cost sharing program at the city,\" Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1505 president Aleem Chaudhary said in a statement."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Tori Weldon", "title": "What does $48,000 get you in renos?

Leger was unsure how to protect herself, but she asked for references.\n\nGarland says he and Leblanc did remove some siding from Leger's house, the back deck and an interior wall before they stopped working when she told them to leave.\n\n\"We called them, they gave good references, said they were excellent, came in under budget, were always on time, did a wonderful job, yeah,\" she said. \"So I thought it was good.\"\n\nGarland and Leger signed a handwritten four-page contract on May 7.\n\nWritten on loose-leaf paper, it describes the renovations the two men agreed to carry out, including the addition of a second floor, with two new bedrooms and a new bathroom, a complete remodelling of the first floor, including new cupboards, countertops and flooring in the kitchen. Outside, there were to be new windows, a new roof, siding and a back deck.\n\nThe estimated cost was $86,500, and Leger had to pay an immediate deposit of $16,816.\n\nSpending spree\n\nBut Leger's elation at hiring a contractor soon started to drain.\n\nBefore starting work at the house, Garland and Leblanc made numerous requests for money to buy supplies.\n\nIf she acted fast, Garland told Leger, he could get a deal on a front door. He also told her he bought roof trusses, cabinets and windows, lumber, staples, joists, hinges and plywood.\n\nBetween June 4 and June 13, she gave $24,450 to Garland, and she said none of the bigger-ticket items showed up at her house.\n\nLeanna Leger said Mark Garland and Roger LeBlanc walked off the job after she confronted them about missing and stolen supplies. 1:08\n\nSmall things disappeared\n\nWhen Garland and Leblanc finally started work at Leger's house, on July 24, her fears did not subside. By then, she had handed over $48,000 to Garland and had nothing to show for it except $32,000 in receipts for supplies she hadn't seen.\n\nEven after a delivery truck showed up with supplies later that first day, Leger said, she noticed things disappearing from the site \u2014 \"cement, house wrap, nails, anything small.\"\n\nAs the days passed and some of the bigger items still didn't appear, Leger's suspicions grew.\n\nIt didn't help, she said, that Garland and Leblanc spent only an hour or two at her house each day.\n\nHusband pulled out walls\n\nTo speed things up, her husband did some demolition work, including pulling out the ceiling and some interior walls, but this was at Garland's suggestion, Leger said.\n\nThings came to a head Aug. 1, when a second delivery truck showed up with supplies. Garland and Leblanc removed some things from the delivery truck and put them \"straight into their truck,\" Leger said.\n\nShe asked the men to put everything in her garage instead.\n\n\"That's not the way we do things, Leanna, we keep it in our truck,\" she recalled Garland telling her.\n\nWhen she insisted, Garland got angry.\n\nHalf of these people that have problems with me want a champagne job done for a beer budget. - Mark Garland, contractor\n\n\"He started swearing at me and saying, 'I don't know why you guys don't trust us anymore\" and 'I don't know what your problem is' and 'We don't need this' and 'We are blank-blank out of here.'\n\n\"He kept the expensive stuff in his truck and left.\"\n\nSince then, Leger said, she has not seen Garland or Leblanc or the things she paid for.\n\nWon't work 'under these conditions'\n\nLeger's Meadow Brook home is in a state of disrepair. She says Garland took supplies from her job site and stormed off when she asked him to return them. Garland said he didn't steal anything. (Tori Weldon/CBC)\n\nReached by CBC News on the phone, Garland denied stealing anything from Leger and said she has everything she paid for.\n\nHe admitted he'd kept the cupboards at his home but said he returned them to the Meadow Brook site after he stopped working there.\n\nHe's also put some things in his truck, but only because they had to be exchanged, he said.\n\n\"She changed the deck three friggin' sizes,\" Garland said. \"They changed the sinks, the cupboards around, lighting fixtures \u2014 inside, everything was changed. We just we couldn't keep up with it.\"\n\nOn his last day, he said, Leger was checking every item against the purchase order.\n\n\"We don't need to be babysat,\" he said. \"When it came down to it, I said, 'Leanna, we're not working under these conditions.'\"\n\nHomeowners 'tore it apart'\n\nLeger, right, her mother and her husband have moved into the basement. They lug water up and down the stairs and eat on paper plates because the kitchen is gutted. (Tori Weldon/CBC)\n\nAlthough the job wasn't done, he said he kept Leger's deposit because she told him to leave.\n\n\"That's what a deposit is for \u2026 if you book our time and you cancel.\"\n\nHe says the right thing until you cross him or you question him, and then he's arguing and yelling and threatening. - Dena Drysdale , former customer\n\nGarland blamed Leger and her husband for most of the damage at the house.\n\n\"All we did was take a wall inside, take a deck out back and strip the siding,\" Garland said. \"If that house is in bad shape, they tore it apart.\"\n\nHe also said he never asked the couple to help with the demolition work.\n\n\"We did not want their help.\"\n\nMore complaints emerge\n\nAccording to court documents, Garland has been accused before of failing to keep up his end of a deal. There have been two small claims court orders against him since 2015.\n\nDena Drysdale, who filed a claim in April, said she hired Garland to build emergency exit stairs at her Moncton home and gave him a $600 deposit. Garland signed a contract for the work.\n\nBut Drysdale said he quickly ran into trouble getting a building permit and she twice had to take the application, filled out by Garland, to Moncton's building inspection office. She said both times she was told the application was not filled out properly.\n\nOn the second attempt, she called Garland from the office and had an inspector speak with him.\n\nCBC reporter Tori Weldon tells us about a woman who ran into big problems with a local contractor. 12:55\n\nRealized her mistake\n\nGarland \"was arguing with the person at the inspection office and I clearly saw that I'd made a mistake,\" Drysdale said.\n\nShe told Garland she would hire someone else and asked for her deposit back. That's when his demeanour changed.\n\nDena Drysdale says Garland kept a $600 deposit for work he didn't do. (Tori Weldon/CBC)\n\n\"He told me he was going to counter-sue me for the cost of the entire job,\" Drysdale said. \"He says the right thing until you cross him or you question him, and then he's arguing and yelling and threatening.\"\n\nShe filed her claim against Garland, alleging that he did not have the skills for the job. She was awarded $725.\n\nIn 2015, Robert Sakell of Riverview filed a small claim against Garland after a botched job on a shed. Garland signed a contract to repair the barn and shingle its roof and install some siding on Sakell's house. Sakell said Garland cancelled a few times, eventually showing up when Sakell was out of town.\n\nPictures misled\n\nWhen Garland sent pictures of what looked like finished work, Sakell paid him the outstanding balance, only to discover after his return home that the work wasn't finished or done properly.\n\nAsked to clean up the mess, Garland became angry and threatening, Sakell said.\n\nSakell was awarded $1,250 in small claims court because of the unfinished work.\n\nGarland didn't respond to either of the small claims and has not paid the awards.\n\nDrysdale and Sakell said they didn't expect to get their money but felt small claims court was their only recourse.\n\nExpected a lot on 'beer budget'\n\nGarland, meanwhile, said he was aware of the court orders but felt small claims court was not a good use of his time.\n\n\"Small claims, they tell you straight out, even if you win their suit, they're not responsible to collect the money,\" he said.\n\nHe also said that for these three unhappy customers, there are 400 happy ones, though he would not provide any names.\n\n\"I don't want you guys hassling my customers,\" he said. \"Half of these people that have problems with me want a champagne job done for a beer budget.\"\n\nRoger Leblanc could not be reached for comment.\n\nThreatening texts\n\nLeger, Sakell and Drysdale all said they spoke to the police about Garland. Sakell said he showed the RCMP what he considered to be threatening texts from Garland.\n\nThe RCMP said they can't comment or confirm whether they are investigating any of the complaints.\n\nLeger said a lawyer advised her that even if she succeeded with a legal action, she wouldn't get her money back if Garland and Leblanc didn't have assets.\n\nLeger said a local hardware store has volunteered to help her with supplies, and she hasn't figured out a next step as her money dwindles.\n\nThrough tears, she said she has accepted that she won't recover her money but hopes some good can come of her ordeal.\n\n\"I know life isn't fair, but this is really bad, you know. \u2026 I just don't want anyone else to have to go through this.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Southern New Brunswick prepares for another 20 cm of snow this week", "description": "The southern half of the province is going to be hit with yet another snow storm this month.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/environment-canada-snow-weather-special-statement-1.4911080", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908847.1542385773!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/winter.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:58:50Z", "content": "The southern half of the province is going to be hit with yet another snowstorm this week, according to a special weather statement from Environment Canada.

(Bell High School yearbook, 1978)\n\nBeatty, who went on to become a school board superintendent, confirmed he received a visit from the victim's father.\n\n\"He just indicated that Bob's behaviour was a little bit out of line with what you'd normally expect from the teacher,\" said Beatty, now retired.\n\nBeatty said the complaint was vague, and that the father asked him not to take any further action.\n\nHe said he spoke to Clarke and \"indicated that it had to stop.\" The former principal said if he'd fully grasped the seriousness of the situation, he would have gone to police.\n\n\"And I would have asked our board office for an investigation,\" Beatty said.\n\n'He's hurting students'\n\nDiane Langlois, who spent 28 years teaching at Bell High School, worked with all three of the men accused of abusing students at that school.\n\nLanglois said she went to a school administrator in the 1970s with concerns about Clarke after one of her students, a teenage girl, came to her worried about her male classmates.\n\nDiane Langlois worked with all three men, and said she told a high school administrator about one student's specific concerns with Bob Clarke. (Julie Ireton/CBC)\n\n\"He's getting away with things. He shouldn't be doing things,\" Langlois said the student told her. \"I said to her, 'What's he doing?' She said, 'He's hurting students.'\"\n\nLanglois recalls saying she thought the allegations were \"sexual\" in nature, and believed something had been done.\n\nStudent also complained\n\nPeter Hamer, a student in Clarke's music class in the 1980s, said Clarke constantly made sexually charged comments, asked to take nude photos of him and masturbated in front of him.\n\nIn 1986, Hamer complained to then-principal Patrick Carroll. Hamer's younger brother was about to start at the school and he didn't want him facing the same abuse.\n\nPeter Hamer said he warned then-principal Patrick Carroll about Clarke in 1986. (Michel Aspirot/CBC)\n\n\"I said, 'I just don't want him here,'\" Hamer recalled. \"[Carroll] didn't say which school, but he said, 'We can give him other opportunities.'\"\n\nClarke finished the term at Bell, then moved to Sir Robert Borden High School, less than two kilometres to the east. He was replaced by a new music teacher, Tim Stanutz.\n\nCarroll died this past July.\n\nNew school, new victims\n\nIt was at Sir Robert Borden High School that Trevor Fenton encountered Bob Clarke.\n\nBefore one band performance, Clarke asked the 15-year-old if he'd masturbated to relieve the tension.\n\n\"Anyone who speaks in such graphic terms to children has got to be dangerous,\" Fenton said.\n\nIn 1989, when Clarke's sexualized comments became too frequent and personal, Fenton told the school's principal, Marcia Reynolds.\n\n\"She asked me flat out, as I recall, whether this was something I wanted to press a formal complaint about,\" Fenton said. \"That sort of leaves me slack-jawed.\"\n\nThere was no investigation nor formal reprimand, according to Fenton. Clarke remained in the classroom for another three years.\n\nBoard investigates\n\nBob Clarke conducting the Bell High School band. (Bell High School yearbook, 1975)\n\nIn 1992, the Carleton Board of Education, which is now the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB), launched an investigation after another unnamed complainant reported Clarke had made \"sexually inappropriate comments.\"\n\nAccording to the OCDSB, Clarke \"resigned before any decision about termination of his employment could be made.\"\n\nSeveral teachers who taught at the school at that time said they were never told about an investigation, nor were students.\n\nMarcia Reynolds was vice-principal at Bell when Clarke taught there, and was still principal at Sir Robert Borden when Clarke was finally forced out of his job in 1992.\n\nWhen contacted by CBC, she said she has no memory of Clarke.\n\nMarcia Reynolds was a vice-principal at Bell. (Bell High School yearbook, 1986)\n\nThe Greenham case\n\nFranz Glaus in 1975. (Bell High School yearbook, 1975)\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Madeleine Glaus, whose two teenage boys attended Bell High School, heard that teacher and basketball coach Don Greenham was sexually abusing students.\n\n\"He used to squeeze their genitals,\" said Glaus. Victims included Glaus's son, Franz.\n\nAt the time, Greenham was teaching younger children at Bayshore Public School, but also coaching Bell's basketball team.\n\nSeveral victims told CBC the abuse often began as initiation exercises, then progressed to molestation and other sexual activity.\n\nGlaus, now 84, told a principal at Bayshore Public School what she knew. When she heard nothing back, she went to the school board. Eventually, board officials questioned her sons.\n\n\"We both testified to what we knew, what we'd experienced,\" Franz Glaus said.\n\nAnother former principal of Bayshore Public School, Mike Vyse, confirmed to CBC that in the late 1970s, a student told him about Greenham's inappropriate behaviour on a canoe trip.\n\n\"I found it quite unacceptable, childish and ridiculous for a teacher to be carrying on, and I told Greenham so to his face,\" Vyse said.\n\nVyse would not specify what the complaint was about, but said he passed the information on to a superintendent. Soon after, Greenham was moved to a neighbouring school.\n\nMadeleine Glaus's two teenage boys attended Bell High School in the mid-1970s. (Julie Ireton/CBC)\n\nThe Stanutz case\n\nAn undated photo of Tim Stanutz. (Bell High School yearbook)\n\nTim Stanutz, the music teacher hired to replace Bob Clarke at Bell High School after he was transferred, was charged with grooming and sexually molesting two teenage girls between 1997 and 2005.\n\nUnlike with the other two Bell teachers, CBC uncovered no evidence authorities knew about Stanutz's behaviour.\n\nIn a statement of defence to a lawsuit launched against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, the OCDSB denied Stanutz molested students, but if abuse did happen, it was done without their knowledge and was not their fault.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, after former student Laurie Howat finally told a therapist about her sexual abuse at the hands of a teacher 28 years her senior, Stanutz was charged and removed from the classroom.\n\nA duty to report\n\nBell High School isn't alone when it comes to historical sexual abuse by teachers, according to Nicholas Bala, a law professor at Queen's University.\n\n\"It was very widespread, and our society, our institutions did not respond appropriately,\" said Bala, who specializes in child and family law.\n\nTeachers, principals and doctors are among the professionals who have a legal duty to report suspected child abuse. The first duty to report law was drafted in 1965, but only applied to suspicions about parents.\n\nNicholas Bala, a law professor at Queen's University, said historical sexual abuse by teachers was 'widespread.' (Frederic Pepin/CBC)\n\n\"The laws changed in 1978 in Ontario, [then] changed again in 1984. So it was sort of a shifting standard,\" Bala said. \"Now, it's very clear that there would be a duty to report.\"\n\nFormer Bell principal John Beatty agrees that both rules and attitudes were different then.\n\n\"There was a very different set of legalities and processes,\" Beatty said. \"It was only later that, for instance, the duty to report to a children's aid society and so on became something that was very, very firm in people's minds.\"\n\nCalls for an investigation\n\nIn a statement, the OCDSB said it's \"very sorry that a person who was employed by our district could have inflicted harm to a child.\"\n\nThe board said it implemented new policies and protocols in recent years to help staff recognize \"professional boundaries.\"\n\nThe Ontario College of Teachers and the Ontario government also recently strengthened laws to \"better protect Ontario students from sexual abuse by teachers.\"\n\nHowever, the board does not support a new investigation.\n\n\"Given the passage of time since the incidents, the turnover of staff in that period, the limited detail known to us about the incidents and the victims \u2026 we do not believe that an independent administrative investigation at this point is necessary to inform our commitment to student safety,\" the OCDSB said in a statement to CBC.\n\nPeter Hamer, left, and Marc Leach. (Michel Aspirot/CBC)\n\nYears after the abuse they suffered at the hands of the three teachers, many of the victims disagree.\n\nAt Clarke's sentencing hearing, Marc Leach discovered his experience took place decades after authorities were first warned about the teacher.\n\n\"Thirty years later, [the school board is] actively trying to conceal the truth, and that pisses me off,\" Leach said.\n\n\"I want to hear how they let this happen.\"\n\nNeed help?\n\nHere are some resources for victims of sexual assault:\n\nAssaulted Women's Helpline: 1-866-863-0511\n\nAttorney General's support services for male survivors of sexual abuse: 1-866-887-0015"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Zero-emission rules mean fewer electric car choices for most Canadians: Don Pittis", "description": "Zero-emission vehicle laws are supposed to force carmakers to produce and sell more electrics.

(Robert Galbraith/Reuters)\n\nMeant to influence the market without distorting it too much, ZEV rules differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. But in principle, ZEV standards have a single intent.\n\n\"The standard seeks to spur the supply of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and low-emission vehicles (LEVs) to afford \u2026 consumers access to greater numbers and a broader range of plug-in motor vehicles, which are the cleanest and the most technically advanced on the market,\" reads a Quebec government website.\n\nDespite a handy explanatory leaflet, ordinary car-buyers may find the complexities of the rules heavy.\n\nBut in essence, ZEV systems are put in place as an attempt to counterbalance market forces that have made selling internal combustion engine (ICE) cars more profitable for automakers than selling electrics. \u200b\n\nPlease don't buy our cars\n\nThe late Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne once notoriously asked customers not to buy the company's battery-powered Fiat 500e because the business lost money on every one sold, although he reversed that view shortly before his death.\n\nWhile electrics are cheaper for consumers over the life of the car, automakers have been able to make more money selling cars manufactured in old plants using established technology. Dealer repair shops make more from combustion-engine vehicle maintenance since, by comparison, electrics have so few moving parts.\n\nA Nissan Leaf and a Chevy Bolt are shown at Toronto's Electric Vehicle Discovery Centre, run by non-profit Plug'n Drive. A national ZEV program could attract more electric cars to Canada. (Don Pittis/CBC)\n\nWhat ZEV mandates do is force carmakers to increase the percentage of ZEVs and LEVs sold year after year. And if they fail to meet those rising quotas, it forces them to pay what the rules describe as a \"royalty.\"\n\nThat means the most profitable thing car companies can do in the short term is to hold steady the total supply of Canadian electric cars \u2014 and merely sell more of them in ZEV jurisdictions. In other words, in Quebec and in B.C.\n\n\"Most electric vehicles that are earmarked for the Canadian market are likely be going to be going to those two provinces,\" said Woynillowicz.\n\nThe federal government has considered a national plan, with a Transport Canada announcement last year going so far as to promise to develop a Canada-wide strategy to increase the number of ZEVs on Canadian roads \"by 2018.\"\n\nBut according to insiders, an advisory group that included carmakers and environmentalists became deadlocked and the group's report has not been released.\n\nGlobal shortage\n\nIndustry representatives make it clear they don't like pressure from the sudden imposition of ZEV rules.\n\nDavid Adams, the president of the industry group Global Automakers of Canada, called the possibility of a ZEV scheme in B.C. \"disconcerting,\" partly because there just aren't enough cars to go around.\n\n\"The supply issue is a global issue that is going to be with us for two or three more years,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nOntario electric car expert Cara Clairman has a certain sympathy for an industry that has been surprised and overwhelmed by the demand for battery-powered vehicles.\n\n\"To be honest, it's just so much cheaper,\" said Clairman, the CEO of Plug'n Drive, a non-profit organization sponsored by the electric and automotive industries that promotes electric cars.\n\nThe Toronto resident has driven her own Chevy Bolt to Montreal, Ottawa and Windsor.\n\nMitsubishi brought in plenty of its best-selling Outlander PHEV SUV. But other companies may need a nudge from a ZEV program to provide enough electric cars. (Mitsubishi Canada)\n\nClairman said she has noticed more cars being shipped to Quebec since the province adopted a ZEV mandate, but she also notes that places like California have electric cars she's never seen available in Canada.\n\n\"Those jurisdictions with a ZEV mandate tend to get the supply when there's a limited number,\" she said.\n\nPeople shopping for an electric outside Quebec have found some cars \u2014 including the Volkswagen e-Golf and any of the Ford electrics \u2014 hard to come by. But some car companies \u2014 including Mitsubishi, whose Outlander plug-in-hybrid is billed as the world's best-selling electric SUV \u2014 planned ahead and currently has a plentiful supply on dealer lots.\n\nCompanies that lead the way on producing enough electrics will win in the long run, Clairman said. But for others, it's possible the ZEV mandate is necessary to twist a few arms.\n\n\"I think, for quite awhile, most of the automakers didn't want it because they said, 'We'll make sure the supply is there.' But if the supply isn't there, I think there becomes more and more public pressure to have a ZEV mandate.\"\n\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n\nThe 'ZEV mandate' versus the 'CAFE standard'\n\nThose with a passing familiarity with the rules to make cars less polluting may be confused between the ZEV mandate and the existing CAFE standard, which stands for \"corporate average fuel economy,\" that U.S. President Donald Trump has moved to abolish. While the two sets of rules overlap in encouraging greater fuel efficiency, some experts, including those advising the State of California, say the ZEV does not replace the need for the CAFE. While the ZEV mandate gradually increases the percentage of zero and low-emission cars on the road, the CAFE standard requires greater efficiency in the entire fleet. \"When we talk about a zero-emission mandate requiring one in three cars sold 12 years from now be electric, that means that even 12 years from now, two out of three being sold will have a gasoline engine,\" said Dan Woynillowicz. If that occurred, the majority of cars sold could include the highest polluting vehicles \u2014 so long as automakers find them profitable. In theory, said Cara Clairman, after many more years, you will have enough electric cars on the road that the effect would be the same. \"But I don't think California would ever go for that,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Janyce McGregor", "title": "'Striking' APEC confrontation causes uncertainty ahead of G20", "description": "The opening photo call at the APEC summit turned out to be a useful roadmap for what unfolded this past weekend: the commanding presence of China driving its agenda, with an isolated United States pursuing competing goals, leaving others looking very uncomfor\u2026", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/apec-confrontation-us-china-g20-1.4910845", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911069.1542612935!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/papua-new-guinea-apec-pence.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:00:30Z", "content": "The opening photo call at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit Saturday turned out to be a useful roadmap for what unfolded in Papua New Guinea's capital this past weekend.

(Please see Correction notice at the end of this story.) (Aaron Favila/Associated Press)\n\nSuch was the APEC summit in 2018: the commanding presence of China driving its agenda, with an isolated United States pursuing competing goals, leaving others looking very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen trade watchers marvel at the failure of this group to come up with even a general consensus statement on a few issues, they do so because this isn't meant to be a forum for fighting.\n\nCo-operation: it's right there in APEC's name.\n\nAPEC doesn't usually get into security issues or high politics, University of British Columbia Asia specialist Yves Tiberghien said.\n\n\"This confrontation\u2026 as far as I know it was the first time,\" he said. \"It's striking.\"\n\nStark contrast to ASEAN\n\nAPEC is usually a friendly summit, where the head of the International Monetary Fund offers a briefing and affiliated business advisory councils \"engage\" politicians on their regional priorities.\n\nHot for 2018: \"strengthening the digital economy\" and \u2014 in an effort not to look too elite among the Maseratis ferrying VIPs around APEC's poorest country \u2014 enabling \"a more open, accessible and secure online environment, so communities and businesses of all sizes can participate.\" (Canada was pleased to see an emphasis on digital privacy issues, an official said.)\n\nMany of the leaders, Trudeau included, arrived in Port Moresby from Singapore, the host for the 2018 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Summit talks.\n\nThe contrast was stark, even jarring: from the luxury fashion labels of a city capitalizing on its region's fast-growing wealth, to the broken windows and tin roofs of a developing country pushed beyond its limits to host.\n\nHolidays were declared to clear out the city for its international visitors, who were warned not to stop at roadside stands trying to attract the attention, and money, of foreigners.\n\n\"This is the biggest thing Papua New Guinea has done in their history,\" said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute, a non-partisan Australian think-tank. The country has \"acute development issues,\" something Australia has been providing low-key help with for years, particularly in its remote and rural regions.\n\nChina winning 'both above board and below board'\n\nAustralia's support overall dwarfs the Chinese money that flowed into Port Moresby to ensure the summit's success. But there was nothing subtle about China's role: a huge Chinese gate outside the brand new Hilton Hotel, with a giant roadside banner celebrating \"co-operation\" and \"peace,\" made it pretty obvious who was paying.\n\nChinese aid is strategic, Pryke says, and usually followed by contracts for China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n\n\"Corruption is a real thing here,\" he said. \"These SOEs don't operate on the same playing field as a lot of Western commercial enterprises here. But they're also competitors. So they are winning contracts both above board and below board.\"\n\nChina's presence and influence could be felt throughout Papua New Guinea's capital city of Port Moresby during the APEC summit. (Mark Schiefelbein/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nExtrapolate that Chinese strategy to a global scale and it gets easier to see what Donald Trump is on about, and why the Americans are so unhappy with the aspects of the World Trade Organization that enable market-distorting, state-subsidized competition.\n\nFundamental issues stood in the way of a final communiqu\u00e9 at APEC, with some countries wanting reform, and China strenuously objecting to accusations it isn't playing by the rules laid out when it joined the WTO in 2001.\n\nAccording to reports from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, China tried to strong-arm the summit's host into the language it wanted. No dice.\n\nThis disagreement isn't something that a few more hours, days or weeks of conversation will resolve, despite Xi's suggestion that multilateralism \u2014 talking \u2014 is the answer to the escalating trade war that's slapped hundreds of billions of dollars in disruptive tariffs on the world's products.\n\nThe U.S. may be big enough for a go-it-alone, protectionist strategy, but others \u2014 Canada included \u2014 are not. Their prosperity depends on trade, and their future economic growth likely requires selling new things to China's enormous market.\n\nHowever, their security may depend on continuing to line up with the U.S. So rhetorical demands to pick sides are unwelcome.\n\nSingapore's prime minister said this week that ASEAN countries need a good working relationship with both China and the U.S. to thrive. The appetite to confront American trade bullying may fade in the face of security concerns, like North Korea's nuclear program.\n\n'Coalition in the middle'\n\nThe road to the seat of government in Port Moresby was paved by the Chinese. But the warships in its harbour were Australian and American.\n\nPence turned up at APEC with a commitment to work with Australia to redevelop a naval base on Manus Island to try to counter China's growing influence in the region.\n\nBeyond the trade war between the U.S. and China, there's a second confrontation underway about globalization itself, Tiberghien said.\n\n\"Clearly there is an interesting clash where the U.S. is saying 'trade has left too many people behind' \u2026 we have to 'rein in trade,'\" he said.\n\nThe tension between the U.S. and China was one of the biggest takeaways from the 2018 APEC summit.

Canada's working with allies like the European Union, Japan and Australia on how to reinvigorate a rules-based system.\n\nBut when the G20 meets in two weeks, the fighting between the two biggest players may suck oxygen away from topics like WTO reforms.\n\n\"It's a very tense environment for making any breakthrough,\" Tiberghien said. \"But on a secondary level, Canada can show a good image by saying 'we're here, we're reasonable, we stand for principles, we'll stand with partners that believe in the same principles' and maybe, over time, build a coalition in the middle.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Alice Hopton", "title": "The Giller Prize turns 25: contenders say it's about more than winning $100K", "description": "The Scotiabank Giller Prize isn't just about the $100K cash prize, it's also about being afforded the time to write that next novel and gaining access to new readers, this year's finalists said.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/giller-25-anniversary-shortlist-authors-100k-1.4899214", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907274.1542307129!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/2018-shortlisted-giller-authors.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:00:00Z", "content": "The Scotiabank Giller Prize is a life-changer take it from Canadian writers.

But the general enquiries and debt management lines have not been switched over yet.\n\n\"Though the implementation of the new call centre platform has taken more time than expected to ensure a seamless transition, I am pleased that the migration of the business enquiries line has been successful,\" said National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier in an email to CBC News.\n\n\"I am looking forward to the platform's full implementation across the CRA's call centres.\"\n\nLast fall's auditor general report found dismal service standards at the CRA's nine call centres across the country, with the agency answering only 36 per cent of all incoming calls and providing incorrect answers to callers nearly a third of the time.\n\nThe audit found the CRA blocked more than half of the 53.5 million incoming calls during the audit period \u2014 which meant callers either heard a busy signal or a message to try back later.\n\nIt found that the agency's internal assessment of its response rate to calls, and the accuracy of the information agents provided, grossly overstated the agency's success in meeting its service standards.\n\nNational Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier promised a new telephone system for tax inquiries after the federal auditor general found Canadians were getting busy signals - and bad advice - from Canada Revenue Agency call centres. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nAt the time, the CRA accepted all of the audit's recommendations, pinning much of its promised improvements on moving to a new, more modern telephone platform that will direct calls to available agents, no matter where they are in the CRA's network of call centres.\n\nThe new system will be able to give callers an estimate of how long they'll have to wait to talk to a human being, allowing them to decide whether they want to stay on hold.\n\nSuch a platform can allow for the use of voice, web chat, email, social media and videoconferencing, in addition to automated self-service options \u2014 although a CRA official clarified later that the agency might not end up using all these options, due to privacy concerns.\n\nThe contract for the phone platform was awarded to IBM. The project, called the Hosted Contact Centre Service (HCCS), is being overseen by Shared Services Canada, the federal government's IT department.\n\nDelays a concern: MP\n\nOriginally, the agency promised the new system's rollout would begin in March 2018, with the project completed by the end of this year, but the business line was only moved to the new system Nov. 11. The goal now is to have the general enquiries line, also known as the individual line, operating on the new system in time for tax-filing season.\n\nCritics worry about whether that will happen.\n\n\"We really aren't that very far from the next tax season, if that's part of what they're targeting to have this fully functional for Canadians,\" said Conservative national revenue critic Pat Kelly, adding he is concerned about further delays. \"It may mean we're going to have a lot of frustrated Canadians.\"\n\nMinutes from a joint CRA-Union of Taxation Employees technological change subcommittee in May 2018 indicate that challenges related to bandwidth, queue capacity, accessibility and language issues contributed to the delays.\n\nBut those minutes also show the federal government seems to be learning its lesson from the Phoenix pay system debacle: it's far better to test a new system successfully before rolling it out.\n\n\"This project was considered high risk and management would not proceed if there were doubts about the functionality of HCCS,\" the subcommittee minutes say.\n\nAuditor General Michael Ferguson took the CRA to task for its outmoded telephone inquiries service in his 2017 fall report a year ago. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nStill, the delays mean millions of Canadians are still struggling to get through on the phone.\n\n\"What I have heard, by anecdote, especially from tax preparers who deal with it consistently, is that things are not significantly better,\" said Kelly.\n\nPrivacy a challenge\n\nExperts say the best call centre phone systems are ones that don't force callers to give their information over and over to different agents as they are routed through the system. For the CRA \u2014 where privacy concerns mean different departments often don't share information \u2014 meeting that standard might prove to be a challenge.\n\n\"Good data lead to good insights,\" said Zeus Kerravala, principle analyst at ZK Research in Westminster, MA, where he covers communications and network technology. \"And so, if the data [are] siloed ... you can spend all the money on new technology but it's not really going to improve things.\"\n\nWhile the new system promises the addition of web chat and email, Kerravala warned that many people will still want to talk to an actual person at the other end of the line \u2014 and that includes younger, more tech-savvy taxpayers.\n\n\"The one thing that I've learned over the years is that when people want to talk about money, they want to talk to somebody,\" he said. The more complex the taxation issue, he added, the more a caller will want to talk to an agent.\n\nThe CRA says that while the delays are unfortunate, it has made other improvements to its services, including hiring additional call centre agents and expanding the number of self-serve options available through the automated telephone service and online.\n\nAnd to address another problem identified by the auditor general, the agency has extended its wait times in the phone queues from two to five minutes, which the audit said would reduce the number of callers getting a busy signal or a message to call back later.\n\nCanadians continue to complain about getting inconsistent information from different call centre agents.\n\nAccuracy improves slightly\n\nIn response to the auditor general's finding that agents were giving incorrect information at least one third of the time, the CRA promised more and better training and the creation of a national quality assurance team.\n\nThe agency conducted a self-assessment during a two-week period last February and found the accuracy rate had improved, but only slightly \u2014 to 78 per cent.\n\n\"I would think any organization should find that utterly and completely unacceptable,\" said Kelly, who also said it's hard to trust those numbers considering the auditor general also found the CRA was wildly off on its previous self-assessments.\n\n\"There's going to be a credibility problem for a while.\"\n\nKelly said he has also heard from CRA employees who fear they're being evaluated mainly on how fast they can process a call.\n\n\"The goal of the agency and the call centre should be to help Canadians get the information that they need,\" said Kelly. \"It may take longer, but if a person doesn't get the information they need, they will have to call back. And so you're not really shortening the queue, either.\"\n\nConservative MP Pat Kelly says he is concerned the CRA won't have an improved service in place for tax filing season. (Christian Diotte/House of Commons)\n\nAfter all three enquiries lines have successfully been switched over, the new phone system will be able to record calls to assess their accuracy, according to the agency.\n\nLebouthillier said she is committed to improving access to call centre agents and improving the information they provide. She points to her appointment of a 'chief service officer' as a major move to help the CRA become more client-focused.\n\nMeanwhile, the agency is facing another audit, due to land Tuesday, that will be part of the auditor general's 2018 fall report. That report will look at whether the CRA applied the Income Tax Act consistently during compliance activities, and whether it accurately reported the results of those activities."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "\u00c9ric Grenier", "title": "Why immigration could be a high-risk, low-reward issue in the 2019 election", "description": "A new poll shows Canadian concerns about immigration haven't deepened, even as politicians have increasingly focused on the issue.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-immigration-poll-1.4907577", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4909696.1542402737!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/refugee-removals-20181031.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:00:00Z", "content": "Though the political debate over immigration and border security has made a lot of noise in recent months, it might turn out to be a dud in the 2019 federal election or it could blow up in the face of the party leader who risks making an issue of it. A new su\u2026 [+7551 chars]", "fulltext": "Though the political debate over immigration and border security has made a lot of noise in recent months, it might turn out to be a dud in the 2019 federal election \u2014 or it could blow up in the face of the party leader who risks making an issue of it.\n\nA new survey by the Environics Institute shows that Canadians' opinions on immigration and refugees have hardly budged from the generally upbeat views recorded by the polling firm over the last few years. A majority of Canadians (58 per cent) say they do not believe that immigration levels are too high, while 76 per cent say that the overall impact of immigration on the Canadian economy has been positive.\n\nBut the numbers suggest there's still an audience for a political party demanding a reduction in immigration and greater efforts to ensure immigrants adopt \"Canadian values\" \u2014 both policies embraced by the new People's Party launched by former Conservative leadership contender Maxime Bernier.\n\nThis could prove to be a point of vulnerability for Andrew Scheer's Conservatives.\n\nThe Conservatives have been sharply critical of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's immigration policies since the beginning of a surge in the number of asylum seekers crossing Canada's borders illegally. But those criticisms have been limited to questions of fairness regarding those asylum seekers who try to enter Canada illegally, and claims that the government has no plans in place to adequately house, employ and integrate immigrants.\n\nThe Conservatives have been careful to state that they are pro-immigration and are not asking for a reduction in the annual intake.\n\nBut that puts the party at odds with many of its own supporters \u2014 who appear to be more in line with where Bernier's party is positioning itself on the issue.\n\nOverall, immigration isn't a top-of-mind issue for voters, according to the Environics Institute poll. Only five per cent of Canadians \u2014 and just six per cent of Conservative voters \u2014 cite immigration and refugees as the most important issues facing Canadians today. That's up only one point since April 2017.\n\nOver the same time, the percentage of Canadians who list the environment and climate change as the most important issue has jumped five points to 10 per cent, second only to economic issues.\n\nHealth care, the government's record, social issues and unemployment also scored higher than immigration in the Environics Institute's research.\n\nFew votes to win in Quebec on immigration\n\nImmigration ranked low on the priority list in Quebec, where the bulk of asylum seekers have crossed into Canada and where a provincial election was just waged, in part, over the issue of immigration.\n\nOnly seven per cent of Quebecers listed it as their top issue. On immigration levels, the legitimacy of refugee claims and immigrants' impacts on the economy, opinions in Quebec were in line with those in the country as a whole.\n\nThis suggests those seeing a hard line on immigration as a winning formula in Quebec are drawing the wrong lessons from the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec's win in the October provincial election.\n\nThe CAQ promised to reduce the province's immigration intake and do more to integrate those who arrive. But the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard was unpopular long before immigration popped up as an issue in the campaign \u2014 and CAQ Leader Fran\u00e7ois Legault's clumsy handling of the file nearly cost him his victory.\n\nConservative, PPC voters on the same page\n\nThe starkest divisions in Canadians' views on immigration are found not between regions, age groups or education levels, but between supporters of the major parties themselves. While Liberals and New Democrats generally view immigration in the same positive light, Conservative voters see things very differently \u2014 though they are no longer alone on that side of the spectrum.\n\nThe Environics Institute poll surveyed a small sample of just 63 People's Party of Canada supporters, so the margin of error on the PPC numbers is high. But the difference between Liberal and NDP supporters on the one hand and Conservative and PPC supporters on the other (and the strong similarity between the views expressed by the last two groups) is so marked that the results are still meaningful.\n\nJust 22 per cent of Liberals and 24 per cent of New Democrats think Canada takes in too many immigrants. But 52 per cent of Conservatives and 47 per cent of PPC supporters think so.\n\nMeanwhile, 58 per cent of Conservatives and 55 per cent of Bernier's supporters think most refugee claims are illegitimate. Just 30 per cent of Liberals and 32 per cent of New Democrats agree.\n\nAnd 73 per cent of PPC voters and 70 per cent of Conservatives think too many immigrants are failing to adopt \"Canadian values,\" compared to 38 per cent of Liberals and 40 per cent of New Democrats.\n\nPierre Paul-Hus, Shadow Minister for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness looks on as Michelle Rempel, Shadow Minister for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship delivers her opening remarks during a news conference in Ottawa, Thursday November 1, 2018. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nPerhaps most stark are the responses Environics heard when it asked whether immigrants make the country better or worse. While 62 per cent of Liberals say immigrants make the country better and just six per cent think they make it worse, Conservatives and People's Party supporters were split three ways.\n\nAmong Conservatives, 28 per cent said immigrants make the country better, 31 per cent said worse and 32 per cent said they make no difference. For the People's Party, those numbers were 32, 34 and 31 per cent, respectively.\n\nThis suggests Scheer could be vulnerable on immigration if it flares up as an issue during the 2019 federal election campaign. The Conservative Party might find itself out of step with its own supporters. Normally, that wouldn't be a problem \u2014 these voters were not going to head over to the Liberals or NDP \u2014 but Bernier's People's Party will be an option on the ballot that didn't exist before.\n\nOne thing that does separate Conservative voters from People's Party supporters is U.S. President Donald Trump. Only 13 per cent of Canadians approve of the president and Conservatives say they disapprove of Trump by a margin of two-to-one. PPC voters are split down the middle on Trump \u2014 which perhaps explains why Bernier hasn't shied away from adopting a \"Canada first\" message in recent speeches.\n\nImmigrants key to a Liberal victory in 2019\n\nBut while immigration might not turn out to be the central issue of the next federal election, immigrants themselves could play a key role.\n\nThe poll suggests that if the Liberals win next year, immigrants could be an important factor in that victory. Among voters born in Canada, the Conservatives led the Liberals by two points in the poll. But among voters born elsewhere, the Liberals held a 16-point lead. That's what makes the difference between a neck-and-neck race and an environment that favours the re-election of Trudeau's government.\n\nBut the poll also suggests that there's very little difference between how Canadians born in this country and those born outside of it see immigration. In other words, however a party drafts its immigration platform, the degree to which that platform appeals to voters won't depend on how long those voters and their families have been living here.\n\nOne noticeable difference in opinion emerged on the question of whether immigrants make Canada better or worse. By a margin of 54 to 15 per cent, immigrants said that immigration made Canada a better place. Among people who were at least third-generation Canadians, however, the margin was 40 to 19 per cent.\n\nThat suggests immigrants are (understandably) sensitive to questions about the value they bring to their new home. Policies that advocate for better integration, or lower intake targets, may not repel immigrants any more than they would non-immigrants. But the perception that a party is anti-immigrant could cause it some real trouble.\n\nIn short, immigration looks like delicate balancing act for any party wading into the debate without a positive story to tell."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Ottawa's best cooks go into battle on Iron Chef", "description": "A trio of Ottawa chefs have been on the front lines of an intense culinary battle in recent weeks, entering \u201ckitchen stadium\u201d to do battle with an Iron Chef.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/iron-chef-canada-ottawa-chefs-1.4910078", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910102.1542575811!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/marc-lepine-owner-and-chef-at-atelier.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:00:00Z", "content": "A trio of Ottawa chefs have been on the front lines of an intense culinary battle in recent weeks, entering \"kitchen stadium\" to do battle with the Iron Chef.

It helps veterans complete the paperwork for long-term benefits; for those in immediate trouble, it dips into the Poppy Fund to bail them out.\n\nThe number of those cases has been on the rise, said Brad White, the Legion's national executive director.\n\n\"I've seen an increase where Veterans Affairs Canada is referring people to the Legion to complete the paperwork, instead of doing it themselves,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nNew figures from the department show $676,519.35 of the $1 million fund had been spent as of Nov. 15. Officials said 418 applications had been approved, while 189 had been denied.\n\nSome of the cases cited by Lowther, however, would not have been captured by those statistics because the veterans involved would not have formally applied to the fund, having been diverted elsewhere first.\n\nA spokesman for Veterans Affairs defended the practice, saying \"referrals to outside agencies are made for a number of reasons.\" In an email, Martin Magnan said that a number of outside groups or institutions may be called upon by the department, depending upon the circumstances of the individual veteran.\n\nThose groups may include the Salvation Army, homeless shelters, crisis centres, food banks, poison control centres or provincial health authorities.\n\nReasons for diverting a case would vary, Magnan said.\n\n\"Referrals may also be made to outside agencies where situations do not meet the definition of an emergency under the Veterans Emergency Fund, or where the financial needs of the veteran's request exceed the annual household limit of $2,500.\"\n\nFor example, Magnan said, the program was not meant to \"support ongoing financial payments such as rent and mortgage.\"\n\nIt can, however, make exceptions and provide \"some short-term funding to give them time to find a longer term solution.\"\n\nA policy disconnect\n\nBased on Lowther's experience, those exceptions seem rare; she noted that several recent cases that came before VETS Canada involved rejected pleas for short-term relief.\n\nWhite did not provide statistics about the size of the increase in cases the Legion has seen, but said he believes government staff need to be more aware of the fund's availability.\n\n\"I would hope if an individual walks into a Veterans Affairs office and is requesting assistance, and it falls within those funds, that those funds are actually provided to them without question or hesitation,\" he said.\n\n\"I can understand why that's happening. I can go out on a limb here and say they just don't have the people trained and ready to handle the cases coming down their way right now.\"\n\nWhite said the enormous backlog of benefit claims and the associated workload may affect the ability of government staff to deal with veterans in crisis.\n\nMagnan said frontline staff are aware of the fund, and have been trained in its use. There appears to be a startling disconnect, however.\n\nConfidential sources told CBC News at least three regional offices have informal policies that state veterans must first tap into VETS Canada, the Legion Poppy fund or the Salvation Army before applying for federal emergency funds.\n\nMagnan said there are \"no departmental policies which state veterans must first seek assistance from other sources.\"\n\nAt least one senior Veterans Affairs executive denied there was even a problem when it was raised during a closed-door stakeholders meeting in Ottawa last month.\n\nLowther said there have been occasions when her organization has worked effectively with case managers to get a veteran off the street and into shelter.\n\nThe challenge, she said, is keeping them from getting there in the first place."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Decision expected Monday on sexsomnia defence in sexual assault trial", "description": "A Brockville judge will decide today if a man is not criminally responsible for the sexual assault of a woman because of a sleep disorder.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/brockville-sexsomnia-decision-1.4910029", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4905298.1542244321!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rape-victim-in-brockville-sexsomnia-case.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:00:00Z", "content": "A Brockville, Ont., judge will decide today if a man is not criminally responsible for the sexual assault of a woman because of a sleep disorder.

This year's tally includes 10 victims of the van attack on Yonge Street and the slayings of a young girl and woman in the summer shooting rampage on the Danforth.\n\nBut criminologist Maria Jung says it's important to keep in mind that incidents like those, while high profile and horrific, aren't the norm in Toronto.\n\n\"Homicides are rare to begin with,\" Jung told CBC Toronto. \"The fact we have one incident that's actually contributing more than 10 per cent of the entire year's homicide count does mean that we have to be very careful in thinking this is part of a regular trend.\"\n\nThe Ryerson University professor says while the number of homicides this year has surpassed the record from 1991, the homicide rate per 100,000 residents hasn't \u2014 and it's a more telling barometer.\n\nRate still lower than 1991\n\nNearly half a million fewer people lived in Toronto back in 1991, so with 89 slayings the homicide rate was 3.9 per 100,000 residents. Right now it's 3.3 per 100,000 with the 90th homicide of the year.\n\nJung told CBC Toronto that 1991 is considered the peak of both homicides and crime in the city and beyond.\n\n\"Across Canada there was a steady rise in crime rates for decades, peaking in 1991 or so, which was also followed by a steady decrease since then,\" she said. \"In 2018, we don't have any indication that we're part of that steady increase in crime trends.\"\n\nCriminology professor Maria Jung says even with a jump in homicides this year, Toronto is relatively safe compared to a city of similar size like Chicago. (Sue Reid/CBC)\n\nInstead, Jung attributes this year's high homicide count to \"a random fluctuation that was higher than we would expect.\"\n\nSo far this year that fluctuation has left Toronto with a higher homicide rate than many other major Canadian cities including Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Montreal. But if you look back at the final numbers from 2017, cities like Thunder Bay and Edmonton had higher rates than the current one in Toronto.\n\nEven with the jump this year, Jung says Toronto is relatively safe compared to a city of a similar size like Chicago, which has seen more than 480 killings this year, and has a homicide rate of 18 per 100,000 residents.\n\nShootings account for half of homicides\n\nOf the 90 homicides in Toronto this year, an arrest has been made in more than half the cases. The vast majority of the ones that remain unsolved were the result of shootings, which also accounted for half of this year's homicides.\n\nThe map above shows all of the homicides in Toronto this year. The blue dots represent shootings, the red dots represent stabbings and the green dots represent trauma-related homicides.\n\nAmong them are the downtown, daylight homicides of rapper Smoke Dawg \u2014 whose real name is Jahvante Smart \u2014 and brand manager Koba Prime \u2014 whose real name is Ernest Modekwe.\n\nThe two men were gunned down along a bustling Queen Street West, near Peter Street, just before 8 p.m. on the Saturday night of the Canada Day long weekend. A woman in her 30s was also injured in the shooting.\n\nFor retired Toronto police detective Mike Davis it's the brazenness of homicides like those and others that sets this year apart from the cases he worked back in 1991.\n\n\"We're having murders occurring in shopping malls, on streets, near playgrounds, near schools, and during the daylight,\" said Davis. \"It's how callous they are, how brazen they are to do it at any time of the day.\"\n\nGuns, drugs and the recession\n\nDavis doesn't remember any fatal shootings that brazen in 1991. Back then, police told CBC Toronto that gangs, guns, drugs and the recession were to blame for the record-setting number of homicides.\n\nRetired Toronto police detective Mike Davis says the brazenness of some of the homicides in the city this year sets 2018 apart from the cases he worked back in 1991. (Jon Castell/CBC)\n\nDavis also recalls drugs playing a role, specifically crack cocaine. More than anything though it was the sheer number of cases the homicide unit investigated that year that sticks out.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the former police detective says he worked on the investigation into the slaying of a young female doctor on Super Bowl Sunday in January 1991.\n\nThree weeks into the New Year she was the city's ninth homicide victim.\n\nEleven months later, Ennis's father would be the 83rd.

The so-called Camp Fire has destroyed more than 10,500 homes.\n\nA team of 10 volunteers, accompanied by a cadaver dog, went from house to house in the charred landscape. They scrutinized the rubble in five-minute sweeps, using sticks to move aside debris and focused on vehicles, bathtubs and what was left of mattresses.\n\nWhen no remains were found, they spray-painted a large, orange \"0\" near the house and moved on.\n\nRobert Panak, a volunteer on a team from Napa County, said he tried to picture the house before it burned and think where people might have hidden. His morning search was fruitless, but he wasn't deterred.\n\n\"I just think about the positives, bringing relief to the families, closure,\" Panak said.\n\nMemorial service held in Chico\n\nSheriff Kory Honea said it was within the \"realm of possibility\" that officials would never know the exact death toll from the blaze. He also questioned whether the search for remains could be completed by midweek when rain is forecast.\n\n\"As much as I wish that we could get through all of this before the rains come, I don't know if that's possible,\" Honea said.\n\nAbout 1,000 names remain on a list of people unaccounted for more than a week after the fire began in Butte County about 225 kilometres north of San Francisco, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities don't believe all those on the list are missing and the roster dropped by 300 on Sunday as more people were located or got in touch to say they weren't missing.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, more than 50 people gathered at a memorial for the victims at First Christian Church in Chico, where a banner on the altar read, \"We will rise from the ashes.\"\n\nA memorial was held for the victims of the Camp Fire at the First Christian Church of Chico in Chico, Calif.

I was only six years old.\"\n\nWinston has been lonely since childhood. (Winston Yuen)\n\nSince then, Yuen, now 32, has tried everything he can think of to find social connection in Vancouver: church, festivals, running groups, eventually, at age 29, joining the ranks of the lonely crying out for help on Reddit.\n\nThat post, entitled \"So lonely in Vancouver I don't know what to do anymore,\" asked for help improving his friend-making strategy.\n\nHe hasn't been able to make a true friend in the last two years, he writes in his post. At times, he's been so dejected he hasn't been able to get out of bed.\n\nLonely young people across the city are using Reddit to reach out. (Reddit )\n\nYoung adults, between 25 and 35 are the hardest hit by social isolation in Metro Vancouver according to the Vancouver Foundation's Connections and Engagement report, released in December, 2017.\n\nThis report echoes the findings of the Foundation's 2012 study, which first drew attention to the widespread concern over disconnection in the city.\n\nA quick search on Reddit turns up dozens of comments from young people who say they can't seem to crack the social code in Metro Vancouver and can't figure out what they are doing wrong.\n\nThe Vancouver Foundation's research suggests that battling affordability might be getting in the way of making connections . A third of under 35s said that more financial resources would make it easier to make friends.\n\nThese are not seniors, nor are they newcomers struggling to learn English. They are often the demographic that is overlooked in the discussion of social isolation; young, employed and making an effort.\n\nAre we flaky?\n\nAfter decades of loneliness in his hometown, Yuen has his own theory to explain why isolation thrives in the Lower Mainland. He believes working to keep your head above water in this city has made it acceptable to back out of commitment.\n\nFlaky is the word used by Charles Wang, a volunteer at the Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention Centre of BC.\n\nIt is a criticism often hurled at young people but it's one that Charles is qualified to throw around. Volunteers like him are anything but flaky. At the crisis centre, they make a serious commitment to accompany the lonely in their darkest moments for at least 250 hours in a year.\n\nStaff there can answer only about half the approximately 88,000 calls received each year. Some regular callers depend on a daily connection. Others reach out when the loneliness becomes too much to bear alone, said Wang.\n\nCommitment has a cost\n\nThe call centre itself is filled with murmurs of soothing, soft voices.\n\nIt may sound calm, but Wang calls his work \"frontline stuff.\" It's a big investment of time and emotional energy, and calls can last hours, he said.\n\n\"In those moments I feel incredibly connected to those callers, where they are in their pain, but there's a cost to that connection.\"\n\nThe most recent data from the Vancouver Foundation suggests it's hard to blame young Vancouverites for being flaky when many feel their connection to this city is uncertain.\n\nHalf of those under 35 who responded to the survey said that they did not feel a strong sense of belonging in their neighbourhoods.\n\nMore than half said they were unsure whether they would still be in the same neighbourhood next year.\n\nYuen says the odds may be stacked against him but he plans to keep searching for connection.\n\n\"I'm not giving up. The alternative isn't very nice, it's just retreating and sitting at home by myself.

When he contacted Go Public in September, he was still waiting for that call.\n\nCBC News contacted Air Canada about Neblett's situation. Later the same day, the airline got in touch with the 78-year-old and offered him a refund.\n\n\"While we strive to deliver customer service excellence throughout all stages, issues can arise,\" wrote Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick in an email.\n\n\"In this particular case, the customer was fully refunded and we apologized for the delay and offered a goodwill gesture because it regrettably took longer than normal to process.\"\n\nIn addition to the refund, Air Canada gave Neblett a $200 credit toward future travel within the next year.\n\n'Classic fine print'\n\nMost websites include \"terms of use,\" that generally waive any responsibility on the part of the company for issues with the website or what's being sold, says Saunders, who is an assistant professor at the Haskayne School of Business at the University of Calgary.\n\nHe calls the terms \"the classic fine print.\"\n\nE-commerce expert Chad Saunders warns that online shoppers are often at the mercy of websites' terms of use. (Colin Hall/CBC)\n\nThe terms of use on Air Canada's website read, in part, that the company does not \"warrant or guarantee that the website will operate uninterrupted, error-free ... You access and use the website at your own risk.\"\n\nSaunders says that kind of language is typical for websites, including Air Canada's competition, WestJet, Air Transat and Porter. The problem, he says, is that most people don't read them or realize they are automatically accepting the terms just by using the website.\n\n\"If you look at most of the terms of use for our more popular sites \u2026 those basically clearly state that they don't really warrant anything to do with the pricing, the accuracy, those types of things,\" he said.\n\nIn the email to Go Public, the airline defended its terms of use, writing:\n\n\"Air Canada uses third-party companies to provide its website services and broad website terms of use are necessary to deal with events beyond Air Canada's control \u2026 That said, whenever a customer encounters difficulty using our website \u2026 we always want to be fair and we will review any concerns and waive the terms if appropriate to resolve the matter, as we did in this case.\"\n\nOnline retail sales have been rising steadily in Canada, jumping nearly 30 per cent between 2016 and 2017 to $34 billion, according to data from market research firm eMarketer.\n\n'Problematic' terms\n\nMichael Geist questions whether those terms of use are even enforceable. He's the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-Commerce Law at the University of Ottawa.\n\n\"Any time, I think, that you find a contract that seeks to essentially have a consumer sign away or click away their rights, I think is problematic,\" he says.\n\nPeople purchasing goods or services online have to agree to terms they can't negotiate and Geist says those terms of use can sometimes infringe on consumer protection legislation.\n\n\"The idea is that they can simply contract out of that by saying you agreed up front that even if something goes wrong on our end, you're still bound by this transaction.\n\n\"From a regulatory perspective, simply falling back and saying well everybody does it this way isn't good enough.\"\n\nTips for troublesome online purchases\n\nLaw professor Michael Geist understands why consumers often don't bother reading the terms of service, because they have no ability to negotiate them. (Submitted by Michael Geist )\n\nIf you're struggling with an online purchase of any kind, Geist offers this advice:\n\nContact the company first. Many are well aware of the damage a negative customer experience can do to their reputation and will fix the issue.\n\nIf possible, make your complaint in writing.\n\nIf that doesn't work, use social media to get the company's attention and pressure them to deal with the issue.\n\nKnow the \"cooling off period\" for your purchase. Depending on what you buy, you may have anywhere from a day to a couple of weeks to change your mind and cancel the transaction.\n\nDispute the charge with your credit card company. Many will cancel a charge for services and products not received.\n\nIn Neblett's case, his credit card company said there was nothing it could do.\n\n\"They said if I had rebooked and paid twice, well then, maybe they can help me.\"\n\nAs for Air Canada, Neblett says he wouldn't have gotten his money back if he hadn't contacted Go Public.\n\n\"My next step was to contact a lawyer, even though the cost would be more than the refund.

Calgary will make its fourth Grey Cup appearance in five years after claiming the championship in 2014.\n\nEric Rogers led Calgary with three touchdown catches Sunday, including a 10-yard leaping grab in the end zone late in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat score was the highlight of a second half largely devoid of offence as both defences dug in.\n\nWinnipeg's Justin Medlock kicked four field goals for the visitors, including a 57-yarder for a CFL playoff record, in front of an announced 29,268 at McMahon Stadium.\n\nMitchell joins elite company\n\nBo Levi Mitchell completed 17 of 31 passes for 214 yards and three touchdown throws.\n\nHe joins a select group of CFL quarterbacks to lead their teams to a playoff win five straight years. Ron Lancaster, Russ Jackson, Doug Flutie and Tracy Ham are the others.\n\nThe last team to appear in three straight Grey Cups was the Montreal Alouettes from 2008 to 2010. The Als won back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010.\n\nWatch highlights of the Stampeders win over Winnipeg:\n\nBo Levi Mitchell threw 3 touchdown passes to Eric Rogers, as the Calgary Stampeders rode past the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 22-14, to force a rematch of the 2016 Grey Cup game against the Ottawa Redblacks. 2:07\n\nWinnipeg's Grey Cup drought extends to 28 years with the loss. The Blue Bombers finished third in the division with a 10-8 record.\n\nAfter starting the season 5-7, the Bombers went 6-1 en route to Sunday's division final including a 23-18 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the division semifinal.\n\nBombers starting quarterback Matt Nichols was 15-for-32 in passing for 156 yards Sunday.\n\n\"It sucks man. It sucks,\" Nichols lamented.\n\n\"We didn't quite earn it as a team today. I feel like our defence deserved better today. They did a hell of a job. We had a lot of opportunities. Of course Calgary's defence, they played great tonight and it's difficult.\n\n\"You go into a game like this with no doubt that you're going to win and when you don't, it's a pretty terrible feeling.\"\n\nMitchell's 21-yard pass to Richie Sindani, followed by an 18-yard Don Jackson run and a 15-yard catch from Lemar Durant put the hosts in scoring range for Mitchell's pivotal touchdown throw to Rogers with just under four minutes to play.\n\n\"Eric is a hard guy to cover,\" Mitchell said. \"I trust Eric, I understand his body language. I know where he's going to be on certain things.\n\n\"A play like that at the end of the game, there's not a lot of players who make plays like that. He's a big-time guy. He never makes the moment bigger than it is.\"\n\nTrailing 6-0, Calgary's first touchdown of the game in the second quarter was key. Mitchell marched the offence 92 yards in a drive that ate eight minutes four seconds off the clock, and capped it with a 12-yard touchdown toss to Rogers.\n\nHe threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Rogers in the end zone later in the quarter to give the hosts a 14-6 halftime lead.\n\nAfter travelling to Toronto and then Ottawa for the two previous Grey Cups, the Stampeders will play for the title much closer to home in their provincial rival's stadium.\n\n\"We're happy to be out west. We're hoping people show up,\" Dickenson said, joking that it was the first time he looked forward to going to Commonwealth Stadium.\n\n\"I know, Edmonton, but we'd love to get some support from you guys.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "B.C. ride-hailing announcement coming Monday", "description": "The provincial government says it will introduce the passenger transportation amendment act on Monday as the next step towards introducing ride-hailing in B.C.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-ride-hailing-legislation-announcement-1.4910942", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3497748.1489090724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/uber-taxi.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:12:27Z", "content": "British Columbia's Minister of Transportation says it will introduce long awaited ride-hailing legislation on Monday.

It's being reviewed by people who \"would never normally pick us up,\" McCambridge told CBC's Breakaway.\n\nThose reviewers came most recently from the New York Times and The New Yorker.\n\n\"They're reading the book, they're impressed by the book. It's not just any old book about Quebec,\" he said.\n\nThe story begins in small town Quebec at the end of World War I with one family,and spans a century, bringing readers across different continents.\n\nSongs for the Cold of Heart is just over 600 pages and McCambridge said it took him about 18 months to translate.\n\nSongs for the Cold of Heart is a novel by Eric Dupont, translated by Peter McCambridge. (Sarah Scott/QC Fiction)\n\nHe said each chapter reads like a new novel with a different tone and characters.\n\n\"Everything's larger than life. It's a fun read,\" he said.\n\nAs a translator, his goal was to stay as close to author Eric Dupont's creative construction of the work, rather than offer a direct translation.\n\nThat's why it would be hard to guess even the original, French title to the novel \u2014 La Fianc\u00e9e Am\u00e9ricaine, published in 2012, which has sold 60,000 copies in Quebec.\n\nDupont, a Montreal-based author, is well known in Quebec literary circles.\n\nHe has published several novels in French and is a past winner of Radio-Canada's \"Combat des livres\" (the equivalent of the CBC's Canada Reads contest).\n\nMcCambridge said that being nominated has been huge for publicizing the book and he's excited for the big award show on Monday.\n\n\"I can't even start imagining what would happen if we won,\" he said.\n\nThe 2018 Scotiabank Giller Prize winner will be announced on Monday, Nov. 19, 2018 on CBC-TV, and will take home the the $10,000 prize.\n\nThe one-hour broadcast will be hosted by Rick Mercer and begins at 8 p.m. local time (12:30 a.m. AT/1:00 a.m. NT).
