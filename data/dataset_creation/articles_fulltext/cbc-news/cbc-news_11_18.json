An extra 2.5 million visitors poured through the gates in 2017.\n\nIn the first eight months of 2018, the number of visitors fell 10 per cent from the same period in 2017. In some parks that saw the biggest jumps in 2017, visits are down more than 30 per cent.\n\n\"We expected we would see a big increase in visitation in 2017,\" said Ed Jager, director of visitor experience for Parks Canada. \"We also knew that we would see sort of a return to the previous trend.\"\n\nJager said Parks Canada's chief social scientist \u2014 Parks Canada has a chief social scientist, and an economist, and data analysts \u2014 predicted exactly what the free admissions in 2017 would do to visitor numbers. He said the good news is that the 2018 numbers are still higher than in the previous years when there were fees, reflecting ongoing marketing efforts to keep visitor numbers growing.\n\nEntry is still free for anyone under 18, which it didn't used to be, but adults once again pay between $3.60 and $9.80 for day passes to different parks.\n\n'They came back in 2018'\n\nThe number of visitors to national parks between January and August was up about three per cent compared to 2016. Visits to historic sites are about even, though final numbers could change because some visits, such as by tour groups, might not all be accounted for yet.\n\nKathleen Yetman, owner of Birdie's Perch restaurant and the Point Pelee Trading Post, said her business had never seen anything quite like what happened in 2017.\n\n\"It was a gift,\" she said.\n\nYetman's place is just outside the entry gates to Point Pelee National Park, billed as the southernmost point of Canada and a birdwatcher's paradise. It saw the biggest increase in visitors of any park, with 217,229 additional visitors in 2017 compared with the year before.

She said the government is clearly working on keeping Point Pelee attractive, with improvements to infrastructure.\n\n\"Point Pelee just keeps getting better,\" she said.\n\n'Pretty good deal'\n\nBanff National Park, with nearly three million visitors, is the country's most popular, and its attendance numbers varied very little regardless of the fees.\n\nBut the Banff Park Museum inside it, with a normal entry fee of $3.90, saw attendance soar 230 per cent to more than 72,000 people in the first eight months of 2017. For the same time in 2018, visits plunged to below 30,000. Though that's still a few thousand more than visited in 2016.\n\nThe government estimated the freebie year would cost about $76 million in foregone admission fees and extra costs to handle all the visits. Jager said the biggest leftover benefit for the parks from Canada 150 is the two million people who signed up for email updates and notices about park programs. That helps market the parks and has resulted in a significant increase in the number of people buying annual passes to get into any national park, he said.\n\nJager said there haven't been piles of complaints from people who want the parks to be free again. He says in reality, the small fees are a \"pretty good deal.\"\n\n\"If I'm going to go to a movie with my family it will probably cost me $40 and maybe $80 if I want to get popcorn and a drink and that's comparative to $20 to spend a day in one of the most beautiful places on the entire planet,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Gail Harding", "title": "Literary trail honours Miramichi authors", "description": "A Miramichi writing group, Words on Water is paying homage to Miramichi authors by creating a literary trail in the city.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/literary-trail-miramichi-authors-1.4910810", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910915.1542577585!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ray-fraser.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:25:44Z", "content": "A Miramichi writing group, Words on Water, is paying homage to Miramichi authors by creating a literary trail in the city.

The win makes this the sixth consecutive year that Thompson has won at least once, extending the longest such active streak on the LPGA Tour.\n\n\"It's very gratifying,\" Thompson said from Naples, Fla. \"This is such a special event for me in general, growing up in Florida. ... It was just very gratifying.\"\n\nJutanugarn took the other two big prizes that were up for grabs this week, clinching the yearlong Race to the CME Globe prize \u2014 and the $1 million US bonus that comes with that \u2014 as well as the Vare Trophy for winning the season's scoring title. The world No. 1 already had wrapped up player of the year honours, and finished 2018 with a 69.415 scoring average to edge Minjee Lee (69.747) for the top spot there.\n\nJutanugarn shot a 6-under 66 on Sunday, finishing the week tied for fifth at 12-under 276.\n\n\"It felt great today,\" Jutanugarn said. \"I'm very proud of myself.\"\n\nHenderson made push for Globe prize\n\nJutanugarn briefly lost the lead in the projected Globe standings on Sunday after Brooke Henderson of Smiths Falls, Ont., made three birdies on her first seven holes to grab the top spot. Jutanugarn reclaimed the advantage with four birdies in a six-hole stretch midway through her round, and the trophy was just about locked up when she birdied the par-5 14th almost simultaneously to Henderson making bogey on the par-3 16th.\n\nThe 13th hole on Sunday provided the shift that Thompson used to hold off Korda. They went to the tee of that par-4 with Thompson up by two; she made birdie, Korda made bogey, and Thompson was suddenly up four with five holes to play.\n\n\"It was just very special to win in front of all my family and friends,\" Thompson said.\n\nJutanugarn finished in style, rolling in a 15-footer for birdie on the final hole to cap the year where she swept the LPGA's biggest prizes.\n\n\"It means so much to me because like to be honest, after 2016 I never expected anything,\" Jutanugarn said. \"I feel like I achieve like too much already in my life, so I never think I can do anything more than that. So this year ... just like unbelievable.\"\n\nIt was the 10th career win for Thompson, who grabbed the lead on Friday and kept it the rest of the way. She hadn't finished better than a tie for ninth in any of her last eight starts \u2014 but Tiburon Golf Club has been a haven for the native South Floridian, who is 31-under in her last seven rounds at the tour championship there.\n\nRole reversal\n\nThe win also helped ease the pain of last year's tour championship for Thompson. She had a two-foot par putt on the 72nd hole \u2014 one that could have meant a tournament win, the world No. 1 ranking and player of the year honours \u2014 but pushed it right and wound up losing to Jutanugarn by a shot.\n\nThere was no final-hole angst this time, and the role reversal was complete. Like Thompson in 2017, Jutanugarn departed with the Globe and the Vare Trophy; like Jutanugarn in 2017, Thompson got the win in the season finale.\n\nAmong other notables, Brittany Lincicome (67) to finish tied for third at 13-under with So Yeon Ryu (68), Lydia Ko went 68-68 on the weekend to finish 12-under alongside Jutanugarn, Marina Alex (69) and Carlota Ciganda (70). Nasa Hataoka finished alone in ninth at 10-under, and first-round leader Amy Olson shot a 4-under 68 to finish at 9-under and in a group tied for 10th with Henderson and Sei Young Kim.\n\n\"To finish top 10, top five, whatever it's going to be, going into the off-season, obviously I made a few extra dollars because I'm not playing until January,\" Lincicome said. \"I feel pretty good about it.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Birders observe wider variety of birds at their feeders", "description": "Birders say they're seeing more finches, such as the redpoll, pine siskin and pine grosbeak, in New Brunswick.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/bird-seeds-finch-1.4910816", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3005843.1427132150!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/common-redpoll.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:32:08Z", "content": "Birders say they're seeing more finches, such as the redpoll, pine siskin and pine grosbeak, in New Brunswick. \"I looked out my window this morning and there were six pine siskins hanging on my sunflower seed feeder three more down on the ground beneath picki\u2026 [+1439 chars]", "fulltext": "Birders say they're seeing more finches, such as the redpoll, pine siskin and pine grosbeak, in New Brunswick.\n\n\"I looked out my window this morning and there were six pine siskins hanging on my sunflower seed feeder \u2014 three more down on the ground beneath picking up the seeds that fell,\" said David Christie.\n\nChristie is a birder and naturalist.

During a period like this, you don't go to elections,\" he said.\n\nThe sudden coalition crisis was sparked by the resignation of the hawkish Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response last week to the most massive wave of rocket attacks on Israel since the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. He alleges the ceasefire agreement reached with Gaza's Hamas rulers will put southern Israel under a growing threat from the group, similar to that posed to northern Israel by Lebanon's heavily armed Hezbollah.\n\nRazor-thin majority\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party leaves the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament.

But several factors could trip him up, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention.\n\nPolice have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another.

She sailed into St. John's in 1900 to become the training ship for the Newfoundland Naval Reserve. Her masts were dismantled and a barracks was built on the deck. The Calypso would remain in St. John's harbour for 20-plus years.\n\nBefore and during the Great War, hundreds of Newfoundlanders would train in the ways of naval warfare to become sailors on British Royal navy ships all over the world.\n\nBut my family's connection is something I never knew until a few short years ago.\n\nFamily lore, not passed along\n\nMy grandfather Peter Gullage passed away when I was 12. I remember the crabapple tree in the backyard on Southside Road, the way the big tree in the front shadowed the living room and the a picture of the SS Caribou in the hall. For a kid living in Mount Pearl it was always a house that felt old, and my grandparents seemed to come from another time.\n\nAuthor Peter Gullage is held by his grandfather, for whom he was named. (Submitted)\n\nWhat I didn't know, and was never told, was the Gullage family history in the Great War. It would take my son Noah's heritage project in school to uncover the surprise.\n\nI was the one who ended up with an oval framed picture of a soldier that had been in a storage room at my grandparent's place. I figured out that was great uncle Victor, whom my dad was named after. That's all I knew, and for years and for whatever reason didn't bother to look into his war record.\n\nIt wasn't until we were picking through war records at the Rooms for the school project that I found details of my family history.\n\nThe microfilm of the old papers revealed that Victor signed up when he was 19 years old on July 5, 1915.\n\nPeter Gullage as a toddler visits Bowring Park. The statue of the Fighting Newfoundlander can be seen in the background. (Submitted)\n\nA year later he died in the battle of Gueudecourt on Oct. 12, 1916.\n\nThe documents tell the tale of how the army had trouble passing on word of his death to his next of kin. They couldn't find his brother Peter, who was serving in the Royal Newfoundland Naval Reserve.\n\nA letter from a pastor in Catalina filled in another detail about the young Gullage's road from Catalina to Southside Road in St. John's.\n\nLearn the history of the Newfoundland Naval Reserve, including the Calypso \u2014 the ship on which each member trained 4:43\n\n\"Their late father perished with all hands on David Rennie's schooner on the banks in late September 1900,\" said the note from the parsonage in Catalina.\n\nReading that was a bit of a moment because that's a piece of family history that was never passed down through the generations.\n\nA ship that served many, but didn't travel far\n\nOr maybe it was. Maybe I was just a suburban kid who didn't care enough to pay attention.\n\nThen again, I remember my grandfather as a quiet man and maybe the war and the loss of his brother had something to do with that.\n\nHMS Calypso docks on the south side of St. John's harbour in the early 20th century.

(Admiralty House Museum)\n\nHe was 20 when he enlisted on July 1, 1916, and served at British Royal Navy stations in England through the war and into 1919. That single record doesn't tell me anything about his experience.\n\nFar from the wreck in Embree, at the Admiralty House museum in Mount Pearl, there are dozens of artifacts from HMS Calypso. During the war, the building was a wireless communication station staffed by sailors who trained on the Calypso in St. John's harbour.\n\nLauren Lambe, the museum's assistant curator, can talk forever about the Calypso and her place in Newfoundland's war effort.\n\n\"For a ship that didn't go many places after 1900, it definitely saw a lot of people and sent a lot of people all around the world,\" Lambe told me.\n\nSlipping away from us\n\nA personal experience turns to memory and slips into history over the generations.\n\nMany times the stories are lost.\n\nI`ve met many people in the past couple of years of the First World War commemoration coverage who were on a similar mission to find out their family history before it was too late and could not be passed on to another generation.\n\nAnd that's why, standing on that dock in Embree, I wanted to reach out and touch the deck of the Calypso.\n\nIt would not fill in the blanks but it would at least make the connection to a story I never knew.\n\nThe rusting wreck of HMS Calypso now sits near the coastline in Embree.

One of the main themes coming out of this year's gathering of military, political and academic leaders is the biggest threat to democracy is coming from within.\n\n\"In the democratic world, many of our strongest and largest democracies are in some type of crisis,\" says former U.S. ambassador Nicholas Burns, who now teaches at the Kennedy School at Harvard University.\n\nBurns was a featured speaker at the final event which looked at security 10 years out and his view is neither positive nor especially hopeful.\n\nHe sees the United Kingdom floundering as it wrestles with deep divisions caused by Brexit, and his own country's place in promoting values of democracy and inclusiveness being undermined by the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nConcerns about U.S. leadership, and about Trump's increasingly inward-looking agenda were front of mind for many at the gathering this weekend.\n\n\"We really need to fortify our situations at home in order to be confident and capable overseas, to advance a global agenda,\" Burns said in an interview later with CBC News.\n\n\"I don't think any country can be effective globally if it's not secure at home.\"\n\nWorrisome U.S. rhetoric\n\nA bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators was asked about the impact Trump is having on the U.S. brand overseas, and about the impact his rhetoric is having on unity among Western nations, and America's ability to lead.\n\n\"The rhetoric is what it is. The actions are far more important,\" said Roger Wicker, the senior Republican senator from Mississippi.\n\n\"The president of the U.S. makes a point that he's a nationalist, not a globalist. What he really means is that we take a lot of international determinations and we need to continue to make the case that they are in the national interest.\"\n\nWicker acknowledged that the benefits of foreign aid, for example, aren't always apparent or relevant to ordinary citizens. Others at the conference made the point that being open to migrants is a source of strength in Western nations rather than something to be feared, and that international trade is a foundation for growth both at home and abroad.\n\nCanadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, right, and Peter Van Praagh, the president of the Halifax International Security Forum, attend a news conference at the annual meeting on Saturday.

And I do think that over the next year \u2026 the next little while, that that's going to be the pressing issue.\"\n\nA number of the sessions at the three-day summit explored what's behind the rise of populist movements in Western countries, and how to modernize aging multilateral institutions like NATO and the United Nations to make them more relevant today.\n\nCanada's ambassador to the UN, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blanchard, says he believes it's more important than ever \u2014 a view he acknowledges might put him in the minority \u2014 because it is the only place where all countries of the world can work together on common problems.\n\n\"What are the biggest issues we are facing today? Climate change. The migration crisis. Cybersecurity. All of these issues cannot be resolved unilaterally or bilaterally,\" he said. \"You need a place where you all come together.\"\n\nGetting our own house in order\n\nBut Burns says coming together isn't enough when so many leaders are now becoming more isolated.\n\nHe says Trump in particular refuses to condemn white supremacists at home, or to promote Western values abroad.\n\n\"We need to be outward looking. Pay attention to our friends, to be good friends and allies.\"\n\nVan Praagh takes a similar view.\n\n\"I do think that over the next year, even the next little while, getting our own politics right is going to be fundamental.\"\n\nHe draws a stark analogy to the rise of fascism in the 1930s, which emerged as a political force because democracy was weak.\n\n\"I think all of us are now beginning to understand that these are urgent issues.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Sarah Rieger", "title": "Townsite becomes 1st in Alberta to compost disposable diapers", "description": "Redwood Meadows is now the first municipality in Alberta and one of just a few in Canada to divert disposable diapers from its landfill.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/diaper-composting-alberta-1.4910790", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1958628.1381422400!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/diapers-cost.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T19:44:49Z", "content": "Redwood Meadows is now the first municipality in Alberta and one of just a few in Canada to divert disposable diapers from its landfill.

It also provides public education and community-based research on the infection.\n\nThe group was created in 1982, after a group of six gay men got together one night for dinner in Vancouver to talk about the AIDS crisis, says Dr. Brian Chittock, executive director of AIDS Vancouver.\n\nAt that time, little was known about AIDS and why so many people were becoming infected. AIDS Vancouver was officially incorporated Aug. 4, 1983.\n\n\"It was a pretty scary time \u2026 people were scared. Nobody knew what this thing was or how we were getting it and how to control it,\" Chittock told The Early Edition host Stephen Quinn.\n\n\"We didn't know how to deal with the situation. Nobody had gone through anything like this ever before. We were winging it.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Brian Chittock, those on antiretroviral HIV treatment do not transfer the infection to their sexual partners. \"It's a much more manageable disease for most people today,\" he says. (Getty Images)\n\nImprovements\n\nWhile Chittock was not involved with AIDS Vancouver in the early days, he founded the HIV/AIDS Network of Edmonton Society shortly after AIDS Vancouver's launch. He then co-founded the Montreal AIDS Committee in 1984.\n\n\"I just remember talking to some of the volunteers beside me who became infected and thinking, 'Am I next?' What's going on? What can we do?' And I had no answers.\"\n\nStigma around AIDS continues to be a big issue for the organization. Chittock says they have never been able to deal with it effectively. But he says that prevention and treatment has advanced.\n\n\"People are not literally dying around us as they were in early years.\"\n\nChittock says there are approximately 15 new infections in Vancouver every year, which is much lower than the early days of AIDS Vancouver. According to Chittock, Vancouver has one of the lowest rates of infection in Canada.\n\n\"It's a much more manageable disease for most people today \u2026 we've made huge strides in treatment.

They are set to expire in November 2019.\n\nAccording to the report, the current regime was developed \"without consultation, input or direction\" from care workers.\n\n\"This program is fundamentally flawed and extends the legal basis for exploiting care workers,\" it says.\n\nThe coalition of groups from across Canada are calling for a new federal workers program that offers permanent residency to foreign caregivers as soon as they arrive. That would allow them to bring immediate family members, who the coalition hopes will be offered open work and study permits under a new program.\n\n\"Family unity is the norm for many other temporary immigration programs and it results in improved health and stronger families rather than years of forced separation,\" the report states.\n\nFurther, for foreign caregivers already in Canada, the coalition's requests include:\n\nCare workers be able to apply for permanent residency after one year of work (1,950 hours), rather than after two years of work.\n\nCaregivers be given open work permits so they have the option to leave abusive work situations or find a new employer if their current one passes away.\n\nMore stringent educational requirements be removed. Currently, care workers must have the equivalent of one year of Canadian post-secondary education to apply for permanent residency. Their arrangements, however, often prevent them from having time to study and complete courses.\n\nEnglish language requirements be removed. These were introduced with the 2014 pilot programs.\n\nRemove caps put on the number of annual applications for permanent residency from foreign caregivers.\n\nThe hard cap on permanent residency applications is currently set at 2,750 for those working under in childcare, and 2,750 for those caring for those with \"high medical needs.\"\n\n\"In 2016, 4,861 migrant care workers were issued a new permit in the childcare stream and 5,335 in 2017.

That if we worked hard, even in the face of discrimination and abuse, we would eventually be able to reunite with our families, bring them here and live here safely and with permanent status.\"\n\n'I felt so bad in my heart'\n\nIndeed, beyond the hard cap, there are a host of others ways care workers can miss out on a chance for residency.

And Sage says other Mexican states want in on the cash crop.\n\n\"The domestic market prices are very low. If you're an avocado grower, you want to export your production.

Over time, the idea is to expand it, so it can participate in the defence of the electrical grid in any of the NATO countries.\n\nAs for social media meddling in the 2019 Canadian general election, Stavridis said it should be expected.\n\nRetired U.S. Navy admiral James Stavridis, former supreme allied commander of NATO, said the new cyber operations centre in Belgium is a 'big, bold idea' that is 'just starting out' to protect NATO countries against cyberthreats. (CBC)\n\n\"One of Russia's principle, strategic objectives is to break that transatlantic link, to force the U.S. and Canada away from European partners and weaken the alliance,\" he said.\n\nStavridis said one message track that could be spread throughout the electoral process is that involvement in NATO is not necessary, and he predicted \"Russian activity will play that way in the social networks.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "'Staffing crisis' leads to delays in accessing early intervention for autistic children", "description": "There are 175 children with autism spectrum disorder waiting for access to the province's Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention program.

You can hear it in her voice.\n\nThere's nothing unique about Reuther's situation. In fact, it's the commonness of things that's partly so frustrating for the Glace Bay, N.S., resident as she and her family wait to get help for four-year-old Kingston, who has autism spectrum disorder.\n\n\"I took the diagnosis very hard,\" Reuther said during a recent interview at home with her son.\n\n\"It's been really hard to watch your child not be able to communicate with you.\"\n\nPriority to oldest kids waiting\n\nReuther started noticing developmental delays with Kingston in his infancy. By his second birthday, in 2016, Kingston was diagnosed and referred to the provincial Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention program, or EIBI.\n\nLike many before her, Reuther was told to wait for a call, and that it could be a while.\n\nIt's been two years and counting.\n\nEIBI is a six-month intensive program for children diagnosed with autism before they start school, pairing them with direct-care staff, a clinical supervisor and a speech-language pathologist \u2014 all with a focus on developing social communication skills.\n\nBecause of the wait list, and because age six is the cutoff, the oldest preschool-age children are prioritized.\n\nReuther took last year off work to stay at home with her son. He's in daycare three days a week this year. (CBC)\n\nReuther was told early last summer to prepare for Kingston to begin therapy in July. But a few days before things were to begin, the family got another call saying things would be delayed indefinitely.\n\n\"I was told that it was a staffing crisis in Cape Breton and that there was nobody to oversee his therapy,\" she said.\n\nThere were six vacancies in the Cape Breton EIBI program at the time.\n\nAccording to a Health Department spokesperson, two full-time clinical interventionists have been hired for the island this past week. That will restore the complement of three supervisory positions.\n\nWith those posts filled, the provincial health authority is now recruiting for two permanent and two temporary autism interventionists.\n\nStaff shortages and waiting lists\n\nBut staff shortages aren't limited to Cape Breton. Across the province there are 10.2 permanent full-time equivalent direct care staff vacancies.\n\nThere are four vacant full-time equivalent clinical supervisor positions and a 0.7 speech-language pathology position that needs to be filled. The EIBI provincial team also has vacancies for one provincial trainer and one psychologist.\n\nAll of this translates to wait lists.\n\nAs of the end of September, there were 175 children waiting and eligible for EIBI, according to the Health Department. Of that group, 101 were born in 2014, making them eligible to start school in September 2019.\n\nCynthia Carroll, the executive director of Autism Nova Scotia, said that means some parents will be faced with the choice of starting their child in school without doing EIBI, or holding them out for a year in hopes they get access to the program before aging out.\n\nThe latter could mean another year of paying for daycare for some parents, an added cost and challenge because some don't accept school-age children.\n\n\"It's incredibly problematic for a variety of reasons,\" said Carroll.\n\nAutism Nova Scotia executive director Cynthia Carroll is hoping the provincial government will recall the EIBI expert panel to discuss ways to improve service access for families. (CBC)\n\nCarroll is hoping the provincial government will reconvene its expert panel on EIBI to re-examine how to ensure continuous services for people in need.\n\nThat group included representation from the education system, provincial health authority and IWK Health Centre, the Health Department and Carroll's organization.\n\nThe effort needs to look at EIBI and current resources, but also ways to improve access to early diagnosis and consider how recent changes, such as the pre-primary program, can be incorporated into efforts to improve the overall system, said Carroll.\n\n\"It's about how do we get a best-practice approach \u2014 seamless, continuous services for families so that they're not caught in these cracks and they're not falling between a system that's not currently [as] integrated as it could be.\"\n\nA right to reach 'fullest potential'\n\nA Health Department spokesperson said in a statement that significant investments have been made so all preschool-age children with autism can get EIBI before beginning school at age six.\n\n\"The province spends $14 million annually so that approximately 180 children with autism spectrum disorder will be able to receive treatment each year,\" Tracy Barron said in an email.\n\nAs Kingston waits for his turn, he's now in daycare three days a week, which includes speech therapy once every two weeks. His mom has high praise for the staff there and what it's meant for her son.\n\nBut she's hoping access to EIBI can help her boy be able to express himself, to learn ways to get what he needs and to \"live his life to the fullest potential.\"\n\n\"He has the right to be able to do that, as every child in Canada does.\"\n\nReady more articles from CBC Nova Scotia"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Shane Ross", "title": "Big bang theory: Dynamite possible cause of loud blasts that shook neighbourhood", "description": "The Salisbury Fire Department found evidence of dynamite explosions in a gravel pit after residents were shaken by \"huge\" bangs on Saturday afternoon.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/big-bang-salisbury-boundary-creek-1.4910692", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910694.1542548642!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/salisbury-explosion.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T17:04:26Z", "content": "Donna Smith was watching a movie inside her Boundary Creek, N.B., home on Saturday afternoon when she heard a bang so loud it \"shook the windows and everything in the house.\" When she went outside to talk to her neighbour, she heard at least two more \"huge\" b\u2026 [+1339 chars]", "fulltext": "Donna Smith was watching a movie inside her Boundary Creek, N.B., home on Saturday afternoon when she heard a bang so loud it \"shook the windows and everything in the house.\"\n\nWhen she went outside to talk to her neighbour, she heard at least two more \"huge\" bangs \u2014 much louder than gunshots, she said.\n\n\"Then everyone starting getting concerned.\"\n\nChildren were upset\n\nHer two sons, age 12 and 10, came running home from a nearby hill where they were sledding.\n\n\"They came home all upset wondering what was wrong.

The aircraft finally came to a stop metres from a deep embankment.\n\nA spokesperson for the Kingston, Jamaica-based airline said Saturday that it has seen no record that Kalloo was treated in hospital \"for any injuries as a result of the accident.\n\n\"We are investigating the position further and lending all possible assistance and support to Mrs. Kalloo's relatives as they come to terms with their loss,\" the statement said.\n\nOther passengers returned to Toronto on Friday morning following a frustrating and chaotic week trying to get home.\n\nSome criticized Fly Jamaica for what they said was a lack of communication following the crash landing. Others alleged that valuable belongings they left behind on the plane after evacuating, such as jewellery, cash and electronics, were unaccounted for."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Malone Mullin", "title": "Poor weather prompts temporary shutdown of all offshore rigs, petroleum board says", "description": "Following a bout of bad weather, the regulator says all of the province's offshore operations have been suspended.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nlopb-offshore-operations-suspended-1.4910715", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2770644.1411065221!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hibernia-platform.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:14:15Z", "content": "All offshore facilities have been temporarily shut down as a safety precaution due to stormy seas and will not resume operations until the offshore industry regulator says it's safe to do so.

Who are you going to call? Nobody.\"\n\nPaying 'a bunch of bandits'\n\nBernard Thompson, reeve for the M\u00e9kinac regional municipality, said the ransom demand presented a real dilemma for his small organization. M\u00e9kinac groups together 10 municipalities with a population of roughly 13,000 people.\n\n\"It was hard, clearly, on the moral side of things that we had to pay a bunch of bandits,'' Thompson said.\n\nM\u00e9kinac's attackers used malicious software \u2014 known as malware or ransomware \u2014 to demand money in return for keys to unlock the data.\n\nFernandez said it is ironic that Quebec is home to a thriving cybersecurity industry and is an emerging hub for artificial-intelligence research, yet the provincial government is \"decades'' behind other provinces in defending against cyberattacks.\n\nStill, Quebec is not the only province experiencing attacks. Several municipal governments and businesses in Ontario were recently hit by ransomware attacks, prompting the Ontario Provincial Police to issue an advisory in September.\n\nIn response to the growing problem, Communications Security Establishment \u2014 the Defence Department's electronic intelligence agency \u2014 launched the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security last month. It is responsible for monitoring \"new forms of ransomware'' and advising the federal and provincial governments.\n\nSpokesperson Evan Koronewski said the centre has no provincial or territorial equivalent.\n\nFernandez, however, notes that some provinces are taking significant steps. British Columbia and New Brunswick have established offices dedicated to protecting government data. Meanwhile in Quebec, he said, small towns are left unprotected.\n\n\"I'm hoping the new government does something about it,'' he said.\n\nMunicipalities responsible for public security\n\nPatrick Harvey, spokesman for the Public Security Department, disputed the claim the provincial government is unprepared for cyberattacks.\n\nHe said the Treasury Department has a director of information responsible for ensuring government data is protected. The Public Security Department has a unit dedicated to responding to cyberattacks within the administration and provincial police.\n\nBut municipalities are not part of the unit's mandate. \"Municipalities are autonomous entities that are responsible for ensuring the security of their digital infrastructure,'' Harvey said.\n\nM\u00e9kinac's servers were compromised after an employee opened and clicked on a link in a fraudulent email sent by the hackers.\n\nOnce opened, the malware was downloaded onto the computer, giving the hackers access to the entire network. The hackers then encrypted all the data and held it hostage until they received their bitcoins.\n\nOnce a system's data is encrypted, it's virtually impossible to crack the code without a key \u2014 and there is nothing police can do about it.\n\nMost professional criminals use commercial grade encryption and to locate a key to decrypt data would take \"astronomical effort in terms of computing,'' Fernandez said.\n\n\"You either pay or you don't get the data.''\n\nThe identity and location of M\u00e9kinac's hackers were never discovered.\n\nThompson said police seized some of his computers for analysis and told his office not to negotiate or pay the criminals.\n\nBut Thompson said his region couldn't heed that advice, because it would have meant months of data re-entry, costing significantly more than $30,000.\n\nSo they paid, got their data back and learned a valuable lesson.\n\n\"In the end, in terms of the security of our system, [the attack] was actually positive,'' Thompson said.\n\nA local cybersecurity company \u2014 for $10,000 a year \u2014 helped the regional municipality build firewalls and encrypt its own data.\n\n\"We are practically no longer vulnerable,'' Thompson said. \"Everything is encrypted now. Every email is analyzed before we even receive it.''\n\nHe warns that small towns across the province are just as susceptible to attack as his region was.\n\n\"Every day, our system catches malicious emails trying to penetrate \u2014 but they are stopped,'' he said. \"But the attacks keep coming.''"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Sarah Rieger", "title": "Strathmore RCMP search for suspect in poppy donation box thefts", "description": "RCMP are searching for a man who's accused of stealing two poppy donation boxes in Strathmore, Alta.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/strathmore-poppy-box-theft-1.4910714", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910718.1542552515!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/strathmore-poppy-theft-suspect.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:30:24Z", "content": "RCMP are searching for a man who's accused of stealing two poppy donation boxes in Strathmore, Alta.

That option would require a longer road and would be more expensive, but would connect Fort Chipewyan with the rest of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo.\n\nEngineering challenges\n\nWhatever route is chosen, Marolo Alfaro, a University of Manitoba geotechnical engineering professor with expertise constructing all-weather roads, foresees some difficulties.\n\nFor one thing, the area where the road would be built is mostly dotted with lakes, peat bogs and sensitive discontinuous permafrost.\n\n\"That's one challenge,\" Alfaro said. \"Of course there are other challenges.\"\n\nBut those difficulties have been overcome before, Alfaro said.\n\nAlfaro has worked on the $300 million Inuvik Tuktoyaktuk Highway, Canada's overland link to the Arctic Ocean.\n\nLike that highway, a road to Fort Chipewyan would likely need to be built in the winter otherwise the construction area would be too wet and marshy for large equipment.\n\nRoad construction this summer on Alaska's Dalton Highway showing insulation placed in the road to insulate the underlying permafrost. (Submitted by the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities)\n\nSome areas of the road might need to be built on top of the land with a synthetic barrier to insulate the permafrost and protect it from melting.\n\nDespite these and other considerations, Inglis said various levels of government need to buy into the project first.\n\n\"That's the first step,\" Inglis said. \"And I'm sure there's many more to come.\"\n\nInglis and other councillors said they will be meeting with Alberta government officials in the coming days.\n\nConnect with David Thurton, CBC's Fort McMurray correspondent, on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or email him at david.thurton@cbc.ca"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "'Be aware,' Winnipeg woman warns East Kildonan residents after coyote spotting", "description": "Two coyotes were seen near 900 Raleigh Street in East Kildonan, just after 9:30 a.m. Saturday, near the Phoenix Soccer FC.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/coyote-spotting-winnipeg-1.4910642", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910644.1542516693!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/coyote-sighting-winnipeg.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T13:36:33Z", "content": "At first, Krysten Yarechewski thought it was two loose dogs running along a busy street in East Kildonan Saturday.

Young boys in the neighborhood would throw rocks through the windows of the Chinese laundry.\"\n\nHardships not talked about\n\nBob Hong's father, Gene, came to Newfoundland in 1931.\n\nLike many of those men, Hong told CBC, his father first worked in a laundry. By the 1950s he had established a caf\u00e9 and then several restaurants, including the United Nations and the House of Hong in St. John's.\n\nThe graves are all of men who came from Guangdong province in Southern China.

(Paula Gale/CBC)\n\nHong said his father didn't tell him about any of the hardships of those early days in Newfoundland.\n\n\"He just never talked about it.\"\n\nInstead, Hong said, his father focused on raising a family and making money.\n\n\"Dad was fully intent on making it here. I mean, he worked constantly from early mornings till late at night,\" he said. \"Of course, back then we made everything by scratch, right. You cooked a turkey, you sliced it up, you made the egg rolls from scratch.\"\n\nFor those early immigrants to succeed here, Jarvis said, they had to endure a lot. He said the Chinese graves in the cemetery are only of men who died far away from home, often without their wives and children; women weren't permitted to come at the time.\n\nFatal laundry fire\n\nTwo graves are for a pair of young men who died together on Dec. 31, 1940, in a laundry fire.\n\nOne of them, Hong Wah Chung, was 24 when he died, said Jarvis.\n\n\"His immigration records say he was 17 when he arrived.

Lots of people actually witnessed it happening! He apologized many months later, blaming his state of inebriation. I accepted his apology and continued to be cautious in his company.\n\nI am sharing this example to illuminate the insidious nature of sexual harassment and sexual violence in the workplace. Part of what we hear in response to people being called out for their behaviour includes \"I came from a different time,\" or \"things have changed.\"\n\nAnd while I do not doubt that, we need to be crystal clear \u2014 it was never OK.\n\nThe difference now is that the people who experience harassment and assault may hear a different message, including \"it is not OK,\" \"it is not your fault,\" and \"you can say something.\"\n\nEmployers can be part of culture shift\n\nThis is a time when employers have a great opportunity \u2014 you can be a part of the workplace culture shift.\n\nThe key to a supportive workplace is good training, policies and procedures that clearly outline:\n\nThe type of behaviours that are unacceptable. For assistance, you can access resources such as SAFE Work Manitoba.\n\nThe process for making a complaint and how it will be handled. Ensure employees know who to talk to, particularly if the complaint is about management.\n\nWhat supports and services are available. This may include an employee assistance program, and/or community programs such as Klinic's crisis lines.\n\nAs employers, we are obligated to create safe workplaces and it is our legal responsibility under the Manitoba Human Rights Code to ensure our workplaces are free of harassment and discrimination.\n\nFor some people, there may be a feeling that this current environment is difficult and different from the past \u2014 that they are worried about saying the wrong thing. As a leader myself, I understand that it can be challenging sometimes to communicate to many people your intentions and get it right.\n\nAt Klinic we describe all sexual harassment and sexual assault as existing under a continuum of sexual violence. This may include any of the following without clear and expressed consent:\n\nAny non-consensual sexual contact that is verbal, emotional or physical.\n\nAn act of violence or aggression involving a sexual attack that is verbal, emotional or physical.\n\nUnwelcome sexual comments, harassment or threats that make you feel uncomfortable, violated or under attack.\n\nTouching in a sexual way without permission.\n\nIf you are unsure or would like to talk to someone about what you have experienced, please contact Klinic's 24/7 sexual assault crisis line at 204-786-8631, 1-888-292-7565 (toll-free) or 204-784-4097 (TTY).\n\nAllegations have surfaced recently of workplace harassment, unfair treatment of staff, racism, and sexual assault at Winnipeg's Stella's restaurants.

Clockwise from upper left: Roja, verde cremosa, cilantro-tomatillo, yoghurt and pequin chile. (Bartley Kives/CBC)\n\nStreet fare of exceptional quality is easy to find in what the locals call Ciudad Mexico, or simply CDMX, possibly because the difficulty in getting across its vast expanse requires Chilangos, as the residents are known, to rely upon a decent snack wherever they happen to be.\n\nBut food in general seems to be an obsession in this city, much the same way it is in Barcelona, Bangkok or any other truly great culinary destination.\n\nOn any given block laden with taco stands, you can pick up a 15-peso ($1 Cdn) round tortilla topped with everything from \u200bthe cactus-paddle strips known as nopalitos to the slow-simmered cut of porks labelled as carnitas to huitlacoche, an immensely flavourful bluish-grey fungus that grows on corn.\n\nFor a few more pesos, a street vendor will hand you a crispy tlacoyo (a larger oval tortilla usually topped with beans and cheese), a very messy pambazo (a fluffy white bun stuffed with fried potatoes and chorizo and then soaked through in guajillo chile sauce) or a deliciously greasy torta (a pressed sandwich filled with the likes of avocado, jalapeno strips, cheese and your choice of meat, often a schnitzel-like milanesa fried cutlet).\n\nThe main infredient in tacos al pastor: pork rubbed with spices, pressed on to a spit and then carved from the exterior, much like shawarma. (Bartley Kives/CBC)\n\nIf you choose, you may actually sit down and eat in this city. The local version of a diner is called a fonda, where you can grab a morning breakfast that usually starts with a bolillo, a small baguette-style bun leftover from a the French occupation of Mexico City in the 1860s. Cut in half and covered with beans and cheese, this bun becomes molletes, an open-faced breakfast sandwich.\n\nDuring the mid-afternoon meal, traditionally the largest of the day in Mexico City, some fondas offer three courses for about 75 pesos, or about $5 Cdn. It's a great way for travellers on a budget to eat very well.\n\nBut the relatively low cost of very high-quality restaurant fare \u2014 CDMX is like a cosmopolitan European city at Mexican prices \u2014 makes it worthwhile to splurge a little.\n\nIn relatively upscale Roma Norte, which has a vaguely hipsterish vibe, you can find seafood of exceptional quality at prices Canadians would consider reasonable.\n\nContramar, which opens only for lunch, is locally famous and justifiably so.

The show stoppers are raw clams, either the dark-brown chocolata variety from Baja California or the larger almejas reina. They pull the pink-and-white meat, chop it and return it to the shells in a vinaigrette.\n\nBut if you're only going to damage your financial health with one high-end meal in Mexico City, head to the bougie neighbourhood of Polanco, home to Pujol, where chef Enrique Olvera has been playing with traditional Mexican ingredients for 18 years.\n\nYou can make a reservation for a table, but a more fun attraction is an 11-seat taco bar designed specifically for taco omakase seatings modelled on the prix fixe meals served in high-end Japanese restaurants.\n\nThe eight-course taco omakase meal on offer at Pujol includes a finger of eggplant on a blue corn tortilla overlaid with a hoja santa leaf. (Bartley Kives/CBC)\n\nEight courses of Pujol tacos will set you back just under $200 Cdn, which is roughly the same price as buying 200 tacos from a street stand in a more central neighbourhood. But the experience, which takes almost three hours and winds down in a beatific outdoor garden, is worth the cognitive dissonance, and not just because of the mezcal pairings that come with every course.\n\nThe meal starts with a trio of appetizers, most notably a spear of smoked baby corn smeared in coffee mayonnaise and dusted with ant powder. Yes, ant powder. Mexicans are not afraid of eating bugs.\n\nTwo mole sauces on a plate at Pujol, a restaurant in Mexico City's Polanco neighbourhood.

This is definitively Mexican fusion food: Middle Eastern immigrants brought over shawarma, which eventually morphed into slabs of spiced pork, instead of lamb, pressed on to a spit below a pineapple, instead of an onion.\n\nOrder a lager to wash these tacos down.

On Thursday, it told CBC News it had resolved its shortage, and Canadian pharmacies would receive the drug \"imminently,\" depending on delivery schedules.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, pharmacies in Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina and Winnipeg said they had yet to receive a shipment, and their pharmacists said it was still listed as unavailable in their system.\n\nA company spokesperson wouldn't divulge why the shortage happened.

None.\"\n\nShe co-authored a report for the C.D. Howe Institute in June that revealed about 1,200 drugs are in short supply in Canada every year, with at least 700 shortages at any time. The most common reasons for shortages are manufacturing disruptions or shipment delays. A shortage of generic drugs can often trigger a shortage of brand-name drugs, and vice versa.\n\n\"At times, all pharmaceutical manufacturers are faced with drug shortage situations,\" a spokesperson for Bausch Health said in an email to CBC News. \"We understand this is challenging for patients and health-care practitioners to manage, and we're glad the situation is being resolved.\"\n\nThe company indicated it had begun shipments, but pharmacists in Saskatchewan said their online system still showed it as unavailable.\n\nDuffin acknowledges that drug manufacturing is a private industry, not a charity, but argues that Health Canada should require companies to release more information about why shortages happen.\n\n\"We can't find solutions until we find the cause,\" Duffin said. \"Canada needs to measure the drug shortage.

Almost all of them agreed the assessment is needed.\n\nEconomic impact\n\nAmong the comments, only two were uniformly positive about the proposal.\n\nChris Pelley-Moore said the project should go ahead \"unburdened,\" as \"the economic potential for the region cannot be overstated,\" and Michael MacGillivray said \"we need to encourage as many business opportunities as possible.\"\n\nAbout 190 people would work at the mine. (Paul Palmeter/CBC)\n\nThe mine is projected to create up to 190 full-time jobs, but that number would climb to 300, including contractors, during construction.\n\nA submission by the Municipality of the District of St. Mary's, the jurisdiction where the proposed mine would be located, acknowledged the project could bring jobs and families to the area. But it also raised concerns about the potential impact on the watershed of the St. Marys River \u2014 a hotspot for anglers and paddlers \u2014 and on highway safety and infrastructure.\n\nOthers questioned the long-term economic impact of those jobs. \"Who would buy/build a home, buy a vehicle or start a family with a five-year forecast of work?\" wrote Milton Gallant.\n\nEffects on tourism\n\nMany submissions to the CEAA raised concerns about the impact on the \"pristine\" environment and the tourism sector that relies on that reputation.\n\nThe executive director of Sherbrooke Village, a historical re-enactment museum and the largest employer in Guysborough County, said the mine would be visible from the main highway, and that could \"pose a significant disincentive to potential tourism\" and affect the \"nature brand\" of the county.\n\nSeveral parcels of land on or near the St. Marys River have been protected by the Nova Scotia Nature Trust. (Len Wagg)\n\nIn a statement, Atlantic Gold said tourism and mine development are \"not mutually exclusive activities and can proceed in harmony.\"\n\nScott Beaver lives about two kilometres from the proposed mine site.\n\nHe said the mine would be a \"big giant eyesore in the middle of our community.\"\n\n\"Will tourists want to come for that?\" he said in an interview. \"Who knows, but that's what our community is based on, is tourism. \u2026 Ecotourism and mining, they don't really seem to go hand in hand.\"\n\nScott Beaver has started a group called No Open Pit Excavation to fight the mine proposal. (Submitted by Scott Beaver)\n\nBeaver has started a group called No Open Pit Excavation (NOPE) to fight the mine proposal, and has launched a petition and organized a meeting to rally the community against the mine.\n\n\"There's only one goal here, is to stop that mine from coming here,\" he said.\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\nBeaver is also the president of the St. Marys River Association, which has put years of work and about a million dollars into restoring the river, an important habitat for at-risk species like Atlantic salmon and wood turtles.\n\nYears ago, the river was a mecca for fishermen, he said.\n\n\"It would be nothing to see boats and 30 people lined up in a fishing line with their fly-fishing rods waiting for their turn for that big salmon. Hopefully, one day we can get back to that. That's kind of the goal.\"\n\nBeaver said this year was one of the driest seasons ever, and \"you could almost walk across\" the river.\n\nThe St. Marys River has had low water levels in recent years. (Jeff Amos)\n\nAmong his many concerns about the project is Atlantic Gold's proposal to extract more than 23,000 litres a day from the surface, or groundwater, to support mine operations.\n\n\"Any water that you're taking out of the system is just not sustainable to habitat and fish life,\" he said.\n\nThe St. Marys River is one of two used by the federal Fisheries Department to assess the recovery of the endangered Atlantic salmon population. The Nova Scotia Salmon Association said disruptions to the watershed could affect the ability to gather valuable information about conservation.\n\nThe Nova Scotia Nature Trust, which has protected about 1,000 acres of land near the river, is concerned about the possible impact of a mine on wetlands and wildlife. The organization has three parcels of conserved land near the proposed mine, and another is in progress.\n\nThe Ecology Action Centre noted that the proposed mine site overlaps with a piece of land the provincial government is in the process of designating as protected \u2014 a designation that would not allow for mining on the land.\n\nThe company said it has hired environmental scientists and engineers to help develop the project, and will work with stakeholders to ensure it doesn't adversely affect the river and surrounding communities.\n\nOther gold mines proposed\n\nThe Cochrane Hill project is one of four currently in development or in operation by Atlantic Gold along the Eastern Shore. The Touquoy mine began commercial production in March, while the proposed Beaver Dam and Fifteen Mile Stream projects are still under federal environmental review.\n\nThe proposals for Beaver Dam, Fifteen Mile Stream and Cochrane Hill all include trucking gold concentrate to the Touquoy site for processing and tailings deposition \u2014 something that worries Barbara Markovits of the Eastern Shore Forest Watch Association.\n\nThe association has asked the CEAA to revisit the approval of the Touquoy operation, since that project got the green light about 10 years ago.\n\n\"We need a federal look at whether the tailings dam that was approved 10 years ago at Touquoy meets the current regulations and concerns,\" Markovits said in an interview. \"A failure, they're not frequent, but when they do fail, they're catastrophic.\"\n\nCompany responds\n\nIn a statement, Atlantic Gold said it was impressed with the submissions, \"which confirmed much of what we already knew to be important to the community,\" and said it will hold another open house in early 2019 to engage with residents and share the results of ongoing studies.\n\nThe company said it expects a federal assessment will be ordered, and has already been preparing for that.\n\nThe CEAA will decide by Nov. 23 whether a federal environmental assessment for the Cochrane Hill project is warranted."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Alan Neal", "title": "Buffy Sainte-Marie donates artwork to Wabano Centre", "description": "Buffy Sainte-Marie once made a film with Pierce Brosnan that was \"not very good.\" Now, a painting inspired by that experience is going to live on in Ottawa.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/buffy-sainte-marie-painting-wabano-centre-1.4909671", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4833504.1537552886!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/music-sainte-marie-tagaq-20170221.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T11:00:00Z", "content": "Buffy Sainte-Marie once made a film with Pierce Brosnan that she says was \"not very good\".

She was born in the Toronto suburb of Brampton, and later, the family moved to Beit Jaan, her father's Druze village in northern Israel where her Lebanese-Druze mother opened a restaurant.\n\nA framed photo of Druze horses hangs in Khold\u2019s home, where faith is a central element of everyday life. Each colour and horse symbolizes one of the religion's five main prophets. The colours also appear on the Druze flag. 'The hour is coming, no doubt about that' are the words written in Arabic below, referring to Judgment Day. (Riya Khold)\n\nHer childhood was split between the two countries. She came to Canada annually to visit her grandmother until she moved back to Brampton permanently at the age of 19.\n\nIn Beit Jaan, she had a childhood similar to those of other Druze children, including frequent family reunions and shared family meals. But Khold was also a child of the West. She grew up on Disney movies and Nutella, and her father was open to the idea of his children marrying outside the faith.\n\n'It's easier'\n\n\"I grew up around religious people, but it wasn't forceful,\" said Khold. \"They just taught us a set of rules \u2026 what you should do, what you shouldn't do, and we just didn't question it. My parents weren't strict on it, but it's just what the society taught us.\"\n\nThose who do find spouses outside the Druze community are usually ostracised \u2014 both from their family and the community. For Khold, the fear of losing the community and wider family she loves outweighed her father's openness to a marriage outside the faith.\n\n\"I don't want to stop talking to my family just because I'm going to marry a non-Druze, so I'm going to marry within the faith. It's easier,\" she said.\n\nTo make things even more challenging, the Druze religion doesn't allow converts, leaving options for potential partners limited to those born Druze.\n\nYou haven't had to think hard about it, but when the moment comes to choose a wife or husband, you do have to think about it. - Gerard Russell, former diplomat\n\nThe consequences of marrying outside the community aren't always consistent, says Chad Kassem Radwan, an anthropologist who has studied the Druze for the last decade.\n\n\"It works on so many different levels. Somebody could take you out of their will, for example,\" he said.\n\nKhold has seen such things happen to members of her family. A cousin of her mother's came to Canada from Lebanon at the same time as Khold's mother and spent most of his formative years in the Western diaspora.\n\nHe married a Christian woman, and as a result, his family and community stopped speaking to him almost entirely. The most Khold's parents will say to him is, \"Hello\" or \"How are you?\"\n\n\"I feel bad for them. It sucks to not be part of [the community] just because you married someone that isn't Druze,\" Khold said.\n\n\"The Druze society is so heartwarming, because everyone knows you: they call; they come over frequently. I would be so sad to lose that.\"\n\nPressure from within\n\nSeeing what happened to her relative increased the pressure she put on herself to find a Druze husband, but she hasn't had much luck.\n\n\"You have all this freedom around you, and you don't feel the immediate pressures of a Druze society like those in the Middle East. So when it comes to marriage, I have to create these pressures for myself.\"\n\nMostly, she is trying to avoid getting emotionally caught up in relationships that have no future.\n\n\"The thing is, I can't allow myself to feel something for [non-Druze men], because then, it would be so much more difficult to break it off in the long run,\" Khold said.\n\nKhold never tells potential suitors the real reason for rejecting them.\n\n\"I don't like saying I'm Druze.\"\n\n'Just a human'\n\nMany of her peers have never even heard the word \"Druze\" let alone understand the faith and restrictions that come with it, Khold says.\n\nDespite her commitment to marrying within her faith, it's hard for Khold to identify outwardly as Druze.\n\n\"I don't want to say, 'I''m Druze,' because I'm not, in my mind. I'm just a human, let's keep it at that,\" she said.\n\nGerard Russell, a former British diplomat who wrote about the Druze in his book Heirs to Forgotten Kingdoms, says that is typical of many young Druze in the diaspora. They don't start thinking about what it means to be Druze until it comes time to choose a partner.\n\n\"You haven't had to think hard about it, but when the moment comes to choose a wife or husband, you do have to think about it,\" Russell said. \"Then, that's something they're not prepared for.\"\n\nGlobal meet-ups\n\nThe Druze have relied on two ways to encourage single young people in the diaspora to meet each other: international conventions and weddings.\n\nThe conventions are straightforward: a weekend is dedicated to hosting hundreds of Druze from around the world, with an itinerary designed to encourage interaction \u2014 everything from shopping to sightseeing to picnics and the customary closing gala.\n\nKhold has yet to attend one of these events because, she says, she fears the disappointment of not finding a partner or of finding one who doesn't live anywhere near her.\n\nAs a student halfway through her undergraduate degree with hopes of continuing on to medical school in Toronto, she's not ready to interrupt her studies and uproot her life to pursue a relationship elsewhere.\n\nWeddings, on the other hand, are familiar territory. Each summer, she attends about six on average.\n\nAt least two of those are likely to be in the Toronto area, meaning many of the guests will be her friends or relatives.\n\n\"It's not like I'm meeting new people,\" she said.\n\nThis past summer, however, she met a young Druze man at a wedding. Intrigued that she hadn't met him before, she struck up a conversation. But her cautious optimism soon turned into disappointment again: he was from Florida.\n\nWith a Druze convention approaching in July 2019, Khold's friends have finally convinced her to come along. Her hopes aren't high: the convention is in Florida and attracts an international crowd. The chances of Khold finding a partner who lives close to her are slim.\n\nFor Khold, there is no other option but to marry Druze, but she says she doesn't want others born into the diaspora to have the same struggles."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Amanda Pfeffer", "title": "New Ottawa air travel research centre billed as international first", "description": "The National Research Council is expecting its new $12-million Ottawa facility will take advantage of the industry's scramble to gain a competitive edge by improving the travel experience.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/new-ottawa-air-travel-research-centre-billed-as-international-first-1.4908067", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4909205.1542486018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nrc-research-lab-airplane-fuselage-ottawa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T09:00:00Z", "content": "What if an airplane seat could monitor your biometric information to help lower your anxiety?

But I will point out that nation states have always had the capability to manipulate media.\"\n\nEager for a solution\n\nDARPA's media forensics program is halfway through its four-year research mandate and has spent an estimated $68 million on this technology so far.\n\nFor digital forensics expert Hany Farid, a technological solution for spotting manipulated videos can't come fast enough.\n\nFarid, a computer science professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, is concerned about how technology that can manipulate video could potentially be misused.\n\n\"The nightmare situation is a video of Trump saying I've launched nuclear weapons against North Korea and before anybody figures out that it's fake, we're off to the races with a global nuclear meltdown,\" he says.\n\nFarid doesn't think that's likely, but he also doesn't think it's out of the question.\n\n\"Certainly that technology exists today.\"\n\nAt DARPA's offices in Arlington, Va., Turek showed The Fifth Estate some examples of manipulated videos that DARPA's detection technology can spot.\n\nIn one example, two people appear to be sitting beside each other.

DARPA is analyzing still images, too.\n\nIn the image below, the detection technology spotted that not all of the pixels come from the same camera.\n\nThis plane was not in the original photo. (DARPA)\n\n\"There's sort of an outline of the airplane that you can see in this noise pattern, and so the computer can automatically pick up on that,\" says Turek. \"Likely the airplane pixels come from a different camera than the rest of the scene.\"\n\nThis is the original photo, without the airplane. (DARPA)\n\nA lot of skill\n\nFarid says developing technology to spot fakes created by technology is an \"arms race.\"\n\n\"The adversary will always win, you will always be able to create a compelling fake image, or video, but the ability to do that if we are successful on the forensics side is going to take more time, more effort, more skill and more risk.\"\n\nWhile software has been released online that allows almost anyone to create manipulated video, Farid says it still takes a level of skill to develop a convincing fake using this kind of technology.\n\nHany Farid, a computer science professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, is concerned about how technology that can manipulate video could possibly be misused. (CBC)\n\nEventually, he says, if they are successful with developing automated forensic technology to spot fakes, it will mean only a relatively small number of people will be able to create them.\n\n\"That's still a risk, but it's a significantly less risk than we have today.\"\n\nFarid says that in addition to developing technology to spot fakes, there could be another way to combat the spread of misinformation.\n\n\"We as consumers have to get smarter. We have to stop being so gullible. We have to get out of our echo chambers. We have to be more rational about how we digest and consume digital content online.\"\n\nDARPA's media forensics program has a focus on the threat manipulated media could pose to national security.\n\nThe program would also help the U.S. military. Right now, human analysts have to verify videos and images, which is a manual process. Analysts examine imagery like foreign propaganda. Law enforcement agencies and organizations like the FBI analyze video and imagery such as security videos.\n\nThe media forensics program would heavily automate the process and would aim to give analysts a tool to make their jobs easier.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s adversaries could be anyone, says Matt Turek, manager of the media forensics program at the U.S. Defence Department's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency.

If we see it then we have faith that it happened,\" he says. \"And so the ability for an individual or a small group of people to make compelling manipulations really undermines trust.\"\n\nTurek says that while manipulators may have the upper hand now, in the long term the detectors have the potential winning advantage \"because we're coming at things from so many different angles.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jason Vermes", "title": "NHL concussion settlement won't stop Bernie Nicholls's worries over his memory loss", "description": "The former hockey all-star says that he suffers from dizziness and memory loss as a result of multiple head injuries sustained during his time as an NHL player.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/nhl-concussion-settlement-won-t-stop-bernie-nicholls-s-worries-over-his-memory-loss-1.4910377", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910387.1542482102!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bernie-nicholls.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T09:00:00Z", "content": "The highlight reel moments of Bernie Nicholls's NHL career may be unforgettable scoring 70 goals in a single season, hoisting the Stanley Cup but it's what he can't remember that scares him.

Now it's down to just 6 per cent, the Bank of Canada calculates.\n\nBut the central bank's numbers are limited to what's happening at federally regulated institutions such as the country's largest banks. What's happening at unregulated private lenders isn't included.\n\nPrivate lenders don't have to comply with federal rules, including Ottawa's tougher mortgage stress tests.\n\n\"Areas with high house prices, such as the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), could therefore see more borrowers obtaining mortgages from private lenders because they might not be able to qualify with other lenders,\" according to the bank's analysis.\n\nWhile private lending falls outside of its purview, the central bank admits that it's a part of the market that's growing. For example, the market share for private lenders in the GTA has grown by 50 per cent since last year, and now makes up nearly one out of every 10 borrowers, the bank said.\n\nUnregulated lending isn't inherently risky \u2014 but it is difficult for analysts to monitor.\n\n\"We are getting into a situation in which the fastest growing segment of the market is the one that is in the dark, and that's suboptimal,\" said CIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal.\n\nWithout more information about what's happening in the private market, Tal said it's unclear whether the central bank's policy changes are simply spreading risk around \u2014 as opposed to reducing it.\n\n\"It's definitely lowering the risk in the regulated segment of the market, the question is whether or not it's lowering the risk in the market as a whole,\" said Tal.\n\nConsumer insolvencies on the horizon\n\nBankruptcy experts said current data isn't giving a full picture of Canadians' overall debt either.\n\nConsumer insolvencies peaked during the 2007-08 financial crisis and have been relatively stable since 2012. Around 120,000 Canadians went insolvent last year, less than 0.4 per cent of the country's population. But experts in the field know there's a delay between when interest rates go up and when that finally pushes people over the edge.\n\n\"Historically, there has been a two year lag from the time interest rates begin to rise and when consumer insolvencies start to increase,\" said Chantal Gingras, chair of the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals.\n\nSo far, higher rates are mainly hitting variable rate mortgage holders, but most Canadians who borrow to buy a home opt for a fixed-rate term, which insulates them from rate hikes \u2014 for now. When those people renew in an era of higher rates, they could be in for a significant shock.\n\n\"At one point,\" said Gingras, \"consumers will hit a wall.\"\n\nStill, the Bank of Canada was confident when it hiked interest rates in October that households are adjusting to higher rates and housing market policies.\n\nBased on the central bank's analysis this week, Scotiabank deputy chief economist Brett House said it seems as though the slew of recent policy changes are doing what they were designed to do \u2014 but he'd still like to see more data.\n\n\"It doesn't get down as much into the weeds on the impact of the [mortgage] rules as I'd ideally like,\" said House"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Tony Seskus", "title": "What's next for oilpatch hit by 'perfect storm'?", "description": "Alberta oil producers have been struggling with low crude prices for months, but the situation leapt to national prominence this week as prices slipped below $14 US a barrel and some companies began calling for the provincial government to mandate production \u2026", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wcs-wti-oilpatch-oilsands-1.4909067", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4823834.1536938865!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fort-hills-mining-truck.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T09:00:00Z", "content": "Alberta oil producers have been struggling with low crude prices for months, but the situation leapt to national prominence this week as prices skidded below $14 US a barrel and some companies began calling for the provincial government to mandate production \u2026 [+5953 chars]", "fulltext": "Alberta oil producers have been struggling with low crude prices for months, but the situation leapt to national prominence this week as prices skidded below $14 US a barrel and some companies began calling for the provincial government to mandate production cuts.\n\nOpinion on whether Premier Rachel Notley should intervene in the marketplace is divided \u2014 not all companies agree that the market is failing. But the fact the idea is being raised at all highlights the extraordinary concern now surfacing in the oilpatch.\n\nThese kinds of interventions weren't even brought forward during the 2014 oil price collapse that led to thousands of job losses.\n\nThere's much at stake for the industry and government, which benefits from taxes and royalties, says Richard Masson, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. He estimates that the situation is costing the provincial and federal governments, cumulatively, tens of millions of dollars every day.\n\n\"It's a huge loss for all of us,\" said Masson, former head of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission.\n\n\"The challenge is, as this loss continues, people are going to have to scale back on the number of barrels produced and it's going to impact jobs in the near term as we go through this pain.\"\n\nCBC News asked Masson \u2014 who has three decades of experience in oilsands development, energy marketing and finance \u2014 about how the oil sector arrived at this situation and the idea of mandated production cuts.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nRichard Masson is the former head of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission and an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. (Anis Heydari/CBC)\n\nWhy are we at this point where the price of Western Canadian Select oil is trading so low?\n\n\"A few years ago oil prices were quite strong and there was a lot of development in the oil sector. A lot of big oil sands projects were approved. Many of them take four years to construct and employ thousands of people during that process. A number of them have actually started up in the last year or so.\n\n\"There's been a lot of big projects come on stream, bringing on hundreds of thousands of barrels a day of new production. The challenge has been the pipelines that folks were counting on to move that production to market have found either cancellations or delays.\n\n\"So we end up with a lot of production coming out of Alberta that doesn't have a physical way to get to a good refinery that could process it.\"\n\nCanadian drivers are seeing the lowest prices for gasoline in months, as a slump in the price of crude oil has hit gas stations. That slump though has been a big blow for the industry as the price of oilsands crude has fallen to a record low of less than $14 a barrel, sparking calls for production cuts and government intervention. 4:39\n\nSince September prices have really crashed. What's happened more recently?\n\n\"There's been refineries go through a process called a turnaround where they have to take down their processing units and typically change out catalysts to make sure everything is going to be safe. That can last a period of weeks. So there are big refineries in the U.S. and the Midwest \u2014 in Minnesota for example \u2014 that have gone down that typically process a few hundred thousand barrels a day of Alberta's bitumen production.\n\n\"So there's even less of a market right now than there typically is because of those turnarounds. We have the challenge of increasing production from from new projects, no new pipelines to move it to market, and at the other end of the line some refineries that are not online making sure that the market isn't even there for what we had intended to produce. It's made it into a perfect storm.\"\n\nHow long might this perfect storm last?\n\n\"The challenge is we've filled up all the storage that's available and we don't have any near-term options to reduce that storage. So people are trying to ramp up rail but that'll take a period of months \u2014 to ramp up rail exports. So it's unclear how long these big differentials of $40 to $50 dollars a barrel are going to last. Clearly we've got to get the market back in balance and then start to drive down inventories for us to get back to the normal kind of $12 to $15 per barrel differential.\"\n\nWe know that some of those big refineries are going to come online shortly. Does that make much of a difference?\n\n\"Well, I sure hope it does. I mean we're losing so much money as a country right now because we're essentially getting $15 a barrel for our Western Canadian Select production. So if the big refineries coming back online can help that, and if new rail can help, maybe we'll move into the high $30s but it's still probably a tough go for the next few months until the supplies from Alberta balances back up with where it should be.\"\n\nThis situation has led some companies to talk about government needing to step in and mandate production cuts. Has the province done anything like this before?\n\n\"Folks recollect back to when Peter Lougheed turned down the taps in response to the National Energy Program and reduced exports out of Alberta by 15 per cent. However, we haven't had to do anything like that for a very long time.\n\n\"There are risks involved with trying to turn back production. They would affect different companies differently. So some would be supportive; some would be against. Companies have different commitments on pipelines. If you don't give them all the production that they are committed to down a pipeline, that's not a good situation for that particular company. The production reservoirs can be impacted if production is turned down, so you need to plan.\n\n\"Oil is traded in the marketplace, and so you've got to be careful about any information leaks around these kind of things because people could use it to their own financial advantage. So the government, I'm sure, is giving serious consideration to these ideas, figuring out if it's possible. But there's a lot to think about.\"\n\nWhat do you think the likelihood is that we could see mandated production cuts?\n\n\"I think it's difficult to say whether this is going to happen or not. But I do know Alberta has to be very motivated to try and find a solution. As I said, we're losing \u2014 as a province and as a country \u2014 so much money right now by selling our product way below market prices that it's unprecedented.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Franco-Ontarians 'disappointed' by cuts to French services", "description": "Francophones in the Ottawa area say they're frustrated with a pair of decisions the provincial government has taken to reduce the deficit.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/franco-ontarian-frustrated-with-provincial-cuts-1.4910288", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910372.1542480064!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/carol-jolin.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T09:00:00Z", "content": "Francophones in the Ottawa area say they're frustrated with a pair of decisions the provincial government has taken to reduce the deficit.

Some may have hip replacements or medical devices that may serve as cover, allaying the suspicions of border officers, she added.\n\n\"Drug suppliers are looking for unsuspecting people to carry the drugs across the border,\" Tamblyn Watts said. \"And in many cases, older adults are being targeted to carry drugs across the border without their knowledge.\n\n\"So when you're looking at border control, very often they're not suspecting the 85-year-old man or the 92-year-old woman with a walker to be carrying cocaine or other drugs across.\"\n\nShame and fear\n\nWhile she said she does not have data on seniors being exploited by drug traffickers, Tamblyn Watts suspects the problem goes largely unreported.

(Canadian Press)\n\nTamblyn Watts said it's important to raise awareness among seniors in a way that doesn't make them afraid to travel.\n\nArun Maini, a former federal prosecutor who now serves as a criminal defence lawyer, said drug trafficking networks traditionally have targeted naive, financially desperate young people to act as mules.\n\n'Two-step' scam process\n\nNow, it appears they're tapping into the growing senior demographic. Some traffickers use a \"two-step\" process: first compromising seniors financially through fraud, then offering them a quick fix to recoup some of their money.\n\nSeniors may see it as an acceptable risk since many smugglers elude detection, but Maini warned that seniors might struggle to convince a court that they didn't suspect what they were doing might be illegal.\n\n\"They're an easy target because of the financial vulnerability, but I think they're going to be less able than young people to defend themselves on this point of being ignorant or unaware of what they were transporting,\" he said.\n\nThe RCMP say they do not have statistics on seniors being targeted as drug mules while travelling.\n\nThe CBSA document says it is meant to raise \"situational awareness\" for points of entry, regional intelligence and international liaison officers. It says vulnerable adults are those travelling to or transiting through countries with severe penalties for drug-related charges. Amnesty International reports that 15 countries impose the death penalty for drug crimes, it notes.\n\nImporting illegal drugs into Canada is also a serious offence that carries severe penalties.\n\nMules employ multiple methods of smuggling drugs, including 'bodypacking' \u2014 concealing them on the body \u2014 and swallowing drug-filled condoms.\n\nThe CBSA document says perpetrators engaged in this type of exploitation of seniors could be found guilty not only of drug trafficking, but also of money laundering, human trafficking and elder abuse."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Flames use furious comeback to top Oilers in feisty Battle of Alberta", "description": "Elias Lindholm scored twice including the game-winner on Saturday night as the Calgary Flames took over top spot in the Pacific Division with a 4-2 comeback victory over the Edmonton Oilers.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-flames-oilers-recap-nov-17-1.4910462", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910655.1542520356!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/backlund-mikael-111718.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T06:05:41Z", "content": "Elias Lindholm scored twice including the game-winner on Saturday night as the Calgary Flames took over top spot in the Pacific Division with a 4-2 comeback victory over the Edmonton Oilers.

She said she's learned from personal experience and from student society campaigns the challenges UVic students face finding affordable housing.\n\n\"I've talked to other students who have had experience living with black mould or no kitchen facilities or they've sort of turned a living room area into an extra bedroom,\" Kerr said.\n\nNow, she just hopes the construction of the new residences won't be too disruptive to campus life.\n\nProvince will provide $123 million for construction of two new student residence buildings 7:24\n\nWith files from CBC's All Points West"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Scott Taylor", "title": "Western heading back to Vanier Cup as defending champs", "description": "Chris Merchant came back from injury to lead the defending Vanier Cup champion Western Mustangs to a rematch of last year's title game against the Laval Rouge et Or with a 47-24 win over the Saskatchewan Huskies in the Mitchell Bowl on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/university/usports-football-mitchell-bowl-recap-nov-17-1.4910425", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4910556.1542499743!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mitchell-bowl-saskatchewan-western-111718-620.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T01:09:27Z", "content": "Chris Merchant came back from injury to lead the defending Vanier Cup champion Western Mustangs to a rematch of last year's title game against the Laval Rouge et Or with a 47-24 win over the Saskatchewan Huskies in the Mitchell Bowl on Saturday.

Alex Taylor rushed for 141 yards on 12 carries and had two touchdowns in support of Merchant, while Harry McMaster had 152 yards receiving and a pair of TDs.\n\nKyle Siemens paced the Huskies with 256 yards in the air and two touchdowns, while Tyler Chow had 143 yards on the ground and a TD.\n\nWatch highlights of Western's win over Saskatchewan in the Mitchell Bowl:\n\nFifth-year running back Alex Taylor ran for two second-half touchdowns, as the Western Mustangs beat the Saskatchewan Huskies 47-24. Western now looks to repeat as Vanier Cup champions in a rematch against Laval. 0:47\n\nColton Klassen had 107 yards receiving and two scores, and Joey Trumpy caught nine passes for 98 yards.\n\n\"Their offence is good and their quarterback is as good as we've played, and we shut them down in the second half,\" said Western head coach Greg Marshall, whose Mustangs only gave up a single touchdown to the Huskies after halftime.\n\nMarshall added that while it was a good test for his players, he would have preferred to rest a few in the second half had the score not been so close.\n\nThe Mustangs will face the Rouge et Or in the national championship game on Nov. 24 in Quebec City. Earlier Saturday, Laval romped to a 63-0 victory over the St. F-X X-Men in the Uteck Bowl to set up the matchup.\n\nOn Saskatchewan's first drive, strong running by Chow and a spearing penalty by the defence laid the groundwork for 22-yard touchdown pass from Siemens to Klassen at the 10:06 mark.\n\nAfter another three and out for the Mustangs, the Huskies fumbled a handoff on the Western side of the field. The Mustangs took advantage of that miscue when Merchant, looking no worse for wear, found wide receiver McMaster in the end zone at 7:49 to tie the game 7-7.\n\nThe Mustangs offence, however, was just heating up. On their first possession of the second quarter, Merchant hit McMaster again for the go-ahead touchdown on a 31-yard bomb for a 14-7 lead.\n\nThe Huskies answered with a field goal and followed that with an eight-yard major from Siemens to Klassen for his second score of the first half at the 7:00 mark.\n\nThe Huskies defence found Merchant again after the Mustangs pivot scampered to his left and was hit hard from the back just as he released the ball. After several minutes on the turf, he was helped off the field only to return for the next series.\n\nWith time running out in the first half, Merchant carried the Mustangs into field goal position, setting up a 37-yard field goal by Marc Liegghio that tied the game at 17-17."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Grande Prairie RCMP charge 19 men with obtaining sexual services", "description": "The men, aged 23 to 69, were arrested last week during a three-day operation, according to a news release from RCMP.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/grande-prairie-rcmp-charge-19-men-obtaining-sexual-services-1.4910566", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4054945.1542501175!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/unidentified-sex-trade-worker.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T00:53:02Z", "content": "Grande Prairie RCMP have charged 19 men with obtaining sexual services for consideration.
