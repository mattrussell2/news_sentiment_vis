Nadeau found that the child's rights were violated and that her \"dignity, integrity and autonomy\" were compromised.\n\nThe child was under the care of Batshaw Youth and Family Centres, the agency that serves English-speaking Montrealers.\n\nShe was just nine when the first of the incidents occurred.\n\nExcerpts of staff reports included in the ruling reveal in detail how the girl and different boys who were also in Batshaw's care engaged in sexual activity, ranging from touching genitals to vaginal penetration \u2014 often against the girl's stated wishes.\n\n\"X and the boy are clear that she told him to stop, but he did not,\" a youth protection staff member notes in an evaluation report about one of the incidents in 2017.\n\nThat incident took place in a bathroom in the group home. The boy involved was 10 at the time.\n\n\"He proceeded to remove their clothing, touched her vaginal area, and tried to insert his penis in her vagina. He was also coercive in promising her an MP3 player and a fidget spinner to keep quiet,\" the report reads.\n\nAll three incidents occurred at the same group home between November 2016 and August 2017.\n\nThe names of the social workers of the children involved were all withheld in the Oct. 4, 2018 court decision, which was made public Tuesday. The ruling was leaked to La Presse last week.\n\nThe girl's social workers flagged their concerns to their superiors at Batshaw on numerous occasions, according to Nadeau's ruling.\n\nOne social worker said that she was \"appalled, angry and sad after being advised of what happened and that it never should have happened.\"\n\n'Chaotic' home life\n\nThe girl was first placed in the care of youth protection in 2013, at the age of six, after living in a \"chaotic,\" sexualized and drug-filled environment in which her \"basic physical needs\" and \"health care\" were neglected.\n\nA year later, a staff evaluation noted that she \"continued to demonstrate signs of trauma, avoiding sleep and becoming hypervigilant and disruptive in the evening or at bedtimes.\"\n\nHer mother was ultimately sentenced to 18 months in jail for the abuse of her daughter.\n\nThe girl spent time in foster homes and rehabilitation centres before being placed in the group home due to the \"higher level of structure required by the child.\"\n\nThe group home was intended for children between the ages of 10 and 14, often for stays of six to 12 months, and staff there were faced with formidable challenges.\n\nAccording to a social worker cited in the ruling, the children placed there could \"exhibit highly aggressive and sexualized behaviours, as well as psychiatric disorders.\"\n\nStaff turnover, poor clinical model to blame\n\nBatshaw Youth and Family Centres serves English-speaking Montrealers. (CBC)\n\nIn his judgment, Nadeau said the \"Director of Youth Protection admits that there was a lack of appropriate supervision, as well as a lack of understanding of safety plans during all three incidents.\"\n\nNadeau concluded that the incidents were the result of a \"high level of staff turnover\" and an \"inappropriate clinical program model\" lacking in oversight.\n\nA total of 33 social workers are cited in the ruling, suggesting challenges in ensuring continuity of the child's care.\n\nHe noted that improvements were made last year to the group home's clinical program. It now involves a more \"individualized approach,\" he said.\n\nAs part of the ruling, Nadeau ordered that a \"qualified person acting as a shadow be appointed to the child at all times while she is under the care\" of the rehabilitation centre chosen by the youth protection agency.\n\nChanges made, agency says\n\nCIUSSS de l'Ouest-de-l'\u00cele-de-Montr\u00e9al, the regional health agency which oversees Batshaw, refused a request for an interview, citing the Youth Protection Act, which guarantees client confidentiality.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said \"measures were taken immediately following the incidents and those measures ordered by the court were put in place.\"\n\n\"The program in question has undergone a complete review and has now been implemented in its new form,\" the statement said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Josee St-Onge", "title": "Parking lot owner within his rights to use Denver boot, defence lawyer tells court", "description": "The owner of a parking enforcement company was within his rights when he used a Denver boot to immobilize a vehicle, his lawyer argued Tuesday in Edmonton provincial court.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/court-mischief-extortion-denver-boot-parking-enforcement-1.4913659", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4061641.1542750113!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/derrick-cantwell.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:54:57Z", "content": "The owner of a parking enforcement company was within his rights when he used a Denver boot to immobilize a vehicle, his lawyer argued Tuesday in Edmonton provincial court.

Trump avoids, at least for now, a potentially risky and unpredictable sit-down with prosecutors, while Mueller secures a set of on-the-record statements whose accuracy the president and his lawyers will be expected to stand by for the duration of the investigation.\n\n\"The president today answered written questions submitted by the special counsel's office,\" attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement. \"The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry. The president responded in writing.\"\n\nSekulow said in a follow-up message that the legal team would not release copies of the questions and answers or discuss correspondence with the special counsel's office.\n\nMueller's team may well press for additional information.\n\nDozens of questions\n\nInvestigators months ago presented Trump's legal team with dozens of questions they wanted to ask the president related to whether his campaign coordinated with the Kremlin to tip the 2016 election and whether he sought to criminally obstruct the Russia probe by actions including the firing of former FBI director James Comey.\n\nMueller's office agreed to accept written responses to questions about potential Russian collusion and tabled, for the moment, obstruction-related inquiries.\n\nThey left open the possibility that they would follow up with additional questions on obstruction, though Trump's lawyers \u2014 who had long resisted any face-to-face interview \u2014 had been especially adamant that the Constitution shielded him from having to answer any questions about actions he took as president.\n\nIf Trump's written responses satisfy Mueller's team, they stave off a potential subpoena fight over the U.S. president's testimony. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nAnother of Trump's lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, said Tuesday that the lawyers continue to believe that \"much of what has been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry.\" He said Mueller's office had received \"unprecedented co-operation from the White House.\"\n\n\"It is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion,\" Giuliani said.\n\nThe precise questions and answers that Trump gave to Mueller weren't immediately clear, though the president told reporters last week that he had prepared the responses himself.\n\n'We're finished'\n\nTrump told Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that he was unlikely to answer questions about obstruction, saying, \"I think we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we're finished.\"\n\nTrump joins a list of recent presidents to be questioned as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nIn 2004, George W. Bush was interviewed by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald's office during an investigation into the leaked identity of a CIA officer. In 1998, President Bill Clinton testified before a federal grand jury in independent counsel Ken Starr's Whitewater investigation.\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday that Mueller's office has received 'unprecedented co-operation from the White House.' (Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)\n\nMueller could theoretically still look to subpoena the president if he feels the answers are not satisfactory. But Justice Department leaders, including acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker \u2014 who now oversees the investigation and has spoken pejoratively of it in the past \u2014 would have to sign off on such a move, and it's far from clear that they would. It's also not clear that Mueller's team would prevail if a subpoena fight reaches the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled on whether a president can be subpoenaed to testify in a criminal case. Clinton was subpoenaed to appear before the Whitewater grand jury, though investigators withdrew the subpoena once he agreed to appear voluntarily.\n\nOther cases involving Presidents Richard Nixon and Clinton have presented similar issues for the justices that could be instructive now.\n\nIn 1974, for instance, the court ruled that Nixon could be ordered to turn over subpoenaed audio recordings, a decision that hastened his resignation from office. The court in 1998 said Clinton could be questioned under oath in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Muriel Draaisma", "title": "TTC's 'newest generation' hybrid electric bus expected on the road in 2 weeks", "description": "The Toronto Transit Commission took ownership of its \"newest generation\" hybrid electric bus on Tuesday and Mayor John Tory was on hand to celebrate the moment.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ttc-hybrid-electric-bus-first-1.4913591", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4913634.1542747887!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ttc-hybrid-electric-bus.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:16:29Z", "content": "The Toronto Transit Commission took ownership of what it calls its \"newest generation\" hybrid electric bus on Tuesday and Mayor John Tory was on hand to celebrate the moment.

(CBC)\n\nIn 2015, the provincial commission launched a review of the homicide investigation after several issues came to light during Oland's first trial, which ended in a jury finding him guilty.\n\nThe court heard evidence of officers entering the crime scene without wearing protective gear to avoid contamination and using the washroom located in the foyer outside the victim's office for two days before it was tested for evidence. A key piece of the Crown's evidence against Oland \u2014 a blood-spotted brown sports jacket \u2014 was kept rolled up in a paper bag for months before forensic testing.\n\nIn October 2016, when the New Brunswick Court of Appeal overturned Oland's conviction and ordered a new trial, citing errors in the trial judge's instructions to the jury, the commission suspended its review \"until such time as all criminal proceedings are completed.\"\n\nExecutive director Steve Roberge told CBC News on Tuesday that decision stands.\n\n\"We do not want to prejudice the criminal proceedings with our Police Act investigation,\" he said.\n\nAsked how that could be a concern now that the trial is proceeding by judge alone, Roberge replied: \"In this case it's not necessarily the fact that we're prejudicing the proceedings themselves, it's also prejudicing the perception of the carriage of justice.\"\n\nPressed on whether not proceeding with the investigation could have the same effect, he replied, \"We don't know who and what kind of material we need to follow up with until the end of the criminal processes.\"\n\nThe Saint John police board declined further comment, citing the continuing court case.\n\nChief Bruce Connell did not provide any comments or respond to questions about Rocca's current status.\n\nThe body of Richard Oland, 69, was discovered face down in a pool of blood in his investment firm office the morning of July 7, 2011. He had suffered 45 sharp- and blunt-force blows to his head, neck and hands.\n\nHis son was the last known person to see him alive when they met there the night before.\n\nOland has maintained his innocence from the beginning and his extended family has stood by him.\n\n\"All Dennis and his family want is a fair trial as soon as possible, without further delay, a trial at which they are confident of Dennis finally being vindicated and his innocence declared,\" said Gold, adding the Olands are \"extremely pleased\" Morrison agreed to proceed with a judge-alone trial.\n\nGold said starting jury selection over with a brand new jury panel could have bumped the trial back several months, raising the possibility of an unconstitutional delay.\n\nThe Supreme Court has set a time limit for superior court cases of 30 months, from the time a charge is laid to the conclusion of a first trial.

The crisp breakouts that used to trigger odd-man rushes featuring some of the league's most skilled players moving at warp speed have largely vanished and been replaced by something significantly sloppier.\n\nOh, and the NHL at large has caught up to the frenetic tempo Sullivan introduced when he took over nearly three years ago, a hiring that \u2014 combined with a roster makeover authored by general manager Jim Rutherford \u2014 helped power the Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cups. In that way, Pittsburgh's current struggles are a byproduct of its not-so-distant glory.\n\n\"For the most part it's a copycat league and teams tend to try to emulate the teams that have success,\" Sullivan said Tuesday. \"When you look at our team over the last handful of seasons, we've had pretty good success with a certain style of play.\"\n\nCatching up to speed\n\nA style Sullivan has no plans to abandon even with Pittsburgh mired in a 1-7-2 funk that has dropped his club into a tie for the fewest points in the wide-open Eastern Conference a quarter of the way through the season.\n\n\"You look at the core of our players, [Sidney] Crosby, [Evgeni] Malkin, [Phil] Kessel, [Kris] Letang, all those guys can skate,\" Sullivan said. \"They can still skate.\"\n\nThe thing now is, so can everyone else.\n\nThe proof came to life over the last 30 minutes against Buffalo on Monday night, when the Sabres reeled off the final four goals, including Jake Eichel's game-winner 45 seconds into overtime at the end of a sequence that began with a Malkin giveaway in the offensive zone.\n\nIt was the kind of miscue Pittsburgh used to pounce on with ruthless efficiency. Now it's the Penguins who are making the crucial mistakes, ones that are ending up in the back of their own net with alarming regularity.\n\n\"I think we've been doing some really good things the last handful of games but we've been shooting ourselves in the foot a little bit with a few plays,\" forward Bryan Rust said. \"We've got to be a little bit more mindful of that and just dig down a little bit deeper and the bounces will eventually go our way.\"\n\nLack of 'puck luck'\n\nThere is a fair amount of \"puck luck\" that's abandoned Pittsburgh at the moment. The Penguins were up two goals late in the second period against Buffalo when Pittsburgh defenceman Jack Johnson locked up Sabres forward Conor Sheary in front of the net. No matter. Casey Nelson's shot from the point deflected off Johnson's skate and by goaltender Casey DeSmith.\n\nWatching from afar while sitting out a third straight game nursing an upper body injury, Crosby could only scratch his head.\n\n\"I think the thing for us that's probably been a little more difficult is, it's not necessarily the same thing,\" said the two-time MVP, who hopes to play on Wednesday when Pittsburgh hosts Dallas. \"We've found different ways to lose games and you know, we've probably corrected one thing and something else has been a factor in another game we lost.\"\n\nOne thread, however, has been a constant: defence. The Penguins \u2014 particularly early in the season during the Crosby era \u2014 have occasionally been slow to tighten things up because they are so talented offensively that the finer points of playing responsibly in their own end can be lost.\n\nIn past years, Pittsburgh has been able to outscore opponents even on nights it didn't particularly play well. That's not happening at the moment. The loss to Buffalo marked the eighth time in 19 games the Penguins have allowed at least five goals, something they did 13 times all of last season.\n\nDefence can improve\n\nWhile Sullivan is quick to point to the number of quality chances Pittsburgh created against Buffalo, he's well aware his team was far too generous in front of DeSmith. Pittsburgh dominated the first period but only had a 1-1 tie to show for it after forward Dominik Simon lost his footing while attempting to help clear a puck. Buffalo kept it in the zone and a cross-ice pass led to a one-timer that Tage Thompson buried to even the game.\n\n\"We've got to do a better job defending and making sure we stay on the right side of the puck and the right side of people in the critical areas of the rink,\" Sullivan said. \"That's an area we can all improve as a team.\"\n\nPittsburgh hasn't missed the playoffs since Crosby's rookie year in 2005-06 and Crosby stressed it is far too early to panic.\n\n\"It's tight but we just have to make sure we eliminate our mistakes and give ourselves the best chance and I thought for the most part [against Buffalo] we were pretty in control of that game,\" Crosby said. \"I think if we keep trending that way, we'll learn from that one and get a lot more wins.\"\n\nThree quarters of the season remains. Though the Penguins have been \"meh\" at best, the rest Metropolitan Division hasn't exactly been lights out. Only eight points separate the Penguins from first-place Columbus. One good consistent stretch of hockey and things can change very quickly.\n\n\"You can't control the ones you've let slip away,\" Crosby said. \"Ten games from now, you don't know where you're going to be.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "B.C. cities mark international Trans Day of Remembrance \u2014 some for the first time", "description": "Hundreds of transgender people around the world are killed every year simply for being trans.

Most major gun retailers, such as Canadian Tire and Cabela's, already follow this sort of record-keeping practice.\n\nScheer said he would enforce his proposed lifetime bans by instituting new criminal penalties for any individual selling a firearm to someone subject to such a ban.\n\nScheer also promised measures to temporarily seize firearms from people detained for mental health-related issues, saying the \"mentally unstable\" should not have easy access to guns.\n\n\"A Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer will ensure that any firearms owner detained under provincial mental health legislation will immediately have their firearms seized,\" he said. \"They will be able to apply, after a period of time, to have their property returned if they can demonstrate that their condition has stabilized.\"\n\nIn addition to C-71, the Liberal government has vowed to study a ban on handguns in an effort to tamp down on gun-related crime following a series of deadly incidents this year in Canadian cities big and small.\n\nBorder Security and Organized Crime Reduction Minister Bill Blair has been tasked by the prime minister with \"an examination of a full ban on handguns and assault weapons in Canada, while not impeding the lawful use of firearms by Canadians\" \u2014 a proposition that has opened up a divide between urban and rural Liberal MPs, with some warning the rights of lawful gun owners must be considered when crafting new laws to curb gun crime.\n\nThe efficacy of such a policy has been questioned by experts \u2014 including RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, who has said she's not sure a ban is the answer to a spike in gun-related crimes.\n\nAdam Palmer, the president of Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, has also said handgun possession is already heavily regulated by existing firearms legislation.\n\n\"Criminals will still come into possession of them, and still use them for illegal purposes,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHeidi Rathjen, coordinator of the gun control advocacy group Poly Remembers, has called the federal government's decision to study handguns \"very encouraging.\"\n\n\"There are different ways to get at it.

The city wants to crack down on units that don't comply with its bylaws to protect tenants in a tough rental market. In doing so, though, it results in tenants like Chorney being evicted.\n\nMike Wood of Hamilton ACORN says the city should grandfather in rental units found to be illegal or it will displace unsuspecting tenants. (Samantha Craggs/CBC)\n\nThe city says it needs to crack down on illegal units to keep tenants safe. Hamilton ACORN says when a crack down happens, tenants such as Chorney should be grandfathered in.\n\n\"We can have some kind of a balance,\" said chair Mike Wood. He'd also like to see a rule that properties can't be sold unless they're zoned for the correct use.\n\nThis issue has been discussed since 2013, when city council debated implementing a rental housing bylaw.\n\nThat bylaw would see landlords with buildings with six or fewer units \u2014 like Chorney's at 228 Rosewood Rd. \u2014 pay an annual fee and abide by annual inspections.\n\nThose in favour of such a bylaw say it would benefit tenants who live in dangerous housing, especially around McMaster University and Mohawk College. Those opposed say it'll displace tenants and cause as much as a 30 per cent reduction in rental housing.\n\nACORN protest 3:09\n\nThe city formed a rental housing subcommittee in 2016. It's still grappling with the issue. The city is looking for work-arounds, including free inspections and anonymous tip lines.\n\nBut Wood said Monday that tenants aren't heard much at those tables.\n\nChorney's landlord, Ryan Kennedy, is frustrated too. He's a Hamilton native in his thirties who flies cargo jets. His wife is a mail carrier.\n\nThey refinanced their home to buy this rental property as an investment, Kennedy said. He's gone above and beyond to ensure the units are safe and healthy, he said. His wife gardens on the property. His own home is nearby.\n\nThe place had six units when he bought it in 2014, he said. As far as he knows, it's been like that for years.\n\n'Everybody's getting screwed'\n\nHe's asked the city for some leniency, but it won't give him any. Rezoning is expensive, he said, and comes with no guarantee of approval.\n\n\"Shawna's getting screwed,\" he said. \"We're getting screwed. Everybody's getting screwed.\"\n\nLast October, someone called the city to complain about the illegal units at 228 Rosewood, said Kelly Barnett, manager of service delivery in licensing and bylaw services, in an email.\n\nWe're in the business to make sure that their living conditions are safe and healthy. - Kim Coombs, manager, municipal law enforcement\n\nBylaw officers ordered the property owner to bring the property back to its permitted use of four units, get a conversion permit or rezone the property.\n\n\"Staff do not direct the property owners on which option they take,\" she said. \"It is the property owner's decision on how they will obtain compliance.\"\n\nACORN members carried signs into the city bylaw office on York Boulevard Monday. But the conversation was circular.\n\n'We're not in the business to displace people'\n\nKim Coombs, manager of municipal law enforcement, told Wood that staff don't set the rules. City council makes bylaws. Staff just enforce them.\n\n\"We're not in the business to displace people,\" she told Wood.\n\n\"We're in the business to make sure that their living conditions are safe and healthy. So if it's an illegal zoning, it's not safe and healthy. If it's illegal and it comes to our attention, we have to investigate it.\"\n\nThe bylaws are applied inconsistently, Wood said. He also asked if staff tell council about the issues they are hearing about. Wood said yes. But the rules are what they are, she said, and they keep people safe. They have to be enforced.\n\nMeanwhile, Chorney feels stuck. She's applying to the Rental Housing Tribunal, which will buy her a little more time. But she's also preparing to lose her home of 10 years.\n\n\"I make a decent living, but not enough to pay $1,000 in rent.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Mike Blanchfield", "title": "Freeland says Khashoggi case not closed; but Trump says facts may never be known", "description": "Canada will use the upcoming G20 summit to push for answers in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/freeland-khashoggi-demanding-answers-1.4913759", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4884197.1540918666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nic459061.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:47:38Z", "content": "Canada will use the upcoming G20 summit to push for answers in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says.

(Ron Jenkins/Associated Press/File)\n\nBut St. Louis \u2014 which has lost four of five, including consecutive shutout defeats that sealed Yeo's fate \u2014 sits 30th in the overall standings, two points up on last-place Los Angeles.\n\nEdmonton, meanwhile, entered Tuesday in 26th.\n\n\"I'm not absolving myself of any responsibility with regards to the team and its current performance or the current slump we're in,\" Chiarelli said. \"The same goes for players \u2014 they shouldn't be absolving themselves either.\"\n\nOne difference in Chicago and Los Angeles is at least those teams have enjoyed recent success.\n\nNot enough recent success\n\nQuenneville won three Stanley Cups in his 10-plus seasons with the Blackhawks, while the Kings won titles in 2012 and 2014, albeit before the promotion of Stevens to head coach.\n\nSalary cap constraints have forced Chicago to repeatedly remake itself around Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, Brent Seabrook and Duncan Keith.\n\n\"We need to maximize each and every opportunity with our playoff goals in mind and create continued growth and development throughout our roster at the same time,\" Blackhawks GM Stan Bowman said in a statement after firing Quenneville.\n\nLos Angeles also still consists of top-end talent with Hart Trophy finalist Anze Kopitar, Norris Trophy-winning defenceman Drew Doughty, as well as forwards Jeff Carter and Ilya Kovalchuk.\n\nBut like the Oilers, the Kings haven't got enough from their supporting cast.\n\n\"You look at training camp and you look at the regular season to where we are now,\" Los Angeles GM Rob Blake said when Stevens was shown the door. \"The expectations have not been met.\"\n\nWith four coaches already down and a razor-thin margin for error standings, there could be more than a few sleepless nights for some of the other 27 men behind NHL benches in the coming weeks and months."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Steve Rukavina", "title": "'I blocked it out,' alleged victim testifies in sexual abuse trial of Fr.

He says the NDP promised to make this change in their 2015 campaign platform.\n\n\"The legislation we are introducing today takes the politics out of pensions,\" Ceci said. \"We're putting control in the hands of people who contribute to the plans. Both employers and employees.\n\n\"By making this change, pensions decisions aren't imposed on plan owners but instead are made by plan owners.\"\n\nSupporters say the proposed changes could have prevented the situation that arose in February 2014, when Alison Redford's Progressive Conservative government introduced Bill 9, which proposed major changes to public-sector pensions.\n\nThe bill's most contentious feature was a jump in the age at which public sector workers with 30 years of service could retire with full benefits.\n\nThe changes were proposed without prior consultation with unions, which prompted protests by members across the province. The bill was referred to an all-party committee several months later, and died on the order paper when the legislature was prorogued in September 2014.\n\nGuy Smith, president of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, referenced the Bill 9 fight in a news release supporting the government's new legislation.\n\n\"This legislation will bring more certainty for members, whose pension funds were previously under the direct control of governments that were sometimes more driven by political motivation than what is in the best interest of workers,\" he said.\n\nThe Official Opposition United Conservative Party is reserving comment on the bill until their MLAs have a chance to review it.\n\nTransition planned for March\n\nBill 27 will not affect how the plans are funded nor the benefits given to employees. If passed, the transition to the new governance model would happen on March 1, 2019.\n\nThe plans affected by the bill are:\n\nLocal Authorities Pension Plan (LAPP) - includes nurses and health-care workers employed by Alberta Health Services, municipal employees, and support and administrative staff at school boards;\n\nPublic Service Pension Plan (PSPP) - includes government of Alberta employees and non-academic staff at the University of Alberta, University of Calgary, and seven other post-secondary institutions, and;\n\nSpecial Forces Pension Plan - police officers in Calgary, Edmonton and other municipal forces covered by the plan.\n\nThe governance model proposed under Bill 27 separates the decision making and administration functions and places them under two separate boards.\n\nThe sponsor board would have equal representation from unions and employers, and would set contribution rates, review the budget and make decisions on changes to eligibility and benefit levels. It would also take the interests of retirees into account.\n\nThe corporation board would be in charge of administering the plan, setting investment policy, communicating with plan members and working with regulators.\n\nThere are 351,210 active, deferred and retired members of the three pension plans.\n\nPublic sector pension plans in British Columbia and Ontario also use a joint governance model.\n\nThe government spent the summer consulting with unions and employers about a new governance structure.

He chose the trail, formerly the Trans-Canada Trail, because it connects community, history, beauty and geography.\n\nThose first kilometres were in Newfoundland, where Meise found himself in the middle of the worst rainstorm he's ever experienced. Turns out, that was just a taste of the adventures yet to come.\n\nThe fly of his tent was shredded \u2014 twice \u2014 by ravens.

Since arriving home, he dreams that he has to wake up and start walking again.\n\nBut with the trek over, Meise is excited about new opportunities that lie ahead. During the journey, he posted to his Facebook page and to Twitter when he had access, and filled dozens of journals with tales of his adventures.\n\nUsing his now-intimate knowledge of Canada from coast to coast to coast, he is planning to start a podcast and write a book.

Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox every weekday.\n\nOK, here's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:\n\nA key Ottawa player might be suspended for the Grey Cup\n\nJonathan Rose was hit with a one-game ban today by the CFL for shoving an official during the East final. The star defensive back immediately appealed the ruling and it's not 100 per cent certain the process will play out before Sunday's game. So there's still a chance he could play.\n\nIt's a harsh penalty, but also a pretty easy call for the CFL. The league said it's tough to keep a player out of the championship game but it wanted to \"send a strong signal\" that refs can't be disrespected or abused. This was a clear case of both. The trouble started for Rose when he whipped Hamilton receiver Bralon Addison to the ground well after he'd stepped out of bounds. Rose was flagged for the hit, a scrum ensued, and Rose pushed the official onto a pile of players. He was then tossed from the game.\n\nOttawa is going to miss Rose. He's one of the best at creating turnovers. Rose tied for the CFL lead this year in both interceptions (5) and forced fumbles (4). Without the all-star in their lineup, it just got harder for the Redblacks to contain a Calgary offence that topped the league in passing TDs.\n\nThe Broad Street Bullies are now\u2026 the Broad Street Nice, Respectful Young Men?\n\nOK, that has zero ring to it, but get this: Twenty games into its season, Philadelphia is one of two NHL teams that has yet to receive a major penalty for fighting (Arizona is the other). Pretty different from those infamous Flyers teams who bare-knuckled their way to two consecutive Stanley Cups in the mid-'70s. The face of the Flyers used to be fierce enforcers like Dave \"The Hammer\" Schultz. Now it's this guy:\n\nNo one's idea of a Broad Street Bully. (Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nPhilly's lack of scraps is another sign of a broader trend in hockey: fighting is disappearing. According to the website hockeyfights.com, 16.56 per cent of games this season have had at least one fight. Ten years ago, it was 41.38 per cent.\n\nDon't forget, though: fans of other sports still think it's absolutely insane that two guys are allowed to punch each other in the face for a couple minutes while everybody watches and then the game just goes on like pretty much nothing happened.\n\nThe Oilers got Hitched\n\nApparently determined not to waste another season of the best player in hockey, Edmonton fired coach Todd McLellan today. The Oilers, who missed the playoffs last year even though Connor McDavid won his second scoring title in a row, have lost six of their last seven to fall to sixth in the Pacific Division. GM Peter Chiarelli ought to shoulder some blame too: he traded future MVP Taylor Hall to New Jersey and signed Milan Lucic (one goal in 20 games this season) for seven years and $42 million US.\n\nTo replace McLellan, Edmonton brought Ken Hitchcock out of retirement. The hockey lifer said he was done last April after a 22-year NHL head coaching career that included a 1999 Stanley Cup title in Dallas. He ranks third all-time in regular-season wins. At 66, he becomes the oldest coach in the league.\n\nMcLellan was the second NHL coach fired in a span of about 12 hours. Mike Yeo got the axe in St. Louis last night. The Blues didn't name a permanent replacement, but there's an obvious one out there. Joel Quenneville, who started with St. Louis and went on to become the second-winningest NHL coach ever, was fired by Chicago two weeks ago. Quenneville, though, seems to be living unemployed life to the fullest. He took a shot with some fellow Bears fans at the tailgate before Sunday night's game in Chicago:\n\nQuickly...\n\nThat Chiefs-Rams game broke fantasy football. After L.A.'s wild 54-51 Monday night win, Yahoo was flooded with complaints about players' stats not being counted on its popular fantasy site (the problem was eventually fixed in the morning). It's almost like the scoring system couldn't keep up, and can you blame it? The third-highest scoring game in NFL history also put a dent in bookies' bankrolls. The strong majority of bettors took the \"over\" despite it being set way up at 64 \u2014 believed to be an all-time high. The Chiefs and Rams blew past it by 41.\n\nCan we stop with the disgusting leg injuries? A day after Washington quarterback Alex Smith suffered a brutal, Theismann-esque compound leg fracture, it was the NHL's turn to turn our stomachs. The right leg of Florida's Vincent Trocheck bent under him at an awful angle as he went into the boards with an Ottawa player. Trocheck was taken off on a stretcher, but as of this afternoon there was still no word on exactly what, and how bad, his injury is.\n\nBig Maple is off to the Bronx. James Paxton, the best active Canadian pitcher in baseball, was traded from Seattle to the New York Yankees for three prospects. The 6-foot-4, 235-pound lefty struck out 208 batters in a career-high 160 innings last year. He fanned 16 against Oakland on May 2 before pitching a no-hitter in Toronto six days later.\n\nMajor League Baseball's non-American hit king retired. Adrian Beltre leaves with 3,166 hits \u2014 more than any other player born outside the United States. The Dominican third baseman also slugged 477 home runs (30th all time) and won five Gold Gloves for his defensive ability. He'll also be remembered for a weird quirk \u2014 he hated anyone touching his head. Teammates and opponents would sometimes tease him over it, and Beltre wasn't always amused.\n\nCleveland is done with J.R. Smith. The maddening forward \"will no longer be with the team as the organization works with JR and his representation regarding his future,\" the Cavaliers said today. Smith helped the Cavs win their first title in 2016, but he's also famous for big-time brain cramps like the time he seemed to forget the score near the end of Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals.\n\nYou're up to speed.

Watch it here.\n\nKhashoggi killing\n\nA Turkish news website has published extracts from audio recordings that purportedly capture the final minutes and violent death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate last month.\n\nThe transcripts, released last night by the website Habert\u00fcrk, claim to detail what happened once the outspoken 59-year-old critic of the Saudi royal family arrived for an appointment to fill out paperwork for his impending marriage to his Turkish fianc\u00e9e.\n\nThis image taken from CCTV video obtained by the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet claims to show Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, just prior to his murder. (Hurriyet via AP)\n\n\"Release my arm! What do you think you are doing?\" Khashoggi says in the first tape, recorded shortly after he entered the main consulate building on the afternoon of Oct. 2.\n\nA verbal quarrel between the writer and at least four other men \u2014 presumed to be members of a Saudi hit squad \u2014 then continues for seven minutes.\n\nThe second recording, said to have been captured inside an adjoining administration building, begins with four minutes of shouting, screaming and the sound of violent blows. \"Traitor! You will be brought to account,\" vows one voice, identified by Habert\u00fcrk as being Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a bodyguard to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe torture goes on for another 11 minutes, before the recording goes silent for an hour and 15 minutes \u2014 a period during which Turkish officials say the Saudis used frequency jammers to foil eavesdropping. Then there are the sounds of what is alleged to be the hit squad deleting security camera footage and removing the hard disks.\n\nFinally, a man identified as Mustafa al-Modaini by the website says, \"it is spooky to wear the clothes of a man whom we killed 20 minutes ago.\" He then complains that Khashoggi's shoes are too small for his feet.\n\nTurkish authorities allege that he is the man later seen leaving the rear of the building in a fake beard and dressed in the journalist's clothes.\n\nA frame from video obtained by CNN that claims to show a man leaving the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 wearing Khashoggi's clothing. (CNN)\n\nThe website also refers to recordings of 19 phone calls made that afternoon from the consul's office, including four conversations involving Mutreb and Saud al-Qahtani, a close advisor to the Crown Prince, who has been removed from his job as part of the Kingdom's probe into the killing.\n\nThis past weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had been briefed about the content of the audio recordings that the Turkish government has been sharing with intelligence services around the globe, but added that he had chosen not to listen to them.\n\n\"It's a suffering tape. It's a terrible tape,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News. \"It's very violent, very vicious and terrible.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump outside the White House on Monday. The White House released a statement Tuesday saying it intends to remain a 'steadfast partner' of Saudi Arabia. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nBut it now seems evident that he doesn't intend to do anything about it.\n\nThe White House issued a new statement this afternoon that it is \"standing with Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n\"The world is a dangerous place,\" it begins, going on to talk about the threat of Iran, Saudi Arabia's desire to have its military leave Yemen, and the Kingdom's promise to invest $450 billion US in the United States, including billions in arms purchases. Any change in that economic relationship would be a \"wonderful gift\" to China and Russia, says Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to the \"terrible\" murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the White House statement says that \"we may never know all of the facts,\" and regardless, the United States \"intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\"\n\nThe statement, which comes on the day Trump was scheduled to receive a briefing on the Central Intelligence Agency's findings about the Khashoggi killing \u2014 reportedly a firm conclusion that the Crown Prince ordered the hit \u2014 is sure to further fuel claims that the U.S. is engaged in some sort of cover-up effort to protect the heir to the Saudi throne.\n\nMiddle East Eye, a London-based news outlet, published a report today claiming that the Saudi royals are simply following a \"roadmap\" devised by their allies in Washington. The plan was hand-delivered by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a sit down with Saudi King Salman and the Crown Prince in Riyadh last month, says the report. It adds that the plan includes an as-yet-unused option \u2014 to pin the blame on a more junior member of the ruling al-Saud family, should the pressure to act become too intense.\n\nSaudi King Salman gives his annual policy address Monday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In his first major speech since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, he expressed support for his son the crown prince, and made no mention of accusations that the prince ordered the killing. (The Associated Press)\n\nThe U.S. State Department says the article is a \"complete misrepresentation\" of what happened during Pompeo's trip.\n\nFor their part, the Saudis appear confident enough to again go on the offensive against their critics.\n\nYesterday, in his first public remarks since Khashoggi's death, King Salman heaped praise on his judiciary, although he did not actually mention the murder or the ensuing investigation that has seen 21 people arrested and 11 charged.\n\nAnd today, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir issued a pointed warning to those who want to keep pushing the matter.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir addresses a news conference in the desert kingdom's capital Riyadh on Nov. 15.

It's estimated that more than 12,000 were hospitalized because of it. And still Canadians aren't getting the flu shot in high numbers.\n\nIn fact, last year only 38 per cent of Canadians got inoculated against flu \u2014 far lower than the 80 per cent rate Health Canada would like to see.\n\nA nurse prepares an influenza vaccination. Flu can cause serious illness even in young, otherwise healthy victims, and the Public Health Agency of Canada calls it, 'an underappreciated contributor to mortality.' (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nSome people say they don't get the flu shot because they feel sick afterwards. Some are afraid of needles. Others point to the fact that the vaccination isn't always successful at fighting the right influenza strain, or say they didn't realize how serious getting the flu can be.\n\nTonight, The National is asking our expert health panel why Canadians aren't taking the flu seriously enough, and how the health system can change that. On the panel are:\n\nDr. Danielle Martin, vice-president of medical affairs and health system solutions at Women's College Hospital\n\nDr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health Systems and University Health Network\n\nDr. Lennox Huang, chief medical officer and vice-president for medical and academic affairs at The Hospital for Sick Children\n\nWe'll also ask them to weigh in on some of the biggest news stories of the week, including the charges brought against students at Toronto's private school, St. Michael's College School, and the impact trauma has on health.\n\n- Perlita Stroh\n\nWATCH: The National's health panel tonight on CBC Television and The National's health panel tonight on CBC Television and streamed online\n\nLike this newsletter?

(Ludovic Marin/Reuters)\n\nUnder legislation introduced last week in the Diet, the country's parliament, that day will become a public holiday.\n\nBut because it falls in the midst of several other annual celebrations, like the birthday of the late Emperor Hirohito on April 29, it will trigger even more days off under a law that automatically bridges weekdays between official holidays.\n\nThus, the country will essentially shut down starting on Saturday, April 27, through Children's Day on Monday, May 6.\n\nThe Japanese will also get another day off on Oct. 22, the day of Naruhito's enthronement ceremony, for a total of 22 national holidays in the 2019 calendar year.\n\nThe 58-year-old Naruhito's transition from Crown Prince to Emperor will be a gradual one, governed by ancient traditions:\n\nAt the beginning of May, he will inherit the royal regalia, including the crown jewels and sacred sword.\n\nhe will inherit the royal regalia, including the crown jewels and sacred sword. Then comes the October enthronement and public celebration.\n\nFinally there is the Daijo-sai (Great Thanksgiving Festival) next November, where the new emperor will commune with the spirits of his divine ancestors, making offerings of sacred rice and sake.\n\nMany of the details have yet to be made public, but preparations are well under way.\n\nOver the summer, workers at the Kyoto Imperial Palace carefully dismantled the takamikura and michodai, the dual-dias thrones that Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako will use in one part of the accession ceremony.

(Mairin Prentiss/CBC)\n\n\"All we are trying to say is it is our story. Include us in the telling of it. That's not that difficult to understand,\" said Bowden, who grew up in New Glasgow and calls herself a social justice advocate.\n\nBowden said she suggested early on that the firm instead ask black artists to collaborate on what story needed to be told and how to do it before putting a public call out.\n\nShe takes issue with people, many of whom may not be African-Nova Scotian, interpreting the racism that Desmond had to endure.\n\n\"It had sort of a historic feel to us where our story is being told by someone else and excludes the custodians of that pain,\" she said.\n\nBowden sent a letter outlining her concerns to the firm's founding partner, Jamie MacGillivray, in October.\n\nThe contest asked artists to create work inspired by Viola Desmond's act of protest in 1946 when she refused to leave the whites-only section of the Roseland Theatre.

Given recent allegations of a racially motivated attack in Pictou County, Bowden said it's important for people to first listen to members of the black community.\n\n\"It's dangerous to tout that we've arrived, when in fact the custodians of that pain are at their kitchen tables saying we haven't arrived,\" she said.\n\n'Viola commemorative committee' formed\n\nWhile the art shows have been cancelled, it's still possible that some of the submissions will end up displayed on the former theatre.\n\nThe firm has formed a committee, chaired by Henderson Paris, a former town councillor and long-time resident, that will decide how to commemorate Desmond.\n\nThe law firm bought the former Roseland Theatre two years ago. (Submitted by Alexis MacDonald)\n\nParis said committee members are still being chosen, and it's too soon to say what pieces, if any, will hang on the building.\n\nStill, he believes the contest, and the conversations it forced people to have, are worthwhile.\n\n\"We envision something wonderful happening, something that will be educational in nature and do honour to Viola Desmond, a pioneer who stood up and stepped up and helped make a change,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Kelvin High School evacuated due to threat", "description": "Kelvin High School is being evacuated as a precaution after a bomb threat was received, police say.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/kelvin-high-school-evacuated-1.4913326", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4913348.1542741360!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kelvin-evacuated.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:17:36Z", "content": "Kelvin High School is being evacuated as a precaution after a bomb threat was received, police say.

You just don't fall over, you start feeling sleepy. That's one possibility, but it just seems so remote that that would happen to people that worked in the industry.

We hear from the head of Nature Canada on lessons to learned from past social movements. 8:37\n\n'What are environmentalists fighting for?'\n\nQ: Why can hope be forgotten by environmentalists?\n\nA: Environmentalists don't do hope very well. If we are honest with ourselves, we peddle mainly in fear. There are good reasons to be deeply worried about the state of the world, but at the same time, we also need to find ways to provide a message that is hopeful and moves and motivates people, and inspires people to take action.\n\nQ: Is there a worry at all that once words of hope are spread on the issue, the sense of urgency will fade and people will become more relaxed and feel as if everything will work out?\n\nGraham Saul interviewed 116 environmentalists to ask them, 'What are you fighting for?'\n\nA: I have always been fascinated by history's great social movements; by the epic struggles that redefine how we relate to one another: the civil rights movement; the abolitionist movement; the anti-colonial movement after the Second World War.... I realized that those movements used powerful words to sum up their ultimate goal \u2026 words like equality, independence, freedom, liberty. Those movements were responding to situations that were very bleak and were very horrible \u2026 but they summed up those goals in hopeful terms and in ways that would inspire people. I began to ask myself, what are environmentalists fighting for? What are the words that we use that bring together the diverse dimensions of our work and put forward a positive, hopeful goal?\n\nQ: The 116 environmentalists you interviewed, did they have a hopeful goal? Did they use words like hope and unity?\n\nA: No, unfortunately, they didn't. In fact, the answers I got were all over the place.... The Number 1 word that was used, by one in five of the 116 environmentalists that I interviewed, was \"survival.\" Many people agreed that that might be an accurate way of depicting the scale of the problem, but it wasn't going to provide that kind of hopeful vision that words like equality, freedom and independence \u200bprovided.\n\n'A truth that can't be denied'\n\nQ: Why do we need a hopeful vision? Shouldn't we just be scared enough about the threat to \"survival\" that was mentioned?\n\nSome people say that Martin Luther King didn't say, 'I have a nightmare.' He said, 'I have a dream.' - Graham Saul, Nature Canada\n\nA: I would like to think so, [but] some people say that Martin Luther King didn't say, \"I have a nightmare.\" He said, \"I have a dream.\" But in fact, he said both. He spent a lot of time talking about the evils and horrors of segregation, but then also positing a hopeful vision. These kinds of words \u2026 they provide something that you are for or against \u2026 and most importantly I think they help ground our work in values. They provide \u2026 an appeal to human goodness, and in that sense they end up providing a truth that can't be denied.\n\nQ: Where does the hope need to start from?\n\nA: When you add it all up, humanity is essentially destroying the life support systems of the planet right now.... If you've got a common problem of that magnitude, you also have a common solution. We need to come together and be a life-affirming force in the world.\u2026 That's actually a pretty hopeful message when you think about the opportunity to be part of a generation that actually begins to move things in the other direction, and actually begins to restore and heal rather than undermine and destroy.\n\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for length and clarity."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Business group calls for back-to-work legislation to end Canada Post strike", "description": "A group that represents small and medium-sized Canadian businesses is calling on the federal government to pass back-to-work legislation to end the Canada Post strike, arguing that two-thirds of their members have been hurt by the ongoing dispute.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-post-strike-trudeau-1.4913042", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4865675.1539727886!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/canada-post-talks-20180924.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:50:23Z", "content": "A group that represents small and medium-sized Canadian businesses is calling on the federal government to pass back-to-work legislation to end the Canada Post strike, arguing that two-thirds of their members have been hurt by the dispute.

Two-thirds of CFIB members say they plan on using the mail service less in the future because of the pain the disruption has caused them, CFIB president Dan Kelly said.\n\nCanada Post says there are currently more than 500 truckloads full of undelivered packages sitting idle at various facilities across the country. Many of the items in there originated from small retailers, and Kelly said the lost orders, late payments and the need to shift to more expensive shipping alternatives have already cost the typical member about $3,000.\n\n\"The rotating strikes have gone on long enough,\" he said.\n\nThat's why the group calling on government to pass back to work legislation by week's end, if the two sides can't reach a deal.\n\nThey may have a sympathetic ear in Ottawa to that request.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ottawa on Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested that \"all options are on the table\" in dealing with the impasse. \"Of course, I'm very preoccupied of the fact that Christmas is coming \u2026 important shopping days are coming, and we need to see a resolution to that.\"\n\nA day earlier, Labour Minister Patty Hajdu was even more circumspect, when asked about the prospect of the government stepping in.\n\n\"We've encouraged [both sides] to work together, we've appointed special mediators,\" she said. \"They are not open to voluntary arbitration, so we're reviewing the evidence right now and we'll have more to say in the days to come.\"\n\nSuch a move would not be without precedent.

Constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns were killed in the shootings, and a number of their colleagues have taken leave.\n\nThe additional police spending will cost the city $2.1 million over the next two years.\n\nThe second is the impact WorkSafeNB premiums will have on the city's payroll costs.

(CBC)\n\nThe options that were presented to council were to raise taxes by two per cent, with the possibility of one per cent being temporary just to address the police budget, or cut and defer $3.1 million in capital projects.\n\nNeither of those proposals was met with enthusiasm by council, with the raising of taxes being the option suggested by staff.\n\n\"That sucked the air out of the room,\" Mayor Mike O'Brien said after the recommendation was delivered.\n\nThe city estimates the tax increase would mean that the average household would pay an additional $66 in taxes per year, a raise that the mayor called \"affordable.\"\n\n\"Especially [since] the municipal rate hasn't increased for 13 years basically,\" said O'Brien.\n\nAccording to the city, since 2005 council has only increased taxes once, in 2010, and taxes were lowered in 2011.\n\nSkate park at risk?\n\nThe city's proposed skate park would cost $1.5 million, almost half the city's $3.1 million budget shortfall.

He joined the Rangers on a $96 million, six-year free-agent deal in 2011, and appeared in his only World Series in his first season with Texas.\n\n\"The thing for me that stood out that I was unaware of ... was how much he fun he had,\" Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. \"He's obviously got an intense demeanour and it probably takes a little while for everybody to kind of get comfortable with him because he's an intimidating guy, just because he's so regimented and serious.\"\n\nBeltre often checked his own swing to umpires and hated being touched on the head, which teammates often exploited. There were the shuffling feet and swiveling legs in the batter's box on inside pitches or those in the dirt.\n\nThere were those times when Beltre and Andrus would be only a few feet apart on the left side of the infield, both with their gloves in the air, one mimicking the other catching a popup. There was a pitching change at Seattle in 2013 when Beltre threw his glove at a fleeing Andrus after being popped on the head with a glove by the shortstop.\n\nAn ode to Tommy\n\nIn his statement, Beltre thanked former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda, then the team's interim general manager, for \"believing in this young kid from the Dominican Republic when others thought I was too young to be called up\" to the majors. Beltre was only 15 when he first signed with the Dodgers as an amateur free agent in July 1994.\n\nBeltre hit a Texas-high .273 with 15 homers and 65 RBIs in 119 games this season, when he went on the disabled list twice because of a strained left hamstring. He was limited in 2017 to 94 games, his fewest since 77 as a rookie, because of calf and hamstring issues.\n\nHe got his 3,000th career hit on July 30, 2017, the 31st major leaguer to reach that milestone.\n\n\"To all my fans in the Dominican Republic, the United States and Latin America, my sincerest THANK YOU for your continuous support throughout my career,\" Beltre wrote. \"While I will forever cherish the memories from my time playing the greatest game on earth, I am excited to become a full-time husband and father, and I am ready to take on the next chapter of my life.\"\n\nMichael Young, now a special assistant to the general manager, was the Rangers third baseman before Beltre joined the team. Young then became a utility infielder and designated hitter and is still the career leader for games played and hits by a Rangers player.\n\n\"I knew he was good defensively, I didn't know he was this good. I knew he could hit, I didn't know he could hit like that. I knew he was tough, I didn't know he was that tough,\" Young said Tuesday. \"I could just pretty much go on, all of the things I knew about him, he was just better in pretty much in every possible way I could have imagined.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Ray Paruch, longtime CBRM councillor, on medical leave for cancer treatment", "description": "Ray Paruch, 70, was first elected to CBRM council in 1995 and has served ever since.

More than a third of the missions the auditors checked had out-of-date assessments, including many in high- and critical-threat areas.\n\nAt four missions, the AG found no threat assessments at all.\n\nFerguson notes Global Affairs Canada did approve a plan in April, after much of his work was done, to hire more people to update these assessments.\n\nUpgrades behind schedule\n\nResponding to the findings, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland laid the blame for these security gaps on the Harper government.\n\n\"For over a decade, the previous Conservative government failed to make sufficient investments in security upgrades at our embassies and did not commit to mandatory security training for our diplomats,\" she said.\n\nBut in his report, Ferguson notes the department did receive $652 million over the past decade to improve safety and security at foreign missions. Many of the 78 construction projects that were initiated to upgrade security were at least three years behind.\n\nMeanwhile, a quarter of the funding approved for these projects \u2014 $103 million \u2014 had not been spent, which resulted in the department's having to get special permission to hold onto $82 million of it rather than returning it to the national treasury.\n\nFunding decisions for major upgrades were based on insufficient information and also hadn't involved the department's head of security for two years. Toward the end of the audit work in July, the department security officer was added to the committee that approves capital projects.\n\nAlarm bells over security at Canada's foreign missions have been sounded for several years. A briefing note prepared in late 2015 for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's newly elected government said the cost of keeping Canadian diplomats safe was rising faster than the government had predicted. The memo said Canadian diplomats face \"evolving risks at a time when security resources are diminishing.\"\n\nThen-foreign affairs minister Stephane Dion said protecting Canada's diplomats was his top priority.\n\nFreeland said the government continues to view this as a priority and notes her department did promise in 2017 to spend $1.8 billion more over 10 years to bolster security at diplomatic compounds.\n\n\"This is a complicated job that has to be done in difficult places around the world, we are very committed to getting it done, we have devoted the money, we are devoting the resources and we will do it,\" she said.\n\nIn many areas he examined, Ferguson found problems had been flagged years ago, including with recommendations for solving them that just weren't followed."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Man fatally shoots hunting partner after mistaking him for deer, RCMP say", "description": "A 60-year-old Debert, N.S., man is dead after police say he was shot in a tragic hunting accident Monday about an hour north of Halifax.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/debert-man-dead-after-tragic-hunting-accident-say-rcm-1.4912907", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3309355.1490715754!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rcmp-cruiser.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:32:36Z", "content": "A 60-year-old Debert, N.S., man is dead after police say he was shot in a tragic hunting accident Monday about an hour north of Halifax.

(Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\n\"National Defence's analysis showed that buying the Super Hornet alone would not allow the department to meet the new operational requirement,\" said the audit.\n\n\"The department stated that the Super Hornet would initially decrease, not increase, the daily number of aircraft available because technicians and pilots would have to be pulled away from the CF-18s to train on the new aircraft.\"\n\nThe proposal to buy Super Hornets was scrapped last spring after the manufacturer, Chicago-based Boeing, angered the Trudeau government in a separate trade dispute involving the sale of Bombardier passenger jets.\n\nThe Opposition Conservatives have long claimed the 'capability gap' was concocted by the Liberals as a way to push off a decision on a permanent replacement for the CF-18s. In the last election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged not to buy the F-35 stealth fighter, the preferred option of the Harper government.\n\nSparring in the House\n\nThe report led to sparring in the House of Commons, with the Conservatives seeing the auditor general's assessment as vindication.\n\n\"Today's report confirms what we have been saying all along,\" said James Bezan, the defence critic.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau deliberately misled Canadians by manufacturing a 'capability gap' to fulfil a misguided campaign promise, and in the process has put the safety and security of Canadians at risk.\"\n\nSajjan, however, believed the report supported the government's position.\n\n\"The report confirms what we have always known: The Harper Conservatives mismanaged the fighter jet files and misled Canadians for over a decade,\" he said.\n\n\"The report confirms a capability gap exists, and started under the Conservatives.\"\n\nIn fact, what the report said was that \"Canada's fighter force could not meet the government's new operational requirement.\" It contained objective analysis of how many aircraft would be required to meet various contingencies.\n\nFleet 'will become more vulnerable'\n\nMeanwhile, the auditor is warning that the Liberal government has no plan to upgrade the combat capabilities of the CF-18s to keep them current over the next decade while the air force waits for replacements.\n\nThe last major refurbishment of the war-fighting equipment on the jets happened in 2008, and Department of National Defence planners have done little since because they had been expecting new planes by 2020.\n\n\"National Defence did not have a plan to upgrade the combat capability of the CF-18 even though it will now have to fly until 2032,\" said the audit.\n\n\"Without these upgrades, according to the department, the CF-18 will become more vulnerable as advanced combat aircraft and air defence systems continue to be developed and used by other nations.\"\n\nThe fact that the CF-18s are not up to date means they will not be able to operate in certain environments where the risk of surface-to-air missiles or advanced enemy planes is great.\n\nThat, in turn, \"would limit Canada's contribution to NORAD and NATO operations,\" Ferguson said.\n\nSajjan said the department is looking at an upgrade to the combat systems.\n\n\"We would love to be able to solve this problem immediately,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "With no budget for rural internet, nobody's made a plan, auditor general says", "description": "Canada's auditor general says people who live in rural and remote parts of the country don't have high-speed internet access because the federal government doesn't want to pay for a plan to give it to them.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/auditor-general-rural-remote-internet-1.4912895", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3254623.1443810131!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/telus-vancouver-investment.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:01:58Z", "content": "Canada's auditor general says people who live in rural and remote parts of the country don't have high-speed internet access because the federal government doesn't want to pay for a plan to give it to them.

Jonathan Vance, intended to stamp out harassment and assault.\n\nThe report credits National Defence for putting in place a variety of systems and services, but identified a number of \"gaps\" and noted the initiatives \"were not well co-ordinated\" and not designed with victim support in mind.\n\nSignificantly, the report, tabled Tuesday in Parliament, said the response to complaints of inappropriate sexual behaviour was still left wanting three years after the Operation Honour program was launched.\n\n\"We found that the Canadian Armed Forces did not always resolve reported cases of inappropriate sexual behaviour in a timely, consistent, and respectful manner,\" said the audit.\n\n\"As a result, some victims did not report or they withdrew their complaints, and they had less confidence that the investigations would produce any tangible results.\"\n\nThe audit found it took military police, in many instances, seven months to investigate cases \u2014 far longer than the 30-day service standard.\n\nIn July 2018, the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal changed the policy to eliminate the 30-day requirement\n\nAG reviewed 46 military police files\n\n\"The updated policy stated that investigations must be conducted as quickly and efficiently as possible, with regard to both complexity and severity,\" the audit noted.\n\n\"It also required a written explanation in the file if there had been no meaningful investigative activity for 30 days.\"\n\nDefence Minister Harjit Sajjan said his department accepts all of the auditor's recommendations and has been learning as it attempts to set up a more responsive system.\n\n\"We will look at any avenue to improve things,\" he said.\n\n\"I wish, when a problem identifies itself so significantly as [this] did, that we could fix it immediately, but unfortunately in this case we did not have all of the right answers. This was going to take time for us to get an understanding.\"\n\nThe auditor reviewed 46 military police files and 29 military career administration files and looked at the impact on victims who had either come forward or had incidents reported for them by a third party.\n\n\"In 21 of the 53 cases, the file showed that the victim experienced fear, distress, discomfort, a lack of support, reprisal, or blame, including from the victim's commanding officer, senior leaders, instructors, and colleagues,\" said the audit.\n\n\"In addition to the psychological trauma, such outcomes can only reduce victims' confidence in the system and contribute to the belief that there are negative consequences for those who report inappropriate sexual behaviour.\"\n\nIn four of the instances, the cases were reported by the commanding officer of an individual even though that person did not want to make a complaint.\n\nUnder legislation, members of the military have what is known as \"the duty to report\" and face sanctions if they do not speak up about misconduct the moment they become aware of it.\n\nThat, the auditor said, has meant unintended consequences.\n\n\"Victims were therefore required to report inappropriate sexual behaviour whether or not they wanted to or were ready,\" the report said.\n\n\"This discouraged some victims from disclosing, for fear of being forced into a formal complaint process, which contributed to underreporting.\"\n\nThe report went to say that some victims did not wish to pursue criminal charges and only wanted the inappropriate behaviour to stop.\n\n\"Subject matter experts argue that victims must decide whether and when to report,\" said the audit. \"If they are forced to report when they are not ready, it can cause further harm and discourage reporting.\"\n\nLack of support\n\nThe auditor also called into question the definition of inappropriate sexual behaviour, saying some members found it \"too broad\" and that has led to differences in how cases are reported.\n\nIn interviews with auditor general, staff members \"told us it had created an environment of fear and frustration and reduced camaraderie.\"\n\nOverall, many soldiers, sailors and aircrew were less comfortable and confident working with one another.\n\n\"Some were afraid of even basic social interaction, for fear of being accused of inappropriate behaviour,\" the audit said.\n\n\"Other members [particularly females] told us that they felt isolated because of their peers' fears about interacting with them. \"\n\nFerguson also complained about the lack of availability of support services and recommended National Defence establish an integrated national approach to victims support \u2014 something the department has agreed to do.\n\nThe auditor found that investigators with the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service's Sexual Offence Response Team and counsellors in the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre had specialized training.\n\n\n\nHowever, that instruction was rarely given to others involved in providing support services, such as physicians, nurses, and chaplains."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Nick Boisvert", "title": "Why researchers believe a radical new brain therapy could 'change medicine forever'", "description": "It's a procedure that's already been used to treat Alzheimer's, tremors and depression, but researchers believe a radical new form of brain therapy may have only scratched the surface of its full potential.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/focused-ultrasound-synposium-1.4912703", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4912728.1542723142!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/focused-ultrasound.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:33:52Z", "content": "It's a procedure that's already been used to treat Alzheimer's, tremors and depression, but researchers believe a radical new form of brain therapy may have only scratched the surface of its full potential.

The waves can be used to target and destroy the cells responsible for debilitating conditions and diseases, and they can also open up temporary pathways which medications can penetrate.\n\nThis Tuesday, the field's leading experts will gather for a two-day symposium hosted by Sunnybrook Hospital and the Canada Gairdner Foundation to explore a technology that, according to organizers, \"could change medicine forever.\"\n\nThe symposium opens at 2 p.m. with a introduction by actor Alan Alda, who revealed his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease in July. Other speakers will include researchers and doctors from around the world, and the theoretical physicist Brian Greene.\n\nHow it works\n\nEarlier this spring, Sunnybrook patient Linda Bohnen became the first person in North America to receive a focused ultrasound procedure for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.\n\nBohnen, who has been suffering from depression for more than 30 years, had tried a variety of medications and talk therapy, but none of the treatments produced lasting improvements without major side effects.\n\nWhen doctors proposed focused ultrasound as a new tactic, she signed on without hesitation.\n\n\"It seemed like a genius idea,\" Bohnen told CBC Toronto.\n\nIn May, Linda Bohnen became the first person in North America to receive a focused ultrasound treatment for major depression. (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre)\n\nOn the day of the procedure, Bohnen was fitted with a helmet-like device, sedated and put inside an MRI machine. Over the next four to five hours, the helmet was used to zap a specific group of neurons in her brain that have been linked to depression.\n\nIn the past, doctors would have had to open her brain and use scalpels to destroy those neurons.\n\n\"There are these kind of calluses on my brain that I'll have forever, and that will prevent the depression circuits from working,\" she explained.\n\nAfter about a week of headaches subsided, Bohnen said the change was unlike anything she'd experienced before.\n\n\"Since then, there's been a slow but steady improvement,\" she said, explaining that she now thinks more clearly than she has for decades.\n\nWhat's next\n\nWhile Bohnen's operation appears to have been a remarkable success, doctors and researchers say there are many more applications for focused ultrasound that have yet to be explored.\n\nDr. Nir Lipsman, who leads Sunnybrook's clinical research team, says the procedure is in its infancy, likening the current state of the technology to the brick cell phone era of the 1990s.\n\nThe next, smartphone-like breakthrough, he says, will be the use of low frequency waves that can open up pathways rather than destroy neurons.\n\nDr. Nir Lipsman \u2014 right, wearing scrubs \u2014 says the procedure works 'less invasively and as effectively' as traditional surgery. (Kevin Van Paassen/Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre)\n\n\"That's where a lot of the excitement is and certainly that will be a big part of what will be discussed at the symposium,\" he said.\n\nThat procedure can be used to open up temporary holes in the blood-brain barrier, the hard-to-penetrate border that protects the brain from germs and substances in the bloodstream.\n\nDoctors can then use the temporary openings to target tumours with chemotherapy treatments, or use antibodies to combat other problems inside the brain.\n\nOver the coming years, Lipsman says advancements in both low and high frequency focused ultrasound will open up new possibilities in non-invasive brain surgery.\n\nThe ultimate goal, he says, is \"a safe, effective treatment for some of humanity's most troublesome and challenging disorders.\"\n\nThe symposium runs from Nov. 20 to 21 at the TELUS Centre's Koerner Hall.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "15-year-old arrested after Fall River knife attack", "description": "Halifax RCMP were called to a wooded area on Lockview Road shortly after noon on Monday.

The second half was an extended thriller featuring 59 combined points.\n\nBoth teams scratched out fourth-quarter leads, only to see them evaporate.

This is what you love so much about the game.\"\n\nAnd this game was ultimately decided by defence: Marcus Peters and Lamarcus Joyner came up with late interceptions as the Rams stopped Mahomes' final efforts.\n\n\"It's always fun to play against real good teams,\" Mahomes said. \"You get to go out there and have fun ... (but) it's the same as when we played New England. You can't make mistakes against great teams. You need to limit your mistakes, but be aggressive.\"\n\nThe Coliseum's first Monday night game since 1985 was staged on short notice after the NFL moved the matchup from Mexico City to Los Angeles six days ago due to poor field conditions at Azteca Stadium. The Rams used the opportunity to give free tickets to thousands of first responders and families recovering from the dual tragedies of nearby wildfires and a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks.\n\nSuper Bowl preview?\n\nThose fans got an incredible treat for their reward \u2014 and if the video-game-like spectacle they saw turns out to be a Super Bowl preview, Atlanta will get an All-Madden-level show as well.\n\n\"It was just cool,\" said Todd Gurley, whose 13-game touchdown streak somehow ended in this offensive showcase. \"It was a last-minute game and everybody (came) out in support.

During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family's senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nNo automatic succession\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead, the kingdom's tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honour existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nSaudi Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, is King Salman's only surviving full brother.

A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \"nothing else to add at this time.\"\n\nThe Saudi sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defence ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defence ministry \"focus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\" and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defence ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nU.S. role key\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment.\n\nSaudi Arabia's public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed's rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nPeople attend a symbolic funeral prayer for Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the courtyard of Fatih mosque in Istanbul on Nov. 16. (Huseyin Aldemir/Reuters)\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi's security and intelligence agencies.\n\nHe first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSome 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500-million yacht and the purchase of a painting by Leonardo Da Vinci that set a new record in the international art market.\n\nThe entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \"would not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\" because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\"They [the security apparatus] will follow any consensus reached by the family.\"\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhite House ties\n\nThe United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to \"roll some heads to appease the U.S.\"\n\nBut Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi's death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role \u2014 including one of MbS's closest aides.\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 82, made a speech in Riyadh Monday in which he seemed to stand by his son, and made no direct reference to Khashoggi's killing except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor. (Bandar Algaloud/Saudi Royal Court via Reuters)\n\nU.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.\n\nKing Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets.\n\nThose who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.\n\nAllegiance Council\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman's wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.\n\nDespite the controversy over Khashoggi's killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.\n\nSome insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site \u2014 thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion \u2014 as a gilded cage for his retirement.\n\nThe site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 kilometres away.

That's up 3.4 per cent from last year, which outpaced the growth of spending on both hospitals and doctors.\n\nHunt said CIHI is keeping an eye on drug spending and shifts to more expensive medications.\n\n\"The impact of using generics may be less as we go forward as there's fewer and fewer generics available for some of the more complex drugs that are challenging to produce and administer to patients,\" he said.\n\n\"The whole category of spending has potential to continue to consume a larger part of overall expenditures.\"\n\nGreying population\n\nHunt said another thing Alberta will need to monitor in coming years is as the average age of the population increases, spending could go up.\n\nAcross the country, an average of $1,539 per person is spent on children aged one to 14, while the average is $11,301 for those over 65.\n\nPeople over 65 made up 16 per cent of the population in 2016, up from 13 per cent in 2006, Hunt said.\n\n\"If you break it down and really go into detail, if you're over 80 years of age we're probably spending $20,000 a year or more on those individuals as they age,\" said Hunt.\n\n\"Population change within individual jurisdictions will affect spending, there's no question.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Experimental Lakes area launches artist-in-residence program", "description": "A famous scientific research area in northwestern Ontario is getting in touch with its artistic side.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/ela-artist-in-residence-1.4905959", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4905974.1542232583!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/experimental-lakes.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:00:00Z", "content": "A freshwater laboratory in northwestern Ontario that's been the site of groundbreaking scientific research, is now hoping to inspire artists as well.

(James Culleton)\n\nThe idea was tested with a pilot project this fall, Bath explained, when a visual artist from Winnipeg was invited to visit the site.\n\nWhile there, James Culleton produced a series of sketches that included everything from landscapes and fish, to lab equipment and portraits of researchers.\n\n\"He put together some beautiful sketches, and we thought, 'you know what?'

The plan is to select four or five artists for the first full run of the program, which will take place from May to Oct. in 2019.\n\nArtists will be brought to the ELA for at least a week each, Bath explained, with travel covered from Winnipeg or Kenora.\n\nThe ELA is also committed to helping the artist's promote the work they create, he added, which could mean hosting an exhibition at some point.\n\n\"I mean what would be really exciting for us is if a bunch of people who are quite interested in the arts ...

(Christmas For Churchill/GoFundMe)\n\nIt all started with polar bears for Skylar Ferguson \u2014 but it led to a massive show of support for a northern Manitoba town cut off from the rest of the province last winter.\n\nThe 17-year-old student at Winnipeg's Oak Park High School, a self-described lifelong \"polar bear fanatic,\" launched a fundraising, toy and food drive called Christmas for Churchill last year.\n\nThe inspiration came from stories she heard while doing research for an international science fair project on Churchill, famous for its polar bears. While talking to Mayor Mike Spence, she found out how profoundly the loss of the washed-out railway link to the town was affecting residents ahead of Christmas last year.\n\n\"It broke my heart. It touched me so much,\" she said of hearing about the financial hardships and job losses faced by people in the town.\n\n\"Families weren't able to support themselves, and were having to move away from their home where they created all these memories. And that was absolutely terrible.\"\n\nTo help, she launched a drive that in just six weeks collected nearly two tonnes of food, more than 300 toys, and $5,000 worth of gift cards to buy fresh food at a local market for Churchill residents.\n\nIt also gave Ferguson a chance to travel to the town, about 1,000 kilometres north of her home in Winnipeg \u2014 a place she had never visited before.\n\nYes, having the rail line helps with financial issues, but a huge problem in the northern areas is mental health, and that's where I really want to focus my work. - Skylar Ferguson\n\nGetting to finally meet the residents \u2014 especially an emotional meeting with kids at the town's Duke of Marlborough School just before Christmas last year \u2014 \"was the most amazing experience,\" she said.\n\n\"When I was organizing all the presents and the food, I was working off a list based on genders and ages.

In the seven other cities the team compared, annual operating subsidies cover more than half of each transit system's operating budget.\n\nIn Boston, it's more than 70 per cent, while in Los Angeles, it's nearly 90 per cent. Toronto's operating subsidy, in comparison, is just 30 per cent.\n\n\"When compared with other cities, Toronto has the least to spend, per rider,\" the report continues. \"Toronto has $2.10 per rider, less than half Vancouver's level, even though the TTC carries more than twice the riders.\"\n\nAs the TTC shifts to full Presto card usage \u2014 the highly-criticized fare system from provincial agency Metrolinx \u2014 for non-cash fares, it's also becoming the only comparable city with a fare card \"fully controlled\" by another level of government, the authors note.\n\nAlongside ongoing payment issues with card readers, \"not being able to really have any control over Presto is a big challenge for the TTC, and it adds to the unpredictability of its budget every year,\" MacLeod said.\n\n\"If the TTC can't trust its own budget, and can't trust its political master, it can't implement some of the things it would like to have.\"\n\nThe TTC relies on fare revenue more than any other city in North America, the report notes. And when compared with other cities, Toronto has the least to spend per rider.\n\n'Every election, everything is up in the air'\n\nSo what needs to change, according to the authors?\n\nThe report recommends developing a governance structure that's city-centred but collaborates with other regions. The municipalities surrounding Vancouver and Montreal both have mayor's councils which can discuss transit from a regional approach, MacLeod notes.\n\nToronto also needs to take cues from other cities and find new, sustainable revenue sources, the authors argue.\n\n\"The TTC doesn't have any dedicated revenue sources,\" MacLeod said. \"Everything is subject to ongoing city council arguments, and every election, everything is up in the air again.\"\n\nEarlier research from other groups and advisory panels have shown that revenue could come from sales-tax revenue, levies, or other readily-available funding sources, he added.\n\nThe province is taking a different approach with its proposed TTC subway upload.\n\nIn last week's fall economic statement, Finance Minister Vic Fedeli reaffirmed a plan to take over the subway infrastructure to \"fund and deliver transit projects sooner, and support an integrated regional network,\" noting the August appointment of a special adviser to determine the best approach.\n\nAs the TTC shifts to full Presto card usage \u2014 the highly-criticized fare system from provincial agency Metrolinx \u2014 for non-cash fares, it's also becoming the only comparable city with a fare card \"fully controlled\" by another level of government, the report authors note.

It also eliminates the existing requirement that development plans from the agency must consider all forms of transportation, and gives the minister of transportation more control over its governance.\n\nThe Toronto Region Board of Trade wants to take things one step further, arguing the ideal approach is a large-scale organization that would absorb both Metrolinx and the municipal transit agencies across the region \u2014 one they've dubbed \"Superlinx.\"\n\n\"In Toronto, and in the Toronto region, we've got a very Balkanized transit model,\" said Brian Kelcey, the board's vice president of public affairs. \"It's very unstable.\"\n\nWhile the TTC and other organizations could still operate local transit options like bus service day-to-day, Kelcey said the province is simply better-equipped to deal with large-scale transit costs and expansion than municipalities \u2014 in large part because it's already holding the purse-strings.\n\nCameron MacLeod, executive director for CodeRedTO, says the TTC doesn't have any dedicated revenue sources and everything 'is subject to ongoing city council arguments, and every election, everything is up in the air again.'

Both have grave concerns for seabird populations after a recent oil spill. (CBC, York University)\n\nThe SeaRose suffered a spill while restarting production after an intense storm on Thursday, as eight-metre waves crashed into the ship.\n\nAccording to an emailed statement from Husky sent Tuesday, the were no oil sheens observed on the water by aerial surveys conducted Monday, but 11 oiled seabirds were reported at the end of the day. Three of the those birds were captured and taken to a rehabilitation centre in St. John's, the release said.\n\nThe company said subsea surveys of the SeaRose showed the spill came from a separated weak link between the SeaRose FPSO and a drilling centre in the South White Rose extension.\n\nThe area affected \u2014 about 350 kilometres off St. John's \u2014 is home to murres and dovekies this time of year as they make their way out to sea for the winter.\n\nFraser said they pack the area in high density and live right on the surface, making them vulnerable to any amount of pollution.\n\nOperations on the SeaRose remain on hold.\n\nDistrust in the amount of oil lost\n\nBoth Fraser and Montevecchi recalled the 2004 oil spill on the Terra Nova floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO).\n\nInitial reports by its owner, Suncor, said there had been 40,000 litres lost into the ocean. A few days later, it was updated to 170,000 litres.\n\nAs a result, Montevecchi is skeptical of the number placed on this spill \u2014 250 cubic metres, or 250,000 litres.\n\n\"It's really important to realize that that's an estimate from the oil company \u2014 the company that's liable for spills in the ocean, and they are giving us the estimate,\" he said. \"I don't trust that's in fact the amount of oil spilled.\"\n\nWhat does it do to fish? I don't know. I don't think any of us know. - Bill Montevecchi\n\nIn 2004, seabird biologists tried to figure out how many birds were killed. The estimate for mortality was about 10,000 seabirds. Montevecchi, though, says the number may have been as high as 100,000 seabirds.\n\nWith the sea conditions in the area being rough, Montevecchi has low hopes for those surveying the damage to marine life this week.\n\n\"I don't know that we'll ever know. We're not going to see those birds and that even begs the question of what does it do to plankton? What does it do to fish? I don't know. I don't think any of us know. We just know the oil shouldn't be there.\"\n\nFisheries union boss weighs in\n\nKeith Sullivan is also left wondering what this means for the fish.\n\nAs the president of the fisheries union in the province, he's worried about what this spill could mean for the men and women who make a living fishing off the Grand Banks.\n\nFFAW president Keith Sullivan is concerned for the livelihoods of fish harvesters near the site of an oil spill off Newfoundland. (CBC)\n\n\"We know what the North Atlantic is like to operate in, so all precautions should be taken, particularly when there's a storm. So that's obvious,\" he said.\n\n\"The other thing is that this can't be cleaned up. We know if there's a storm in these conditions ... that's going to be dispersed. That's going to have an impact.\"\n\nSullivan was angered to see Husky Energy involved in another controversy in the province's offshore industry, after they were sanctioned earlier this year for failing to stop production while an iceberg came bearing down on them.\n\nInvestigation into Husky's decision to restart in stormy weather\n\nThe decision to halt production during Thursday's storm was made by each of the oil rigs independently. It is also their responsibility to decide when to start production again \u2014 without needing approval from the offshore regulator, the C-NLOPB's chair and CEO Paul Tessier told CBC News on Monday.\n\nWhile the SeaRose decided to restart on Friday, all other production platforms stood down and remained shut in.\n\nAn investigation by the C-NLOPB will determine if Husky Energy followed its approved safety plan in trying to restart production and why the company decided to restart in bad weather and rough seas, he said.\n\nThe FPSO SeaRose has been involved in two recent controversial incidents in Newfoundland's offshore oil industry.\n\nWaves at the time topped 8.4 metres \u2014 nearly 28 feet. A northwesterly wind cut across the ship at more than 80 kilometres per hour.\n\nFraser doesn't believe that decision should have ever been Husky's to make on its own.\n\n\"Part of the problem is that it's a daily expenditure to have this rig being operated and not pumping oil,\" she said.\n\n\"So I would say it was an unfortunate decision that I wouldn't have agreed with. And I would hope that the regulator going forward could have some rules about conditions where start-ups shouldn't happen.\"\n\nNDP seeks third-party regulator\n\nGerry Rogers, leader of the NDP, agrees. Her party issued a statement Monday calling for an independent offshore regulator.\n\nRogers says the spill and the confusion around it \u2014 the lack of clarity over who tells operators to stop and restart in extreme weather conditions, the questions about why Husky would attempt a restart in extreme weather when the other operators stood down \u2014 indicate a dire need for a third-party regulator for the province's offshore oil industry.\n\n\"Let's do the best that we can to prevent these kinds of situation and to have standards and regulations and enforcements,\" she told the St. John's Morning Show on Tuesday.\n\n\"And to ensure there is adherence to strong regulations.\"\n\nA report by Commissioner Robert Wells, written after an investigation into offshore safety following 2009's Cougar helicopter crash, recommended the establishment of an independent agency to regulate offshore safety, Rogers said.\n\nIt's a recommendation that has largely been dismissed by the province, she said.\n\n\"It's simply time to do this,\" Rogers said.\n\nWe can't afford not to.\"\n\nWith files from Chris O'Neill-Yates, Jane Adey and Ted Blades\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Julie Ireton", "title": "OCDSB facing $25M in lawsuits over sex abuse at Bell High School", "description": "Victims and alleged victims of three former teachers accused of sexually abusing students at Ottawa's Bell High School are suing the city's biggest school board for a combined sum of more than $25 million, CBC news has learned.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ocdsb-25-m-lawsuits-sexual-abuse-schools-1.4911778", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3956149.1537994356!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ocdsb-ottawa-carleton-district-school-board-logo.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:00:00Z", "content": "Victims and alleged victims of three former teachers accused of sexually abusing students at Ottawa's Bell High School are suing the city's biggest school board for a combined sum of more than $25 million, CBC news has learned.

After everyone at the party got high on cocaine, they told us, one boy was made to \"engage orally\" with someone's faeces.\n\nTo this day, I have no idea if that actually happened.\n\nBut had you told me prior to last week that a student was allegedly sexually assaulted with a broom handle by members of the junior football team in the school's locker room, I would've been skeptical about that, too.\n\nInsp. Dominic Sinopoli confirmed in a news conference Monday that police became aware of the video of the alleged sexual assault through the media. (Tijana Martin/Canadian Press)\n\nVideo documentation erases that uncertainty. This will likely be what the bombshell New York Times investigation was to the Harvey Weinstein story and what Maclean's investigative reporting was to the reputation of Canada's military: proof in the face of decades of conjecture.\n\nThe secret is out, but only to those who didn't already know.\n\nAccording to principal Greg Reeves, St. Michael's became aware of the video of the alleged sexual assault last Monday, when it was investigating another hazing incident involving the boys' basketball team. Reeves did not report the second incident to police, however, because, he said, the alleged victim had yet to tell his family.\n\nToronto police Insp. Dominic Sinopoli confirmed in a news conference that police became aware of the video through the media two days later.\n\nThe charitable explanation here is that the principal was so sensitive to the implied wishes of the victim that he chose to disregard explicit policy set out by the Ontario College of Teachers: that even suspected abuse should be reported to police.\n\nThe more cynical explanation is that St. Michael's College School sells a reputation as much as it does an education \u2014 and that it's hard to sell a $20,000 tuition to a school under police investigation.\n\nSt. Michael's College School principal Greg Reeves speaks with The National's Adrienne Arsenault. 3:16\n\nThe reality is probably some combination thereof. But the only procedure that should matter is that set out by both professional policy and law, which dictates that an individual who works with children has a duty to report abuse to the relevant authorities.\n\nThere was an opportunity for Reeves to both uphold the law and attempt to safeguard the emotional welfare of the child by calling the police and a social worker.\n\nInstead, he waited, which naturally raises the question of how many past instances of abuse were not disclosed to the relevant authorities. The ongoing tally on newly reported incidents suggests this was not an anomalous oversight.\n\nSome have suggested that this alleged assault at St. Michael's is a reflection of the ever-worsening cruelty exhibited by adults around the world, mimicked by kids. I'm not convinced. Children have been horrible to each other forever; it's only recently that they've started keeping evidence of their horribleness on their phones.\n\nOthers have said it's a good example of why we need lessons on consent in high school curriculums. But it's unclear how consent would have factored into a scenario for which six boys now face charges of gang sexual assault. A failure to ask first was not the problem.\n\nIf anything, the \"lesson\" here is one of empathy, which unfortunately cannot be taught and generally (hopefully) comes with age. That's part of the reason why the duty to report is so important: children might not always recognize or understand abuse, or might be fearful of authority figures, or susceptible to peer pressure or wary of punishment.\n\nDumb, teenage me knew that what was rumoured to have taken place at the St. Michael's party was mean and disgusting. But it never occurred to me that it might be abusive or even criminal. (Granted, I might not have been the most insightful teenager). Had I known, I still can't say with confidence that I would have told an adult \u2014 I wouldn't have wanted to be a wet blanket or risk losing friends.\n\nBesides, everyone thought it was funny. No big deal. It's why we talked about it openly. And probably why kids now record these things on their phones and post them on social media. No big deal.\n\nCriminal charges will probably change that \u2014 but it's a shame it took this long. Had police been called to question students each time an educator overheard basketball players talking about hazing or noticed students huddling around a phone to watch a video or discussing some sort of grotesque ritual at a weekend party, at least a few targeted students might have been spared.\n\nKids are lousy at keeping secrets, both among themselves and from adults. That makes it particularly noxious when adults decide to keep those secrets for them.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

The hearings started in June 2017 and will wrap up next month.

(Catou MacKinnon/CBC)\n\nLast week, in the village of Kuujjuarapik, Viens heard a litany of concerns about the justice system, including confusing bail conditions, mistreatment by police and the lengthy wait for court proceedings.\n\nThough Quebec's bar association issued a scathing report in 2015 which said language barriers are a serious problem, and the provincial ombudsman followed up the next year with another critical report, Atagotaaluk said not much has changed.\n\nCourt proceedings take place in French or English, and while Inuktitut interpreters are available, documents are not translated, and outside the courtroom, there are no interpreters.\n\nAtagotaaluk says that means discussions with defence lawyers and probation officers about issues such as bail conditions all take place in what is the second or third language of many defendants.\n\n\"It's very traumatic. It's very scary to go to court,\" said Martin Scott, a non-Inuk administrator who has worked for more than 15 years with the Tumiapiit Justice Committee in the village of Aupaluk, Nunavik's smallest and northernmost village.\n\nScott says people facing charges \"have no idea what they've signed most of the time.\"\n\nMartin Scott, who has worked with the Tumiapiit Justice Committee in Aupaluk for more than 15 years, said Inuit charged with crimes and flown south for a court appearance sometimes plead guilty just because they want to go home.

Most new fridges are not built as well as in the past, he added, so there is a chance it could become a write-off when it's damaged.\n\n\"The warranty of 10 years means that at seven or eight or 10 years if you've got a problem you can say, 'Hey, I paid the extra money, you should do something for me,' and generally they will,\" he said.\n\nSteve Brannan often gets a call when a fridge goes on the fritz. He says his first piece of advice to customers is to call the manufacturer to see if they'll offer a solution. (Grant Linton/CBC)\n\nJeff Hoogendam, manager of Tasco Appliances' North York location, also thinks a good warranty is worth the extra cost.\n\n\"I don't think that products today are built as well as they used to be and you always want to have coverage, so the longer warranty does give you that protection,\" he said.\n\nTo get the most out of your fridge, and your warranty, they offered these five tips:\n\n1. Make the decision: Cash or more negotiating power\n\n\"I always tell people buy something middle of the line,\" Brannan said, adding the parts in both are mostly the same, but in \"premium\" brands, such as KitchenAid, you get a better looking product and a better warranty.\n\nIf you buy the \"value\" product with a shorter warranty, Brannan said, you can put that money in your pocket, instead.\n\n2. At least a 5-year warranty is worth your while\n\nJeff Hoogendam finds many customers start experiencing problems with their fridge between three-to-five years after purchasing. (Grant Linton/CBC)\n\nHoogendam said it's after the one-year warranty expires many people find themselves in trouble.\n\n\"Usually, three-to-five years you get a lot of complaints,\" he said.\n\nIf you need an extended warranty to get to the five years, Brannan recommends you try to negotiate it into the product price.\n\n3. Do your research\n\nIn anticipation of future problems, Brannan would also tell a potential customer to call the manufacturer to see how long it would take for them to send a technician. If it's too long, he said you may want to consider just paying someone to fix it on your own.\n\nHoogendam also recommends making sure your fridge's warranty covers all the major components.\n\n4. If something goes wrong, call manufacturer even if warranty is expired\n\n\"I think the manufacturer wants a good reputation. They want people to like them,\" Brannan said. \"You're at their mercy, but call them.\"\n\n5. Be persistent\n\nAs in Alimam's case, persistence can yield results.\n\n\"You say, 'Hey, I bought your product specifically because I was told how good it was, and it hasn't lived up to my expectations,'\" Brannan said.\n\n\"'Do something for me, make an exception.'\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Adam Carter", "title": "Meet the Hamilton designers helping to bring the iconic El Mocambo back to life", "description": "A Toronto cultural icon that has hosted the likes of The Rolling Stones and U2 is finally making a comeback \u2014 and a group of designers from Hamilton are on the ground floor.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/el-mocambo-1.4912027", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4902767.1542118924!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/el-mocambo-sign.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:00:00Z", "content": "A Toronto cultural icon that has hosted the likes of The Rolling Stones and U2 is finally making a comeback and a group of designers from Hamilton are on the ground floor.

The review would look back at how well the Federal Tobacco Control Strategy (FTCS) performed between 2001 and 2017.\n\nThe number of Canadian smokers aged 25 and up hit 16 per cent of the population in 2017, up from 13 per cent two years earlier, according to a recent survey by Statistics Canada.\n\nThe FTCS has spearheaded several initiatives meant to convince Canadians to quit, including graphic warnings on cigarette packages, a toll-free 'quitline' offering smokers access to advice and resources to help them kick cigarettes, and ad campaigns directed at young people. The Liberal government has earmarked a further $330 million over five years for the FTCS.\n\n\"The objective of the requirement is to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of the FTCS ... investigating the fiscal benefits that accrue from reductions in smoking prevalence against the cost of implementing such policies,\" the tender reads.\n\n\"This retrospective analysis will be used to update the fiscal success of new initiatives as they are implemented and support ongoing policy decisions regarding the implementation of the best 'value for money' programs in the future.\"\n\nDavid Hammond of the University of Waterloo, one of the nation's foremost experts on tobacco controls, said this proposed historical review should take a backseat to an urgently needed, fundamental \"rethink\" of the current tobacco control program.\n\nHammond said there have been some substantial changes in the nicotine market since the FTCS was launched, with the recent legalization of e-cigarettes and the introduction of more sophisticated vaping devices.\n\nDavid Hammond, a professor at the University of Waterloo and an expert on tobacco control policy, said the Federal Tobacco Control Strategy needs a re-think in a changing nicotine market. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\n\"There's definitely a need for renewal. We have a massively changing market in terms of e-cigarettes and despite it all we still have 5 million Canadians who continue to smoke,\" he said.\n\n\"Do we need a new strategy? Yes. We need one quickly. In terms of contracting out \u2014 to figure out how the last one did \u2014 evaluation, reflection is important but we have some new challenges and I'd rather us look forward than backwards.\n\n\"There's not too many areas in tobacco control or public health where we have extra resources laying around ... I don't think we can stand around looking over our shoulder for too long because this market is moving so quickly.\"\n\nHealth Canada defended the proposed external review in a statement to CBC News, saying it's standard for any federal program.\n\n\"The government of Canada is committed to evaluating our programs to ensure that we are delivering value to Canadians,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"This \u200econtract is intended to bring in experts to help us evaluate the value of the previous tobacco strategy, and the benefits it has delivered to Canadians. This is a standard part of regulatory and policy development. The results of this evaluation will inform future strategies and policies.\"\n\nThe strategy, first launched in 2001, has been credited by some experts with helping to substantially reduce the number of traditional cigarette smokers.\n\nThe number of smokers aged 15 and over peaked at nearly 50 per cent of the population in 1966 before dropping to 22 per cent in 2001.\n\nAs of 2017, that figure stood at roughly 15 per cent \u2014 a number unchanged since the last Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey in 2015.\n\n'Have we stalled?'\n\nBut last year saw the uptick in the number of Canadians aged 25 and up smoking cigarettes, while the percentage of Canadians aged 25 or older who reported having used cannabis in 2017 hit 13 per cent, up from 10 per cent in 2015.\n\nThe government aims to drive down the overall smoking rate in Canada to less than five per cent by 2035.\n\n\"Have we stalled? It's possible,\" said Hammond. \"We've seen some troubling signs among youth, and that's a big concern.\n\n\"If we see another year or so of data that ... suggest the declines have stalled or youth smoking is picking up, then we really need to understand this new dynamic market much better.\"\n\nBeyond the plain tobacco packaging regulations the federal government is set to introduce, Hammond said the federal government could pursue more restrictions on where cigarettes can be sold. \"You can still buy cigarettes more places than you can buy milk,\" he said.\n\nHammond also said Ottawa should pursue new regulatory controls over cigarettes themselves.\n\n\"Where we've struggled is on the product side. We're really good at telling people not to smoke. We're pretty good at telling them where not to smoke. We're not great at actually helping them to quit,\" he said.\n\n\"Where we've really dropped the ball is in dealing with the product. We've done nothing to make cigarettes less harmful or addictive.\"\n\nRob Cunningham, senior policy adviser for the Canadian Cancer Society, holds up a proposed standardized cigarette package. The federal government has mandated plain packaging for tobacco firms. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nNew data from the U.S., he said, suggest mortality from smoking is actually higher than it was 50 to 60 years ago, when cigarettes were far more popular in the West.\n\n\"Cigarettes are no less lethal,\" he said. \"It's really gotten out of hand.\"\n\nHe suggested Ottawa could do more to \"incentivize people to get off smoke\" by championing e-cigarettes and vaping products as safer alternatives to traditional cigarettes. \"We have to get off smoke.\"\n\n\"When I see an adult vaping I think, 'Good for you,'\" he said, adding that, unlike younger users, the vast majority of adult e-cigarette smokers are people who have quit smoking cigarettes.\n\nHealth Canada only recently acknowledged that vaping is safer than cigarettes and a viable smoking cessation tool.\n\n\"Except for nicotine, vaping products typically only contain a fraction of the 7,000 chemicals found in tobacco or tobacco smoke, and at lower levels. Switching completely from tobacco cigarettes to vaping products will reduce a person's exposure to many toxic and cancer-causing chemicals,\" a spokesperson with Health Canada said.\n\nBut despite the promise of these devices for former smokers, a spike in usage rates in the U.S. has health experts concerned that young people are picking up a nicotine addiction from vaping devices before turning to traditional cigarettes to get their fix.\n\nWhile numbers are scarce in Canada because the products were only recently made legal, the number of U.S. high school students who say they've used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days is 78 per cent higher this year than last year, according to the latest National Youth Tobacco Survey, a joint study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Drop in city's emissions chalked up to coal plant closures", "description": "Ottawa's greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 11 per cent between 2012 and 2016, but it appears the drop was mostly due to the closure of the province's coal-fired power plants.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ghg-emissions-coal-plants-1.4911291", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3938411.1484606642!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nanticoke-generating-station.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:00:00Z", "content": "Ottawa's greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 11 per cent between 2012 and 2016, but it appears the drop was mostly due to the closure of the province's coal-fired power plants.

That blaze was 94 per cent contained by Monday morning.\n\nMalibu's power supply was cut off on Monday to allow for repairs, the Los Angeles County sheriff's office said.\n\nThe cause of both fires is under investigation, but electric utilities reported localized equipment problems around the time they broke out.\n\nPG&E Corp has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Darren Haynes", "title": "Tkachuk, Gaudreau tie career-highs as Flames ignite to roll past Vegas", "description": "Matthew Tkachuk and Johnny Gaudreau tied career-highs with four-point nights on Monday as the Calgary Flames took over top spot in the Pacific Division with a 7-2 rout of the Vegas Golden Knights.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/calgary-flames-vegas-golden-knights-nhl-nov-19-recap-1.4912167", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4912516.1542689401!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hkn-golden-knights-flames-20181119.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T04:50:15Z", "content": "Matthew Tkachuk and Johnny Gaudreau tied career-highs with four-point nights on Monday as the Calgary Flames took over top spot in the Pacific Division with a 7-2 rout of the Vegas Golden Knights.

(Andy Sawyer/The Associated Press)\n\nThe top selling apples at Calgary Co-op stores are Gala, Ambrosia, Honeycrisp, Granny Smith and Pink Lady.\n\nBedford was especially happy to see Honeycrisp on that list, as his team at the University of Minnesota bred that variety. Now the apple is very popular and sells for a high price, which he chalks up to its sweet taste uniquely married with crispiness.\n\nListen to the full interview about why some apples are a hit:\n\nWe speak to Minnesota apple breeder David Bedford about what makes a great apple, and why the gala is the top selling apple in Calgary. 7:18\n\nApples typically have two textures: hard, dense and crisp, or soft and mealy, \"which nobody likes unless you've got some denture issues or something,\" Bedford said. Honeycrisp changed that thinking, he said.\n\n\"It's crisp, and when you bite it it kind of explodes in your mouth,\" Bedford said. \"It's really a juicy sensation. So once you've had that texture, it's hard to go back.\"\n\nBreeders are now trying to replicate that experience in new varieties, he said.\n\nIn the course of his work, Bedford has developed a palate for apples. Each day, he tastes roughly 500 apples \u2014 and \"as a matter of fact, almost every single day, I get sick of it.\"\n\n\"But the good news is, you go home, you have a little home-cooked meal, sleep it off and come back for more.\"\n\nApples are a major industry in Canada. (Norm Arnold/CBC)\n\nIn terms of taste, apples range between sweet and tart.\n\n\"People are trending toward sweeter varieties but I'm not sure of the reason, just preference,\" said Candy O'Connor, executive director of the Nova Scotia Fruit Growers' Association.\n\nThe Honeycrisp now tops the sales in Nova Scotia, both domestically and in exports, and the variety is in the top five for both British Columbia and Ontario.\n\nThe types of apples offered at your supermarket often depend on what's available. For example, Gala is a top-seller and also widely grown. (Katherine Holland/CBC)\n\nO'Connor has universally sweet varieties on her list, including Gala, specialty varieties SweeTango and Pazazz, and the B.C.-bred fruit, Ambrosia.\n\nAmbrosia was a chance seedling discovered in Cawston, B.C., in the early 1990s, according to the B.C. Fruit Growers' Association. Now it's a consumer favourite and a big seller.\n\nWhat's your favourite apple? Share your thoughts in the comments.\n\nWhile taste often drives demand, so does supply. Gala is one of the top varieties grown, Bedford says, plus it has that popular sweet taste.\n\n\"That's fine, I don't have an argument with its flavour,\" he said. \"My only concern or dislike or distrust of Gala is that that texture tends to get a little mediocre in time.\n\n\"So at some point, you get kind of a semi-soft juicy apple with a nice sweet flavour. I mean, that's, that's nice. I won't call it exciting but it's, it's pleasant.\"\n\nGala, in fact, was responsible for booting Red Delicious off its throne as the top selling apple in the United States.\n\nFor Bedford, he'll keep looking for the most a memorable experience in his 500 daily bites.\n\nFor everyone else, the varieties continue to grow, should you want an apple to snack on.\n\nWith files from Danielle Nerman and the Calgary Eyeopener."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Grey Cup 2018 in Calgary: where to watch the Stampeders face off against the Redblacks", "description": "Where to go to watch the Stamps try to win the Grey Cup Sunday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/where-to-watch-grey-cup-2018-sunday-calgary-1.4912032", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4911014.1542591407!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/stampeders-bombers-west-final-111818-620.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:29:41Z", "content": "Game time with a kickoff around 4 p.m. coincides nicely with happy hour.

If not, she wants recommendations on how to improve the system.\n\n\"The more transparent the process, the better (the) result, the more credibility there is especially for anyone who wants to come forward,\" McPherson said Monday.\n\nThe existence of these investigations came to light after reporters asked Notley about an allegation raised by former caucus member Robyn Luff.\n\nLuff said NDP MLAs were told to stay quiet about sexual misconduct allegations involving opposition members as the NDP \"wasn't completely without fault on the matter.\" Notley denied that was ever said by anyone who reports to her.\n\nTo name or not?\n\nThe government said the investigations into their MLAs were undertaken by Janice Rubin of Rubin Thomlinson in Toronto and Ayla Akgungor of Field Law in Edmonton.\n\nNotley refuses to release the names of the MLAs involved, claiming it could reveal the identities of the complainants. The nature of the complaints have not been disclosed.\n\nBoth investigations concluded the behaviour could be corrected through education. The premier's office said the complaints were not criminal in nature and took place outside the workplace.\n\nMcPherson said she has mixed feelings about revealing the MLAs' names. She said the courts regularly handle sexual assault cases without revealing complainants' identities\n\nBut she said disclosure would depend on the nature of the complaints.\n\n\"Sexual misconduct is a really wide range of behaviours and it would depend on what the behaviour,\" McPherson said.\n\n\"I think it is an opportunity for someone who did commit a sexual misconduct offence to own up to their behaviour and take responsibility publicly.

Complaints about backbench MLAs, their staff or caucus staff are directed to the executive director of caucus.\n\nThe complaint can be resolved informally if the complainant agrees. Formal investigations are called if the informal process doesn't work or if the complainant wants one.\n\nEveryone who is part of an investigation is required to keep it quiet under the policy: \"Failure to keep the matter confidential may result in disciplinary action.\"\n\nInvestigations can also be conducted by the Legislative Assembly Office and the government of Alberta. \"However, those processes will have no bearing on the outcome of the caucus process,\" the policy says"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Man found dead after being asked to leave Edmonton bar", "description": "A young man was found dead Sunday afternoon, two days after he was removed from an Edmonton bar.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/ranch-roadhouse-mohamed-abdi-death-edmonton-bar-1.4912336", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4912340.1542674215!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mohamed-abdi.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:18:19Z", "content": "A young man was found dead Sunday afternoon, two days after he was asked to leave an Edmonton bar.

MacLean spoke to the Calgary Eyeopener's David Gray on Monday about life in the kitchen.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity\n\nQ: What's the premise behind The Final Table?\n\nA: Basically, you're given nine countries you have to cook for \u2014 if you go that far.\n\nEach week, you're judged by the best chefs in the world. Chefs with Michelin stars, chefs from San Pellegrino Top 50 Best lists. It's the highest calibre cooking competition ever released.\n\nQ: There's an awful lot of culinary shows on television right now. How is The Final Table different from the rest?\n\nA: It's all about food. [On] a lot of culinary shows, it's personality driven. I remember watching one show where they had to climb a fire ladder to get the advantage of an ingredient.\n\nThat's what's interesting about this program: it isn't about the optics. You have a dish and you cook it \u2014 and you go. You're never safe unless you're cooking.\n\nQ: Out of the nine countries, which cuisine was the toughest to cook?\n\nA: A lot of South American cuisine is challenging for me because I just have really very little knowledge [of the cuisine from that region].\n\nAnything in the scope of \u2014 Japanese, obviously, Chinese, East Asian, French and North American is easy for me. But anything south of the American border is a challenge.\n\nQ: How did you get into cooking in the first place?\n\nA: I never wanted to be a cook but basically when I was 13, I lied about my age, more or less. North American cliche, right? Single mom, no dad, just helping out [financially] at home.\n\nCooking was one of the few avenues I had at that age to weasel my way into a dishwashing position and it just kind of took off from there.\n\nQ: There must have been a few more twists along the way to go from dishwasher to owning your own restaurant\n\nA: There was a few pretty amazing things that happened.\n\nQ: Like what?\n\nA: I cooked from when I was 13 on until I was about 18, and as soon as I could, I became a server. I saw the lifestyle [and] the tips [that servers earned]. I was going into Mount Royal College for economics and finance and it (cooking) wasn't really agreeing with me.\n\nBut for whatever reason, I kept one foot in the kitchen, whether it was [working at the] Chicago Chop House or going through Murrietta's, so finally I got really serious about it when I met a chef called Ned Bell.\n\nCalgary chef Darren MacLean got his first restaurant job at 13, as a dishwasher to help out financially at home. (Parker PR)\n\nI remember him saying, \"this is my face on the plate, so you guys have to really understand what you're serving.\" It was the first time as a server I was made to taste the food I was serving.\n\nThat was a big thing.\n\nHe asked why I wasn't cooking because I clearly had a passion for the kitchen, and I didn't really have an answer.\n\nFast forward a little bit. I was in a bit of an accident that really propelled me [to take action]. I went to the Stratford Chef School. That was the next step. I did some formative culinary training with [someone] who I think is one of the most talented chefs in the country, Aaron Linley, who had a restaurant called Bijou.\n\nAt the time, [I had] the opportunity to open my own restaurant, Downtown Food, here in Calgary.\n\nQ: Let's stop there. Downtown Food was a fine concept that was well executed, but all it seemed to be missing were people. Is that fair to say?\n\nA: Downtown Food was an interesting restaurant. Very intense farm to table. We made all of our own charcuterie, all of our own bread \u2014 everything. But maybe what didn't resonate was it was a restaurant driven for me.\n\nIt was things I was interested in \u2014 and those are things that don't necessarily translate (into popular success).\n\nQ: Could it have been a good lesson?\n\nA: One hundred per cent. We weren't as busy as we wanted to be, but it was actually \u2014 our lease was up. I took over a failing restaurant, and for three years, ran it, paid the bills, everything was fine. And then the landlord doubled the price per square foot.\n\nFinancially, it wasn't necessarily viable, but I do think having Downtown Food close was the best thing that actually happened to me in my career. But I also think running it for three years was the best thing, and that's what I've realized.\n\nWhen you're young, you're not patient.\n\nI'm still not patient, which is my Achilles heel: I want everything now.\n\nWith files from the Calgary Eyeopener."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "7 teens charged in organized iPhone thefts from Lethbridge mall", "description": "Police have charged seven teenagers in the organized theft of iPhones from two stores at a mall in Lethbridge, Alta.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/lethbridge-iphone-thefts-1.4912266", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2825566.1415248012!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/apple-china-resale.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:11:21Z", "content": "Police have charged seven teenagers in the organized theft of iPhones from two stores at a mall in Lethbridge, Alta.

She said their \"pop-up\" stores and craft fair sales replicate what they try to do online.\n\n\"It was one of the first times we actually got to have a face-to-face relationship with our customer.
