But the retired Marine general and his former top aide are hardly the only ones whose jobs are at risk in what could be one of the most dramatic Cabinet and staff shakeups in modern presidential history.\n\nThe two weeks since the midterm elections have served as a long wind-up for the president to make big changes to his Cabinet. But aside from firing his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, Trump has yet to make a move, instead letting advisers including Nielsen, Kelly, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross dangle in a state of awkward public limbo.\n\nWhite House officials would like to plan for orderly firings and replacements, but acknowledge that \u2014 particularly when it comes to personnel issues \u2014 it is almost futile to expect Trump to follow a plan.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen looks on as President Donald Trump speaks during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office on Friday. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nIt's far from an unfamiliar plight. Past officials including former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster were all treated to weeks or months of reports about their impending doom before their official dismissal, with Trump pawing at them like a cat toying with wounded mice. In the cases of Tillerson and Priebus, the deed was done with a presidential tweet.\n\nBut even longtime Trump observers say his public dithering is being exacerbated by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s intensifying probe and by the upcoming Democratic takeover of the House, which threaten to constrain the Trump presidency in ways yet unknown. The president has spent hours with his lawyers over the past several days answering written questions from Mueller and his team, and Trump told reporters on Friday that he had recently finished the process.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s feeling the pressure of both the Mueller investigation and that the House is going to have all of this institutional power over him, and he likes to feel unfettered,\u201d said Trump biographer Tim O\u2019Brien. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you have this heightened sense this week that everybody is walking on eggshells \u2014 these institutional forces are really causing him to lash out.\u201d\n\nThe big question in the White House now is when \u2014 and how \u2014 Trump conducts the multiple firings and reassignments that his inner circle assumes are coming.\n\nWhite House aides are looking ahead to several upcoming Air Force One flights, which will provide the president with hours of open TV and iPhone time, as potential killing fields for advisers in jeopardy. The president will fly from Washington to California on Saturday to visit with victims of the wildfires that have ravaged the state, and then to his Mar-a-Lago resort on Wednesday for Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be on that plane,\u201d said a Trump friend who speaks with the president frequently.\n\nIn a move few White House aides were prepared for at the time, Trump dismissed Priebus by tweet while sitting aboard his plane \u2014 announcing Kelly as Priebus\u2019 successor before he had formally offered Kelly the job.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American and a Great Leader,\u201d Trump wrote, as Air Force One idled on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base.\n\nThat announcement came during another period of turmoil for the administration, the day after Trump named Anthony Scaramucci his communications chief.\n\nBeginning on election night, Trump has made clear to virtually everybody with whom he has come in contact that he wants Nielsen gone. He acknowledged publicly on Wednesday that he is mulling widespread changes, telling the Daily Caller in an interview that \u201calways in an administration after the midterms you make changes, so, I\u2019m looking at things and I\u2019ve got a lot of options. A lot of people want to come in. A lot of politicians that have had very successful careers that are very good want to come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be making a decision on Homeland shortly,\u201d he added. But by Friday evening, there was still no word from the White House.\n\nWhile Trump has expressed skepticism about the 46-year-old Nielsen from the time she succeeded Kelly as DHS chief last December, after Kelly moved to the White House, the president has been particularly upset by recent data showing that border arrests \u2014 generally considered an indicator of illegal immigration rates \u2014 are on the rise.\n\nTrump has boasted in the past about low border-crossing rates, which he considers a critical metric of a Homeland Security director\u2019s effectiveness, even though many factors determine rates of illegal immigration, including how many jobs are available within the U.S. for migrants.\n\nAfter a plunge in border apprehensions around the time of Trump\u2019s 2016 election \u2014 a drop for which Trump has taken credit, and for which he also credited then-DHS chief Kelly \u2014 that rate has steadily risen since mid-2017 and is now close to levels predating Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhile Kelly, Pompeo and others are pushing the president to keep her on, Nielsen is not without her critics in the administration. They include national security adviser John Bolton, who engaged in a heated argument with Kelly in the Oval Office last month after Bolton said Nielsen's department was to blame for not doing more to discourage illegal immigration. Trump became particularly focused on the issue during this fall\u2019s election campaign, when he warned that a caravan of several thousand Central American migrants headed to the U.S.-Mexico border amounted to an \u201cinvasion\u201d of America.\n\nNielsen\u2019s departure would leave Kelly more isolated than ever in the administration. Some of his closest West Wing collaborators have departed in recent months, including former White House counsel Don McGahn and former White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin. Nielsen\u2019s ouster would serve as an exclamation point.\n\nNielsen guided Kelly through his confirmation hearings to be secretary of Homeland Security and accompanied him to the White House, where she served as his deputy, before she was nominated to be secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House speculated Wednesday that if Trump dismisses Nielsen in a humiliating manner, that might be enough to prompt Kelly to depart as well.\n\nSome of the president\u2019s allies are urging him to announce several dismissals at once, along with a handful of replacements, in order to stanch what one characterized as the \u201cdrip, drip\u201d of salacious news stories.\n\nTrump has upended his own administration\u2019s plans for orderly mass firings before, though. His dismissal of McMaster by tweet last March ruined plans for an announcement of a wider administration shakeup that included the dismissal of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, among others.\n\nThe president has also made clear the blizzard of news coverage about personnel intrigue inside the White House is an irritant, declaring on Twitter on Thursday, \u201cThe White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes, the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible!

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nTo reporters, the threatened new rules \u2014 which one person close to the White House said were in the works before the court ruling Friday \u2014 represent another obstacle to covering Trump, who views his battle with the media as an unambiguous positive with his conservative base. It was Trump and Sanders, after all, who escalated the Acosta situation after a dispute at a news conference by yanking his press pass and, to justify it, pointing to an apparently altered video of his interaction with a White House aide. Now, future legal encounters appear certain, as journalists deemed to have broken the rules are also likely to take the administration to court.\n\nThe situation is akin to having a \u201csword hanging over our heads,\u201d said New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker. \u201cIt leaves this idea that they are going to be the judge of who gets to cover them based on some probably arbitrary criteria that they will be the only ones to determine.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe idea that suddenly you\u2019re going to try to determine who is polite enough to ask the president questions is just kind of ridiculous.\u201d\n\nWhite House Correspondents\u2019 Association president Olivier Knox said Friday afternoon that the White House had not reached out to him for input on any new rules for reporter behavior.\n\n\u201cAs the organization that defends the interest of a free and independent news media at the White House, we have our role to play, but what that role will be, I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House might see political victory in battling the media, but the court ruling Friday was a legal win for CNN, long a favorite target of Trump's. Federal Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, ruled that the administration had denied Acosta due process in revoking his security pass, citing shifting White House explanations, no clear process, no advance notification to Acosta and no chance for him to rebut the allegations. Kelly ordered the White House to return Acosta\u2019s credential on a temporary basis, while the rest of the case moves forward.\n\nThe White House did not reply to questions Friday about whether it would continue fighting Acosta and CNN in court. But Trump has kept up a confrontational stance with reporters in the past two weeks.\n\nHe berated CNN's Abby Phillip for asking a \u201cstupid question,\u201d after she asked whether he wanted acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to rein in the Russia investigation. And at the same news conference in which he tussled with Acosta, Trump accused Yamiche Alcindor of \"PBS NewsHour\" of asking a \u201cracist question\u201d when she brought up his use of the phrase \u201cnationalist\u201d and its links to white nationalism.\n\n\u201cAcosta is one thing, but I think they tip their hand by going after people like Abby Phillip and going after Yamiche Alcindor, who have done nothing but show how professional they are,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThis is meant to intimidate.\u201d\n\nTrump's frustration with relatively straightforward questions such as those will almost certainly lead reporters to wonder whether they are being targeted for their coverage, not their behavior.\n\nCNN has argued that was the case with Acosta, alleging that the White House yanked his hard pass \u2014 which allows reporters to freely enter and exit the grounds \u2014 because it was attempting to stifle coverage it disliked, in violation of the First Amendment. But Kelly did not address that in his ruling, saying only that Acosta's due process rights were clearly violated.\n\nNow, the administration says it's creating a process for banning reporters who do not show \u201cdecorum\u201d at events.\n\nIn excerpts of the Fox News interview \u2014 which will air in full Sunday \u2014 Wallace asked Trump what the rules for reporters should be. \"You can't keep asking questions,\" the president replied. \"We had a lot of reporters in that room, many, many reporters in that room, and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts ... just shouting out questions. And making statements, too.\"\n\nTrump added, \u201cBut I will say this: Nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do. And if I think somebody is acting out of sorts, I will leave and say, 'Thank you very much. Thanks for coming.' And I'll leave. Those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that's acting up.\u201d\n\nThe White House will have broad discretion in formulating rules for reporters\u2019 behavior, so long as none of them discriminate against anyone based on their views or coverage, said Katie Fallow, a senior attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.\n\n\u201cThe fight will likely be over how they\u2019re applied,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce the new rules are established, the White House likely would not be able to kick out Acosta, or anyone else, for past offenses, said Nathan Siegel, a First Amendment lawyer with Davis Wright Tremaine who previously served as in-house counsel for ABC.\n\n\u201cProbably the biggest question is whether it will use those rules to try to eject reporters, whether it\u2019s Acosta or others, in the future,\u201d Siegel said.\n\nHe said any reporter ejected from the White House under the new rules and procedures would be able to challenge them in court. The result could be an ongoing carousel of legal fights between Trump and the press \u2014 something the president seems to relish.\n\nIn the case of Acosta, Baker said the White House has an easy solution before it.\n\n\u201cIf they really think that Jim Acosta is too rude, don\u2019t call on him,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want what\u2019s happening right now. They want to be in a war with us.\u201d\n\nGabby Orr contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "dstrauss@politico.com (Daniel Strauss)", "title": "Abrams says Kemp will be next governor of Georgia, effectively conceding race", "description": "Democrat Stacey Abrams announced Friday that Brian Kemp, her Republican opponent in the Georgia gubernatorial race, would be certified as governor.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/stacey-abrams-acknowledges-brian-kemp-will-be-next-governor-of-georgia-1000395", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/be/46/cfe86ef94d39b141686c3d359792/181116-abrams-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:33:15Z", "content": "Democrat Stacey Abrams announced Friday that Brian Kemp, her Republican opponent in the Georgia gubernatorial race, would be certified as governor. \"I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernator\u2026 [+1045 chars]", "fulltext": "John Amis/AP Photo Elections Abrams says Kemp will be next governor of Georgia, effectively conceding race\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams announced Friday that Brian Kemp, her Republican opponent in the Georgia gubernatorial race, would be certified as governor.\n\n\"I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election,\" Abrams said at a press conference Friday, effectively conceding that she lost the race.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe announcement comes more than a week after the November midterm elections when Kemp came out as the top vote-getter in the race. But Abrams refused to concede, arguing that there were outstanding votes that needed to be counted. Since then her campaign has filed legal challenges and pushed to have additional absentee and provisional ballots counted.\n\nThat move lowered the margin of victory for Kemp but not by enough to trigger a runoff or recount.\n\nBut Abrams also criticized Kemp's handling of the election as secretary of state and said her speech was not a normal concession of a fair election to an opponent. But Abrams still said she was dropping out.\n\n\"My assessment is the law allows no further viable remedy,\" Abrams said.\n\nFriday was the day all counties had to certify the election results.\n\nSince the Nov. 6 election, Abrams and her campaign argued that Kemp, through negligence or indirect moves as secretary of state, worked to suppress the vote for Abrams throughout the state. Abrams officials also argued that Kemp was not doing everything in his power to count every vote.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the former secretary of state was deliberate and intentional in his actions,\" Abrams said. \"I know that eight years of systemic disenfranchisement, disinvestment and incompetence had its desired effect on the electoral process in Georgia.\"\n\nAfter election night, the campaign filed multiple legal challenges to ensure absentee or provisional ballots were counted even if they came late in certain cases. The campaign also sued to extend certification deadlines for parts of the state.\n\nAbrams, in her speech, acknowledged that she could continue to fight the election results but said that would be counterproductive.\n\n\"Now, I could certainly bring a new case to keep this one contest alive, but I don't want to hold public office if I need to scheme my way into the post,\" Abrams said. \"Because the title of governor isn't nearly as important as our shared title. Voters.\"\n\nAbrams \"would probably be gov if it would have been a #fairfight. But here we are, we will #keepfightinig,\" Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo tweeted after the press conference. \"Coming soon: all of this knowledge, analysis and info on what happened, collected by our staff and vols, will be poured into a major lawsuit to force reform.\"\n\nSince the election, Kemp and his team have been adamant that Abrams lost. In response to every lawsuit or criticism, Kemp\u2019s team argued that he was the decisive victor and Abrams was just grandstanding.\n\n\u201cGovernor-elect Brian Kemp earned a clear and convincing victory on Election Day,\u201d Kemp communications director Ryan Mahoney said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe campaign is over and Kemp\u2019s focus is on building a safer, stronger future for Georgia families. Radical Stacey Abrams is beyond desperate with her latest publicity stunt. Georgia voters made their decision at the ballot box. It\u2019s time for Stacey Abrams to end her ridiculous temper tantrum and concede.\u201d\n\nThroughout the race, critics including former President Jimmy Carter argued that Kemp had a conflict of interest as both a secretary of state and a candidate. But Kemp only stepped down from his official role after election night as he began his transition to governor.\n\nAbrams was one of the most high-profile Democratic statewide candidates in the 2018 cycle and quickly earned endorsements from major figures of the establishment and liberal wings of the Democratic Party. The thesis of Abrams' campaign was that Georgia had an untapped pool of Democratic voters, many of them nonwhite, that could be leveraged into a major statewide win and turn the state purple in elections to come.\n\nThe race became a rallying point for the respective grassroots wings of the Republican and Democratic parties. Abrams became a favorite of Democratic moderates and liberals while Kemp, who didn't start out in the Republican primary as the frontrunner, earned a surprise endorsement from President Donald Trump. Kemp also built his reputation as secretary of state on being a voter-fraud hardliner. Abrams, prior to running for governor, founded a group aimed at registering new voters in Georgia. The two had seemed to be on a collision course in recent years.\n\nIn the primary, Abrams was always the frontrunner and handily defeated her opponent, Stacey Evans, raising optimism that her campaign's focus on building a strong field apparatus earlier than most campaigns could work in a general election atmosphere even in a ruby-red state like Georgia.\n\nBut on election night and even as the margin of Kemp's lead shrank, he always led Abrams by thousands of votes.\n\nLate Friday, Trump tweeted: \"Congratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia.

They argued instead that an appeal in another case \u2014 filed by a grand jury witness resisting a Mueller subpoena \u2014 raised serious issues about the special counsel\u2019s legitimacy and should be resolved before Papadopoulos is required to begin serving his sentence.\n\n\u201cIn light of the advanced stage of the appeal\u2026Mr. Papadopoulos faces the prospect of unnecessarily serving a sentence of incarceration for a conviction that may in the near future be reversed,\u201d his new lawyers, at the firm of Pierce Bainbridge, wrote.\n\n\u201cAbsent a stay of the execution of his sentence, the hardship and unfairness to Mr. Papadopoulos is palpable: he risks unnecessarily serving a sentence of incarceration that was unconstitutionally obtained,\u201d they added.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019 approach towards Mueller\u2019s office grew even more combative after he testified behind closed doors last month to lawmakers from the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nShe went on to note that the 15 to 20 Pelosi critics trying to oust her are more centrist in their ideology and goals than the rest of the caucus. If Democrats remove her, Jayapal argued, they would effectively be turning their backs on the voters who swept Democrats into power.\n\n\u201cThat drive is not going to take us in the direction that we should go,\u201d Jayapal said of the effort to depose Pelosi. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the opposite of what the election really told us, which is a much more diverse, progressive, bold agenda.\u201d\n\nPelosi's overtures also speak to progressives\u2019 growing influence in the Democratic Caucus. The Progressive Caucus will increase its membership by at least 20 members next year, and comprise about two-fifths of the caucus. Its leaders intend to use those numbers to boost their power and agenda \u2014 starting first with committee assignments and leadership positions, then expanding into legislation.\n\nAdding to that heft is their relationship with powerful groups on the outside \u2014 organizations that Jayapal argues are the main reason Democrats retook the majority.\n\n\u201cWe coordinated very closely with them, and they actually told Pelosi that they won\u2019t come out for her until [after] our meeting,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cSo we are leveraging our power in different ways within the caucus but also with our allies on the outside.\u201d\n\nThursday's meeting with Pelosi included Jayapal and current Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Mark Pocan (D-Wis.). One request to which Pelosi agreed was to give the Progressive Caucus proportional representation on what lawmakers call the \u201cA committees\u201d: the Appropriations, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, Financial Services and Intelligence committees.\n\nJayapal and Pocan also asked for \u201cexpanded leadership that allows for more progressives in the top spots,\u201d Jayapal said. While progressives would still have to run for and be elected to the positions, it would at least ensure there would be positions for progressives to run for.\n\nPelosi agreed with the idea, though it is unclear whether she will create a new position in leadership, as is being discussed behind the scenes now, according to several Democratic leadership sources. Since Pelosi, Hoyer and Assistant Leader James Clyburn have been leading the caucus for 15 years, there haven\u2019t been many openings in leadership for progressives.\n\nOne progressive lawmaker, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), is running for assistant leader, the No. 4 position. But he is expected to be defeated by Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), who helped win back the House as head of the caucus' campaign arm, lawmakers and aides predict.\n\nA new leadership spot would create an opening for Cicilline, in theory, though he would have to be elected.\n\nPelosi did commit to enhancing the heft of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a panel recently created to give rank-and-file members more leadership opportunities \u2014 and stocked with progressive lawmakers. Pelosi agreed to a Progressive Caucus demand that those positions include a budget and staff; they currently have neither. Several progressive lawmakers are running for these positions again next year.\n\nThe group leaders also registered their concerns about \u201cpay-go\u201d rules with Pelosi. Under those rules, certain bills cannot be considered if they aren't paid for. Progressives have long run on policy positions that would be expensive, from \"Medicare for all\" to free college tuition. Pelosi didn\u2019t make any commitments, but she promised to bring those rules up for debate.\n\nIn a sign of the rising influence of the Progressive Caucus leaders, outside groups specifically held off on endorsing Pelosi until she committed to these asks. After the meeting, the progressive leaders called these groups to give them the green light to back Pelosi.\n\nWhile the Progressive Caucus as an entity has not endorsed Pelosi, the promises were enough for Jayapal.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we doubted [Pelosi\u2019s] credentials as a progressive,\" Jayapal said. \"But we felt that we really needed to have some assurances around her commitment to making sure that the blue wave, which in our mind has been fueled by progressives across the country,\u201d continues in Congress.\n\nAbout 30 minutes after that meeting, progressives weighed in on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe strongly support and call on all members of the Democratic caucus to support @NancyPelosi for Speaker,\u201d MoveOn.org tweeted at around 6:30 p.m.. \u201cWere it not for her skilled and effective leadership, the ACA would not be law today. Dems must reject attempts to defeat her and move caucus to the right.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "skarlin@politico.com (Sarah Karlin-Smith)", "title": "Pfizer raises drug prices again, rebuking Trump", "description": "Pfizer's new price increases, which take effect Jan. 15, will apply to 10 percent of its portfolio, the company said.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/pfizer-drugs-prices-increase-trump-981010", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/12/be/02ecd32a493d9a00693bdee6d411/181116-pfizer-getty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:28:07Z", "content": "Mario Tama/Getty Images Drug giant Pfizer announced today it will increase the list prices of 41 medicines in January, just months after it agreed to temporarily roll back price hikes under pressure from President Donald Trump.

Trump accused the company of \"taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves,\" and Pfizer a day later agreed to cancel the price increases.\n\nPfizer at the time said the rollback would give Trump an opportunity to work on his administration's drug price plan. The company said it would reinstate price increases at the end of the year if the administration's drug pricing plan didn't take effect.\n\nA spokesperson for HHS Secretary Alex Azar criticized Pfizer\u2019s latest price hikes, saying they \u201cfurther illustrate the perverse incentives of America\u2019s drug pricing system.\u201d\n\nPrescription Pulse A weekly briefing on pharmaceutical policy news \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But the gestures were largely seen as symbolic, with some companies agreeing to freeze prices just weeks after they already took what is usually their last price increases of the year \u2014 companies typically raise prices in January and July. Health policy experts have expected the industry would resume regular price increases starting in January.\n\n\u201cThe drug price pledges made earlier this year were just for show \u2014 it was obvious at the time, and it's obvious now,\u201d said Walid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cThe bully pulpit doesn't work, and even if it did, we don't want a system in which the only way to bring down drug prices is for the president to publicly berate a company \u2014 that's not a healthy market and not good policy.\u201d\n\nBut some health policy experts said they think Trump\u2019s tendency to lash out at drug companies will keep price hikes lower next year, even it doesn\u2019t completely eliminate them.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s less likely we\u2019ll see the same manner of price increases of previous years (double digit) that the market had grown accustomed to, but I don\u2019t think that entails a wholesale stop to price increases,\u201d John Leppard, an analyst at the research firm Washington Analysis, said in an email.\n\nPfizer said the new price increases are expected to be offset by higher rebates and discounts given to insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers, and it doesn\u2019t expect the hikes will increase its 2019 revenue. Azar spokesperson Caitlin Oakley pointed out the company\u2019s discounts won\u2019t help consumers who must pay list price or a set percentage of it.\n\nTrump's drug pricing plan from May, a 44-page outline of proposals, largely remains unimplemented. Drug pricing is one area where the new Democratic House majority could find common ground with Trump.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts said drug companies were holding down price increases this summer to avoid provoking more aggressive action from the Trump administration. But just before the elections, the administration offered proposals the industry doesn't like, including one tying Medicare payments for some expensive drugs to lower prices set by European countries.\n\nDrug companies, \"don't need to play nice anymore (or not 'as nice'),\" Bernstein investment analyst Ronny Gal said in an email.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mlevine@politico.com (Marianne LeVine)", "title": "One more post-election memo", "description": "Manufacturers add four \u2014 Definers responds", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2018/11/16/one-more-post-election-memo-419105", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:26:55Z", "content": "With Daniel Lippman, David Beavers and Sarah Cammarata PROGRAMMING NOTE: PI will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22, and Friday, Nov. 23.

The latest comes from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. There\u2019s a lot in it, but here\u2019s what the lobbyists there have to say about what\u2019s likely to happen in the lame duck. \u201cDespite historic progress on appropriations before the September 30 deadline, the remaining spending fights in the lame duck session will be contentious,\u201d the firm writes. \u201cOne of the seven remaining appropriations bills provides funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is expected to lead to a heated debate over President Trump\u2019s insistence that Congress include funding for his proposed border wall that Democrats oppose.\u201d\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s always the possibility of a government shutdown over the wall, of course. Any spending bill could also include tax changes. The relevant \u201ccommittees have each worked on a package of fixes and improvements for retirement plans that may see a conclusion in the lame duck session. In addition, some of the provisions, referred to as \u2018tax extenders,\u2019 technically expired on December 30, 2017, but Congress has a history of retroactively renewing these provisions, so they will be part of the larger negotiation on a possible tax package.\u201d But the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that passed in October \u201celiminated a \u2018must pass\u2019 tax vehicle for the lame duck session, slightly reduces the odds of a tax package coming together in December.\u201d Here\u2019s the full memo.\n\nMANUFACTURERS ADD FOUR: The National Association of Manufacturers has hired David Eiselsberg as senior director for tax policy, Graham Owens as director of legal and regulatory policy and Kristie Arslan as director of member and board relations. Eiselsberg was previously chief of staff to Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), who\u2019s retiring next year. Owens was previously a legal fellow at TechFreedom. And Arslan previously had her own firm, Arslan Consulting Services. The trade group also announced it had hired Sam Beaver, a former aide to Sen.

Definers responded in a statement posted on its website this morning. \u201cDefiners\u2019 main services for Facebook were basic media monitoring and public relations around public policy issues facing the company,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe ran a large-scale news alert service keeping hundreds of Facebook staff informed on news stories about the company and its policy challenges.\u201d It also notes that Definers\u2019 work for Facebook, which Facebook\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has claimed he knew nothing about, wasn\u2019t exactly a secret: \u201cOur hiring was public, and first reported by Axios in October 2017.\u201d\n\nANONYMOUS DONORS GAVE MILLIONS TO PRO-TRUMP NONPROFIT: A super PAC and an allied nonprofit aligned with President Donald Trump \u201craised $26 million in its first year in operation, new disclosures show, the vast majority of which came in through a political nonprofit that does not have to reveal its donors,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Maggie Severns reports. \u201cPolitical nonprofit America First Policies raised $22 million in 2017, a filing with the IRS showed Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cAn affiliated super PAC, which reveals its fundraising totals quarterly, raised $4 million that year, previous disclosures with the Federal Election Commission showed. \u2026 The filing Thursday showed America First Policies raised money from 33 donors in 2017, who each donated between $5,000 and $5 million.

Mark Meadows (N.C.) and Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen (Nev.) \u2014 over sexual harassment-related allegations, the latest sign that fallout from #MeToo movement continues to be felt on Capitol Hill.\n\nMeadows was found to have violated House rules \"by failing to take appropriate steps to ensure that his House office was free from discrimination and any perception of discrimination.\" This case grew out of an investigation into Meadows' former chief of staff, Kenny West. Meadows kept West on his payroll even after learning of credible harassment allegations against the former aide. At one point, Meadows ordered West not to interact with women staffers, a move the Ethics Committee criticized in its report as risking \"unequal treatment.\" Meadows will have to pay more than $40,000 to cover the cost of West's salary.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPOLITICO first reported the allegations against Meadows and West.\n\nKihuen, who announced his retirement as the #MeToo movement swept Capitol Hill last year, was found to have \"made persistent and unwanted advances towards women who were required to interact with him as part of their professional responsibilities.\"\n\nBoth lawmakers were reproved by the bipartisan Ethics Committee, the least serious form of punishment it can mete out.\n\nMeadows is chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and he has been mentioned as potential ranking member on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the next Congress, although the Ethics Committee's action could prove troublesome on that front.\n\nIn a statement, Meadows said he was glad the investigation was over, and he noted that he had first asked for an Ethics Committee review in Nov. 2015. However, the Office of Congressional Ethics had already begun its own probe into sexual harassment allegations against West by that time.\n\n\u201cThree years ago I asked the Committee on Ethics to review the matter surrounding the alleged conduct of my former chief of staff, Mr. West, and I\u2019m thankful their review has now concluded,\" Meadows said. \"I appreciate the Committee\u2019s acknowledgment of the immediate, appropriate, and good faith steps I did take after learning of my staff\u2019s concerns - including immediately separating the chief from the accusers so they never had to interact with him personally during the independent investigation.\n\nWest was hired by Meadows as chief of staff in Jan. 2013, shortly after Meadows won a seat in Congress. Meadows said he was not made aware of any harassment allegations against West until Oct. 2014, although aides told investigators West's improper, troubling behavior began shortly after he was hired. This included \"unwanted touching,\" \"inappropriate staring\" and \"unprofessional comments\" about women in Meadows' Washington and North Carolina offices.\n\nBeginning in Oct. 2014, multiple women staffers in Meadows' office complained to him about West, the Ethics Committee states. Meadows responded by barring West from interacting with all female staffers, although Meadows left him in as chief of staff. Meadows also asked Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to help with an \"independent investigation\" into the incident. A Gowdy aide who looked into the matter said West should be fired, according to the Ethics Committee report. It wasn't until then-Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) office got involved in early 2015 that West was fired, although Meadows kept him on as a senior adviser making the same salary.\n\nPOLITICO raised questions in Sept. 2015 about a lump-sum payment made to West by Meadows' office that year. The Office of Congressional Ethics began an investigation. At that point, Meadows reported the issue himself to the Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Ethics Committee noted that the \u201cCode of Official Conduct provides that Members may not retain an employee who does not perform duties for the employing office commensurate with the compensation the employee receives. When Mr. West was demoted to Senior Advisor, his pay remained the same but the Committee found little evidence of official work that he completed during that time. Thus, the Committee found that his duties as Senior Advisor were not commensurate with his pay.\"\n\nWhile noting that there was \"little and inconsistent guidance on severance payments available to the House community at the time,\" Meadows did not seek any guidance from the Ethics Committee about West or whether such payments would be allowed. Thus the Ethics Committee found Meadows would be personally responsible for reimbursing the Treasury for some of the funds paid to West.\n\nAn aide said, \"Rep. Meadows will pay back the severance in full.\"\n\n\"Representative Meadows\u2019 failure to take prompt and decisive action to deal with the alleged sexual harassment in his congressional office was troubling to the Committee,\" the report states. \"The Committee found Representative Meadows violated House rules by failing to take appropriate steps to ensure that his House office was free from discrimination and any perception of discrimination.\"\n\nThe report added: \"In addition, the Committee is concerned that Representative Meadows\u2019 'solution' to the sexual harassment allegations, to cut off all contact between Mr. West and most of his female employees, caused another potential problem. An environment where only male staff have access to the Chief of Staff risks unequal treatment of employees based solely on sex.\"\n\nKihuen, who was only elected in 2016, saw his congressional career quickly ended following media reports that he had sexually harassed at least three women, including during his time as a state legislator in Nevada.\n\nAccording to the Ethics Committee, the Nevada Democrat made repeated sexual advances to one of his campaign aides. This included \"the touching of her thigh on two occasions, comments on how she looked, suggestions that Representative Kihuen would take her out if she did not work for him, a suggestion that she and Representative Kihuen should get a hotel room together, and questions regarding whether she would ever cheat on her boyfriend.\"\n\nA Nevada lobbyist told congressional investigators that Kihuen \"made unwanted physical and verbal advances towards her including, among other things, sliding his hand under her dress and onto her thigh, grabbing her buttocks, messages asking her to come and sit on his lap, asking her what color her panties were, suggesting she would look good naked, and messages suggesting, through the use of emojis, that they make a sex tape together.\"\n\nDuring an interview with by the Ethics Committee, Kihuen denied the allegations. However, the panel did not believe those denials, according to its report.\n\n\"Despite Representative Kihuen\u2019s denials, each of the complainant\u2019s allegations were supported by documentary evidence and some of the alleged incidents were corroborated by third party witnesses,\" the report states. \"Furthermore, at least two outside entities were made aware of Campaign Staffer and D.C. Firm Employee\u2019s allegations and approached Representative Kihuen, and his campaign, about his behavior in 2016 and 2017.\"\n\nKihuen announced his retirement in Dec. 2017, after Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats demanded he resign from office.\n\nKihuen on Friday said he didn't agree with everything in the report but apologized to the women.\n\n\u201cAfter much reflection and introspection, I recognize that regardless of the fact that I never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable or disrespected, what matters is how my actions were perceived by the women who came forward,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt saddens me greatly to think I made any woman feel that way due to my own immaturity and overconfidence. I extend my sincere apologies to each of these women. Though I do not agree with aspects of the Report, I am thankful the Committee afforded everyone an opportunity to be heard and appreciate the Committee\u2019s acknowledgment that I fully cooperated with the investigation.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: Mark Meadows\n\nRuben Kihuen"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "rmorin@politico.com (Rebecca Morin)", "title": "Without a 280-character limit, George Conway dishes on it all", "description": "In an 80-minute wide-ranging discussion on Yahoo News' Skullduggery he continued to take digs at President Donald Trump.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/george-conway-dishes-it-all-996715", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/19/de/7aa67048442f86759044b89c9489/181116-george-kellyanne-conway-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:37:43Z", "content": "President Donald Trump last week said he did not know George Conway, referring to him as \"Mr. Kellyanne Conway,\" and that his criticisms towards the president were to get attention. | AP Photo/Matt Rourke \"Mr. Kellyanne Conway\" isn't confined to a 280-charact\u2026 [+7787 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump last week said he did not know George Conway, referring to him as \"Mr. Kellyanne Conway,\" and that his criticisms towards the president were to get attention. | AP Photo/Matt Rourke White House Without a 280-character limit, George Conway dishes on it all\n\n\"Mr. Kellyanne Conway\" isn't confined to a 280-character limit anymore.\n\nInstead, George Conway, the outspoken husband of counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, stepped out from behind his Twitter persona and op-ed writing to participate in an 80-minute wide-ranging discussion on Yahoo News' Skullduggery, where he continued to take digs at President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nConway, who said he was finally worn down by requests from the podcast's co-host Michael Isikoff, hit on why he withdrew his name from consideration for a top position at the Justice Department, when the tides began to turn in regard to his views on Trump, and the relationship with his wife given his harsh criticism of her boss.\n\nHere's a roundup of top moments from Conway's interview.\n\nChecks and Balances\n\nConway said the group he created to encourage conservative lawyers to speak out against the Trump administration, entitled Checks and Balances, is not about \"any single individual,\" adding that its mission statement does not specifically \"use the 'T' word.\"\n\n\"It's about the principles, it's about the rule of law,\" he said. \"You don't have to stay silent when you see something that you don't like that is inconsistent of these timeless principles.\"\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter.\n\n\"To criticize the attorney general for permitting justice to be done without regard to political party is very disturbing,\" he said.\n\n'I call myself Mr. Kellyanne Conway'\n\nTrump last week said he did not know George Conway, referring to him as \"Mr. Kellyanne Conway,\" and that his criticisms toward the president were designed to get attention.\n\nGeorge Conway agreed with the president on two of the three points.\n\n\"I call myself Mr. Kellyanne Conway,\" he said. In addition, Conway said he does not know the president well.\n\nBut he said he doesn't want attention with his criticisms, adding that \"if I wanted to get attention, I wouldn't be on this podcast.\" Conway said he has been asked to speak on a number of news networks but has declined those invitations.\n\nWhen asked how Kellyanne Conway feels about his criticisms, George Conway said he doesn't \"think she likes it.\"\n\n\"I've told her that I don't like the administration, so it's even,\" he said. \"It's one of these things that if I had a nickel for everybody in Washington who disagrees with their spouse about everything that happens in this town, I wouldn't be on this podcast, I would probably be on a beach somewhere.\"\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, when it comes down to things we disagree about, we agree on most policy things, virtually all, ever, it's just, though, this is the one thing we really disagree about,\" he added.\n\nDodged a bullet\n\nConway believes he dodged a bullet by not joining the Trump administration.\n\nThe lawyer was undergoing a background check to be the chief of the civil division at the Justice Department, which he said he believes was nearly completed when he withdrew his name.\n\n\"It's like the administration is like a shit show in a dumpster fire, and I'm like, I don't want to do that,\" he said.\n\nHe added that following Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and Comey's comments about the Russia probe, he knew that the relationship between the president and the Justice Department was going to be tense.\n\n\"I realized, you know, that this guy is going to be at war with the Justice Department,\" he said. \"He's going to be at one end, and if I get this door prize, I'm going to be in the middle of a department he's at war with. Why would anybody want to do this?\"\n\nElection night tears ... of joy\n\nThe night of Trump's win in 2016, it was reported that George Conway cried because he was so happy about the election results.\n\nConway said he was happy at the time Trump won, adding that he didn't like the Clintons and did not want Hillary Clinton to win. Conway was a lawyer representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton.\n\nOn Trump, he said at the time: \"My view was he was the lesser evil.\"\n\nBut he also said he was happy for his wife, and the outcome of all the work she did to get Trump elected.\n\n\"My wife did an amazing thing, she basically got this guy elected,\" he said. \"And other people like to take credit for it, but she got this guy elected.\n\n\"She steadied that vote. She did it. She went on television, she imposed message discipline on that campaign; I mean, he was in the crapper when she took that campaign over,\" he said.\n\nConway, however, said that he does not know whether Trump is now the lesser of two evils.\n\n\"Faced with the choice again, I would probably move to Australia,\" he said.\n\nGrounds for impeachment\n\nConway said that discussions of impeachment should happen after all the evidence from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is complete.\n\nOnly then, he said, could there be a judgment, and he believes that the House and Senate should make the decision on what to do next.\n\n\"I'm open to supporting what's constitutionally appropriate, and if any constitutional officer commits an impeachable offense, then they should be subject to potential impeachment and removal under the Constitution,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked whether that includes Trump, he said: \"Including any president.\"\n\nGoodbye to the party of Trump\n\nIn March, Conway changed his voter registration from Republican to \"unaffiliated,\" citing the state of the Grand Old Party.\n\n\"I don't feel comfortable being a Republican anymore,\" he said. \"I think the Republican Party has become something of a personality cult.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he would support Trump in his reelection bid in 2020, Conway immediately said no. He wouldn't confirm whether he would support a Democrat in 2020 or a Republican who chooses to run against the president. In addition, Conway said he has no comment on whether he believes Trump is \"stable.\"\n\n\"I don't know, we'll have to see. I don't know who's going to run,\" he said.\n\nThe turning point\n\nAlthough Conway said he cannot pinpoint the moment he soured on Trump, he said that the president's continued attacks on Sessions really irked him.\n\n\"I think the things that really bugged me the most was the tweets at Sessions, and the Justice Department, those things bugged me the most,\" he said. \"I don't know if there was any one moment, but it was sort of a gradual thing.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he thinks Trump poses a threat to the United States' fundamental institutions and the rule of law, Conway said he thinks \"that we have a strong constitutional order, and I think that's what we've seen thus far.\"\n\n\"I don't think there's been actual, functional damage,\" he said. \"In a sense, we have a weak president because the president wasn't able to fire his attorney general, he was only able to tweet at his attorney general for so long.\"\n\nHowever, Conway added that the perceptions Trump creates, such as his tweets calling Mueller's investigation a \"witch hunt,\" could have a long-term effect on Americans.\n\n\"They're corrosive,\" he said. \"And even if they don't actually have a legal effect and they're not executed with an order of any sort, they have a corrosive effect, I think, over the medium- to long-term perceptions, I think, of the public on what is how the system operates, and that's disturbing.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Matthew Choi", "title": "Assange charges could unsettle liberals, conservatives \u2014 and Trump", "description": "Some liberals have defended Assange as a journalist, conservatives celebrated him in 2016 and Trump once declared his 'love' for WikiLeaks.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/julian-assange-charges-wikileaks-997122", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/37/60/1e3509a14b52a927331b9d8c534f/181116-julian-assange-gtty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:30:25Z", "content": "Although Julian Assange has legions of determined enemies in the U.S., some influential actors may not be enthusiastic about his prosecution. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images Apparent criminal charges against Julian Assange are thrusting the WikiLeaks founder back \u2026 [+8650 chars]", "fulltext": "Although Julian Assange has legions of determined enemies in the U.S., some influential actors may not be enthusiastic about his prosecution. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images Legal Assange charges could unsettle liberals, conservatives \u2014 and Trump Some liberals have defended Assange as a journalist, conservatives celebrated him in 2016 and Trump once declared his 'love' for WikiLeaks.\n\nApparent criminal charges against Julian Assange are thrusting the WikiLeaks founder back into American politics \u2014 a development that could create awkwardness across the political spectrum.\n\nMany liberals and civil rights activists have defended Assange as a journalist entitled to First Amendment protections.

And President Donald Trump, who declared his \u201clove\u201d for Assange\u2019s website during the 2016 contest, may have new concerns about whether the focus on Assange has a connection to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor now, the details remain murky about what U.S. law Assange, an Australian national holed up in a London embassy, has even been charged with violating. An unrelated federal court filing discovered late Thursday appears to have accidentally mentioned Assange but doesn\u2019t explain whether the sealed charges deal with WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of stolen Democratic documents to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign or another matter that has also triggered notice from U.S. prosecutors.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when \u2014 if ever \u2014 the details about Assange will even be made public. Still, Assange\u2019s reemergence at a time when Mueller has carefully studied how WikiLeaks obtained the Russian-hacked Democratic emails in 2016 jump-starts a debate over the fate of the Australian computer programmer.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican. \u201cHe deserves to spend the rest of his life in an American prison.\u201d\n\nBut many influential conservatives gleefully celebrated the release of Clinton\u2019s emails in 2016 and have hailed Assange, 47, as a whistle-blower.\n\nIn September 2016, Fox News host and Trump confidant Sean Hannity hosted Assange on his show and congratulated him for showing \u201chow corrupt, dishonest and phony our government is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do hope you get free one day,\u201d Hannity added.\n\nIn late 2010, after WikiLeaks released a trove of sensitive U.S. diplomatic documents pilfered by Manning, Hannity called for Assange to be jailed for \u201cwaging war\u201d against the U.S.\n\nBut Assange\u2019s potential criminal prosecution may be most awkward of all for Trump, who during the 2016 campaign repeatedly praised WikiLeaks for revealing damning correspondence from Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cI love WikiLeaks,\u201d Trump extolled several times during the presidential campaign. \u201cThis WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove.\u201d\n\nSince then, after briefings from U.S. intelligence officials who consider Assange a national security threat,Trump has changed his tune and sought to place some distance between himself and Assange.\n\n\u201cThe dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange \u2014 wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people.... to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against 'Intelligence' when in fact I am a big fan!\u201d Trump wrote in a two-part tweet on Jan. 5, 2017.\n\nOnly a few months into Trump\u2019s presidency, his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said it would be a \u201cpriority\u201d to stop leaks and arrest Assange. CNN reported in April 2017 that the U.S. was preparing charges to arrest Assange and that then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo characterized WikiLeaks as \u201ca non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\u201d\n\nAssange\u2019s efforts in the 2016 campaign present challenges for several people in Trump\u2019s orbit. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors and his grand jury have summoned about a dozen associates of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone to Washington to explain how the self-proclaimed dirty trickster came to know about the pending WikiLeaks release of emails embarrassing to the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe president\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also appeared to have correspondence with WikiLeaks leading up to the election, The Atlantic reported last year.\n\nLegal experts cautioned against drawing conclusions about the nature of any charges the Justice Department might bring against Assange.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should assume this is Russia-related,\u201d said Matthew Miller, an Obama-era Justice Department spokesman. U.S. officials have considered bringing charges against Assange since he was the conduit for Manning\u2019s 2010 disclosure of secret government documents.\n\nSeamus Hughes, a former U.S. counterterrorism official now working at George Washington University, first discovered the reference to criminal charges against Assange and posted the publicly filed document on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis is every lawyer\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d said Samuel Buell, a Duke University law professor and former federal prosecutor who said the disclosure looks to be \u201can erroneous cut and paste.\u201d\n\nAt issue is a three-page court filing dealing with an unrelated sex-crime case brought by federal prosecutors alleging Seitu Sulayman Kokayi tried to coerce and entice a minor. In one passage, Assange\u2019s name mysteriously appears amid an explanation for why the case needs to be kept from public view \u201cdue to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case.\u201d\n\nAfter explaining the reasons why the U.S. government can keep a case sealed, the document concludes: \u201cThe complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\"\n\nJoshua Stueve, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement the reference to Assange in an unrelated criminal case \u201cwas made in error.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not the intended name for this filing,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for Mueller declined comment.\n\nBarry Pollack, a U.S.-based lawyer representing Assange, took issue both with the disclosure of the charges, as well as its longer-term implications. \u201cThe news that criminal charges have apparently been filed against Mr. Assange is even more troubling than the haphazard manner in which that information has been revealed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government bringing criminal charges against someone for publishing truthful information is a dangerous path for a democracy to take.\u201d\n\nEven some Assange critics agree. While the Obama White House publicly described Assange as an \"accomplice\" in Manning's theft of classified information, Obama officials concluded that it would be difficult to charge him given the implications for more traditional journalists.\n\nSeveral former federal prosecutors said Assange could be a gold mine of information for Mueller if U.S. officials were able to extradite him from the Ecuador Embassy and ultimately flip him into a government witness.\n\nPhilip Lacovara, an attorney from the Watergate special counsel team, called Assange \u201cthe linchpin between the Russian intelligence operatives and the activities by Donald Jr., Stone and others to exploit the illegally hacked emails and to disseminate them for coincident purposes of aiding Trump\u2019s own political goals and enabling Russian influence on the election.\u201d\n\nAdded Renato Mariotti, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago: \u201cHe could reveal important information to prosecutors, not just about Americans who worked with WikiLeaks to commit crimes, but also about foreign intelligence services that used WikiLeaks to undermine the United States.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "acancryn@politico.com (Adam Cancryn)", "title": "HHS official vows to pursue research 'alternatives' to abortion tissue", "description": "Brett Giroir also portrays HHS as &quot;pro-life and pro-science&quot; under the Trump administration.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/hhs-official-abortion-tissue-alternatives-978007", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/6f/ba/79c73f59418bbb377dfa984e7470/181116-brett-giroir-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:50:40Z", "content": "NIH leaders are concerned Dr. Brett Giroir is committing the agency to a path that is not scientifically workable, given that fetal tissue is the only current option for some researchers studying developmental disorders in children, for instance. | AP Photo/E\u2026 [+4116 chars]", "fulltext": "NIH leaders are concerned Dr. Brett Giroir is committing the agency to a path that is not scientifically workable, given that fetal tissue is the only current option for some researchers studying developmental disorders in children, for instance. | AP Photo/Eric Gay Health Care HHS official vows to pursue research \u2018alternatives\u2019 to aborted fetal tissue\n\nAn HHS official told a key conservative lawmaker Friday the agency seeks to end the use of fetal tissue in taxpayer-funded research if it can find \u201cadequate alternatives\u201d \u2014 advancing the agenda of anti-abortion groups who decry the use of tissue derived from elective abortions for biomedical research.\n\nBrett Giroir, the HHS assistant secretary of health, sent a letter to GOP Rep.

The National Institutes of Health currently funds more than $100 million in research that draws on fetal tissue.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the letter, Giroir \u2014 one of the top officials involved in the agency's ongoing review of fetal tissue research \u2014 says that HHS is \u201cfully committed to prioritizing, expanding, and accelerating efforts to develop and implement the use of these alternatives.\u201d He also portrays HHS as \"pro-life and pro-science\" under the Trump administration and says the agency did too little to find alternatives to fetal tissue under previous administrations. Parts of the letter were shared with POLITICO by a source.\n\nScientists are alarmed by the efforts by anti-abortion groups to stymie such research, maintaining there are few alternatives to fetal tissue, which has been instrumental in developing vaccines and in researching how the Zika virus affects the brains of fetuses in utero, as well as exploring treatments for those afflicted with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s. They say the tissue would otherwise be discarded, and safeguards have been in place to ensure it is obtained and used ethically.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The draft defines alternatives as \u201cmodels that are scientifically validated and reproducible in multiple conditions and by multiple investigators.\u201d\n\nHHS spokesperson Caitlin Oakley said the agency has not made a formal determination on whether to continue to fund fetal tissue research. \u201cWe continue to go through a thoughtful, deliberative process given the scientific ethical and moral considerations involved,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we receive inquiries from members of Congress, we respond.\u201d\n\nEnding the use of fetal tissue from abortions in government-funded research is a longtime goal of anti-abortion groups, which criticized HHS after videos surfaced in 2015 purportedly showing Planned Parenthood officials profiting from the sale of fetal tissue, and have lobbied the Trump administration to end government support. Planned Parenthood said the videos were edited to be intentionally misleading, and a Texas grand jury subsequently cleared the organization of any wrongdoing.\n\n\"[W]e will continue to advocate for cutting off funding for this research as soon as possible and are hopeful that HHS will reach a new policy consensus that better reflects the administration\u2019s pro-life position,\" Mallory Quigley of Susan B.

NIH did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has already canceled one small FDA contract, citing concerns the contract\u2019s language didn\u2019t meet federal procurement rules, although the language was little changed from previous years when it had been renewed.

That result is no shock to election experts who note that Nelson has to win all of his court cases \u2014 which he isn\u2019t doing \u2014 and has to somehow defy history by overcoming such a large margin.\n\nAs the manual recounts wrap up \u2014 with preliminary reports indicating no major change and no newly found batch of Democratic votes \u2014 Nelson\u2019s path narrowed even more Friday. The manual recounts are supposed to finish by Sunday, and the race is scheduled to be certified on Tuesday, Nov. 20.\n\nStill, Elias told reporters in a conference call Thursday that Nelson\u2019s win was possible, given a number of circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been our view that there is going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in this race,\u201d Elias said. \u201cIf you look at each stage where the margin has shrunk, it has not shrunk because of one big thing, but rather it has shrunk from a number of smaller things.\n\n\u201cSo as we move forward, I continue to expect that 12,500 margin to go down and ultimately disappear entirely due to a variety of factors,\u201d he added, underestimating Nelson\u2019s deficit by 603 votes.\n\nElias listed three factors he said could sway the race in Nelson\u2019s favor: the signature mismatch lawsuit that has already been decided, another legal contest about ballots that were cast before Election Day and mailed but have not been delivered or counted, and the manual recount.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign said Elias\u2019 optimism is misplaced.\n\n\u201cBill Nelson has served the country and the state of Florida for decades. But his D.C. lawyers don\u2019t care about his legacy,\u201d Scott spokesperson Chris Hartline said. \u201cAll they care about is changing Florida\u2019s election laws ahead of the 2020 presidential race. With the hand recount concluding in most counties across the state showing no significant change in the margin, it\u2019s time for Bill Nelson to face reality and concede.\u201d\n\nFederal Judge Mark Walker did rule in favor of Nelson in the signature mismatch case \u2014 in which the signature of voters casting absentee and provisional ballots don\u2019t match the signature on file \u2014 but the judge did not go along with the Democrat\u2019s motion to automatically count all those ballots.\n\nInstead, the ruling and a subsequent opinion from an appeals court dictated that all of those voters would have to proactively find their county election supervisor by 5 p.m. Saturday and sign a sworn affidavit attesting to the fact that they cast those ballots. Additionally, the ruling only applies to those notified of a mismatch after Nov. 1.\n\nAnd the total pool of voters to whom that decision applies \u2014 about 5,000 \u2013 is not enough for Nelson, whose campaign is struggling to find the voters after Judge Walker rejected his effort to force the state to cough up their identities to make it easier to find them. Nelson also lost a bid to delay the recount deadlines but is suing in state court to mandate the hand recounting of all of Palm Beach County\u2019s 588,598 ballots after a major tabulating machine and recount malfunction.\n\nA ruling in the absentee ballot deadline case is pending. It\u2019s unclear how many ballots were postmarked before Election Day but were received by election supervisors throughout the state after 7 p.m. on Election Day, thereby rendering them invalid under a Florida law that Nelson is challenging.\n\nIn a related loss for Nelson, Walker also rejected a League of Women Voters lawsuit that sought to force the recusal of Scott from presiding over the recount because of his conflict of interest as both governor and candidate amid his baseless claims about \u201crampant voter fraud.\u201d\n\nWalker, though, did excoriate Scott for his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThis Court recognizes the demarcation between typical campaign-trail puffery and the words and actions of a public official acting in an official capacity. While campaign-trail rhetoric is increasingly bombastic, imprudent, and not necessarily rooted in objective facts, there is a critical line between campaign rhetoric and that rhetoric transforming into state action that requires judicially imposed recusal,\u201d Walker ruled.\n\n\u201cHere, Scott has toed the line between imprudent campaign-trail rhetoric and problematic state action,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cBut he has not crossed the line.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "gross@politico.com (Garrett Ross)", "title": "POLITICO Playbook PM: Acosta \u2018back to work\u2019 at White House as court case continues", "description": "And Nancy Pelosi meets with Rep.

Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) told POLITICO in an interview.\n\nAdjusting the deal is a tall order.\n\nThe countries are expected to sign the agreement on Nov. 30 at a G-20 summit in Argentina, the day before the current Mexican administration leaves office. The easiest way for the administration to address the conservatives\u2019 concerns is to persuade Canada and Mexico to change the language before the agreement is signed. If those countries balk and the administration is concerned about having enough Republican votes to win approval, it could attempt to negate the language through the implementing bill. But that would be highly unusual and give many Democrats another reason to vote against the legislation.\n\nTweaks can be made through so-called side letters. But this particular demand is certain to leave Canada especially cold.\n\nLamborn said his understanding is that the administration could seek to alter the language without opening the deal back up. But \"if it\u2019s bad enough \u2014 and in my opinion it\u2019s bad enough \u2014 they should consider taking it out,\" he said. \"At this point I\u2019m a 'no' vote and I would encourage others to be a no vote unless something is done. And things could be done within the agreement.\"\n\nThe LGBT provisions were a Canadian priority \u2014 part of the so-called progressive trade agenda championed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and described as a \u201cbig win\u201d by his government. And the Trudeau government already is less than enthusiastic about entering the agreement while steel tariffs remain in place. Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington joked in a recent interview with POLITICO that the country might sign the pact with a \u201cbag over its head.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the LGBT clauses even have real teeth. Both Canada and the U.S. agree it wouldn\u2019t require a new law.\n\nBut it\u2019s unprecedented language in a U.S. trade agreement.\n\nUSMCA\u2019s Chapter 23 on labor requires countries to implement policies that protect workers against employment discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. Another provision in the same chapter requires countries to promote workplace equality with respect to gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nThe conservatives say this would undo other administration policies.\n\nThe letter argues that USMCA contradicts other administration work on sexual orientation and gender identity, and would also make it impossible to end a pair of executive actions from the Obama administration forbidding workplace discrimination.\n\nIt accuses the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative of working against administration policies.\n\nIn reality, the federal government is somewhat divided about whether employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a question that turns on how judges interpret the word \u201csex\u201d (one of the law\u2019s protected classes, along with race, religion, and national origin).\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the Justice Department said that \u201csex\u201d included sexual orientation and gender identity, and that discrimination on those bases was therefore illegal. After Trump was elected and Jeff Sessions became attorney general, the department reverted to the position that the 1964 law did not bar discrimination against LGBT individuals. In addition, the Justice and Education departments, in a two-page guidance letter to schools, scrapped an Obama directive aimed at protecting the rights of transgender students.\n\nBut the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which continues to retain a Democratic majority, still adheres to the Obama policy that the Civil Rights Act outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Federal appeals courts are split on the question, and the Supreme Court has never taken up the matter.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump issued orders to ban transgender troops who require surgery or significant medical treatment from serving in the military except in select cases \u2014 following through on a pledge under review by the Pentagon that is being fought out in the courts.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply troubling,\u201d the letter says, that the U.S. Trade Representative has approved language that contradicts LGBT policies in the departments of Justice and Health and Human Services. USTR did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe letter is otherwise supportive of Trump\u2019s trade efforts. It begins with praise: \u201cWe applaud your hard work to negotiate a new trilateral free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Balancing the competing interests of three different countries is a monumental challenge.\u201d\n\nDoug Palmer contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "aadragna@politico.com (Anthony Adragna)", "title": "Climate protesters storm Pallone's office", "description": "This week\u2019s actions are just the beginning of their efforts to build support for the Green New Deal, according to the activists.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/climate-protesters-storm-pallone-office-978185", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/bc/52/0b6252a4409e8f203beb706e3631/181116-frank-pallone-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:36:43Z", "content": "Rep.

At a protest earlier this week at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, 51 demonstrators were arrested.\n\nPallone has been at odds with other Democrats this week over Pelosi\u2019s plan to revive a select panel on climate change. He argues his committee \u2014 and others of jurisdiction \u2014 are best-positioned to move swiftly on climate legislation and adding another panel would add bureaucratic hurdles to crafting bold bills.\n\nJoining Pallone in a nearly 20-minute discussion with protesters was Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), who told POLITICO afterwards she happened to have a meeting scheduled with the New Jersey Democrat at the same time.\n\n\u201cI think you think we don\u2019t agree with you. We do,\u201d she told the youth activists from the Sunrise Movement. \u201cI don\u2019t think you realize you\u2019re preaching to the choir, but it\u2019s music to my ears.\u201d\n\nProtesters said they felt energized after speaking with Pallone, but they urged him to pledge not to take any fossil fuel money. He has received nearly $100,000 from electric utilities and more than $44,000 from other energy interests, according to Opensecrets. Pallone did not sign their pledge Friday but committed to reviewing it.\n\nThis week\u2019s actions are just the beginning of their efforts to build support for the Green New Deal, according to the activists. They said Ocasio-Cortez was \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to lead the charge in Congress and they would organize \u201creally, really hard\u201d to defeat Democrats not ready to move aggressively on the problem.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "dstrauss@politico.com (Daniel Strauss)", "title": "Booker to campaign for Espy in Mississippi Senate race", "description": "It will be the potential 2020 presidential candidate's second trip to camping for Espy.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/cory-booker-mississippi-epsy-2018-996717", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/81/1d/d73d2a494ce88a9e49c2267113a7/181-113-booker-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:35:27Z", "content": "Sen.

I think the biggest issue that we discussed was the feeling in the caucus of people who are feeling left out and left behind.\"\n\nIn an interview before she met with Pelosi, Fudge said an offer by Pelosi to limit her time as speaker \u2014 to, say, one term \u2014 could win her and other Democratic rebels over.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Pelosi allies have been trying to convince the New Jersey Democrat to vote \u201cpresent\u201d instead of opposing Pelosi on the House floor, according to multiple sources on both sides of the fight.\n\nA present vote \u2014 while not directly in support of Pelosi \u2014 would lower the threshold for a majority on the floor, making it easier for Pelosi to win. Sherrill could tell supporters she kept her vow not to support Pelosi but not block her from getting the speaker's gavel. Sherrill wouldn't say whether she still intends to vote against Pelosi and walked into a members-only room where reporters were not allowed.\n\nBut Rose emerged from his meeting vowing to continue to oppose Pelosi.\n\nRose said the session was \u201cextraordinarily civil\u201d and that Pelosi did not ask him to change his mind. Rose said they used their time together to discuss issues important to his district, including transportation needs and help with the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cI have been so consistent and clear, and I haven\u2019t played games with my position; it allows her to fill the discussion,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThe only thing she offered me was a can of Coke. There was no grand offers made. No drama.\u201d\n\nAnti-Pelosi rebels including Rose have been circulating a letter that now includes 20 incumbents and members-elect indicating they won't vote for Pelosi on the floor, a number large enough that it would prevent her ascension to the speaker's chair and plunge the Democratic Caucus into chaos just as the party returns to power in the House.\n\nThe insurgents' threat \u2014 and Pelosi's inability so far to win them over \u2014 has turned into a serious problem for the longtime Democratic leader. Pelosi has sat atop the House Democratic Caucus since 2002.\n\nFudge has not formally announced her candidacy. But even floating herself as a potential speaker challenger has scrambled Pelosi's effort to lock down the 218 votes needed to win. Fudge would be the first black woman in leadership and first African-American speaker.\n\nFudge repeatedly said on Friday that Pelosi doesn't have the votes to win a speakership fight on the floor, stating \"If the vote were taken today, she does not have the votes to be speaker of the House. I don\u2019t think I do, either, right now.\"\n\nPrior to her meeting with Pelosi, Fudge suggested she might take a few weeks to decide whether to run. Democrats are set to nominate a speaker in a closed-door caucus meeting on Nov. 28, after they return from the Thanksgiving Day recess.\n\nBut while many expected that Fudge would want to be on the ballot for that vote, Fudge said she could wait to announce her bid until after Pelosi likely wins the Democratic nomination. Pelosi needs support from only half the Democratic Caucus for that vote. The more difficult test is on Jan. 3 on the House floor, where 218 votes \u2014 or a majority of those members present and voting \u2014 are required and Pelosi has little room for error.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even sleep, my phone is going off so much, not just from people within this institution but people outside of this institution who are excited about the possibility of change in the leadership,\" Fudge said. \"I\u2019m hearing it from lobbyists, from labor, from tons and tons of people, and so there\u2019s a great deal of hope and excitement about the fact that there could be new leadership.\u201d\n\nShould Pelosi fail to get the votes, however, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Assistant Minority Leader Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) are expected to jump into the race for speaker, among others. Asked about her chances going up against both men, Fudge took a shot at them for being too afraid to challenge Pelosi themselves.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what I think. \u2026 None of them had the courage to do what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she said sternly.\n\nWith her opponents continuing to work against Pelosi, the California Democrat's allies are hitting back in her defense.\n\nIllinois Rep.

But the six remaining states where Medicaid could be expanded through the ballot are on the group's radar: Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThis past election teaches us that this can be passed anywhere,\u201d said Dave Regan, president of the UHW, which represents 100,000 nurses and other caregivers in California and provided most of the funding for the expansion campaigns in Nebraska, Idaho and Utah this year and Maine last year. \u201cWe\u2019d love to do it everywhere. That\u2019s ultimately the goal.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the Fairness Project, the progressive advocacy group the UHW created in 2015 to spearhead these and other ballot campaigns, said this year\u2019s health care-fueled blue wave marked a turning point for the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and Medicaid expansion in particular.\n\nStill, many of the biggest states that have refused Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion for low-income adults, including Texas and Georgia, are legally barred from putting the question directly to voters. And many Republican leaders remain staunchly opposed to the program.\n\nIn Wisconsin, where Democrat Tony Evers toppled Gov. Scott Walker after campaigning on Medicaid expansion, GOP lawmakers are vowing to block the program. In Georgia, where the governor\u2019s race remains undecided, Republican Brian Kemp routinely rails against it as an unaffordable \u201cgovernment takeover of health care.\u201d Oklahoma Gov.-elect Kevin Sitt opposes expansion and is calling for cuts to the state's existing program, which is among the stingiest in the nation.\n\nEven in the states that just voted to expand, GOP lawmakers are considering work requirements and other conservative policies that would curtail enrollment.\n\nLawmakers from remaining holdout states also say any campaign sponsored by a California union would face skepticism.\n\n\u201cOklahoma would probably be their most difficult target, because it\u2019s California,\u201d Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said. \u201cNo one has any respect for California and what they have done.

The stigma of union money wasn\u2019t a major obstacle in red states this year, group officials said, where they succeeded in passing several minimum wage hikes in addition to Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cIf you want to accuse us of caring for tens of thousands of people and wanting to get them health care, well, we're guilty of that,\u201d said executive director Jonathan Schleifer.\n\nIn all, the Fairness Project spent $6 million on the three Medicaid campaigns. The group and UHW declined to say how much came from the union, versus small donors, though the UHW says it was a \"major contributor.\"\n\nNow, the Fairness Project is starting conversations with groups in states that may attempt to put the question to voters in 2020. Though officials declined to name the states, progressive advocacy groups in Florida and Oklahoma confirmed to POLITICO they reached out to the Fairness Project asking how to pursue their own expansion ballot measures.\n\n\u201cWhen we see California or Massachusetts do things, we think: \u2018That\u2019s great, that\u2019s good for them, but those lessons don\u2019t translate back here,\u2019\u201d said Carly Putnam, policy director for the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. \u201cBut seeing that everyday Utahns and Nebraskans pulled the lever for Medicaid expansion, in states not known for having robust safety net programs, is really encouraging. We would definitely be interested in working towards this here.\u201d\n\nVicky Neapolitan-Scott, a Pensacola-based social worker and leader of the electoral activist Indivisible chapter in northwest Florida, said she was also inspired by the success of the Medicaid expansion initiatives to reach out to the Fairness Project.\n\n\u201cWatching it pass in Nebraska, Utah and Idaho gave us a lot of hope for getting it passed here,\u201d she said.\n\nIf Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis prevails in the ongoing Florida recount, that would likely take Medicaid expansion off the table for at least four years \u2014 unless voters approve it through the ballot in 2020. Florida ballot standards are tougher than most, since the state requires 60 percent of voters to approve an initiative. But Florida health care advocates say this year\u2019s ballot measure restoring voting rights for 1.4 million ex-felons, which passed with 64 percent support, is a hopeful sign for a Medicaid expansion referendum to cover more than 600,000 in the state.\n\n\u201cIt showed we can get an initiative for a progressive policy on the ballot and make a nonpartisan argument for it,\u201d Neapolitan-Scott said. \u201cI think we could do the same for expansion.\u201d\n\nTo bring Medicaid expansion to other holdout states, the Fairness Project said it wants to use the same battle plan that\u2019s already worked elsewhere. That involves searching for states with the right elements in place, bringing in millions in funding and an army of staffers to conduct polls, gather the signatures to get the question on the ballot and campaign hard for passage. Schleifer, the executive director, emphasized that the collaboration with local groups requires a \u201clong runway\u201d \u2014 beginning at least a year before the election takes place.\n\n\u201cWe look for where there is already a ton of support on the ground, build bipartisan in-state coalitions, and provide the resources they need to get on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we know that good policy ideas and strong grassroots support isn\u2019t always enough to win an election.\u201d\n\nThat was the case in Nebraska, where Democrats in the minority in the state legislature had for years waged a fruitless battle to pass an expansion bill. State Sen. Adam Morfeld, who introduced two failed measures, said he reached out to the Fairness Project last November on the same night Maine voters became the first in the country to approve Medicaid expansion through the ballot.\n\n\u201cThey provided more than a million dollars in seed funding to help collect the signatures, which demonstrated to our local folks on the ground that we were organized and serious and encouraged them to contribute,\u201d Morfeld said.\n\nIn other states, including Utah, the Fairness Project reached out first to make the case.\n\n\u201cAt first we said, \u2018Are you crazy? In Utah we just don\u2019t do ballot initiatives,\u2019\u201d said RyLee Curtis, with the pro-expansion advocacy group Utah Decides Healthcare. \u201cWe were very skeptical at first, because we have one of the highest signature thresholds in the country. But the Fairness Project did early polling specifically on a ballot initiative to show it was possible, finding about 60 percent support.\u201d\n\nIn all three states this year, the Fairness Project poll-tested and deployed an effective \u201chybrid message\u201d that emphasized both Medicaid expansion\u2019s fiscal benefits for state budgets and health benefits for individuals and families. The campaign worked to counter messages from conservative policymakers opposing Medicaid expansion, who have long cautioned it would be an unaffordable entitlement that would crowd out state funding for education and other public priorities.\n\n\u201cWe focused on showing people how their friends and neighbors would benefit,\u201d Schleifer said."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Alex Thompson", "title": "Oprah pal and spirituality guru plans 2020 run", "description": "\u201cWe had a miracle in this country in 1776 and we need another one.&quot;", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/oprah-pal-williamson-2020-run-996174", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/52/d2/87dcd4704668bbb36d8626b83d81/181116-marianne-williamson-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:45:39Z", "content": "During her congressional bid, Marianne Williamson decried what she called Americas permanent war machine, the mass incarceration of people of color, and economic inequality. | Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP Add one more name to the growing list of Democrats \u2026 [+2913 chars]", "fulltext": "During her congressional bid, Marianne Williamson decried what she called America\u2019s \u201cpermanent war machine,\u201d the mass incarceration of people of color, and economic inequality. | Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP 2020 Oprah pal and spirituality guru plans 2020 run\n\nAdd one more name to the growing list of Democrats preparing to run for president in 2020: Marianne Williamson \u2014 pal of Oprah, spirituality guru and fixture of Hollywood's New Age community.\n\nWilliamson, a best-selling author of a dozen books on spirituality including \u201cA Return to Love,\u201d announced on Friday that she's forming a presidential exploratory committee and traveling to Iowa, her fifth trip to the state this year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe had a miracle in this country in 1776 and we need another one,\u201d the Williamson said in a video announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a co-creative effort, an effort of love and a gift of love, to our country and hopefully to our world.\u201d She added that America needs to get \u201cback to an ethical center that is the true exceptionalism of the American ideal.\u201d\n\nWhile the 66-year-old Williamson is not a familiar name inside the Beltway, it is not her first time dabbling in national politics.

But the book is not simply an unloading of grievances on former colleagues. In the book, he also turns self-critical about the role he played in a snake-pit work environment, ultimately attempting to offer a candid view of what it was like on the inside from a position of access to the president, and as a person who took copious notes as part of his job.\n\nSims\u2019 book is not a takedown, \u00e1 la Omarosa Manigault Newman\u2019s \u201cUnhinged,\u201d which was based on secret tape recordings she made of her colleagues while working by their sides, those people said.

The Trump campaign earlier this year sought legal action against Manigault Newman for breaching the agreement through her book.\n\nAnother question Sims will face is whether there is still appetite for more inside-the-room Trump stories from aides who appear to be cashing in as they are heading out. He's also in competition with writers who are still telling the story from the inside out. The journalist Michael Wolff is also working on a sequel to his bestseller \u201cFire & Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\"\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "eschor@politico.com (Elana Schor)", "title": "Grassley to trade Judiciary gavel for Finance", "description": "His departure paves the way for Lindsey Graham to lead Judiciary.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/grassley-finance-committee-996195", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/1e/b2/40f546b3479d95130119958a9ad2/181116-chuck-grassley-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:24:14Z", "content": "Sen.

The judge granted CNN's request for the reporter's access to be temporarily restored while the rest of the case moves forward.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that the administration would temporarily reinstate Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which allows reporters to freely enter and exit the grounds.\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

A group of news organizations, including POLITICO and the White House Correspondents' Association, filed briefs siding with CNN.\n\nKelly said Friday that he was not ruling on whether the White House violated Acosta's First Amendment rights by targeting him for his coverage \u2014 emphasizing what he called \"the very limited nature of today\u2019s ruling\" \u2014 but he said it appeared officials had yanked the reporter's press pass without any advance notice or chance to rebut. The process by which the White House came to its decision was so \u201cshrouded in mystery,\u201d the judge said, that Department of Justice lawyers arguing the case were not even able to say who inside the White House had made the call to pull Acosta\u2019s pass.\n\nKelly also noted the White House\u2019s shifting explanations, highlighting that the administration was no longer relying on its initial justification \u2014 that Acosta had laid hands on an intern, which was disputed by video of the incident \u2014 and that it was only after the lawsuit was filed that the White House fully laid out its argument that Acosta had been banned for disruptive behavior.\n\n\u201cThese belated efforts were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nKelly\u2019s decision Friday does not end the overall case, but it was seen by press advocates as a good sign. One of the standards for granting a temporary restraining order \u2014 as the judge did to restore Acosta\u2019s pass \u2014 is that the underlying case is likely to succeed. Kelly said CNN appeared likely to succeed on Fifth Amendment grounds.\n\n\u201cEven if Judge Kelly did not address the First Amendment issues yet, this is a strong win for CNN and press freedom generally,\u201d said Katie Fallow, a senior attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \u201cThe judge recognized the importance of restoring the reporter's access to the White House immediately and rejected the government's argument that the President has complete discretion whom to allow at press conferences.\"\n\nKelly did not comment directly Friday on the White House's argument that Trump could strip any reporter he chooses of their security pass. But he said he was bound to a ruling in a 1977 D.C. Circuit Court case \u2014 \"whether I agree with it or not\" \u2014 that said the government cannot boot out reporters \"arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons\u201d and must follow a clear process to do it.\n\n\u201cOnce the White House opens\u201d to reporters, Kelly said, the due process protections apply to removing any media. He said he agreed with the administration that there was no First Amendment requirement to keep the White House open to reporters in the first place \u2014 which Sanders noted in her statement about the ruling \u2014 but once any were admitted, the rights exist, Kelly said.\n\n\u201cI simply have no choice,\u201d the judge said.\n\nSpeaking of the president, Kelly said, \u201cCertainly he need not ever call on Mr. Acosta again, but...the government must provide Mr. Acosta due process.\u201d\n\nThe judge said he was giving Acosta back his press pass while the case proceeds because he would be done \"irreparable harm\" if he were deprived of it. \u201cThe court cannot restore\u201d access to missed press conferences or newsworthy events, the judge said.\n\nThe case will resume next week, as Kelly said he expected it to \u201cproceed at a rapid pace.\u201d\n\nAcosta watched the events unfold inside the courtroom but did not react when the judge read his decision. Outside the courtroom, though, a CNN group appeared to pose together for a photo.\n\n\"Let's go back to work,\" Acosta said to reporters assembled outside the courthouse.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "tstarks@politico.com (Tim Starks)", "title": "Assange watch", "description": "Signs of fresh Cozy Bear attacks \u2014 Details out today on DHS supply chain, risk management work", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2018/11/16/assange-watch-417061", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:06:39Z", "content": "With help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak and Christian Vasquez Editor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Cybersecurity is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Cybersecurity subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6\u2026 [+12444 chars]", "fulltext": "Assange watch\n\nWith help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak and Christian Vasquez\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Cybersecurity is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Cybersecurity subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMorning Cybersecurity will not publish Nov. 22 and Nov. 23. The newsletter will resume publishing on Nov. 26.\n\nAPPARENT JULIAN ASSANGE CHARGES \u2014 Late Thursday night, news broke that U.S. prosecutors are preparing to charge WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The Washington Post reported that Assange \u201chas been charged under seal, prosecutors inadvertently revealed in a recently unsealed court filing \u2014 a development that could significantly advance the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and have major implications for those who publish government secrets.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no indication yet what charges Assange may be facing, but special counsel Robert Mueller has been looking into WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of Democratic National Committee emails that U.S. officials believe Russian hackers stole from the DNC and other party operatives, according to the Post. But even if he\u2019s charged, it will be difficult to get Assange to the U.S. to face trial, as he\u2019s currently living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\n\u201cProsecutors have considered publicly indicting Mr. Assange to try to trigger his removal from the embassy,\u201d according to The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that the relationship between Assange and Ecuadorian officials is souring while the country is also looking to improve relations with the U.S.\n\nSoon after the news broke that Assange may be facing charges in the Mueller investigation, WikiLeaks and its backers went on the offensive. \u201cAny prosecution of Mr. Assange for Wikileaks\u2019 publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional, and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations. Moreover, prosecuting a foreign publisher for violating U.S. secrecy laws would set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest,\u201d said Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, in a statement.\n\nAnd WikiLeaks tweeted out an April 2017 Post opinion piece by Assange in which he asserts the motivation of his anti-secrecy organization \u201cis identical to that claimed by the New York Times and The Post \u2014 to publish newsworthy content.\u201d\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

During a federal advisory board meeting earlier this month, NRMC Deputy Director Mark Kneidinger told reporters that DHS would use the Chamber event to discuss the status of the center\u2019s initial \u201csprints,\u201d including the supply chain task force and an industry-led effort to identify cross-sector \u201cnational critical functions.\u201d DHS also planned to discuss the metrics by which it would evaluate the center, Kneidinger said at the time.\n\nExpect some details about the supply chain task force at the Chamber event, co-chair Emile Monette told reporters at the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board meeting on Nov. 1. MC first reported its industry and government members \u2014 including DHS, the Justice Department, the Pentagon and the General Services Administration \u2014 on Thursday, when the group held its first meeting. At that gathering, DHS said, the task force agreed to conduct an \u201cecosystem analysis of existing industry and government supply chain initiatives to identify consensus best practices and concentrate efforts on critical gaps,\u201d to help steer future work.\n\nThe Chamber conference includes opening remarks by DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen; assistant secretary for cybersecurity Jeanette Manfra moderating a supply chain panel with Monette; NRMC Director Robert Kolasky discussing the center\u2019s public-private partnership model; and Chris Krebs, undersecretary in charge of the DHS cyber wing, delivering an afternoon keynote. Then Kneidinger will discuss the center\u2019s cross-sector approach, and Kolasky will moderate a panel on its pipeline cybersecurity initiative. Karen Evans, head of the Energy Department\u2019s new cyber office, will also speak about \u201csystemic risk identification and registration.\u201d\n\nRUSSIA\n\nDID YOU FORGET ABOUT COZY BEAR? \u2014 A Russian hacking group identified by U.S. intelligence agencies as one of the groups that penetrated the DNC in 2016 appears to now be going after the U.S. government and defense industry, according to FireEye. The threat intelligence firm on Thursday tweeted that it had seen spearphishing attempts that have \u201cpossible ties\u201d to APT29, also known as Cozy Bear. \u201cBut attribution is ongoing,\u201d the firm said.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, FireEye said the hackers are casting a wide net. \u201cThis campaign has targeted over 20 FireEye customers across: Defense, Imagery, Law Enforcement, Local Government, Media, Military, Pharmaceutical, Think Tank, Transportation, & US Public Sector industries in multiple geographic regions.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to conclusively attribute these attacks to APT29, there are striking similarities to previous Cozy Bear activities, Nick Carr, a senior manager at FireEye, told MC. \u201cOur attribution and technical analysis of this campaign is ongoing, however there are several shared traits between this activity and the last known APT29 activity, a November 2016 spear phishing campaign that began a day after the U.S. election,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThis new phishing campaign included very creative new elements, interesting post-midterm election timing, and some obvious re-use of previously-reported APT29 tactics, making conclusive attribution difficult at this time.\u201d\n\nThe hackers in the new string of attacks took advantage of an infected hospital and consulting company to send out phishing emails that look like they originated from a public affairs official from the U.S. State Department, said Carr. On victim systems, said Carr, \u201ca weaponized Microsoft shortcut file was used to deliver Cobalt Strike BEACON, a commercially available post-exploitation framework, which was customized by the attacker to blend in with legitimate network traffic.\u201d Carr said that shortcut \u201cwas likely manually modified from the version used in their widespread November 2016 phishing campaign targeting many of the same victims, leaving obvious technical breadcrumbs for researchers to link back to APT29.\u201d\n\nCATCHING UP WITH CALI \u2014 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla renewed his call on Thursday for Washington to give states more election security funding to prepare for 2020. While states know what they should do to better protect the polls, many don\u2019t have enough money to make the necessary changes, he said during a panel discussion on election security hosted by the liberal Center for American Progress.\n\nThe midterms offered the first test for California\u2019s new Office of Elections Cybersecurity. During the election, it informed social media companies about an estimated 300 suspicious posts suspected of spreading disinformation. Padilla told MC that ahead of 2020, he plans to add more social media, communication and monitoring positions to the office. He expects \u201cbetter training, better practices, better habits\u201d for the state\u2019s election workers, noting that bad cyber hygiene can put election systems at risk.\n\nSPEAKING OF ASSANGE \u2014 A group of hackers believed WikiLeaks asked them to penetrate targets and share the results with them, according to newly released documents. Emma Best, who has extensively published chat transcripts involving WikiLeaks, said a leader of LulzSec believed WikiLeaks founder Assange had first suggested, then asked, a hacker going by the name Sabu to go after the corporate intelligence firm Kroll Inc. and others.\n\n\u201cAccording to the transcripts, by the next week Sabu felt that Julian had crossed the line from suggesting to asking,\u201d Best writes. \u201cThese hints and requests do not appear to have been isolated events. Recalling events from that time period, several sources have described Assange and his representatives soliciting others to hack Icelandic targets, as well as critics of WikiLeaks and supporters that Julian didn\u2019t trust.\u201d WikiLeaks did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRETURN TO SENDER \u2014 House Judiciary ranking member Jerry Nadler on Thursday asked the heads of the Justice Department, FBI and DHS to respond to a \u201cbacklog of unanswered questions,\u201d including some on election security. In a letter, Nadler, who is expected to become the panel\u2019s chairman next year, cited POLITICO reports on the Trump administration\u2019s lack of a cohesive plan to combat foreign interference in U.S. elections and repeated warnings from intelligence community leaders about meddling to demand responses to requests he and other lawmakers made during the 115th Congress.\n\n\u201cIn the next Congress, our committee will examine existing vulnerabilities in our election infrastructure, the threats posed to that infrastructure by foreign actors, and any systemic impediments to our voting rights,\u201d Nadler wrote. He asked the agency chiefs to respond by Dec. 31 to a litany of requests \u2014 including a letter from all panel Democrats from last December to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking for a briefing on steps DOJ may have taken to tackle vulnerabilities in the federal election system.\n\nGIVING OUT GREEN TO AVOID A BLACKOUT \u2014 The Energy Department has awarded $7.5 million to four research projects focused on grid security and resiliency, the agency announced Wednesday. \u201cThe selected projects will lead to the next generation of transformers that can be shared and replaced more easily in the event of a failure, are smarter with embedded sensors and analytics, and are more secure to cyber-physical threats,\u201d DOE said in a statement. The four projects explore ways to build better large power transformers. The department noted that most currently deployed LPTs are \u201cnot readily interchangeable with each other\u201d and are \u201capproaching or exceeding their design lives.\u201d\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Federal agencies are publishing a number of regulations today related to ZTE, Kaspersky Lab, contractors and nuclear fuel producers. \u2026 A U.S. judge rejected an attempt by a Russian firm to dismiss charges from special counsel Robert Mueller, who accused the company of having ties to a troll farm. \u2026 The Office of Financial Research counts cybersecurity among the top risks to the financial system. \u2026 The Pentagon will present a $700 billion budget plan to the White House next week, and Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he will try to protect cybersecurity funding. \u2026 Two GOP senators introduced a bill requiring additional credit bureau protection for small businesses after a breach. \u2026 In Senate testimony, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission nominee Bernard McNamee discussed cyber attacks on the electricity grid and supply chain.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 If you\u2019re absent-minded, do not do this.\n\nPEOPLE ON THE MOVE\n\nMerle Maigre, the former director of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, has joined the Hudson Institute as a non-resident fellow.

The bill in question, S. 1885 (115), has been the subject of a drawn-out legislative process. Beyond the political challenges that will arise if lawmakers have to start over next year with a split Congress, testing the industry\u2019s patience risks losing its cooperation altogether. \u201cThe sense I\u2019m getting from the developer community is we\u2019re not interested in doing this again next Congress. It\u2019s been a frustrating couple of years to try to get his over the finish line, a lot of wheels spinning,\u201d Cain said. The alternative could be to focus on DOT's efforts to come up with a framework for regulating autonomous vehicles.\n\nSafety metrics not there yet: DOT is keeping tabs on Waymo's imminent rollout of a commercial self-driving car service in Arizona, and an official warned Thursday that as the technology inches ever closer to viability, there\u2019s still no consensus on how to measure safety. Speaking at the same Bloomberg event, Derek Kan, undersecretary of transportation for policy, wouldn\u2019t comment directly on Waymo. But he said that, in general, \u201cI think where we are at this point in history, is defining how do we measure safety and what are the leading indicators of safety?\u201d Kan also said he hopes that as car companies come closer to deployment, they collaborate more on developing safety metrics, citing confidential meetings that the aviation industry holds to share data.\n\nMADD campaign: Speaking of Waymo, 600 of its cars being tested in Arizona will carry red ribbons from Mothers Against Drunk Driving through the holiday season.

A few, along with CMS Administrator Seema Verma, dropped by a virtual-care themed symposium hosted by lobbying group the Alliance for Connected Care. Here are a few of our takeaways:\n\n\u2014 Rep. Bill Johnson said he plans to advance legislation co-sponsored with Rep. Doris Matsui that could remove geographic and site restrictions on reimbursement for all Medicare codes. A version of that bill passed as part of the opioid package, but it only waives restrictions for care related to substance use disorder.\n\n\u201cThe providers want it, the technology is there,\u201d Johnson said, noting that the major barriers to widespread telehealth access are physician licensing and reimbursement. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason why in Timbuktu, rural Appalachia, you can\u2019t get access to a world-class heart surgeon over telehealth.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2014 a member of House Energy and Commerce who\u2019s also part of the Congressional Telehealth Caucus\u2014plans to examine broadband coverage next session, he said. He said he was encouraged by FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr\u2019s Connected Care pilot program, a nascent concept for a fund that could support remote monitoring programs in rural areas.\n\n\u2014 Rep. Anna Eshoo said Washington decision makers should focus on shrinking the gap between telemedicine coverage on Medicare Advantage plans and the original fee-for-service model.\n\nEshoo, a member of Energy and Commerce\u2019s telecommunications subcommittee, also plans to work on increasing broadband connectivity; she introduced a bill this year mandating that broadband conduit pipes should be laid on roads and highways built on federal lands as they\u2019re being built.\n\nShe noted that telemedicine advocates on Energy and Commerce who represent rural districts across the country will have \u201creal opportunities on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a member of the Commerce Committee and its telecommunications subcommittee, also plans to prioritize broadband deployment. Last year he introduced the SPEED Act, which would expedite the permitting for that process, along with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, though the measure stalled in the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\neHealth Tweet thread of the day: Austin Frakt @afrakt This has never happened to me before. I emailed an author of a paper for background/comment. No reply. I emailed a different author of that paper. Also no reply. Not saying people have to respond, but not doing so is a great way to make sure nobody knows about you/your paper.\n\nThis doesn't bother me as \"something of a journalist\". It bothers me as a researcher who cares about dissemination. It's a case study in how not to do it, again unless your goal is obscurity (which is fine, it just doesn't scale well ... for the community).\n\nBy which I mean, we, as a community, have to be communicating what research is about/for if we expect funding and support.\n\nIt\u2019s FRIDAY at Morning eHealth.

Reach the rest of the team at @arthurallen202, @dariustahir, @ravindranize, @POLITICOPro and @Morning_eHealth.\n\n... Back at the Alliance for Connected Care, Verma said her agency is thinking of ways to accommodate a large and very tech savvy population of senior citizens; expanding coverage of virtual check-ins is just one such strategy. She noted that she tested out a driverless car on a recent trip to California, which got her thinking about how automation could play into the delivery of care. \u201cAs we\u2019re serving older individuals, disabled individuals...the technology that wasn\u2019t designed for them specifically could be applied.\u201d\n\nSmartwatches might be part of that ecosystem too; she mused that her husband\u2019s cardiac arrest in the Philadelphia airport last year could have been prevented or predicted with a smartwatch passively measuring pulses.\n\nShe also said that CMS was planning new features for its eMedicare program, an online system designed to guide beneficiaries through the selection process.\n\nREPORT: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u2019S PLANS FOR VA PRIVATIZATION: The Trump administration is intent on elevating private sector health options for veterans, Pro Publica\u2019s Isaac Arnsdorf reports. In January, Trump\u2019s team plans to unveil a proposal that could further push veterans to see private doctors.\n\nPrivatization has been a touchy topic for VA officials; in a New York Times op-ed published the week he was fired, former VA Secretary David Shulkin said the Trump administration saw him as an \u201cobstacle to privatization who had to be removed.\u201d\n\nBROADBAND LEADERSHIP UPDATES: Wicker, who has said he wants to take over the full Senate Commerce Committee, could decide to put Sen. John Thune in charge of the telecommunications subcommittee, our POLITICO colleague John Hendel reports.\n\nThune told POLITICO earlier this week that he was deciding between making a bid for the telecom panel or the Commerce surface transportation subcommittee, saying \"both are of great interest to me.\u201d\n\nThe decision to go with telecom means that Thune \u2014 who will step down as chairman of the full Commerce Committee next year after being elected GOP whip \u2014 will likely stay involved in debates ranging from 5G wireless to data privacy to rules governing the media marketplace.\n\nOne factor driving Thune's telecom interest is the upcoming process to reauthorize satellite TV legislation, which is set to expire at the end of 2019. That process, which typically happens every five years, has been viewed as must-pass legislation, although the broadcast industry is lobbying Congress to let the statute expire.\n\n...Over at the FCC, Chairman Ajit Pai said today he intends to stay on as head of the agency as newly empowered House Democrats pledge rigorous oversight of his leadership, our colleague Margaret Harding McGill reports. In October, ahead of the midterm elections, Pai sidestepped a question about his future when asked what he would do if Democrats won the House.\n\nAMIA URGES TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ALIGN HEALTH AND CONSUMER PRIVACY: The American Medical Informatics Association says Washington officials should \u201charmonize\u201d data privacy policies within the health and consumer sectors. In response to a request from information from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration on protecting consumer privacy, AMIA pointed out that varying interpretations of HIPAA have led to confusion, and that some health-related technologies actually fall outside the patchwork of HIPAA, Federal Trade Commission regulations and state laws. \u201c[T]he administration should consider developing an ethical framework around the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of the personal information consumers may provide to organizations,\u201d they wrote.\n\nICYMI \u2014 AI AND OUTCOME PREDICTION: A CMS effort to get data scientists talking about how artificial intelligence can help predict clinical outcomes and aid new quality measures appears to be underway. Verma hinted at that effort at the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network summit earlier this year (skip to the 4:58 mark.)\n\nWHAT WE'RE CLICKING\n\n\u2014 NPR reports on Nebula Genetics, which could pay patients for their genetic sequence data\n\n\u2014 MedCityNews reports on CloudMine\u2019s bankruptcy"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "rrainey@politico.com (Rebecca Rainey)", "title": "Remember the caravan?", "description": "More on vacancies \u2014 PBGC nominee advances", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-shift/2018/11/16/remember-the-caravan-416998", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:00:12Z", "content": "PROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Shift will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22 and Friday, Nov. 23 Our next Morning Shift newsletter will publish on Monday, Nov. 26.

You may not have heard because, now that midterms are over, President Donald Trump no longer talks about them much. \u201cSince November 6,\u201d Chris Cillizza noted Wednesday, \u201cTrump hasn't mentioned the so-called caravan once in a tweet. He has used the word \u2018border\u2019 a single time.\u201d\n\nThe press isn\u2019t paying as much attention, either. The video-monitoring service Grabien told TheWrap that in the week leading up to election day, the word \u201ccaravan\u201d was said 1,202 times on Fox News, 834 times on CNN, and 586 times on MSNBC. The week after, the word was only uttered 203 times on Fox, 75 times on CNN, and 110 times on MSNBC. The New York Times and The Washington Post also published 84 stories covering the caravan in the eight days before the election, according to data from Media Matters that was reported by MSNBC. In the eight days after, they published just 39.\n\nThe migrants began arriving in Tijuana by bus earlier this week and quickly overwhelmed the city\u2019s shelters, according to the AP\u2019s Elliot Spagat. \u201cFrancisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months in Mexico at current processing rates,\u201d Spagat writes.

If the nominees for these positions aren\u2019t confirmed by the time Congress breaks for the holidays they\u2019ll have to start the nomination process all over again. Here are a few we missed:\n\nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training. John Lowry\u2019s nomination was sent by president in April and placed on the Senate Calendar in June. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Matt Miller has been serving as acting assistant secretary..\n\nCommissioner of Labor Statistics (BLS chief). William Beach was nominated last year, wasn\u2019t confirmed, then was renominated in January. Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski is serving as acting commissioner.\n\nThe Office of Disability Employment Policy, we mentioned yesterday, lacks a permanent chief, but we neglected to mention that in the meantime Deputy Assistant Secretary Jennifer Sheehy is running it.\n\nPBGC NOMINEE ADVANCES: The Senate Finance Committee on Thursday overwhelmingly approved Mitch McConnell\u2019s brother-in-law, Gordon Hartogensis, to lead the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, POLITICO\u2019s Ian Kullgren reports. Hartogensis\u2018 nomination now heads to the Senate floor, where he\u2019s expected to be confirmed before Congress packs its bags. More for Pros here.\n\nAT THE BORDER\n\nTHE REAL WALL COST: Even as lawmakers do battle over how much they\u2019re willing to spend on President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, a new Dartmouth-Stanford study looked at the job impact of constructing 548 miles of fencing along the border in 2007-2010. The researchers found that the resultant alteration of migration flows cost the average college educated U.S. worker $4.35 in annual income and increased annual income for the average less-educated U.S. worker by 36 cents.\n\nIf the U.S. were to fence the remaining 50 percent of the border, the researches projected that the average less-educated worker would gain 58 cents in annual income while the average college-educated worker would lose $7.60. The president boosted his budget request earlier this year to $2.2 billion to construct 65 miles of border wall in south Texas. But Trump may not get even the original $1.6 billion he asked for in February. Read a press release about the study here.\n\nTRADE PARADE\n\nNEW NAFTA IN TROUBLE?: \u201cThe AFL-CIO remains unconvinced that the new NAFTA's labor standards will be enforceable,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Megan Cassella reports, \u201cor go far enough to make a \u2018meaningful difference\u2019 for the working families they aim to benefit, its top trade official said Thursday.\u201d Celeste Drake, trade and globalization specialist at the federation, told the U.S. International Trade Commission that the new USMCA takes steps in the right direction, but \u201cif the commission simply assumes that \u2018words on the page\u2019 are sufficient to transform Mexico\u2019s repressive labor regime, it will make a grave error,\u201d she said.\n\nThe future of the deal may depend on the federation\u2019s approval. \u201cWe urge the commission to make clear that if the obligations are not enforced, the lure of cheap and easy labor exploitation in Mexico will continue to draw production and hold down wages in both countries,\u201d Drake said. More from POLITICO here.\n\nA SECOND CHANCE AT ASYLUM: A federal judge on Thursday approved a settlement agreement that will give parents who failed an asylum screening after being separated at the border another shot at applying for asylum, POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson reports. U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw, who is based in San Diego, said during a court hearing that the settlement was \u201cnot perfect but we are dealing with a situation that is far from perfect.\u201d More here.\n\nDIVERSITY DATA DISCLOSED: \u201cFederal labor officials have decided to reverse their longtime policy and release diversity numbers for government contractors such as Oracle and Palantir Technologies in response to a lawsuit filed by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting,\u201d the center reported Thursday. Five companies \u2013 Oracle, Palantir, Pandora Media, Gilead Sciences and Splunk \u2013 objected to the Reveal Center\u2019s requests, \u201cclaiming that the diversity data is a trade secret,\u201d Will Evans and Sinduja Rangarajan write. DOL initially agreed with the companies, then changed its mind and notified the companies on Oct. 30 that it will disclose their diversity numbers. \u201cThe companies have until Nov. 19 to take legal action to stop the release of the data.\u201d More here.\n\nDISCRIMINATION INQUIRIES INCREASE: The EEOC said Thursday in an annual performance report that over the past fiscal year (which ended in September) it\u2019s seen a 30 percent increase in discrimination inquiries and that during that period it granted $505 million and other relief to more than 67,860 victims of discrimination in the workplace. The agency also said that it reduced its backlog of discrimination charges in the private sector by 19.5 percent and its backlog of federal employee appeals by 19.4 percent.

Lawrence, the department's undersecretary for benefits.\n\n\u2014 A big impediment is that the VA hasn\u2019t been able to meet a requirement in a law passed last year, H.R. 3218 (115), that changed how a recipient\u2019s housing allowance is calculated because of IT problems. The change was supposed to go into place on Aug. 1.\n\n\u2014 Because it wasn't ready, the VA went ahead and calculated fall housing payments based on the old law, but said it would later reprocess the fall claims as needed once the new system is ready. But VA officials testified that they don\u2019t have a projected release date yet because testing continues. Meanwhile, many GI Bill recipients continue to receive the wrong housing allowance amount \u2014 although VA officials have said those being overpaid won\u2019t have to pay it back.\n\n\u2014 Member after member on the House Veterans' Affairs Economic Opportunity Subcommittee expressed exasperation that the VA didn\u2019t warn lawmakers earlier about the potential problems. They wanted to know how much the problem is costing taxpayers. They also questioned how the VA will be able to handle the claims load when the fall claims are reprocessed.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWe have no earthly idea when this is going to be ready,\u201d said Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the committee.\n\n\u2014 Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), the chairman of the subcommittee, said someone at the VA needs to be held accountable for IT problems that have plagued this program and others at the agency. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a leadership issue,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of strategic management. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real plan for the IT architecture of this agency.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Robert Worley, the VA\u2019s education service director, said any student veterans experiencing a hardship can request expedited processing. Although more than 10,000 recipients have a claim that\u2019s between 30 and 60 days old, Worley said the current workload as the semester wraps up is at a manageable level despite the backlog throughout the fall.\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY, NOV. 16.

And follow us on Twitter: @Morning_Edu and @POLITICOPro.\n\nSchool Safety\n\nTHE FATE OF OBAMA\u2019S SCHOOL DISCIPLINE DIRECTIVE: The Trump administration in recent months has been planning to do away with controversial Obama-era school discipline guidelines in conjunction with the release of a long-awaited school safety report, two people familiar with the report have told POLITICO. That was the plan as of earlier this fall, according to the individuals, who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Caitlin Emma has more.\n\n\u2014 A department spokesperson wouldn't confirm that will be the outcome. \u201cThe Federal Commission on School Safety has studied this topic extensively and will make a recommendation on it in its final report,\u201d Liz Hill said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Education advocates have anticipated the rescission of the Obama-era discipline directive. After the Valentine's Day school shooting in Parkland, Fla., the Trump administration launched the Federal Commission on School Safety and asked it to consider whether the directive should be scrapped, in addition to making other recommendations on school safety.\n\n\u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos chairs the commission, which is expected to detail its recommendations in a report and rescind the school discipline guidelines by the end of the year.\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION\n\nBUCKLE UP: The Trump administration this morning is expected to unveil its proposed overhaul of rules for schools handling allegations of sexual harassment and assault. The long-awaited proposal is almost certain to spark a firestorm, as DeVos\u2019 decision to write new regulations under Title IX has been among her most controversial actions in office.\n\nCOLLEGE BOARD\u2019S \u2018DASHBOARD\u2019 GOES BEYOND TEST SCORES: David Coleman, the president of the College Board, surprised many at a veterans\u2019 education conference in Arlington, Va., this week when he bluntly said that for too long the College Board didn\u2019t say clearly that \u201cthere are a lot of amazing people with low SAT scores.\u201d\n\n\u2014 While the College Board has long encouraged holistic admissions, it hasn\u2019t done enough to provide tools to help colleges identify talented students beyond test scores, Coleman said. (Read more from your host about his comments.)\n\n\u2014 A big part of the College Board\u2019s push to change that is the creation of a dashboard, which is being piloted at some colleges, that\u2019s designed to help admissions officers consider SAT scores and grades in the context of a student\u2019s neighborhood and high school.\n\n\u2014 But how exactly does it work? The College Board provided Morning Education these details about what it\u2019s calling the \u201cEnvironmental Context Dashboard\u201d \u2014 or ECD. It says that a student\u2019s SAT score is presented in the context of the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of SAT scores from the student\u2019s high school.\n\n\u2014 Race is not included. But admissions officers are able to access information on the prospective student\u2019s high school, such as the senior class size, percentage of students eligible for free and reduced-price lunch, and number of AP courses. Indicators about the applicant\u2019s home neighborhood and high school \u2014 like housing stability and family income \u2014 are also included.\n\n\u2014 The College Board said an experimental field study found that after readers were given the dashboard, more disadvantaged applicants were more likely to be admitted.\n\n\u2014 Fifteen colleges participated in the pilot in the 2017-18 school year, and about 50 are doing so this school year. A College Board spokesperson said the organization hopes to make the dashboard broadly available in fall 2019.\n\nRUTGERS REVERSES RULING ON CONTROVERSIAL FACEBOOK POSTS: After being accused of caving to an \u201cinternet mob,\u201d Rutgers University has reversed a ruling that history professor James Livingston was guilty of violating its anti-harassment policy when he wrote posts on Facebook complaining about gentrification. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group, sided with Livingston and complained to the university in August and Rutgers President Robert Barchi ordered a reevaluation of the initial ruling.\n\n\u2014 Notably, the school found that: \u201cNo student or university employee has come forward to assert that Professor Livingston has in some way penalized them for their race. This is the case even after Professor Livingston has been teaching for several months after making his Facebook posts. There is no evidence that he administered grades and conducted himself in class in a manner that reveals any racial bias on his part.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Livingston wrote on Facebook in May: \"OK, officially, I now hate white people. I am a white people, for God's sake, but can we keep them-us-us out of my neighborhood?\" In another post, he wrote, \"I just don't want little Caucasians overrunning my life ... remand them to the suburbs, where they and their parents can colonize every restaurant.\" The posts quickly drew the attention of the conservative website The Daily Caller, as well as local and national news outlets. Livingston reported to the university that he started receiving hate mail and death threats.\n\nDEVOS TODAY\n\nDEVOS TO ADDRESS ASSESSMENT BOARD: DeVos will administer the oath of office this morning to Beverly Perdue, a former Democratic governor of North Carolina who takes over as chair of the National Assessment Governing Board. DeVos will also make remarks before the board during its meeting in Washington, according to the agenda. The nonpartisan board sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The meeting starts at 8:30 a.m.\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n\u2014 A new report by the Pew Research Center finds that the \u201cpost-millennial\u201d generation is the most racially and ethnically diverse in the country. They are also enrolling in college at a much higher rate than millennials were at a comparable age.

Our next Morning Ag installment will publish on Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nIN THE HOPPER: House and Senate agriculture leaders expressed optimism Thursday that a farm bill deal is close, a marked change in tone from the finger-pointing of earlier this week.\n\n\u2014 The latest on USDA\u2019s efforts to solve sexual harassment problems: A congressional hearing shed light on how the U.S. Forest Service continues to reckon with its alleged culture of sexual harassment and retaliation.\n\n\u2014 The trade news never stops: U.S. pork exports are getting smacked in two top overseas markets, new USDA data shows. Today is Day 2 of the U.S. International Trade Commission\u2019s hearings on the new North American trade deal.\n\n\u2014 What Mick has in mind: POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia report that OMB chief Mick Mulvaney has told allies and other officials he\u2019s interested in succeeding Wilbur Ross, if the Commerce secretary exits in an expected Cabinet shakeup.\n\nSEXUAL MISCONDUCT PERSISTS AT FOREST SERVICE: New details emerged Thursday about misconduct allegations that led former U.S. Forest Service Chief Tony Tooke to resign in March. Shannon Reed said during a House Oversight Committee hearing that she believes she was fired last month from her post as an air quality specialist as a reprisal for reporting allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Tooke and another supervisor, Pro Ag\u2019s Catherine Boudreau reports.\n\nThe allegations: Reed alleged Tooke groped her buttocks during an October 2016 orientation for new employees, and that other employees witnessed it. Two other female Forest Service employees told her they had had improper sexual relationships with Tooke when he led the Forest Service\u2019s Region 8. Reed didn\u2019t report the allegation until March because of her fear of retaliation, she said.\n\nThe agency\u2019s response: The new Forest Service chief, Vicki Christiansen, testified Thursday that she\u2019s committed to ushering in a culture change at the agency. She listed a number of changes, including a \u201ctighter\u201d anti-harassment policy, the hiring of outside investigators to guard against bias when handling sexual misconduct allegations, and plans to update internal procedures so complaints are handled faster.\n\nWhistleblowers say the agency\u2019s efforts fall short: Reed characterized the Forest Service\u2019s policy changes as \u201cmerely a check-in-the-box process,\u201d because gender discrimination, sexual harassment and assault, and retaliation against those who complain persist.\n\nA new letter: Reed and 59 other current and former female Forest Service employees sent a letter to Christiansen last week. They said the agency \u201cattempted a coverup\u201d by making it appear as if Tooke had just one consensual relationship that had been addressed years prior. \u201cWe have evidence this was a fabrication of the truth,\u201d the letter said.\n\nCummings promises legislation: Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who will chair the Oversight Committee in the next Congress, said he plans to develop legislation that would include ways to measure the Forest Service\u2019s progress and increase transparency, while protecting victims\u2019 privacy.\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY, NOV. 16! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host is seeking pie recipes. Have news or pie crust tips to share? Send \u2018em to hbottemiller@politico.com and @hbottemiller, and follow the whole team @Morning_Ag.\n\nFARM BILL COMPROMISE TAKING SHAPE: As House and Senate agriculture leaders on Thursday stopped publicly casting blame for the lack of a farm bill deal, the chairmen of the two panels both said they\u2019re close to reaching a deal. The nutrition title that is being negotiated \u2014 one of the major sources of controversy \u2014 would blend Senate and House proposals, lawmakers said. Both sides were tight-lipped about any details.\n\nHow about Monday? Other unresolved issues include the conservation title and regulatory language, lawmakers said, as talks remain fluid. \u201cThere are a few things, but we're darn close,\u201d said House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway. Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts said he\u2019s hoping a deal will come together by Monday.\n\nNew analysis of House SNAP changes: Mathematica Policy Research released a new study Thursday that found as many as 1.1 million households would see a cut in their SNAP benefit levels under the House farm bill, H.R. 2 (115). But the analysis also found that benefits would go up for roughly a fifth of SNAP households (4 million households). The analysis is here.\n\nCalendar check: As of today, there are just 12 joint legislative days remaining in the lame-duck, though it\u2019s possible leadership could add more time to the schedule. Liz Crampton and yours truly have the latest on the farm bill talks here.\n\nMcConnell pledges action: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discussed the farm bill with President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday in a broader meeting about lame-duck priorities. \u201cWe will finish the farm bill before the end of the year,\u201d McConnell said after the meeting.\n\nPORK EXPORTS TRENDING DOWNWARD IN KEY MARKETS: New numbers indicate that tariffs are starting to take a toll on two of the largest markets for U.S. pork producers. American pork exports to Mexico dropped 10 percent in September when compared with September 2017. Exports to China sank even more drastically \u2014 by 33 percent \u2014 during that month.\n\nNot just a one-off: The numbers, released Thursday in an Agriculture Department Economic Research Service outlook report, also showed exports to the two countries dropped on a quarterly basis \u2014 shipments to Mexico were off by 5.6 percent in the third quarter and by nearly 29 percent to China, compared with the third quarter of 2017.\n\nBoth countries targeted pork for retaliatory duties in response to the Trump administration\u2019s actions. Mexico hit the products after the U.S. slapped duties on Mexican steel and aluminum for national security reasons. China\u2019s retaliation was in response to U.S. tariffs meant to punish Beijing for its forced technology transfer and intellectual property policies.\n\nOn the trade front today: The U.S. International Trade Commission holds a second day of hearings as it develops a report to Congress on the economic impact of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Meat producers are on today\u2019s docket.\n\nOn Thursday, a top dairy industry official raised questions about whether the USMCA pact is susceptible to loopholes that could diminish its intended benefit of providing greater market access to American dairy farmers, Pro Trade\u2019s Megan Cassella reports.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 Trump-Juncker meeting expected at G-20: Plans are in the works for Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to hold talks in Buenos Aires during the upcoming G-20 summit from Nov. 30-Dec. 1, EU Ambassador David O\u2019Sullivan said Thursday, per our Pro Trade colleagues. Trump is already scheduled to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 gathering.\n\n\u2014 Beef quota deal expected soon: O\u2019Sullivan, at an event hosted by the Washington International Trade Association, also said the two sides are close to finalizing a deal to boost U.S. exports to the EU of beef produced without artificial growth hormones. More on that here.\n\n\u2014 Schwan\u2019s sold for $1.8 billion: Schwan\u2019s Co., a Minnesota food company known for delivering ice cream and other foods, is being sold to South Korea\u2019s largest food company, The Minneapolis Tribune reports. Schwan\u2019s is also a leading supplier for school nutrition programs across the country.\n\n\u2014 Update on trade aid payments: USDA has doled out nearly $840 million of the $12 billion it has budgeted to aid farmers hurt by trade retaliation. The states that have gotten the most in aid were Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Indiana and Minnesota, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 Study: Low-carb diet boosts metabolism: A new study, published in the journal BMJ, found that overweight adults who cut carbohydrates boosted their metabolism. The results have been making waves this week. The New York Times and Popular Science have more.\n\n\u2014 USDA won\u2019t release info on Salmonella-linked turkey brands: The Food Safety and Inspection Service issued a strongly worded statement to reject consumer advocates\u2019 request to disclose the names of 22 turkey slaughterhouses and seven processing facilities where testing has found a strain of Salmonella that has sickened more than 160 people across 35 states, Food Safety News reports.\n\n\u2014 No \u2018Monday morning quarterbacking\u2019: The FSIS statement, shared with POLITICO, said the agency doesn\u2019t have evidence to pinpoint a single common supplier of tainted turkey products. FSIS lashed out against \u201cspecial interests\u201d that have accused the agency of purposefully withholding information. It said trace-back investigations aren\u2019t conducted in \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking from the comforts of an urban high-rise in New York City or K Street in Washington, D.C., with fundraising pleas attached.\u201d\n\n\u2014 More time for comment on labeling standards: The FDA on Thursday announced a 60-day extension of the public comment period on the agency\u2019s plan to reconsider labeling standards for plant-based products that use names like \u201cmilk\u201d and \u201ccheese.\u201d The comment period was originally scheduled to end Nov. 27.\n\n\u2014 EPA hasn\u2019t assessed hundreds of pollutants for regulation: The agency can't say whether hundreds of pollutants found in biosolids \u2014 which are used as fertilizer in all 50 states \u2014 are harmful to human health, according to a report released by the agency's inspector general. Pros, read more here from POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Zimmerman.\n\n\u2014 AMA pushing for added sugar warnings: The American Medical Association is urging FDA to develop front-of-package warning labels for foods that are high in added sugars based on the established recommended daily value. The Sugar Association argues the proposal amounts to advocating for \u201ca scare-tactics warning label\u201d that \u201cwould mislead consumers because it is an idea not grounded in science.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dan Barber wants people to stop tossing away food: Barber, the famed Blue Hill Farm chef who advised President Barack Obama on food policy, sat down with Pro Health Care\u2019s Dan Diamond to discuss the connection between nutrition and health, wasteful food habits, and much more.

The Morning Tax newsletter will resume publishing on Monday Nov. 26.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSIGNS POINT TO NO? The push to address in the lame duck a raft of glitches in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is not off to a roaring start. Days after House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said he had a long list of proposed fixes, Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he had yet to see them. \u201cThe majority has got to give the minority some piece of paper indicating what their priorities are in order to jump start a serious effort,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have not given us in any way, shape or form a piece of paper indicating what they might want to do.\u201d\n\nHis colleague, Sen. Ben Cardin, called the prospect of Congress addressing technical corrections in the lame duck \u201cremote.\u201d Many Democrats are in no hurry to help Republicans with the snafus, after the GOP stopped them from fixing the Affordable Care Act. And Democrats will want something in exchange for allowing technical corrections to pass, much like they only agreed earlier this year to fix the so-called grain glitch in exchange for beefing up a tax subsidy for affordable housing. \u201cI think we\u2019ll do that next year,\u201d said Cardin.\n\nSpeaking of the Senate, Chuck Grassley still isn\u2019t ready to say whether he\u2019ll take the Finance gavel next year. \u201cIn maybe two or three days, I\u2019ll have an answer for you,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s three or four people that are affected by the decision I make, and I\u2019ve talked to one of them already and I\u2019ll take to a couple more and then I\u2019ll know something.\u201d Grassley has dibs on the chairmanship, thanks to his seniority, but giving up his Judiciary gavel would set off a chairmanship chain reaction. The next person in line, Sen. Mike Crapo, declined to say if he\u2019d take the post if Grassley opts out: \u201cI\u2019ll decide when the opportunity comes, if it does \u2014 it\u2019s all up to Senator Grassley.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY. You made it. There\u2019s just one more thing you need to do before the weekend: Email us your juiciest tax secrets. We are standing by, at bfaler@politico.com, alorenzo@politico.com teckert@politico.com and bbecker@politico.com. You can also reach us on the Twitter machine at @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brianfaler, @aaronelorenzo,@POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nANOTHER TAX WRITER CONSIDERING A PRESIDENTIAL BID? Now Sen. Bob Casey is opening the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said, NBC News reports. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a multi-candidate field and that\u2019s probably the biggest understatement. [There\u2019ll] be a lot of variety in that field, so we\u2019ll have to see what happens.\u201d Casey\u2019s comments come after a boomlet of speculation over whether fellow Finance Democrat Sherrod Brown might run. Like Brown, Casey easily won reelection this year in a perennially important presidential battleground state, both of which went for President Trump in 2016. Brown won in Ohio by 6 percentage points, while Casey coasted to a 13-point victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nPAY YOUR TAXES IN BITCOIN? An advisory group to the IRS is urging the agency to look into allowing people to pay their taxes with virtual currencies, our Toby Eckert reports. \u201cThe IRS could leverage the information and experience obtained from voluntary payments of virtual currency to strengthen enforced collections,\u201d the council said. It also \u201coffered a laundry list of ideas for how the IRS could expand its efforts to regulate virtual currencies and deal with their use by taxpayers.\u201d\n\nCHAINED CPI \u2014 DRAMATIZED (SORT OF): The effects of provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that changed the way the tax code is indexed for inflation are beginning to show up, the Wall Street Journal reports. The IRS\u2019s new inflation adjustments to various parameters of the code released yesterday are smaller than what would have happened in the absence of the move to what economists called chained CPI. For example: \u201cThe start of the 37 percent top bracket for individuals, set at $500,000 for this year, will rise to $510,300 in 2019 under the new inflation-adjustment method. Under the old system, it would have been $512,075, the Tax Foundation calculates. By 2025,the gap between the old and new top brackets is projected to be $10,325.\u201d\n\nRELIGIOUS GROUPS UNITE AROUND OPPOSITION TO PAYING TAXES: Almost three dozen groups have signed a letter to lawmakers demanding they turn off during the lame duck provisions in the new tax law that will require them to begin paying taxes on some types of their employees\u2019 fringe benefits. \u201cUnless repealed, this provision will require tens of thousands of houses of worship to file tax returns for the first time in our nation\u2019s history and will impose a new tax burden on houses of worship and nonprofit organizations,\u201d they wrote. Among those signing the letter: The Episcopal Church, The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the National Association of Evangelicals.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nNEW JERSEY RAISES MONEY BY GIVING TAX DELINQUENTS A BREAK: \u201cA special two-month tax amnesty launched Thursday for the hundreds of thousands of people and businesses that owe the state of New Jersey money. Qualifying taxpayers can have penalties waived and interest payment cut in half if they settle up before Jan. 15,\u201d NJ.com reports. Lawmakers hope it will raise $200 million. They\u2019ve tried this before. \u201cA 2014 tax amnesty brought in $75 million from more than 26,000 people and businesses, according to the state Treasury Department. The Assembly Majority Office said the state collected $725 million from a 2009 amnesty and $277 million in 2002.\u201d\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nTHE BAHAMAS IS OUT, SINGAPORE IS IN: New anti-abuse rules out of Europe are pushing multinational corporations out of tax-free havens like the Bahamas and into merely low-tax places like Singapore and the Netherlands, Bloomberg News reports. \u201cTax experts say the driving force behind the move away from the most flagrant tax havens is a series of requirements from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development intended to stop companies from shifting profits abroad. The standards, which have become law in many European countries, require companies to show economic substance \u2014 employees, management teams and sales \u2014 in the countries where they\u2019re earning income.\u201d\n\nSPEAKING OF SINGAPORE: \u201cIndonesian presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto will slash corporate and personal income taxes if he comes to power, part of a plan to compete with low-tax neighbors like Singapore in luring more investment to Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy,\u201d Bloomberg News also reports.\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nCBO issues new report on taxes and intangible assets\n\nThe Tax Policy Center on why states should consider creating refundable child tax credits\n\nThe Nation on why the earned income tax credit isn\u2019t enough\n\nThe Economist on \u201cOpportunity Zones\u201d\n\nCNBC on \u201ctax-loss harvesting\u201d\n\nPaul Krugman on tax cuts and the balance of payments\n\nFERC orders utilities to reduce tax withholdings\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nIt takes less energy to leave our solar system than it does to reach our Sun."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "ABehsudi@politico.com (Adam Behsudi)", "title": "Don\u2019t get your hopes up on China tariff peace", "description": "Mulvaney eyes top Commerce post \u2014 Expect more pointed views on Day 2 of USMCA hearing", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2018/11/16/dont-get-your-hopes-up-on-china-tariff-peace-417104", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:00:02Z", "content": "With help from Sabrina Rodriguez and Doug Palmer PROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Trade will not publish on Thursday Nov. 22 and Friday Nov. 23.

Office of Management and Budget chief Mick Mulvaney is eyeing the top spot at the Commerce Department. U.S. pork exports to Mexico and China have taken a beating in the past year due to retaliatory tariffs. Start here:\n\nDON\u2019T GET YOUR HOPES UP ON CHINA TARIFF PEACE: Two of Trump\u2019s top trade officials downplayed the chance of a major standstill in U.S. trade actions against China as a result of an upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nOn the sidelines of an event at a Texas LNG facility, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg News on Thursday that the U.S. is still planning to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent starting Jan. 1.\n\nHe said it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to have a full deal with China by January and that the meeting at the G-20 in Argentina, \u201cif it goes well,\u201d would set up a framework for going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer shot down a report that he recently told a group of executives that the next escalation in the tariffs was on hold.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Lighthizer has made no representations to industry executives that future Section 301 tariffs are on hold. The plan for the tariffs as covered in the Federal Register Notice dated September 21, 2018, has not changed at all.

Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host thinks it\u2019s far too early for snow days but can say for once the DC area may have fared better than New York. Any news to get us through Friday? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi.\n\nMULVANEY EYES TOP COMMERCE POST: Office of Management and Budget chief Mick Mulvaney is gunning for Ross\u2019 job in the new year, POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia report.\n\nOctogenarian Ross is said to be on thin ice with the president and could be sent packing after an expected Cabinet shake-up as soon as in January. Mulvaney, once in the running for chief of staff, has told allies and other officials that he is now interested in succeeding Ross, according to several people familiar with the conversations. Trump and Mulvaney have not spoken specifically about the Commerce slot, a Mulvaney ally said.\n\nOther names circulating for the top Commerce slot include SBA Administrator Linda McMahon; Ray Washburne, a major Republican donor and the president and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; and Karen Dunn Kelley, undersecretary for economic affairs at Commerce who is jockeying for the job internally at the department. Read the full story here.\n\nEXPECT MORE POINTED VIEWS ON DAY 2 OF USMCA HEARING: The U.S. International Trade Commission is readying for a second day of hearings on the economic impact of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement as it evaluates what to say to Congress on the new deal.\n\nSteel, aluminum, textile, apparel and tech industry groups are scheduled to testify today. Also on the docket are meat producers and access-to-medicines advocates.\n\nNot a slam-dunk, Mr. President: If Thursday\u2019s testimonies were any guide, several groups and lawmakers are demanding more details on the pact\u2019s specifics. Reps. Bill Pascrell and Sandy Levin say their support for USMCA will come down to whether the deal actually reverses job losses in U.S. and suppressed wages in Mexico.\n\nIndustries and labor pipe up: The AFL-CIO strongly suggested Thursday that improvements would be needed to get the labor group\u2019s support, especially when it comes to Mexico\u2019s labor commitments. \u201cIf the Commission simply assumes that \u2018words on the page\u2019 are sufficient to transform Mexico\u2019s repressive labor regime, it will make a grave error,\u201d AFL-CIO trade specialist Celeste Drake said at the hearing.\n\nAuto industry groups warned that any benefit the new agreement might have for the industry would be canceled out by continuing tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as potential penalties on imports of autos and auto parts\n\nAnd the dairy industry worries that the pact is susceptible to loopholes that diminish the deal's intended benefit of providing greater market access to American farmers.\n\nGiving some ground: Pascrell, who could become chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, acknowledged that USMCA has \u201csome improvements\u201d over the original NAFTA.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going in the right direction,\u201d Pascrell told Morning Trade. The New Jersey Democrat said he spoke with Lighthizer after his testimony to discuss what he\u2019s looking for in the deal. Lighthizer \u201cknows what we need. \u2026 It\u2019s been laid out in every meeting with him,\u201d Pascrell added.\n\nMEXICAN STEEL, INDUSTRY GROUPS TAKE A STAND: Mexico\u2019s leading steel business and steel industry groups are pressuring the government not to sign the new NAFTA deal until the U.S. grants a full exemption on tariffs saying that they were \u201cleft aside\u201d in the NAFTA renegotiation.\n\nQuotas under discussion: The current administration seems likely to punt the tariff issue to President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration to handle. One trade lobbyist told POLITICO Pro Canada that the U.S. and Mexico are discussing a quota in the range of 130 percent from steel export levels in recent years. Two sources close to the U.S.-Mexico talks confirmed that\u2019s accurate, but that the figure hasn\u2019t been finalized. Sabrina has more here.\n\nBREXIT DEAL RAISES UNCERTAINTY ABOUT U.S.-U.K. TRADE TALKS: A draft deal on the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union either sets the stage for an ambitious U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement or dooms the negotiations before they even start. U.K. Ambassador Kim Darroch presented the more optimistic view, while two Conservative Members of Parliament, David Davis and Owen Paterson, gave voice to the gloom.

Trump has the meeting with Xi. Now, plans are underway for Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to hold talks in Buenos Aires during the upcoming G-20 summit on Nov. 30-Dec. 1, EU Ambassador David O\u2019Sullivan said Thursday.\n\nThe hope is the two leaders will take stock of recently launched talks to increase regulatory cooperation and give a fresh push to negotiations on reducing most industrial tariffs.\n\nBeef quota deal expected soon: O\u2019Sullivan, at an event hosted by the Washington International Trade Association, also said the two sides are close to finalizing a deal to boost U.S. exports of beef produced without artificial growth hormones to the EU.

Exports to China sank even more drastically \u2014 by 33 percent \u2014 during that month.\n\nNot just a one-off: The numbers, released Thursday in an Agriculture Department Economic Research Service outlook report, also showed exports to the two countries also dropped on a quarterly basis \u2014 shipments to Mexico were off 5.6 percent in the third quarter and nearly 29 percent to China compared to the third quarter of 2017.\n\nBoth countries targeted pork for retaliatory duties in response to the Trump administration\u2019s actions. Mexico hit the products after the U.S. slapped duties on Mexican steel and aluminum for national security reasons. China\u2019s retaliation was in response to U.S. tariffs meant to punish Beijing for its forced technology transfer and intellectual property policies.\n\nTRADE REMEDY CORNER\n\nCHINESE QUARTZ EDITION: The Commerce Department announced it had made a preliminary determination that China is dumping exports of quartz surface products into the U.S. at less than fair value. The investigation is recommending preliminary dumping duties of between 242.10 percent and 341.29 percent.\n\nMinnesota-based Cambria Company LLC petitioned for the duties. A final Commerce determination is expected by April 4. The ITC will make its final injury determination on May 20. Imports of quartz surface products from China were valued at $460 million in 2017, according to a Commerce Department fact sheet.\n\nISRAELI MAGNESIUM TARGETED: Commerce also announced the initiation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations of imports of magnesium from Israel. The petitioner in the case is Utah-based US Magnesium LLC. Imports of magnesium from Israel in 2017 were valued at $43.5 million, Commerce said in a fact sheet on the case.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Trump formulated his views on trade in the 1980s and hasn\u2019t deviated since then, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\n\u2014 The Agriculture Department has paid out nearly $840 million in trade aid to farmers to date, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014The U.S. wants to include soybeans in any trade deal it reaches with China, Bloomberg reports.\n\n\u2014 A senior administration official said China\u2019s offer is unlikely to spur a major breakthrough in trade talks, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warns that one day Southeast Asian nations will have to choose between the U.S. and China, Bloomberg reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

But her effort to overhaul sexual assault rules for schools under Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination, has been among her most controversial moves in office, because it would allow for victims to be cross-examined, raise the standard of proof in such cases and let schools offer mediation.\n\nDemocrats insisted they will fight the proposed regulation, which civil rights groups and advocates warned will create more barriers for students seeking justice. While Democrats did not specify hearings or other actions, they pledged they won't let DeVos move forward.\n\n\"Congress must not let this proposal become a reality,\u201d said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who has authored legislation aimed at combating sexual violence on campuses.\n\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Rosa DeLauro, (D-Conn.), in line to become the next chairwoman of the subcommittee that writes the Education Department budget.\n\n\"Betsy DeVos is failing them in this regard, and if she does not get this right in the final rule, Congress needs to step up to return the proper balance.\u201d\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), expected to become the next chairwoman of Financial Services, tweeted: \"Betsy DeVos, you won\u2019t get away with what you are doing. We are organizing to put an end to your destruction of civil rights protections for students.\"\n\nAyanna Pressley, a newly elected Massachusetts Democrat, tweeted at DeVos that she is a campus sexual assault survivor and knows the \"pain and fear survivors feel when they disclose\": \"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ayanna Pressley. I\u2019ve just arrived in DC. I\u2019m here to fight for survivors and hold your @usedgov accountable.\"\n\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the Democrat expected to chair the House Education and the Workforce Committee in the upcoming Congress, called the proposal \"a damaging setback\" that \"provides schools with numerous opportunities to evade responsibility for incidences of sexual misconduct.\"\n\n\"I strongly encourage the administration scrap this proposal and join the effort to make college campuses and school classrooms safer and more welcoming for all students,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, writing on Facebook that the proposal \"would return us to the days when schools swept rape and assault under the rug and survivors were shamed into silence. Schools will have decreased liability for their response to sexual violence. And most disturbing, students will be placed at greater risk. We cannot go back.\"\n\nThe proposal marks a step into politically fraught terrain for the administration, as sexual misconduct claims \u2014 including against President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and against the president himself \u2014 have galvanized activists in recent months.\n\nThe proposal echoes the debate that has repeatedly captured the nation since Trump took office, most recently when allegations from Kavanaugh's high school and college years nearly tanked his nomination \u2014 leading the president to fret that \"it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of.\"\n\nThe administration touted its plan as a historic move that will for the first time create formal regulations \u2014 through a notice-and-comment process \u2014 for schools responding to sexual harassment claims.\n\nDeVos said her focus is on \"ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment.\"\n\n\u201cThat starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on,\" she said in a statement. \"Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.\"\n\n\"We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function.\u201d\n\nDeVos' proposal includes language meant to assure due process: Accused students are presumed innocent until proven otherwise. They should be given written notice of the allegations against them and should have access to evidence gathered in investigations. Both parties would have the right to appeal disciplinary decisions.\n\nThe proposal includes a narrower definition of sexual harassment than in the past \u2014 as unwanted conduct that is \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" \u2014 and it would give both K-12 schools and colleges more latitude in how they handle allegations.\n\nThe rules would let schools use a higher standard of evidence for discipline decisions related to sexual misconduct and offer mediation if both students agree to it. They would also hold schools responsible only for allegations involving misconduct on school-owned properties or at school-sponsored programs or events, a change the administration stresses isn't meant to create an \"artificial bright-line\" between harassment occurring on or off campus.\n\nThe rules also maintain certain requirements meant to offer relief to students who have been harassed or assaulted. They require schools to respond meaningfully to all complaints and encourages them to offer so-called supportive measures \u2014 changes in class schedules or dorm room assignments, for example \u2014 even if the student does not want to file a formal complaint.\n\nDeVos' move to rescind the Obama guidance last year was among her most widely criticized actions since taking office. Drafts of the new rules that leaked in recent months drew intense pushback from women's advocacy groups, who argued the DeVos rewrite will mean more obstacles for victims reporting assaults and could open the door for retaliation against students who do report.\n\nNotably, the new rules would guarantee students the right to cross-examine their accusers, something survivors' advocates say is deeply traumatizing. Students, however, can request to be in separate rooms during the questioning, which would be done through third-party advisers, not between students directly.\n\n\u201cThis rule will return schools back to a time where rape, assault and harassment were swept under the rug,\" said Jess Davidson, executive director of End Rape on Campus.\n\n\"It demonstrates Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration share the same attitude about assault that we saw from Senate Republicans during the Kavanaugh hearing \u2014 disparage and diminish survivors and discourage them from reporting.\u201d\n\nMen's rights advocates and civil liberties groups, meanwhile, have cheered the administration's efforts, arguing the Obama-era policies they are replacing \u2014 which weren't formal rules though they were treated as such \u2014 led schools to trample the due process rights of the accused.\n\n\"It\u2019s important that allegations aren\u2019t ignored and aren\u2019t prejudged,\" said Samantha Harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group that was among the most vocal critics of the Obama administration\u2018s guidance.\n\n\"It\u2019s an unfortunate misconception that due process rights for the accused somehow undermine protections for complainants and those things are mutually exclusive,\u201d she said. \u201cSchools can have a process that is tremendously respectful to complainants and take those complaints seriously.\"\n\nThe proposal kicks off a 60-day public comment period, and the administration may still tweak it before it becomes a final regulation, but it will carry the weight of law once it does.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate HELP committee, said DeVos \"has begun the appropriate public rulemaking process, including the opportunity for individuals to review and make comments for 60 days, to bring much needed clarity to the federal rules helping colleges protect the safety and rights of students.\"\n\nBut Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Senate HELP committee, said the proposal is \"another step toward sweeping the scourge of sexual assault under the rug\" and urged \"every woman, man, mom, dad, and anyone else who cares about campus safety and preventing sexual assault to make your voices heard and demand that Secretary DeVos and President Trump withdraw this proposal immediately.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "asarkissian@politico.com (Arek Sarkissian)", "title": "Federal judge tosses Nelson rules challenge", "description": "The case was one of several brought by Nelson\u2019s campaign in anticipation of the manual recount that Secretary of State Ken Detzner ordered Thursday.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/11/16/federal-judge-tosses-nelson-rules-challenge-701094", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/a8/03/1a49b0d4452499faf6000439aa66/181116-billnelson-ap-900.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:55:02Z", "content": "Sen.

Another 97 provisional ballots were rejected for the same reason.\n\nThe manual recount in the U.S. Senate and state agriculture commissioner races call for canvassing boards in the state\u2019s 67 counties to review disputed ballots known as \"undervotes\" or \"overvotes.\" A ballot where someone did not input enough selections is deemed an undervote and a ballot with too many selections is an overvote.\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign had also filed a lawsuit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court Thursday that demanded a hand recount of the 588,562 ballots cast in Palm Beach County. The lawyers claimed County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher\u2019s office would not be able to complete the manual recount in time. But Bucher said Thursday night the manual recount for the Senate race should be completed sometime Friday. The deadline to submit final results to Detzner's office is Sunday at noon.\n\nAlong with Nelson\u2019s rule challenge, Walker handed down another order early Friday that rejected a case brought against Scott by the League of Women Voters, which argued the governor should be blocked from using his official powers to oversee the election. Lawyers for the league argued during a three-hour Thursday hearing that Scott endangered the integrity of the election when he made allegations of voter fraud last week.

Thad Cochran\u2019s term. Cochran retired earlier this year, citing health reasons, and was replaced by Hyde-Smith, who was appointed by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant.\n\nDemocrats have accused Republicans across the country of attempting to suppress the voting rights of minority groups under the guise of curbing voter fraud, but the issue is much more fraught in the South, which has a history of racial tension and voter discrimination.\n\nEspy did not mince words in a statement on Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks, noting the historical context of the senator\u2019s message. \u201cFor a state like Mississippi, where voting rights were obtained through sweat and blood, everyone should appreciate that this is not a laughing matter,\u201d he said.\n\nEspy, a former congressman who would be the first black senator from Mississippi in over a century, called Hyde-Smith a \u201cwalking stereotype who embarrasses our state.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith responded to Espy on Twitter, asking: \u201cIt\u2019s ok to still have a sense of humor in America isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese students enjoyed a laugh with Cindy despite out of state social media posts trying to mislead Mississippians,\u201d the post to her Twitter account continued, posting a picture that appeared to be at the same event.\n\n\u201cI know the senator \u2014 she\u2019s not a racist and she would not be in favor of suppressing anybody\u2019s right to vote,\u201d Scallan said Friday, insisting again that Hyde-Smith was \"not even saying she\u2019s supporting voter suppression at all\" and lamenting that the political climate has become so volatile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that somebody can\u2019t make a joke ... without everybody taking it so seriously,\u201d she said.\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s latest remarks to surface are the second controversy she\u2019s faced this week. The same Twitter user, a local publisher, posted a video of Hyde-Smith over the weekend in which she says with a smile that if a supporter she was campaigning with invited her to a \u201cpublic hanging,\u201d she\u2019d \u201cbe on the front row.\u201d\n\nHer use of the phrase was ill-received given Mississippi\u2019s dark history involving racial discrimination and lynchings, but Hyde-Smith brushed it off as an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard\u201d and said that it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to have given the comments a negative connotation.\n\n\u201cIn nearly 20 years of public service nobody has ever accused [Hyde-Smith] of racism or anything \u2014 there\u2019s nothing,\u201d Scallan said, arguing that now, \u201cPeople are reaching for things.\u201d\n\nDespite President Donald Trump carrying deep-red Mississippi by 18 points in the 2016 election, the race between Hyde-Smith and Espy has gotten tight enough that both Republicans and Democrats are placing ad buys in the state, and Trump himself is even mulling a visit to boost Hyde-Smith\u2019s chances. Scallan said the campaign would welcome a visit from Trump, and while she\u2019s heard rumblings of a possible Trump visit, the White House hasn\u2019t confirmed its plans."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "SALLY GOLDENBERG", "title": "Amazon deal will disrupt plans for affordable housing on Long Island City sites", "description": "Amazon's plans to expand into Long Island City may cost Mayor Bill de Blasio - and New York City - approximately 1,500 units of affordable housing.

Michael Gianaris, who represents Long Island City.\n\nPlaxall, which owns land around the Anable Basin, was prepared to ask New York City for permission to build up to 4,995 new homes on a 14.7-acre site on the East River, 1,250 of which developers would have set aside for low- and middle-income New Yorkers. Most of that site will now be subsumed into Amazon\u2019s office campus.\n\nA small portion of it \u2014 about two acres \u2014 can still be used for housing because it won\u2019t be part of Amazon\u2019s campus. But Plaxall hasn\u2019t decided if it wants apartments or office space there, and either way, it won\u2019t be able to accommodate nearly as many homes as originally planned.\n\nMeanwhile, another developer, TF Cornerstone, was poised to build 1,000 apartments on a neighboring site owned by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, of which 250 units would have been affordable. That site, too, will be part of Amazon\u2019s office campus.\n\nA spokesman for Amazon confirmed there will be no housing in its Long Island City complex.\n\nOne of de Blasio\u2019s primary goals as mayor is to build and preserve 300,000 homes for people of limited means. He recently pointed to that housing plan when asked if Amazon would strain New York City\u2019s housing market, like the tech sector has strained San Francisco\u2019s.\n\n\"The absolute difference between us and San Francisco is we believe in economic diversity, we believe in ensuring there's a vast supply of affordable housing,\" he said.\n\nAffordable housing, however, is no longer the main focus of development in Anable Basin.\n\nThe New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is helping shepherd the Amazon project, said the jobs and other amenities the company plans to bring will produce a net benefit for the area.\n\n\"Tackling the affordability crisis means building more affordable housing \u2014 but it also means creating more good-paying jobs,\" EDC spokesperson Stephanie Baez said. \"Development of commercial office space around Anable Basin will offset concerns about residential overdevelopment that have been expressed by some community residents.\"\n\nShe said the plan will include other perks, like a workforce program and a public school.\n\nOn Thursday, TF Cornerstone circulated a job posting for a project manager for Amazon\u2019s Long Island City campus, who will help build out \u201ccommercial development for Amazon along the Long Island City Waterfront.\u201d\n\nNo salary is listed.\n\n\u201cThe more we learn about this deal, the worse it gets,\u201d Gianaris said."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mparthasarathy@politico.com (Maya Parthasarathy)", "title": "TRUMP heading to CALIFORNIA -- PORTER beats WALTERS; DCCC claims another win -- PELOSI projects confidence as challenger emerges -- KHANNA teams up with BERNIE vs. WALMART -- More HIGH-SPEED RAIL criticism", "description": null, "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2018/11/16/trump-heading-to-california-democrats-break-down-their-california-victory-route-pelosi-projects-confidence-as-challenger-emerges-ro-khanna-teams-up-with-bernie-vs-walmart-more-high-speed-rail-criticism-347849", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:15:57Z", "content": "Presented by California Resources Corporation THE BUZZ: First things first: Donald Trump is finally coming to pay his California wildfire respects.

The commander-in-chief is scheduled to touch down Saturday and then meet with victims \u2014 a first despite a year of record-breakingly bad blazes. This comes after the feds and Gov. Jerry Brown have tried to move past Trump\u2019s unsettling fire-related broadsides.\n\n-- Back in California politics land: Democrat Katie Porter officially beat GOP Rep. Mimi Walters last night, which means Dems have won five of their targeted House races. While we\u2019re still waiting for the final contest to be called, in CA-39, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is already breaking down its victory.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n-- A new D-trip memo breaks down how the national party\u2019s strategic focus on California \u2014 which included intervening to winnow a crowded primary field, opening a campaign office in Orange County and spending some $12.9 million on six targeted California races \u2014 yielded at least five pickups, with one more potentially coming. (The only Republican to survive a major onslaught, Rep. David Valadao, has seen his margin dwindle this week as the vote count has continued.) Even with the reach seats (Nunes, Hunter, McClintock) retained by the GOP, the DCCC can fairly boast it painted California\u2019s House delegation blue. Some points from the memo:\n\n-- The DCCC sought to get ahead of the top-two primary\u2019s tricky dynamics and the attendant threat of Democrats fracturing the vote at the start of 2018, using data to determine and boost the strongest Dems (Gil Cisneros in the 39th and Harley Rouda in the 48th) and the weakest Republicans. They\u2019re gleeful about boosting the \u201cunsalvageable\u201d Republican Diane Harkey, who lost badly to Democrat Mike Levin in the race for Rep. Darrell Issa\u2019s seat (the DCCC worked to keep the more-electable state Assemblyman Rocky Chavez out of the general).\n\n-- The work started early: The DCCC said it had people on the ground weeks after Trump\u2019s inauguration and began running ads on health care back in 2017.\n\n-- GOTV: The party spent $30 million this cycle to turn out voters, signed up 20,000 voters and called 6 million voters in targeted districts. They also invested in Spanish-language media to galvanize the Latino electorate.\n\n-- Record-breaking fundraising numbers posted by prime candidates reflected party assistance, per the DCCC, which furnished digital fundraising experts.\n\nTHE GOP TAKE: Shawn Steel, the Republican National Committee\u2019s man in California, tries to break down the tsunami that just hit the state GOP: \u201cCalifornia Republicans, long in the wilderness, have now reached the point of desperation.\u201d Steel points to structural and strategic problems that precede Donald Trump: Column .\n\nBUENOS D\u00cdAS, Good FRIDAY morning. San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento schools are closed today because the air quality is so bad from the fires, and Facebook is moving once again into damage-control mode.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cCome on in!

McCaskill ( nmccaskill@politico.com or @NolanDMcCaskill )\n\nCBC MEMBERS STAND WITH PELOSI -- Many members of the Congressional Black Caucus are standing by their commitments to support Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for speaker on the House floor, despite the possibility that former CBC Chairwoman Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) could enter the race. \u201cThe CBC has been spoiling to elevate a group member into one of the top two positions in Democratic leadership for years, with current CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond writing as recently as two weeks ago that having a black speaker or majority leader was a top priority,\u201d Rachael, Bres and I write. \u201cBut in interviews with eight CBC members about Fudge\u2019s possible bid for speaker, all but two members said they would back Pelosi over Fudge.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor his part, Richmond told reporters he\u2019d likely be on \u201cTeam Marcia\u201d if she launched a bid for speaker. \u201cAnd the Louisiana Democrat predicted that his fellow CBC members currently backing Pelosi over Fudge would change their tune should she actually jump into the race,\u201d we note. Fudge, Richmond said, \u201cwould be a good speaker. I\u2019m not anti-Pelosi, but whatever Marcia does, I\u2019m very pro-Marcia.\u201d Pelosi invited -- if not dared -- Fudge to challenge her. Fudge is among the group of 17 anti-Pelosi Democrats who have pledged to vote against her on the House floor. \u201cCome on in,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe water\u2019s warm.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2Q23pjZ\n\nRelated: \u201c\u2018Where are we recognized?\u2019: Fudge emerges as potential challenger to Pelosi,\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Elise Viebeck: https://wapo.st/2DHBgJi ; \u201cMarcia Fudge, Toying With Speaker Run, Slams Nancy Pelosi,\u201d from HuffPost\u2019s Matt Fuller: http://bit.ly/2QMCvK5 ; and \u201cPelosi allies rage over tactics of opponents,\u201d via The Hill\u2019s Scott Wong and Mike Lillis: http://bit.ly/2zZJS9A\n\nDEMS GET TWO MORE PICKUPS -- The House Democratic majority continues to grow. Democrat Katie Porter defeated Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.) last night. \u201cWalters\u2019 loss means the GOP is in danger of not having a single representative in Congress from Orange County, a former Republican stronghold once home to Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan,\u201d Brent D. Griffiths writes. \u201cAfter leading in election night returns, Walters was reportedly mounting a bid to head House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, before her lead began to shrink and then evaporate.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2Fs6gid\n\nDemocrat Jared Golden also claimed victory Thursday over Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine), who has sued the Maine secretary of state over the constitutionality of the vote. The contest in the 2nd Congressional District is the first House race to be decided by a ranked-choice voting system. Poliquin said he \u201cwon the constitutional \u2018one-person, one-vote\u2019 first choice election on Election Day\u201d and \u201cwill proceed with our constitutional concerns about the rank vote algorithm.\u201d \u201cUnder Maine\u2019s system, voters rank their preferred candidates to allow for an \u2018instant runoff\u2019 by counting second-choice votes from people who supported last-placed candidates, repeating the process until a candidate secures victory with more than 50 percent of the vote,\u201d Elena Schneider explains.

Shelby was among the group of Senate Republicans who met with the president at the White House on Thursday. Shelby told reporters Trump didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m going to keep the government open\u201d but seemed to agree that a shutdown should be avoided. \u201cTrump\u2019s staff has warned him he may not get the full $5 billion he has demanded for new wall construction for 2019,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report.\n\n\u201cGOP leaders this fall convinced Trump to delay any decision about the border wall until after the November midterm elections, fearful that a big showdown could hurt Republicans with voters,\u201d they continue. \u201cBut Republicans suffered heavy losses during the midterms in the House of Representatives and will lose control of that chamber in early January. Although they retain full control of Congress for now, Republicans still need support from Democrats to pass any bill in the Senate. Democrats have expressed opposition to giving Trump the money he wants to build his long-promised wall.\u201d More: https://wapo.st/2Kcgq5i\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY! Thanks for reading Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill, on this Nov. 16.\n\nTHURSDAY\u2019S MOST CLICKED: Roll Call\u2019s report on House Republicans considering changing the way they select committee leaders was the winner.\n\nSENATE GOP NUDGES TRUMP FOR AG NOMINEE -- Senate Republicans are urging the president to nominate a permanent attorney general -- and fast. Republicans are hopeful that the nomination of a new DOJ chief \u201cwill blunt bipartisan concern over the future of special counsel Robert Mueller and boost the GOP ahead of tough government funding talks,\u201d Burgess and Eliana Johnson report. Most Republicans insist the president won\u2019t oust Mueller or derail his investigation. But they acknowledge an AG nominee would halt momentum for legislation to protect Mueller and mollify Democrats who are adamant that acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker will undermine the probe.\n\n\u201cThe White House is working to find a broadly acceptable pick for the job,\u201d they write. Potential candidates include former Attorney General Bill Barr and former Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip. Trump, however, has no relationship with either candidate, and allies say the difficulty in nominating one of them lies in persuading the president that he can trust them. \u201cAbsent a pledge from [former Attorney General Jeff] Sessions\u2019 successor to lay off Mueller, any nominee would be enormously difficult to confirm and would quickly turn off the prospect of Democratic support,\u201d they add. Regardless of who the president picks -- or when -- a nominee likely won\u2019t get confirmed until next year.

COTTON -- Sen.

Those who relied on mass transit didn\u2019t fare well either. It wasn\u2019t just New Jersey. The entire tri-state area was a disaster.

Phil Murphy beams with the belief that his toothy smile and can-do optimism can melt his most ardent foes. Not on Thursday, when a stronger-than-expected storm turned the afternoon commute into a white-knuckled slog along un-plowed highways glazed with ice. At least 500 vehicles collided in accidents. Bus commuters found themselves locked out of the Port Authority's NYC bus terminal. Suddenly, no one had any patience for Smiling Phil. And they weren't buying his excuses. His public service video, with its oddly, out-of-sync and cozy Winter Wonderland backdrop, and opening with a hokey \u2018Hey, Governor Phil Murphy coming at ya\" failed to reassure anyone who listened.\u2019 His urging to stay home and be safe struck, only fueled commuter fury.

Does that hurt Christie's chances at AG?\u201d by The Record\u2019s Charles Stile: \u201cIf you haven't noticed by now, President Trump really, really hates Bob Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible Russian collusion with his 2016 presidential campaign. But Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, really likes Mueller. Christie could be a prime candidate for president of the Bob Mueller fan club. \"I always found Bob Mueller to be a person of integrity and honesty and hard worker and he deserves great credit for the fact that there has been absolutely no leaking out of that operation,\" Christie said Wednesday after an appearance at the New Jersey League of Municipalities convention in Atlantic City. And why is this difference in opinion significant? It's because Christie's name has been floated as a short-list candidate for Trump's next attorney general. Trump fired Jeff Sessions last week, a day after the midterm elections, reportedly furious that Sessions removed himself from oversight of Mueller's probe \u2026 If Trump plans to pursue this Nixonian-strategy, then why would he install a fan of Mueller, like Christie, whose admiration of Mueller stems for their work together in the early 2000s at the Justice Department? \u2018I have no idea,\u2019 Christie said when asked if his praise of Mueller will be a disqualifier.\u201d Read more here\n\nCLIMATE STATUS: HOSTILE \u2014 \u201cOcasio-Cortez gets in closed-door fight with veteran lawmaker over climate change,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Anthony Adragna, John Bresnahan and Zack Colman: \u201cA fight broke out in a closed-door meeting of House Democrats over climate change as a powerful veteran lawmaker fought with freshman star Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members-elect over the creation of a special panel for the issue. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, incoming chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee \u2014 backed by a number of other committee members \u2014 slammed the creation of the new climate panel, according to multiple sources in the room. Pallone argued that his committee and other existing panels within the House could take on the issue aggressively. But Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Rep.-elect Joe Neguse (Colo.) and some of the other progressive incoming lawmakers fought back, saying they ran on the issue and needed to do it \u2026 Pallone declined to comment on what happened during the closed-door meeting, but further explained why he opposes the select committee. \u2018My fear is that if you have a select committee, by the time the select committee gets going, gets appointed and hires staff that it might actually delay what we\u2019re doing,\u2019 the New Jersey Democrat told reporters.\u201d Read more here\n\nIF HE WASN\u2019T VEGAN HE\u2019D BE MORE INFLUENTIAL \u2014 \u201cBooker throws his weight behind Trump-backed criminal justice deal,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor: \u201cSen. Cory Booker is signing on as an original backer of the criminal justice package backed by President Donald Trump, giving the deal valuable momentum with Democrats even as it splits the Senate GOP. Booker's support for the carefully-crafted agreement to overhaul prison and sentencing laws also puts him in rare alignment with a president whom he's openly considering challenging in 2020. But the New Jersey Democrat said his decision to endorse the deal \u2014 which backers are pushing to vote on during this year's lame-duck session \u2014 has nothing to do with those considerations. \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn about politics when thousands of people are incarcerated unjustly,\u2019 Booker told POLITICO on Thursday.\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014 \u201cNJ's 4 new House Democrats start fast.

Murphy must ensure cannabis jobs come to our cities,\u201d by Ras J. Baraka and Steven M. Fulop for The Star-Ledger: \u201cIn the next few weeks the New Jersey Department of Health will award licenses to six medical marijuana dispensaries doubling the number in the state to 12. Over 140 applications were submitted for these six slots, showing the market demand corporate investors believe exists in New Jersey. This presents the Murphy administration with the ability to help deliver economic growth to our urban centers. Under federal law no cannabis merchandise can legally cross state lines. This means all marijuana products - both medicinal and recreational - need to be cultivated, manufactured, distributed and sold in New Jersey. By expanding the use, an entirely new industry is being introduced into our state. Marijuana cultivation is a 24/7/365 operation in sophisticated growing centers using advanced technology to grow, harvest and then manufacture marijuana products.

A pretty blond woman, alone late at night, stuck in a car that sputtered to a stop in an unfamiliar neighborhood, approached in the darkness by a haunted face in tattered clothes. Would he hurt her? No, Johnny Bobbitt Jr. meant no harm, he would later say. The homeless veteran materialized \u2014 out of thin air, it seemed \u2014 and offered to use the last $2 \u2026 So when McClure and D'Amico created a GoFundMe campaign with the intention of raising a modest $10,000 to help get Bobbitt off the streets, the response was immediate and overwhelming \u2026 more than 14,000 donors contributed $402,706 to the account in just one month. Bobbitt's selfless act, and McClure's and D'Amico's well-intentioned response, made them instant celebrities, the subjects of front-page headlines and sought-after guests for Good Morning America and The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

The change, effective July 1, 2019, would mean a loss of faculty members represented by the local chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, whose leaders claim the university is handing employees over to the Chinese government. Wenzhou-Kean University is governed by a 15-member board of directors, with eight members appointed by the Chinese government, according to the union. Moreover, according to the union, professors at WKU have been told they\u2019ll no longer belong to the AFT, but may join the Chinese government\u2019s official labor union, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party. Union leaders are concerned the changes will compromise academic freedom and integrity at the campus.

I\u2019m one of those who decorates for the holidays before Thanksgiving--so I don\u2019t have to worry about it after. But before I pull out boxes, there's news.\n\nTHE BUZZ\n\nCommenters on state Rep.-elect Anne Stava-Murray\u2018s Facebook page have for weeks been disparaging House Speaker Mike Madigan. That\u2019s no surprise given Democrat Stava-Murray campaigned saying she wouldn\u2019t vote to re-elect Madigan as speaker. But some of the social-media rhetoric has gone over the top, including inciting violence. Of Madigan, one commenter wrote, \u201cCan\u2019t we just drag him out into the street and beat him within an inch of his life\u2026\u201d Another said \u201cThrow the bastard out through a window about six floors up maybe he will get the hint it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStava-Murray told POLITICO she doesn\u2019t delete comments because \u201cit\u2019s illegal to do so\u201d if they\u2019re from constituents. She didn\u2019t push back to condemn the comments either because she said she didn\u2019t see them. Stava-Murray, who is manager of the Facebook page, said she only looks at the comments at the top of the feed when she logs on. It wasn\u2019t until after talking to POLITICO that she responded to the \u201cbeat him\u201d comment, writing, \u201cLet\u2019s try to keep it peaceful. Not trying to invite violence here, just phone calls to reps.\u201d\n\nThat may be enough to calm concerns by anyone who saw the posts that Stava-Murray takes her social-media messaging seriously.\n\nThe newly elected Rep has been calling lawmakers and encouraging them to vote against Madigan as speaker. Stava-Murray says it\u2019s what her constituents want. She sending a message that a change in leadership is necessary given complaints last year about sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.\n\nLegislators aren't clamoring to join her parade. Madigan also has been calling lawmakers and asking they vote for him as speaker. That prompted Stava-Murray to post a Facebook message to constituents. \u201cI\u2019m asking people to call their legislator to ask them to reconsider\u201d their support of Madigan. The vote is taken up by lawmakers Jan. 9.\n\nStava-Murray, who has most recently served as a commissioner of the Naperville Board of Fire and Police, narrowly defeated state Rep. David Olsen, a Downers Grove resident who had served as a village commissioner and College of DuPage board member and vice chairman.\n\nMORE BUZZ\n\nThe best campaign money can buy: J.B.

Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio find themselves fighting on the same side, as critics from the New York Times to the City Council question the wisdom of handing a trillion-dollar company more than $2 billion in incentives. The governor dismissed the voices of dissent, saying their arguments are \u201cnonsensical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the largest economic infusion the state has ever seen,\u2019 Cuomo said. \u2018It\u2019s a big, transformative move for our economy in the tech sector. It diversifies our economy, and it\u2019s a home run. \u2026 These are great jobs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s their argument, and they\u2019re sticking with it. But as our Dana Rubinstein notes, there seems to be some dispute on the Capitol\u2019s second floor about some of that incentive money.\n\nDana writes: \u201cTwenty-four hours after the administration confirmed its plan to award Amazon up to $505 million in grants for its new Queens headquarters would require the approval of the Public Authorities Control Board \u2014 an obscure state entity over which the Legislature has some authority \u2014 the administration walked it back. In interviews with the New York Daily News and The New York Times Thursday, Cuomo budget director Robert Mujica said that in the case of the $505 million grant, the state could evade board approval, thereby denying the state Legislature a say in the matter. A spokesman for Mujica confirmed Thursday night that was the state\u2019s new opinion.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, Cuomo and de Blasio, who have argued over the meaning of progressivism at a time when the Democratic Party is listing to the port side, find themselves having to defend the sort of deal they might well have railed against had it been negotiated by, say, Mike Bloomberg or some other corporate-political type.\n\nIt will pre-empt at least 1,500 units of affordable housing that were originally planned for the site, as Sally and Dana report today. It\u2019s going to displace 1,000 public school employees who work in an office there. It\u2019s part of a pattern of Mayor de Blasio saying one thing and doing another when it comes to real estate development, the Times\u2019s J. David Goodman and Willie Neuman write today.\n\nThe corporate subsidies come at a time when the subways and the city\u2019s public housing stock are literally crumbling, and as a newly-released study shows that two out of every five working-age New York City households do not have the income they need to pay for basic necessities, like food, housing, health care and child care.\n\nBut this is their deal, and they are in it together. If nothing else, it may make them feel more like teammates and less like sparring partners.That may not be such a bad thing.\n\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY.

When asked about the turmoil, City Hall referred questions to the Sanitation Department \u2014 which on Wednesday said it had issued a \u201csnow alert\u201d to the \u201crelevant city agencies\u201d to be ready for the storm. ...

Officials from City Hall and the New York City Housing Authority, whose vast troubles are at the center of an ongoing federal case , have been briefing elected officials in recent weeks, ahead of unveiling a new 10-year plan to raise at least $22 billion for the agency. The blueprint, a revamp of a plan the city released in 2015 called NextGen NYCHA, seeks to raise revenue by monetizing the housing authority\u2019s assets and partnering with private developers to manage dilapidated buildings, according to multiple sources briefed on the rollout...The plan, dubbed NYCHA 2.0, proposes that 62,000 of the agency's roughly 175,000 apartments be enrolled in one of several federal programs, primarily the Rental Assistance Demonstration or RAD, sources said. That\u2019s more than triple the goal in the original plan. POLITICO\u2019s Sally Goldenberg\n\nLESS FOR MORE \u2014 by Dana: All is not well at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. If no substantial new money comes the MTA's way in the near future, the authority will have to cut service and raise subway fares as much as 15 percent by 2022, officials warned Thursday. That would be on top of the 4-to-5 percent subway-fare hikes the MTA is planning next spring and again in 2021. \"[This] is the land of tough choices,\" said Andy Byford, who, as New York City Transit president, runs the system's subways and buses. In new proposals released Thursday, the MTA said it is considering raising the base subway fare from $2.75 to $3, and raising the cost of a 30-day pass from $121 to as much as $127. On MTA commuter rails, it's considering a maximum increase of nearly 4 percent on weekly and monthly tickets. And on its bridges and tunnels, the MTA is contemplating a toll hike of as much as 8 percent for E-ZPass users (who comprise the vast majority of bridge and tunnel customers). Meanwhile, to balance its budget next year, the MTA is considering eliminating employee wellness programs, slashing station painting contracts, cutting subway car cleaning and manual track inspections, diminishing fare evasion enforcement, eliminating some bus service to the Staten Island Ferry, and delaying the roll-out of two new faster bus service routes, known in transit-world jargon as Select Bus Service. Read more here.\n\nTOP TALKER: \u201dThe revelation that there could be significant fare increases or service reductions came after the news that Amazon was promised more than $2 billion in government incentives in exchange for locating a headquarters in Long Island City, Queens. The M.T.A. deficits have been caused in part by declining ridership, which has led to lower revenue projections. The decline is worrisome because it comes as the city\u2019s population is increasing and tourism is booming.Officials blamed the ridership drop on competition from Uber and other ride-hail apps, and on construction work on nights and weekends to fix the system. Some riders said they had become fed up by constant delays and had abandoned the subway. The authority expects growing deficits of $510 million in 2020 and $816 million in 2021, said Robert E. Foran, the agency\u2019s chief financial officer. Without new funding or huge service cuts, fares might have to rise by as much as 15 percent, he said.\u201d New York Times\u2019s Emma Fitzsimmons\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS: \u201cWith just weeks remaining in 2018, New York-Presbyterian is struggling to reach an agreement to remain in Empire BlueCross BlueShield's network.

Simcha Felder, when asked if he\u2019d be there. Felder, a registered Democrat from Brooklyn who regularly runs on both major party lines, has conferenced with Republicans since he was elected in 2012. After the Independent Democratic Conference dissolved in April, calls for him to join with other members of his party intensified, as he was responsible for giving the 31 Republicans control of a chamber in which 32 members are needed for a majority.\n\nBut Felder steadfastly declined to do so, saying that the resulting change in leadership would lead to \u201can unprecedented and uncertain late session political battle that will only hurt my constituents and New Yorkers.\u201d Democrats captured control of the Senate in last week's election and are poised to have at least 39 members in 2019, meaning Felder\u2019s status as a king-maker has ended. But the state senator, who has always said that he is more interested in helping his constituents than any partisan loyalties, has now expressed at least some interest in joining the Democrats now that they control the spoils.\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Bill Mahoney\n\nHOT COMPETITION FOR NO-POWER JOB \u2014 \u201cTwo Republican senators, including one from Western New York, are feverishly vying for a Senate leadership job with zero power in Albany over policy matters, the state budget or even parking lot assignments at the Capitol. Yet, senators John Flanagan of Long Island and Catharine Young from Olean, are coveting the right to be called Senate Minority Leader come January. That\u2019s when the GOP turns over the keys of the Senate to the Democrats, who will have an overwhelming majority when they come into power: 40 members of their conference compared with 23 for Republicans. Flanagan, the current Senate Majority Leader, and Young, the head of the Senate GOP campaign finance committee, have been burning up their phone lines in a pitched battle against each other. The voters are the 21 other Senate Republicans who will be returning to Albany.\u201d Buffalo News\u2019 Tom Precious\n\nNY SPENDS $4.8M MORE ON FILM HUB IN \u2018FINAL DISCONNECT\u2019 \u2014 \u201cState taxpayers will fork over another $4.8 million to help seed a film industry in Syracuse, where New York has already spent more than $16 million on a film hub that is used only sporadically. That's it for state funding to help the film hub, declared Howard Zemsky, who heads the state economic development agency, Empire State Development. Onondaga County bought the film studio from the state for $1 earlier this year. \u2018This is part of, really, the unwind for us at the film hub in Syracuse,\u2019 Zemsky told ESD board members today. \u2018We see this as kind of a final disconnect for us.\u2019 Empire State Development today approved a $4.8 million grant to an affiliate of CNY Arts , a nonprofit arts funding group, to help finance films made in Syracuse.\u201d Post-Standard\u2019s Tim Knauss\n\nASSEMBLYWOMAN JENNE WANTS NEW LEADERSHIP AT DANC \u2014 HERSELF \u2014 Outgoing Assemblywoman Addie A.E.

The job is currently held by former state Sen. James W. Wright, who has been in the position since 2009. Ms. Jenne said Wednesday that the Nov. 6 election left Democrats in the majority of both the state Assembly and Senate, potentially making appointments to DANC\u2019s board vulnerable to state control and leaving the board open to political interference. \u2018My advocacy would be to retain local control,\u2019 she said. \u2018If the board is concerned about that, that is something I would have relevant experience in and be able to advocate on behalf of regional control.\u2019\u201d Watertown Daily Times\u2019 Brian Kelly\n\nCIMINELLI ALLIES PLEAD FOR LENIENCY \u2014 \u201cIn his years as a prominent Buffalo businessman, Louis Ciminelli made some enemies, but he made lots of friends, spreading his time and money around to cultural groups, providing steady union jobs on his many projects and enjoying close ties with politicians across party lines. Now, as Ciminelli faces a possible prison sentence being handed down in a couple weeks, those friends and family are coming to his defense. Lawyers for the convicted former construction titan have turned to dozens of big and small players in the Buffalo community to try to convince a federal judge not to sentence him to any prison time when Ciminelli learns his fate later this month. From siblings and his children to political, cultural and business figures came pleas to U.S. District Court Judge Valerie Caproni to show leniency for Ciminelli, who was convicted last summer in a federal corruption case that found the Buffalo Billion solar plant project at RiverBend was the product of a rigged bid.\u201d Buffalo News\u2019 Tom Precious\n\n#Upstate America: John Lennon\u2019s killer, who is serving a life sentence at at Wende Correctional Facility, said he feels more shame every year.\n\n\n\nA message from Airbnb: The big hotel industry and hosts facing off is nothing new -- and the reality is that we remain at a stalemate, with real New Yorkers\u2019 lives hanging in the balance.

Solomont: \u201cThe Treasury Department drastically increased the number of all-cash deals that are subject to its anti-money laundering rules on Thursday. Starting Nov. 17, title insurance firms will be required to disclose the identity of LLC buyers who spend $300,000 or more on the real estate purchase. Previously, the rule applied to cash deals above $3 million in Manhattan and $1.5 million in New York City\u2019s other boroughs. The threshold was $2 million in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego; $1 million in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties in Florida; and $500,000 in San Antonio, Texas. The government\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) disclosed the revised rules Thursday.

TGIF.\n\nFAMILIAR FACES IN FACEBOOK SCANDAL \u2014 Facebook axed its relationship with Definers Public Affairs on Thursday after a bombshell New York Times report that the firm spread misinformation on Facebook's behalf in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And because there really always is a Massachusetts connection, one of the brains behind the Definers operation worked in the Romney administration on Beacon Hill.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDefiners Senior Vice President Colin Reed worked for former governor and Utah Senator-elect Mitt Romney in 2006 and 2007 and managed U.S. Ambassador Scott Brown's 2014 Senate campaign in New Hampshire. Most recently, he was executive director of the America Rising PAC during the 2016 election and he touts himself as a vocal critic of Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The founder of Definers also has Romney ties, although they're presidential. Matt Rhoades was the manager of Romney's presidential campaign against President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\nFacebook is under fire for using Definers to share opposition research and spread negative stories about critics, linking them to conservative punching bag George Soros, the Times reports. The practice is pretty common in Washington, but it's a bad look for Facebook, which is already facing sharp criticism for its business practices. Definers defended the research as \"entirely factual,\" according to a POLITICO report .\n\nIS LYNCH ON THE \u2018NO\u2019 LIST? \u2014 Count Rep. Stephen Lynch as a maybe. The South Boston congressman's office isn't saying whether he'll support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker. As lawmakers work behind the scenes to either secure Pelosi's top spot or topple her, it appears Lynch's name might be on a letter opposing Pelosi, according to a Huffington Post report published Thursday.\n\nLynch isn't what you'd call a Pelosi ally. In 2015, Lynch said Pelosi should consider resigning as minority leader because she wouldn't lead the party to a majority in 2016. He turned out to be right, and the following year, Lynch, Rep. Seth Moulton and Rep. Mike Capuano voted against her bid for minority leader. And years before, Pelosi had an uncomfortable exchange with Lynch in 2010, when she was rallying support for the health care bill. According to a Boston Globe report at the time, Lynch told Pelosi: \u201cLook, lady, I know a lot about this bill, and I am not for it.\u2019\u2019\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

The famed Draper Lab in Cambridge remains a highly sought after partner in the new space race.\n\nDraper Laboratory's history is intertwined with the American space program, dating back to its work developing the guidance and navigation systems for NASA's Apollo moon missions.\n\nOriginally founded in 1932 as the MIT Instrumentation Lab, the non-profit headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, also remains a key partner for the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, including playing a critical role on the Navy's Trident nuclear ballistic missile program.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut its engineers are now in steadily higher demand from space agencies and private companies around the world who are developing new satellites and spacecraft and in some cases also angling to go to the moon.\n\n\"It is absolutely growing. Not just in the United States but around the world.\" says Jennifer Jensen, a retired Army colonel and acquisition officer who took over earlier this year as Draper's vice president of national security and space.\n\n\"As technology matures different countries have the ability to have their own small space programs, with satellites,\" she explained, \"or put payloads on other satellites that they never did before. So we\u2019re seeing a tremendous growth in that.\"\n\nPOLITICO Space POLITICO\u2019s weekly must-read briefing on the second space age.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIndeed, the lab's work in commercial and civil space \"has doubled every year for the last three years,\" adds Jensen, who came to Draper from Sierra Nevada Corporation.\n\nShe spoke about some of the research center's long legacy of technological innovations -- including the atomic clock the first fly-by-wire aircraft, and more recently the solar protection for the avionics on NASA's Parker Probe -- as well as some of its new partnerships with NASA and private firms.\n\nThis transcript has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTell us about Draper Lab.\n\nWe are just about 1,750 people. Of those there is between 1,100 and 1,200 engineers. We are headquartered in Cambridge but we have offices across the country -- in Annapolis; Cape Canaveral; Houston; Huntsville; Pittsfield, Massachusetts; Reston, Virginia; St. Petersburg, Florida; Washington, D.C. Those satellite office s are geared mostly to be close to the customer to make sure we stay attuned with them. Our revenue is close to $600 million year on average.\n\nHow is Draper is different from other non-profit research and development centers?\n\nDraper started from the MIT Innovation Lab and it broke out in the 1960s to become an independent nonprofit, which is different from a federally-funded research and development center or university -affiliated research center.\n\nWe are just like any other company, basically. We have to compete for every contract that we have. Anything we have from profits we reinvest back into our company to support the national interest and various programs to keep us ahead of technology for our nation.\n\nThat is where we differ from the other non-profits. They get funding set aside in a funding line and they get it on an annual basis. They don\u2019t have to go compete. It is just given to them. We have flexibility because we can do any type of contracts. We can do completely commercial contracts. We can do military contracts. We have all sorts of customers and business models. At the same time, our core is we are here as a nonprofit for national interest and security, so we keep that in mind in everything we do.\n\nThe moon is in Draper\u2019s DNA.\n\nWe were on all the Apollo missions. We did the navigation and guidance. The company basically formed out of that. Everything is stemmed from that in some way or another.\n\nWhere is Draper now focused in commercial and civil space sector?\n\nThis is a growing business. Our customers there are NASA and then partnerships that we have with commercial industry. For instance, we just announced an award and a partnership with iSpace, a Japanese company that is going back to the moon for lunar mining services. We are partners with them on their navigation and guidance... and the flight computers and subterranean mapping of the moon. That one is completely commercial.\n\nWe would potentially use that same type of vehicle for a NASA service, which we also proposed for lunar landing services. It has applicability both ways. That is what is great about Draper. We have these technologies and even though it is developed for one, we can span across and re-purpose it sometimes to other areas. It is pretty exciting that we are going back to the moon in this capacity.\n\nDid you compete for the iSpace project?\n\nThey sought us out as a strategic partner. Draper is probably the world\u2019s leading space company that\u2019s been to the moon. We\u2019re the only ones around that has. So these commercial companies frequently seek us out for the navigation and guidance system.\n\nWhat is the relationship with Sierra Nevada?\n\nWe provide the navigation and guidance software in the flight computers for that mission [Dream Chaser]. We just completed a successful demonstration to NASA of that software in the last week in September. That was a major milestone to get through. It went absolutely perfect.\n\nWe also announced a teaming relationship we have for lunar landing services for NASA. We brought General Atomics in on that as well, with iSpace. We are doing the power propulsion element for several of the bidders. We have several in the making right now. There is a lot of activity.\n\nWe do navigation, landing, autonomy, docking for space stations, terrain mapping. We do micro sat thrusters. We do protection on the Parker Solar Probe. We did the solar protection for the avionics.\n\nHow has the space-related work evolved in recent years?\n\nIn that particular division division it has doubled every year for the last three years. We should be somewhere between $60 and $70 million this year we're hoping. We hope to exceed it, actually.\n\nIt is absolutely growing, Not just in the United States but around the world. As technology matures different countries have the ability to have their own small space programs, with satellites, or put payloads on other satellites that they never did before. So we\u2019re seeing a tremendous growth in that.\n\nHow do you view the proposed Space Force?\n\nIt is not unlike what happened back in the 30s and 40s when they were assessing whether to have an Air Force or not.\n\nI think they are going through the same thing and trying to make an assessment to see if that is appropriate at this point in time. Our stress is that the funding remain strong for however they decide to do it.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version misstated the title of the predecessor organization of Draper.\n\nThis article tagged under: POLITICO Space"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "daniel@politico.com (Daniel Lippman)", "title": "A way for Pelosi to win", "description": "And the GOP pushes President Donald Trump for a new attorney general amid the Robert Mueller uproar.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2018/11/16/a-way-for-pelosi-to-win-347994", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/2e/ae/d58212754da9b208dba97e11a19a/181116-house-dem-pelosi-msm-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:16:14Z", "content": "DRIVING THE DAY NEW ONE WAY FOR NANCY PELOSI TO WIN There are 48 DAYS until Nancy Pelosi is scheduled to face a floor vote for the speakership, and she is facing resistance like never before.

It would also suggest that, after years of internal wrangling within the Justice Department, prosecutors have decided to take a more aggressive tact against the secret-sharing website.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Assange\u2019s name was included in the document, though Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the Eastern District of Virginia \u2014 which had been investigating Assange \u2014 said, \u201cThe court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported late Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter, that Assange had indeed been charged.

Special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating whether Trump campaign associates had advance knowledge of Democratic emails that were published by WikiLeaks in the weeks before the 2016 election and that U.S. authorities have said were hacked by Russia. Any arrest could represent a significant development for Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the election.\n\nBarry Pollack, a lawyer for Assange, told the AP earlier this week that he had no information about possible charges against Assange.\n\nThe filing was discovered by Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who posted it on Twitter hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department was preparing to prosecute Assange and said, \u201cTo be clear, seems Freudian, it\u2019s for a different completely unrelated case, every other page is not related to him, EDVA just appears to have assange on the mind when filing motions to seal and used his name.\u201d\n\nAssange, 47, has resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy for more than six years in a bid to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was wanted to sex crimes, or to the United States, whose government he has repeatedly humbled with mass disclosures of classified information.\n\nThe Australian ex-hacker was once a welcome guest at the Embassy, which takes up part of the ground floor of a stucco-fronted apartment in London\u2019s posh Knightsbridge neighborhood.

Officials have also imposed a series of other restrictions on Assange\u2019s activities and visitors and - notably - ordered him to clean after his cat.\n\nWith shrinking options \u2014 an Ecuadorian lawsuit seeking to reverse the restrictions was recently turned down \u2014 WikiLeaks announced in September that former spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic journalist who has long served as one of Assange\u2019s lieutenants, would take over as editor-in-chief.\n\nWikiLeaks has attracted U.S. attention since 2010, when it published thousands of military and State Department documents from Army Pvt.

The two men who met me for lunch, a retired CIA agent and a former National Security Council official in the Trump administration, were wearing shorts and flip-flops. Otherwise, they were all business, and utterly serious. \u201cThere\u2019s substantial evidence that ISIS was involved in this,\u201d the former NSC staffer told me, a few minutes after we had settled into our booth at the back of the restaurant.\n\nHe was referring to the worst mass shooting in American history, which happened last year in Las Vegas when Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and wounded more than 800 others at an outdoor concert. According to a final report issued by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department on August 3, Paddock\u2019s motive was unclear, but he \u201cacted alone\u201d and had no links to \u201cany hate group or any domestic or foreign terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMy two lunch companions believe otherwise. They belong to a small group of about a dozen members from the intelligence and special operations community pushing the theory that Paddock\u2019s rampage was part of a coordinated anti-Trump plot involving the Islamic State and Antifa, or left-wing \u201canti-fascist\u201d activists.\n\nI know, it sounds nuts.\n\nThe idea sprang from the twisted, feverish mind of Infowars\u2019 Alex Jones days after the Vegas attack. \u201cThey found Antifa information in the room,\u201d Jones claimed in one telecast. \u201cThe whole thing has the hallmarks of being scripted by deep-state Democrats and their Islamic allies using mental-patient cutouts,\u201d he said. Others of his ilk then amplified the unsubstantiated Antifa-ISIS allegations on social media in what became a frothy concoction of phony tweets, Facebook posts and YouTube videos.\n\nBut weeks later, the theory took on a life of its own in an ad hoc \u201calternative\u201d investigation spearheaded by my two lunch companions\u2014Brad Johnson, a retired CIA officer, and Rich Higgins, a former Pentagon official who last year served for a few months in the White House as director of strategic planning for the National Security Council. (Yes, the same Rich Higgins who infamously got tossed off the NSC for writing a controversial memo warning that \u201cIslamists,\u201d \u201cglobalists\u201d and the \u201cdeep state\u201d together were trying to subvert Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.) A month after the October shooting in Vegas, Johnson, Higgins and a handful of associates collaborated on a 51-page PowerPoint document based, according to its executive summary, on \u201copen source information with tactical counter terrorism analysis, cyber intelligence, and digital data mining capabilities.\u201d Higgins and Johnson told me they sent the document to contacts in the CIA and FBI, as well as to conservatives in Congress and the media. Higgins claims a current FBI agent in his and Johnson\u2019s circle\u2014who he says had input on the document\u2014\u201cfiled it as a formal report with the bureau.\u201d\n\nSo far, however, nobody with any real standing has taken the document seriously, much less acknowledged having received it. The findings of the Las Vegas police investigation\u2014in which the FBI was of assistance\u2014directly contradict Higgins and Johnson\u2019s theory. In response to questions about the theory, Sandra Breault, an FBI spokesperson, said only: \u201cThe FBI Las Vegas office has the utmost confidence in our agents and analysts\u2019 investigative techniques.\u201d The CIA declined to comment.\n\nEven as there appears to be no evidence supporting Higgins and Johnson\u2019s theory, it is having alarming, real-world effects. At least one member of Congress whom Higgins says he briefed about the theory appears to have parroted its contents on television.\n\nI learned about Johnson's and Higgins\u2019 effort months ago, while interviewing Higgins for a previous article. I said I would look into the story only if he and his co-authors put their names and faces to the document, which they had not yet done. And so, on a broiling late summer day, I met him and Johnson at the Cheesecake Factory in the Fair Oaks Mall in Northern Virginia. I made it clear at the outset that I was skeptical. Higgins sat stone-faced beside me in the booth, as Johnson explained why I should read between the lines of the final law enforcement report that found \u201cno evidence\u201d linking Paddock to any terrorists. \u201cWhen they say there is no evidence of terrorist involvement, what they are saying is, at the level of proof, they have found no evidence,\u201d Johnson asserted. He paused for an instant, keeping his eyes tightly locked on me. \u201cNow, at the level of intelligence, it is frickin\u2019 chin deep in it.\u201d\n\nEven as there appears to be no hard evidence supporting Higgins' and Johnson\u2019s theory, and very little support for it outside the authors of the document, it is having alarming, real-world effects. At least one member of Congress whom Higgins says he briefed about the theory appears to have parroted its contents on television. And, as with conspiracy theories that have arisen in other national tragedies, from 9/11 to Sandy Hook, the Vegas theory has caused measurable damage: the Higgins and Johnson report, which was posted online anonymously earlier this year, goes so far as to name an individual they allege was Paddock\u2019s accomplice and had \u201cpossible ties to Islamic organizations and possible Islamic State linkage.\u201d That man, Brian Hodge, an Australian native based in Los Angeles who was at the Mandalay Bay on the night of the shooting, spoke with me\u2014and vehemently denies any involvement. He also told me the attention he has gotten from Higgins' and Johnson\u2019s claim\u2014their report contains detailed personal information about him\u2014has led to death threats and strangers showing up at his home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a living nightmare,\u201d Hodge told me by phone.\n\nAP\n\nWhat\u2019s also alarming about this particular conspiracy is that it\u2019s being driven by people who not long ago held senior positions in the intelligence community and who still have access to members of the government. One day in late September, Higgins texted me via Signal: \u201cI was told by a fairly senior former official that the Bureau has placed everyone knowledgeable on Vegas under a gag order with threats of polygraphs. Even formers have been told, \u2018Shut the fuck up\u2019.\u201d In other words, the government, Higgins claimed, wasn\u2019t allowing officials to follow up on his and Johnson\u2019s supposed leads. I don\u2019t know if this is true. What\u2019s clear is that Higgins\u2019 very ties to a network of intelligence officers, analysts, agents and contractors have fed into his conspiracy theories\u2014and reinforced his and Johnson\u2019s determination to stay on the case, with little regard for the consequences.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt a news conference on October 5, 2017, Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo was still reeling from the heinous magnitude of the carnage. Days earlier, Paddock had fired more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition into a crowd of 22,000 country music fans gathered on the Las Vegas strip. It was a chillingly premeditated act: Paddock had stockpiled an arsenal of weaponry in his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, which overlooked the concert venue. In addition to the 24 high-powered rifles in his hotel room, police found explosives in his car parked in the hotel\u2019s garage. (Paddock shot himself dead before police got to him.)\n\n\u201cDo you think this was all accomplished on his own?\u201d an anguished Lombardo asked at the news conference. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point.\u201d Such speculation ran wild in the days and weeks after the shooting. Part of this stemmed from the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cnews\u201d agency having declared a role in the attack; as some experts observed at the time, the propaganda arm of the Islamic State tends not to make false claims about such events. But no evidence was ever offered by the jihadis, and the FBI ruled out the possibility. Lombardo also moved away from the possibility that Paddock had help.\n\nStill, it was hard for some observers to accept that Paddock had acted alone. Within weeks of the massacre, Higgins and Johnson\u2019s small hive of like minds in the intelligence and special ops community\u2014among them a retired Delta Force troop commander and a former member of Seal Team 6, according to Higgins\u2014informally teamed up to examine data they thought investigators were ignoring. The work was done mostly in conference calls and via email, Higgins told me. It included an analysis of acoustic signatures from cellphone videos recorded during the shooting and posted on YouTube, which led them to believe a second gunman was likely involved. This conspiracy theory had spread on the internet days after the Vegas tragedy, and was firmly rebuffed by law enforcement and independent fact-checkers.\n\nNo matter. The document authored by Higgins and Johnson argues that Paddock was likely killed by another collaborator in the room with him in \u201can op gone bad.\u201d No evidence from the hotel room supports this theory; Paddock\u2019s death was ruled a suicide. Nonetheless, the supposed collaborator is identified in the PowerPoint document: Brian Hodge.\n\nThe broken windows of Mandalay Bay, the hotel from which Stephen Paddock opened fire on concertgoers, killing 58 people. | AP\n\nHodge, who moved to the United States from Australia in 2013, was in Las Vegas for business the night of the massacre and was staying in the same hotel as Paddock, in a room on the same floor. According to Hodge, he was returning to his room as the shooting unfolded, so he fled downstairs and hid in some bushes outside the hotel, posting on social media in real-time about what he thought was happening. Although he was not an actual witness to anything, he talked about being onsite and disseminated faulty information he pulled off the internet. At one point, he posted, \u201cThere are multiple shooters with automatic weapons.\u201d All this caught the attention of Australian media, who knew of Hodge because of his career in the entertainment industry, and Hodge gave a series of interviews in the hours after the shooting in which he talked about hiding in those bushes for hours, until a Las Vegas SWAT team led him to safety. Unfortunately, Hodge also made misstatements\u2014for instance, mistakenly saying his hotel room was next door to the shooter\u2019s, rather than just on the same floor.\n\nHodge says an FBI agent from the Las Vegas field office called him the day after the shooting to ask him about the media statements he had made. (An FBI spokesperson says the Bureau does not confirm, much less discuss, interviews with any of the witnesses in the investigation.) While nothing appeared to come from the interview, Hodge found himself the subject of wild speculation on the internet in the days after the shooting. YouTubers and bloggers dissected his media appearances, raising questions about his various misstatements and assertions.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nSoon enough, all this became gruel for Higgins and Johnson, who examined Hodge\u2019s digital footprint on social media and, in turn, came to believe he was \u201cthe go-between ISIS and Antifa,\u201d as Higgins told me over lunch. The unsubstantiated conjecture is based on a hodgepodge of spurious assumptions. For example, this is how the authors infer in their PowerPoint that Hodge is somehow connected to Antifa: \u201cWhile not excessively political, it is clear from his Facebook activity that Mr. Hodge supports left wing issues such as transgender rights, support of gay marriage, and that he holds some anti-right wing views.\u201d One piece of evidence given for Hodge\u2019s supposed ISIS ties is that he allegedly ate at a Turkish d\u00f6ner kebab restaurant in New Mexico in the days after the attack. Except even that is untrue, according to Hodge, who insists he never traveled to New Mexico, much went to the restaurant.\n\nIn the days and weeks after the shooting, when Hodge saw that he was becoming the focus of conspiracy theories, he changed his social media privacy settings so that only select friends and family had access. To Higgins and Johnson, this was suspicious. In their document, they write that in some cases, \u201cthe purposeful deletion of data is evidence of consciousness of guilt,\u201d and \u201csince the Las Vegas attack, Mr. Hodge has attempted to conceal his electronic Social Media presence, locking down his Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts.\u201d Hodge insists he has never deleted any of his social media posts. Regardless, instead of thinking that Hodge might be scared\u2014since many people experiencing internet wrath withdraw from social media\u2014the authors became so suspicious that they recommended in their report that Hodge be put under \u201cNational level surveillance\u201d via FISA. When I asked whether they had ever simply tried to contact Hodge as they constructed their speculative narrative, they admitted they had not. \u201cThat\u2019s not my job,\u201d Higgins said to me recently. \u201cThat\u2019s the FBI\u2019s job.\u201d\n\nFor a while after the shooting, Hodge was unaware of the unofficial attention he had attracted from various former members of the intelligence community. He tried to put the episode behind him. But he noticed that Laura Loomer, a notorious internet conspiracy monger, had started to become obsessed with him on Twitter. (Loomer is a regular guest and contributor at Infowars, where she has spun numerous conspiracies related to the Las Vegas shooting.) Hodge says a friend in the media and entertainment industry advised him it was best to ignore the fringy elements inhabiting the dark underbelly of the internet.\n\nThen, sometime this past spring, Higgins' and Johnson\u2019s document got posted online. It was so unnerving to Hodge\u2014particularly because it contained his personal information\u2014that he called the FBI switchboard, asking for help. Hodge told me that an agent from the Los Angeles field office responded to him over the phone and told him there wasn\u2019t anything the Bureau could do about the anonymous conspiracy theories circulating on the internet. The document was soon seized on by Loomer and other far-right conspiracists, triggering another round of vitriol. Panicking, Hodge emailed the same FBI agent he had spoken with on the phone: \u201cI really need some help from the FBI to shut this down,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cIt is getting very scary and is having a massive impact on my life.\u201d In a response email, which Hodge provided to me, the agent advised Hodge to report any threats or harassment to his local police department. Hodge told me he never personally filed a police report but that a friend\u2014who he says is a \u201chigh-profile\u201d figure in the entertainment industry\u2014contacted the LAPD threat unit on his behalf. An officer I spoke with at the unit couldn\u2019t tell me over the phone whether anyone connected to Hodge had filed such a report, but he did say that it is very rare for the department to investigate claims made through a third party.\n\nBoth Higgins and Johnson claim they did not post the document online. Of course, none of this is any consolation to Hodge, who is most upset by the privacy violations with which he has contended. \u201cHis complaint is valid,\u201d Higgins acknowledged to me. \u201cI don\u2019t think his shit should have been posted all over the internet.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt lunch, Higgins, a 44-year-old former Army serviceman, wore a black T-shirt with a logo for Operation Restored Warrior, a religious veterans\u2019 organization. He credits the group with helping him steady his life in 2011, after a turbulent stretch in the Pentagon. According to Ed McCallum, the former director of the Combatting Terrorism Technical Support Office and Higgins\u2019 boss from 2002 to 2010, Higgins distinguished himself as a brash, innovative thinker\u2014but often butted heads with leadership and \u201cmade some enemies\u201d at the Pentagon. Higgins left the Defense Department in 2013. He says he wanted to make more money in the private sector, but McCallum says Higgins was also feeling besieged. \u201cI protected him for a while,\u201d McCallum told me, \u201cbut they went after him hard.\u201d\n\nHiggins has a history of propagating controversial ideas. An ally of Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump\u2019s first, short-lived national security adviser, and Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former political strategist, Higgins was an early Trump supporter and traveled with the 2016 presidential campaign before joining the administration. The controversial memo he penned while at the National Security Council distills his worldview: \u201cCultural Marxist narratives,\u201d he wrote\u2014that is, the \u201cforced inclusion of post-modern notions of tolerance\u201d such as \u201ctransgender acceptance\u201d\u2014are destroying America\u2019s \u201cJudeo-Christian culture.\u201d Higgins argued that this was all part of a larger \u201cpolitical warfare campaign\u201d waged by \u201cIslamists\u201d in concert with the \u201chard left.\u201d McCallum told me that Higgins developed these ideas (some of which McCallum agrees with) while writing his 2010 National Defense University master\u2019s thesis, in which Higgins describes Islam as \u201ca threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nHiggins has kept a mostly low profile since his memo leaked last year and was widely ridiculed. (Slate called it \u201cface-melting gibberish.\u201d) Remarried and recently having become a father for the third time, he told me he splits his time between government contract work and strategic communications for a new nonprofit called Unconstrained Analytics. On his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he describes himself as \u201can expert on information age unconventional warfare.\u201d\n\nGuns litter the interior of Stephen Paddock\u2019s hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas after the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting. | Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department via AP\n\nHiggins says he \u201cwas brought on to the Vegas thing\u201d by Johnson, with whom he had worked at an interagency level when Johnson was at the CIA in the 2000s. Johnson, retired a decade ago after a 25-year career as a senior operations officer and chief of station in various overseas assignments. \u201cI made things go bump in the night,\u201d he said with a grin, as we sipped our coffee. Several years ago, he founded a nonprofit organization called Americans for Intelligence Reform, which according to its website, was created to draw attention to \u201cpolitical corruption and diminished capabilities within the intelligence community.\u201d Johnson is among those who are convinced that an entrenched \u201cdeep state\u201d\u2014both Obama administration holdovers and establishment Republicans\u2014is trying to sabotage Trump. He periodically expounds on this view and his Las Vegas theories in interviews with fringe media outlets, most notably Jack Posobiec of One America News network, who helped to spread the \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy in 2016.\n\nHiggins\u2019 and Johnson\u2019s views about the so-called deep state, the left and Islam are clearly at the heart of their Vegas conspiracy. The official police investigation of the shooting suggests that Paddock, a reclusive 64-year-old gambler, had psychological problems\u2014his personal doctor thought he was manic-depressive. According to the final police report, \u201cPaddock would often complain of being sick and told [his girlfriend] that doctors couldn\u2019t cure him.\u201d The report says he would get bad headaches from chemical smells and took to wearing cotton gloves. Family members noted that he had grown \u201cirritable\u201d in recent years and that he did not look well. (The FBI says it will release its own psychological profile of Paddock\u2014a \u201cbehavioral analysis report\u201d\u2014later this year, which will \u201cpiece together the why,\u201d as Aaron Rouse, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Las Vegas field office, put it in a recent radio interview.)\n\nHiggins and Johnson, however, say the attack was all about \u201canti-Trump bias,\u201d in Higgins\u2019 words. He and Johnson told me Paddock was a registered Democrat in Florida. (In fact, this was an internet rumor; according to his family, Paddock had no political affiliation.) Johnson also told me Paddock had \u201ctargeted\u201d country music fans, which he characterized as a natural Trump fan base. To Higgins, the timing of Paddock\u2019s apparent plotting\u2014just before Trump was elected, he began purchasing dozens of weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition\u2014was the biggest \u201cindicator\u201d of the anti-Trump sentiment Paddock apparently was motivated by.\n\nPerhaps, I countered at lunch, it stemmed from personal demons eating away at Paddock\u2014something unknowable that, as one of his brothers said, \u201cdrove him into the pit of hell.\u201d Johnson grew perturbed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re set up to absorb and process what you\u2019re being told,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Higgins and Johnson see it, this deep-state machinery is also what\u2019s preventing the FBI from pursuing their \u201cleads\u201d in the Vegas shooting. Higgins believes this lack of interest can be traced to then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe allegedly giving the order to \u201cbury the investigation.\u201d Higgins offers no proof but speculates that it was done to save face because the FBI had \u201cnot been following up on these anti-Trump activists.\u201d (A spokesperson for McCabe declined to comment.)\n\nOK, but McCabe has left the FBI, I noted. So, what would be preventing the Bureau from following up now, if there were good reason to do so?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThe Bureau isn\u2019t going to go back. \u2026 It would just rip the country apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cMcCabe is gone, but everything remains the same,\u201d Johnson chimed in. \u201c[Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein isn\u2019t going to want this to come out.\u201d\n\nI mentioned that hundreds of agents from multiple federal and state agencies had participated in the official Vegas investigation. Were they all part of a massive cover-up?\n\nHiggins and Johnson were silent for moment. \u201cEverybody does what you\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSitting here and talking to us right now, saying, \u2018How could the FBI be denying? How could they all be misleading us?\u2019 And so forth. But it\u2019s all bullshit. Almost nothing you think is true is true.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nNot everyone has been as skeptical as I am. In January, Congressman Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show to talk about what he considered to be \u201ccredible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus\u201d regarding the Las Vegas shooting massacre. Perry didn\u2019t offer any specifics when pressed by another guest on the show\u2014a lawyer for the shooting victims\u2014and he wouldn\u2019t say where he got his information. His remarks were denounced across the political spectrum, including by members of Nevada\u2019s congressional delegation, who demanded an apology. According to Higgins, Perry\u2014who did not respond to requests for comment for this article\u2014was referring on-air to the document compiled by Higgins and Johnson. Higgins told me that Perry was one of about a dozen Republican members of Congress he and Johnson briefed about the Vegas theory, and that Higgins briefed Perry himself.\n\nIn front of the iconic, retro \"Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas\" sign, mourners placed flowers and candles. | AP\n\nSince then, only alt-right fringe media figures have been willing to take the document at face value\u2014people like Loomer and Posobiec, who have clashed over who deserves more credit for propagating the theory first. (Loomer, for her part, remains fixated on Hodge, and also insists that ISIS is responsible for the Las Vegas shooting.) At the Cheesecake Factory, Higgins was palpably frustrated that his group\u2019s \u201calternative analysis\u201d could not get traction beyond the internet\u2019s backwaters. I told him it didn\u2019t help that the other contributors to the document refused to come out from the shadows.\n\n\u201cWhy should they?\u201d Johnson said. He launched into an anti-media rant. \u201cWhat do you represent to them? Trouble. Liars. You\u2019re going to sabotage them in the press. That\u2019s what always happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been talking to me,\u201d I said, pointing to Higgins.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t use me as an example,\u201d Higgins said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m like Swiss cheese over here. I\u2019ve already been shot to shit. I can say anything now.\u201d\n\nBrian Hodge knows this all too well. He told me he has hired a lawyer to help him figure out a way forward, and that experts he has consulted have told him, \u201cThis is never going away.\u201d He feels that the FBI hung him out to dry, and the whole ordeal has made him distrusting and fearful. \u201cI look over my shoulders all the time now,\u201d he says. He believes his phone is being tapped.\n\nThe paranoia that has overtaken him is, oddly enough, a trait I also detected in his two accusers. At one point during our lunch, Johnson said, \u201cI get death threats all the time,\u201d and talked about being \u201ctargeted by the Chinese.\u201d Higgins likewise believes his phone is being monitored.\n\nStill, they remain undeterred, and hopeful they can persuade influential\u2014and somewhat more mainstream\u2014conservative allies to take up the case. \u201cWe talked to Tucker Carlson,\u201d Johnson confided over lunch. \u201cHe found it very exciting and wanted to do it, but it got spiked.\u201d Carlson told me by phone that he did talk with Higgins\u2014but he categorically denied wanting to run the story and being overruled. \u201cI\u2019ve never talked to any supervisor at Fox about this story,\u201d Carlson told me. \u201cSo, nobody put the kibosh on it. The reason we couldn\u2019t do the story is we couldn\u2019t prove it.\u201d\n\nThat leaves Higgins in the company of the Infowars crowd. It\u2019s a place no one with any standing in the intelligence community wants to be, and Higgins knows this. \u201cThe Loomers of the world are devastating to folks like me,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything is a conspiracy to them.\u201d\n\nKeith Kloor is a writer in New York and adjunct professor of journalism at New York University."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "drobertson@politico.com (Derek Robertson)", "title": "Michelle Obama Wants to Save Politics By Staying Out of Them", "description": "The most popular Democrat in America is doing just fine outside the arena, thanks.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/11/16/michelle-obama-wants-to-save-politics-by-staying-out-of-them-222575", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/06/b2/63878abc4ebfbc46354da5122e9c/gettyimages-1061264576.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:10:36Z", "content": "Michelle Obama is not running for president, people close to her insist.

And she\u2019s not running for mayor of Chicago, or for Congress, or for the Board of Overseers at Harvard, where her older daughter Malia started last year.

A recent poll featured her at the top of the heap among Democratic women facing President Trump in a theoretical 2020 matchup, beating him by a whopping 13 points. Just a day after the 2016 election, CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza tweeted: \u201cThrowing it out there: Michelle Obama in 2020? It\u2019s not totally crazy ... \u201d\n\nBut as Hillary Clinton can attest, absence from the field of presidential candidates tends to make voters\u2019 hearts grow fonder\u2014once the former secretary of State, who at one point was more popular than Barack Obama or Joe Biden, declared her intention to run, she saw her ratings plummet. Or just ask her husband, who entered the White House with a not-inconsiderable 41 percent approval rating among Republicans\u2014only to leave office with that number at 14 percent.\n\nThen there\u2019s the sheer soul-crushing misery of running for office in the era of 24/7 cable news, social media and Donald Trump\u2014and the very qualities that make Michelle Obama such an appealing alternative to so many voters are what make her exceedingly unlikely to run.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot about politics she doesn\u2019t like,\u201d says Axelrod. \u201cThe coarseness, the meanness, sometimes the silliness, the focus on the trivial \u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nSo why the memoir, why all the voter participation efforts, if she doesn\u2019t want to be in the arena? The former first lady believes she can get close enough to the heart of politics to make a difference without wading into the partisan fray, people familiar with her thinking say.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s been clear that she doesn\u2019t have a love of politics, but [her recent activities are] her way of encouraging people to stand up for who they are and the things they feel are important,\u201d says Susan Sher, Obama\u2019s former chief of staff. \u201cThat\u2019s key to her, as opposed to saying, \u2018Vote for this person vs. that person.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn that spirit, just this year she\u2019s launched the nonpartisan When We All Vote, aimed at boosting midterm turnout, and the Global Girls Alliance, a program through the Obama Foundation aimed at educating girls in the United States and the developing world. And, of course, there\u2019s the rock-star-adjacent stadium tour and best-selling memoir; extra tour dates were added in Washington and Brooklyn to accommodate demand, and book retailer Barnes & Noble announced this week they haven\u2019t seen as high demand for any book since the 2015 release of Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cGo Set a Watchman.\u201d\n\nIn other words, when the ongoing slap-fight between Democrats and Republicans goes low, Michelle Obama plans to keep going high, hoping her megawatt celebrity can bring some of the civic goodwill that surrounded her husband\u2019s political ascent back to a bitterly divided country. If Democrats are looking for a savior to deliver them from Trump, it won\u2019t be her.\n\n***\n\nAlthough she\u2019s been reluctant to wade into Democratic politics, it can hardly be said that Michelle Obama has remained neutral since leaving the White House\u2014and every time she\u2019s fired back at the Trump administration, it\u2019s only made the calls more fervent for her to throw down the gauntlet and challenge Republicans at the polls. When Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in May 2017 delayed a requirement for healthier school lunches that she\u2019d championed as part of her Let\u2019s Move! health campaign, she fired back on all cylinders at a public conference: \u201cThink about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap ... if somebody is doing that, they don\u2019t care about your kid.\u201d\n\nThe subject of children\u2019s health and welfare is clearly close to Obama\u2019s heart\u2014the Let\u2019s Move! initiative was her first major endeavor as first lady, and she writes in \u201cBecoming\u201d of how personally the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre affected her and the former president.\n\n\u201cShe was the mom-in-chief, and people absolutely adored that,\u201d says Democratic strategist and pollster Celinda Lake. \u201cShe\u2019s had a 10-year conversation with the American public, and they\u2019ve valued what she\u2019s said because she uses her voice selectively; she hasn\u2019t been out there every five minutes using her voice in a political way.\u201d\n\nHer occasional tetchiness at Trump aside, Obama has mostly maintained that equilibrium in her post-White House political life. Her unique ability to critique Trump\u2019s worldview, as she did in September after the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d remarks at the United Nations General Assembly, while maintaining her benevolent aura is exactly why some think she\u2019d be such a formidable candidate (Cillizza once referred to her as the president\u2019s \u201ckryptonite\u201d). Despite their constant rebuffing, the calls for her to run are ubiquitous for a reason\u2014YouGov ranks her as the third-most popular American in the world, behind only Bill Gates and her husband, and the most popular person in the world full stop among millennials.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for her dislike of politics, but I wish she would run,\u201d sighs Lake. \u201cShe would be an unparalleled leader, but she\u2019ll be one in whichever realm she chooses.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would be amazing [as a candidate],\u201d gushes Andrea Steele, president and founder of Democratic nonprofit Emerge America. \u201cI\u2019d love to see her be recruiter-in-chief now \u2026 maybe she doesn\u2019t want to run, but she could be a tremendous recruiter in all of these cities [on her book tour], if she made the pitch.\u201d\n\nLynda Tran of the progressive firm 270 Strategies underscored the weight a figure like Obama carries on the stump for Democrats, where she was absent this year in favor of When We All Vote\u2019s nonpartisan outreach efforts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably no better surrogate on the campaign trail, no better ally to have onstage than Michelle Obama,\u201d says Tran. \u201cYou\u2019d be crazy as a Democratic candidate if you didn\u2019t want to have Michelle standing next to you.\u201d\n\nThose in Obama\u2019s camp, however, believe an effort that reaches more than just dyed-in-the-wool Democrats will be more effective in the long run\u2014and more in line with her personal goals and mission.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure [When We All Vote\u2019s] reach was as broad as it could be,\u201d says Tina Tchen, Obama\u2019s former chief of staff in the East Wing and treasurer of the nonprofit today. \u201cWe partnered with a lot of college voter registration efforts, we wanted to make sure make sure we could go into all sorts of settings \u2026 that was the idea, making sure the reach was as broad as it could and doing it in a nonpartisan way.\u201d\n\n\u201cParticipation was the aim,\u201d says Axelrod. \u201cAnd, you know, to the extent that her efforts went [with When We All Vote], they were successful, because we saw the greatest midterm turnout in a century.\u201d When We All Vote can\u2019t quantify exactly how many voters it registered and turned out, but a post-midterm statement from the group\u2019s CEO, Kyle Lierman, boasted of reaching more than 220 million individuals via social media and reaching over 3.7 million voters via text.\n\nOf course, when voter participation spikes, it happens to benefit Democrats more than their opponents, a fact that\u2019s surely not lost on Obama and her allies. But the nonpartisan approach is largely in line with how she and the former president have approached his post-presidency, with only the occasional glancing shot at the current occupant of the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cA huge part of her brand and emphasis was on what are fundamental American values\u2014inclusiveness, fighting for a better future for our children and families,\u201d says Tran. \u201cThese are all things that are aspirational goals, regardless of your side of the aisle.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOf course, it\u2019s one thing to espouse the values of unity, inclusiveness, and civic responsibility\u2014it\u2019s another entirely to successfully sell voters on their value. Modern political history is littered with the footnotes of otherwise milquetoast political figures hoping to appeal to an idealized American identity; the Obamas\u2019 enduring popularity comes from their ability to do it well.\n\nTo what, then, can you ascribe Michelle\u2019s ability to act as such an effective messenger even if her message is fairly ethereal? Both Obama world insiders and Democratic onlookers had largely the same response, which could be boiled down to one word\u2014a trait she paradoxically shares with Trump, who rode his tell-it-like-it-is persona into the White House:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very authentic,\u201d says Tchen.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an authentic, passionate, hip person,\u201d says Axelrod.\n\n\u201cWe often talk about authenticity in politics, and she\u2019s definitely authentic,\u201d says Tran.\n\n\u201cI think that I\u2019ve known her for something like 27 years, and she\u2019s exactly the same person,\u201d says Sher.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo if Michelle Obama\u2019s not running, but she\u2019s got what it takes to defeat Trump, is there anyone else in the Democratic Party who does, too? Several Democratic insiders referred to the same troika of Beto O\u2019Rourke, Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to see how any of them could carve out a path to the presidency, and that\u2019s why the calls for Michelle Obama to run, however futile, will probably keep coming even as her friends keep shooting them down.\n\n\u201cWould she be great? Yes,\u201d says Sher. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be fair to her. I do not think she should run for office.\u201d\n\nDerek Robertson is a news assistant for POLITICO Magazine.

James Lankford (R-Okla.) said Trump\u2019s pick would have to assure lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that Mueller would be able to continue unimpeded.\n\n\u201cIt would be helpful to start moving \u2026 so we can have that person in place as soon as possible,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cWhoever is going to be there would have to make clear statements about what they intend to do on the special counsel. The sooner the better. Let\u2019s get it resolved.\"\n\nThe White House is working to find a broadly acceptable pick for the job. The president's legal team has reached out to former Attorney General Bill Barr to gauge his interest in the position, according to sources familiar with the conversations. Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration, didn't say no, but he did tell the president's lawyers he'd prefer they look at other options.\n\nThe Trump team has begun that process, and those options include Barr's Kirkland and Ellis partner Mark Filip, who served as deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration. The Senate unanimously confirmed him to that post.\n\nThe challenge with more traditional choices like Barr and Filip, with whom the president does not have a personal relationship, will be persuading Trump that he can trust them, the president's allies say. They are aware they will have to call on people like the Federalist Society\u2018s Leonard Leo to vouch for their personal loyalty and sterling credentials.\n\nTrump insisted this week that people are clamoring to be chosen for the post, despite the difficult balancing act it will take between aiding Trump and overseeing the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"I have been called by so many people wanting that job. We have some great people. In the meantime, I think Matt\u2019s going to do a fantastic job,\u201d Trump told the Daily Caller on Wednesday.\n\nNo matter whom Trump picks, the attorney general nominee is unlikely to be confirmed until next year. But the nominee could quickly pledge to protect Mueller if confirmed, and keep most Senate Republicans in line and away from pushing the special-counsel protection bill on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cWhether it happens now or next year in the Senate, we\u2019re pretty well positioned to move forward. We\u2019ll have the votes we think, assuming it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s well qualified, and I expect them to be,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who will take over as majority whip next year.\n\n\u201cSooner rather than later,\u201d added Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally. \u201cIf the investigation is still ongoing, yeah, they need to protect him.\u201d\n\nHowever, any pledge to protect Mueller from a nominee or a confirmed attorney general would set off Trump and be viewed as a betrayal akin to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal.\n\nWhat is more likely, Trump allies say, is silence. That's what Whitaker has given, avoiding a statement that would enrage the president and an attack on Mueller that would alienate Republicans already suspicious of him. The next attorney general is likely to operate the same way, leaving both the president and senators unsatisfied.\n\nAbsent a pledge from Sessions\u2019 successor to lay off Mueller, any nominee would be enormously difficult to confirm and would quickly turn off the prospect of Democratic support.\n\n\u201cIf I had someone coming in that I thought would pull the plug on Mueller, it would be a problem,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, a moderate Democrat who opposed Sessions.\n\nBoth he and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said legislation to shield the special counsel from a Trump firing must be passed regardless, given the uncertainty in the Justice Department\u2019s leadership.\n\nWhitaker \u201cmay resign tomorrow and we may get a new attorney general,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cBetter for us to have the Mueller protection in place regardless of who the attorney general is.\"\n\nFor the next month a half, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) must deal with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and his vow to vote against judicial nominees absent an opportunity to vote on the special counsel bill. But Flake is alone in his stand at the moment among Republicans, and he could remain there if Trump moves on an attorney general.\n\nSens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said they won\u2019t join Flake but believe he should get a vote on the special counsel bill. Corker, however, said it \u201ccould\u201d help if Trump acts quickly on an attorney general nominee and suggested that Flake may end up getting a nonbinding \u201csense of the Senate\u201d vote.\n\nCollins and Flake, however, said they want a binding vote to protect Mueller, despite concerns of other GOP senators. The Senate GOP discussed the bill\u2019s potential constitutional issues at a private lunch on Thursday, Corker said.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump lashed out at Mueller on Twitter, calling the investigation a \u201ctotal mess\u201d and accusing the special counsel of protecting Democrats.\n\nThe legislation should come up in light of Trump\u2019s \u201cfiring of Jeff Sessions, his installation of Matt Whitaker, and also his tweet this morning, all of which are disturbing to me,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI really wish the president had followed the advice of many of us in the very beginning and never commented on this investigation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, top Democrats and Flake are floating demands that any bill passed to prevent a government shutdown next month include language shielding Mueller, something Republicans have resisted.\n\n\u201cThe final goal is to put it as part of the spending bill and get it signed into law, but the first goal has to be having a vote on the floor.

That led authorities to devise a staggered evacuation plan \u2014 one that they used when fire came again last week.\n\nBut Paradise\u2019s carefully laid plans quickly devolved into a panicked exodus last week. Some survivors said that by the time they got warnings, the flames were already extremely close, and they barely escaped with their lives. Others said they received no warnings at all.\n\nNow authorities are facing questions of whether they took the right approach.\n\nReeny Victoria Breevaart, who lives in Magalia, a forested community of 11,000 people north of Paradise, said she couldn\u2019t receive warnings because cellphones weren\u2019t working. She also lost electrical power.\n\nJust over an hour after the first evacuation order was issued at 8 a.m., she said, neighbors came to her door to say: \u201cYou have to get out of here.\u201d\n\nShari Bernacett, who with her husband managed a mobile home park in Paradise where they also lived, received a text ordering an evacuation. \u201cWithin minutes the flames were on top of us,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, survivors said authorities need to devise a plan to reach residents who can\u2019t get a cellphone signal in the hilly terrain or don\u2019t have cellphones at all.\n\nIn his defense, Honea said evacuation orders were issued through 5,227 emails, 25,643 phone calls and 5,445 texts, in addition to social media and the use of loudspeakers. As cellphone service went down, authorities went into neighborhoods with bullhorns to tell people to leave, and that effort saved lives.\n\nHonea said he was too busy with the emergency and the recovery of human remains to analyze how the evacuation went. But he said it was a big, chaotic, fast-moving situation, and there weren\u2019t enough law enforcement officers to go out and warn everyone.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have thousands and thousands of people in shelters would clearly indicate that we were able to notify a significant number of people,\u201d the sheriff said.\n\nSome evacuees were staying in tents and cars at a Walmart parking lot and in a nearby field in Chico, though volunteers are planning to close the makeshift shelter by Sunday.\n\nA Sunday closure \u201cgives us enough time to maybe figure something out,\u201d said Mike Robertson, an evacuee who arrived there on Monday with his wife and two daughters.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, firefighters reported progress in battling the nearly 220-square-mile blaze that displaced 52,000 people and destroyed more than 9,500 homes.

State Sen. Michael Gianaris, who represents Long Island City, is fiercely critical of the Amazon project and is a powerful member of the Democratic caucus that will take control of the Senate in January, acquiring veto power on the board in question.\n\nThe Cuomo administration's waffling on the question of which aspects of the project require control board approval comes in the wake of an outcry over the state\u2019s and city\u2019s subsidies for Amazon \u2014 an outcry that has resounded across the political spectrum and appears to have taken state officials by surprise.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "bgriffiths@politico.com (Brent D.

However, in recent days, Mulvaney has abandoned that ambition and told allies and other officials that he is now interested in succeeding Ross, according to several people familiar with the conversations.

His successor would also oversee the crucial 2020 census, which will help determine the future apportionment of seats in Congress.\n\nThe deliberations and back-channel conversations about Ross\u2019 job show the extent to which the White House is currently consumed by personnel machinations as it braces for the onslaught of a Democratic House in January and possible new indictments of Trump associates by special counsel Robert Mueller. Top aides and Republicans close to the White House describe an atmosphere of tension and uncertainty as they monitor the president\u2019s mood and study his Twitter feed for clues about the fates of beleaguered Cabinet officials \u2014 including that of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen, whose long-rumored firing is believed to be imminent.\n\nThe White House\u2019s mood, and its latest internal thinking about personnel changes, were described to POLITICO by eight current and former administration officials and close White House advisers.\n\nThis week has already seen the dramatic ouster of national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s deputy, Mira Ricardel, whose clashes with the office of first lady Melania Trump led the president\u2019s wife to issue a highly unusual public statement calling for her removal.\n\nSeveral top Trump aides are weighing their own fates by looking for other work. Some hope to find refuge in Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, which will be staffing up in the coming months.\n\nTrump himself has snapped at a handful of top aides and outside lawyers in the past several days. He is unsettled over a flood of bad news \u2014 from poor reviews of his weekend trip to Paris to the slow trickle of bad news for Republicans about outstanding midterm races to mounting worry that Mueller may soon drop more bombshell indictments.\n\nEven in an ever-roiling White House that has always tested its staff, the current moment looks particularly dark.\n\n\u201cMorale is [at] a low point,\u201d said one former administration official. \u201cThere is all of this uncertainty about who will still be in the White House in a few months and anxiety about what anyone has to look forward to \u2014 just the Democratic Congress making everyone\u2019s lives miserable.\u201d\n\nA major wild card now is how and when Kelly decides to leave the administration. He and Nielsen \u2014 who served as his top aide when he ran DHS and followed him to the White House \u2014 remain close, and he recently berated a senior colleague who questioned her abilities. Several Republicans believe Kelly will exit the administration shortly after she does, meaning that a Trump tweet announcing her exit could also amount to word that the White House\u2019s top staff job will imminently open up.\n\nVice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, is seen as a leading contender to replace Kelly. While the 36-year-old Ayers enjoys the support of Trump\u2019s family, including daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, he also has powerful internal detractors who could block his ascent.\n\nMeanwhile, some White House officials say that Mulvaney\u2019s interest in a Cabinet position \u2014 following summer talk that he might succeed Kelly \u2014 may reflect a belief that the former politician was unlikely to get that job in the first place. The 51-year-old Mulvaney, an ideological economic conservative, served as a South Carolina state legislator and congressman before taking over Trump's budget office in February 2017.\n\nOther Cabinet officials remain under the close watch of the White House, including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose current plight reminds administration sources of former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s before his firing. Trump openly admires Zinke and White House aides do not expect the president to oust him anytime soon. But several aides said they feel exasperated by the half-dozen ethics-related investigations into Zinke\u2019s conduct and worry those investigations could be a drag as Trump revs up his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nOne White House official said Zinke\u2019s troubles are worse than Pruitt\u2019s ever were because they now include a referral to the Justice Department, which is weighing whether a criminal investigation is necessary.\n\nOn Nielsen, White House aides are so confident Trump will fire her that some have already started to coalesce around her potential replacement: Thomas Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nTrump also needs to tap a new attorney general to replace the fired Jeff Sessions. The job is now held by Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, a controversial Trump loyalist considered unlikely to win Senate confirmation. In an interview with the conservative Daily Caller published Thursday, Trump said he is \u201clooking at a lot of people\u201d for the post, adding: \u201cI have been called by so many people wanting that job.\u201d\n\nAll these subplots have recently overshadowed the fate of Ross, whom Trump has called \u201cpast his prime\u201d and whose influence with Trump over China policy has markedly diminished since the start of Trump\u2019s presidency. That has helped Ross to lay low as his allies and a handful of White House aides seek to cast any near-term Ross departure as voluntary, easing him into retirement.\n\n\u201cRoss has not done anything terribly wrong that caused distrust with the president. The president might not be happy with everyone all of the time, but what happens this week is often forgotten with no grudges held,\u201d said one former senior administration official. \u201cLoyalty in this business is all you got, and Secretary Ross is loyal to the president. That is the difference between him and some of the other Cabinet members.\n\nWhile Trump likes Ross personally \u2014 the wealthy Commerce chief was among a select group who joined the president in the White House on election night, for example \u2014 he has increasingly relied more heavily on other senior administration officials, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and National Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow to take the lead on sensitive negotiations\n\nBut another former senior administration official noted that Ross is deeply involved in at least one policy issue that Trump obsesses over: a crucial ongoing report outlining the effects of potential tariffs on imported foreign cars. Trump, against the advice of most in his administration, has repeatedly threatened to slap tariffs of as much as 25 percent on auto imports.\n\n\u201cWilbur has had ups and downs in his relationship with the president throughout the past two years. At various points he\u2019s been sidelined on trade and other policy processes,\u201d the former official said. \u201cBut it\u2019s Wilbur who\u2019s in charge of the report on potential auto tariffs, so it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019s fired if the president is serious about pursuing that path.\u201d\n\nAlthough he is the oldest of Trump\u2019s Cabinet officials, a source close to Ross says the Commerce secretary shows no sign of slowing down and continues to attend the weekly trade meeting in the Oval Office, in addition to taking on a key role with the White House\u2019s workforce initiative.\n\nUndermining that portrait, however, are embarrassing reports that he falls asleep in official meetings.\n\nRoss and his wife, Hilary, are also among the few top Trump officials to really settle into Washington. Unlike Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s former top economic official \u2014 who stayed at the Four Seasons hotel on weeknights and returned to New York for weekends \u2014 Ross bought a $12 million house in the tony neighborhood of Massachusetts Avenue Heights, where his wife is known for throwing elaborate dinners and parties.\n\nThe couple are also members of Trump's private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida and have deep ties in the surrounding Palm Beach community where Trump has wintered for decades \u2014 social ties which other Trump officials currently on the hot seat lack, and which make the potential departure awkward for a president who dislikes confrontation.\n\nAs for Mulvaney, a White House official said Trump likes his budget chief and would consider him for another Cabinet role when one opens up.\n\nThe official added that Trump has no immediate plans to remove Ross from the Commerce Department, but acknowledged that Ross, who is turning 81 later this month, is not expected to remain in his post for long.\n\nGabby Orr and Eliana Johnson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "asarkissian@politico.com (Arek Sarkissian)", "title": "Palm Beach elections chief cutting back 24/7 operation", "description": "Susan Bucher said that old ballot-counting machines and an overtired, error-prone staff led her to dial back the workload.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/11/15/palm-beach-elections-chief-cutting-back-24-7-operation-700866", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/b7/cb/1a1b0bf7409a839b88a32d1ef4fe/1115bucher900.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:38:38Z", "content": "We have been going at a pace of 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher said during a Thursday evening court hearing. | AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee TALLAHASSEE The Palm Beach County supervisor of elections says her \u2026 [+3259 chars]", "fulltext": "\u201cWe have been going at a pace of 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher said during a Thursday evening court hearing. | AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee Palm Beach elections chief cutting back 24/7 operation\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 The Palm Beach County supervisor of elections says her staff is just a few hours away from finishing a manual recount for the razor-thin race for U.S. Senate, but her office will no longer be able to operate on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nSusan Bucher told Tallahassee Federal Court Judge Mark Walker that old ballot-counting machines and an exhausted staff led her to dial back the workload to meet state-mandated deadlines.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe have been going at a pace of 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d Bucher said during a Thursday evening court hearing. \u201cAnd we will not be able to continue this pace moving forward.\"\n\nBucher\u2019s testimony via telephone was part of a federal court case brought by Democrat state House candidate Jim Bonfiglio, who is just 37 votes behind GOP opponent Mike Caruso. The race is the closest of the four requiring recounts, but state law does not say whether the recount could be completed before the races for governor and agriculture commissioner.\n\nBucher\u2019s office has been plagued by delays that have generated outrage from candidates and President Donald Trump. The Palm Beach Canvassing Board had considered prioritizing the state House race, but the law was too ambiguous.\n\nBucher blamed Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who oversees the state Division of Elections, for not offering any guidance.\n\n\u201cOur canvassing board was not sure what to do, and it\u2019s because the secretary of state didn\u2019t give any direction,\u201d Bucher said.\n\nBucher\u2019s office missed a Thursday deadline to give Detzner\u2019s office a second set of unofficial race results. She said the recounts required for the races could be completed the week before Christmas.\n\n\u201cWe will not be going 24/7 any more,\u201d Bucher said. \u201cIt\u2019s the machines but it\u2019s staff \u2014 they\u2019re tired, they haven\u2019t eaten and they\u2019re more likely to make mistakes.\u201d\n\nBucher testified two hours after the campaign for Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson filed a lawsuit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court against Palm Beach County and Detzner that demanded Bucher\u2019s office conduct a hand recount.\n\nNelson campaign lawyer Marc Elias said the hand recount of 588,598 ballots would likely be faster than Bucher\u2019s current pace, saying her machines have failed.\n\nBack in federal court, Bucher said her outdated ballot counting machines had been repaired and technicians are standing by on site.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re just like an old car \u2014 it overheats,\u201d she said.\n\nWith no new vote counts, the totals Bucher\u2019s office provided to Detzner for Thursday\u2019s deadline were identical to what she submitted for a Nov. 10 deadline. The deadline for the final submission of race results is Sunday at noon, and Bucher expected to have the Senate manual recount completed sometime Friday. But she could not guarantee the other races.\n\nPalm Beach County Canvassing Board lawyer Andrew Baumann told Walker the state law was ambiguous. And board members feared moving the House race to the front of the line would seem like favoritism.\n\n\u201cWe thought it may give the appearance of cherry-picking,\u201d Baumann said.\n\nWalker said he would be willing to issue an order that allows them to prioritize the state House race. The results for the races for governor and agriculture commissioner may default to the submission from Nov. 10.\n\nWalker\u2019s order hinges on word from Detzner\u2019s lawyer, who was told to submit a brief by Friday morning."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "nmccaskill@politico.com (Nolan D.

Marcia Fudge \u2014 a bad sign for the former CBC chair who\u2019s considering a challenge to the California Democrat.\n\nThe CBC has been spoiling to elevate a group member into one of the top two positions in Democratic leadership for years, with current CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond writing as recently as two weeks ago that having a black speaker or majority leader was a top priority.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut in interviews with eight CBC members about Fudge's possible bid for speaker, all but two members said they would back Pelosi over Fudge. Other CBC members on Thursday tweeted or put out statements of support for Pelosi, including Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the most powerful African-American in the House and a close friend and ally of Fudge.\n\n\"She knows that, she knows that, she knows I'm for Pelosi,\" Clyburn said of Fudge in a brief interview in the Capitol.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon, of Pelosi.\n\nFudge, 66, has not formally declared for the position. She is part of a group of anti-Pelosi critics who don\u2019t want the woman who has led the party for 16 years to be speaker in the next Congress.\n\nThey say 17 incumbents and incoming freshmen have signed a letter vowing they will not support Pelosi on the floor \u2014 though POLITICO has only verified 12 of these names with the members or their offices. The group has been trying to find someone to challenge Pelosi so that members who don\u2019t want to vote for her can have someone else to support.\n\nFudge\u2019s bid would nullify Pelosi allies\u2019 suggestion that a vote against her would be \u2018anti-woman.\u2019 Fudge also would be vying to become the first African-American to serve as speaker \u2014 and the first black woman to be in leadership.\n\nStill, some CBC members didn\u2019t think that would be the most important factor in a leadership race.\n\n\u201cI just think you put your best generals forward, your battle-tested generals, and I think that leader is Pelosi,\u201d said CBC member Rep. Val Demings of Florida, who backs Pelosi. \u201cWe have to realize that we\u2019re at a point right now where we\u2019re not the \u2018girls club\u2019 or the \u2018black club\u2019 or the \u2018Hispanic club.\u2019 We\u2019re looking to \u2026 be successful in moving the agenda that supports the American people.\u201d\n\nStill, that feeling wasn\u2019t universal.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/795/1155968404_5859496769001_5859491003001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nRichmond told reporters that should Fudge decide to run, he\u2019d be on \u201cTeam Marcia.\u201d And the Louisiana Democrat predicted that his fellow CBC members currently backing Pelosi over Fudge would change their tune should she actually jump into the race.\n\n\u201cI think Marcia would be a good speaker,\u201d Richmond said. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-Pelosi, but whatever Marcia does, I\u2019m very pro-Marcia.\u201d\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri also said he was \u201cvery intrigued\u201d by the idea, calling Fudge \u201cone of my closest friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Marcia is very serious [about running], it could create some tumult in the Democratic Caucus,\u201d Cleaver said. \u201cShe would create a whole new dynamic that might cause some people to\u201d change their mind on the Pelosi question.\n\nIn a CBC letter sent just days before the election, Richmond reaffirmed the group\u2019s desire to have a black lawmaker in the No. 1 or No. 2 position.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of weeks, several of our colleagues have respectfully shared letters of intent expressing interest in various House Democratic Caucus leadership positions,\u201d Richmond said in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. \u201cIt is within that context that I\u2019d like to reiterate that if there is any change in our top leadership positions the Democratic Members of the CBC endorse African-American representation in at least one of the two top positions of elected House Democratic Caucus leadership.\u201d\n\nThat notion, however, clearly doesn\u2019t extend to Fudge when Pelosi still wants the job \u2014 at least not for much of the CBC.\n\nEven several black women in the group eager to see an African-American female leading the party are sticking with Pelosi over Fudge.\n\nRep. Karen Bass tweeted that she was still with her fellow California Democrat on Thursday afternoon. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas also reaffirmed her loyalty to Pelosi to reporters, even as she had nothing but praise for Fudge.\n\n\u201c[Fudge] has been a real key leader in the conference,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI have expressed my support for Nancy, \u2026 But [Fudge] is a fantastic person, but I just hope that we can work together.\u201d\n\nThe situation clearly created some discomfort for some CBC members. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin would not say anything when asked about the matter Thursday, telling reporters she had to get to the caucus meeting right away. On Wednesday, Moore had said kind words about Pelosi.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who is currently running for caucus chair, wasn't so shy, declaring, \u201cI continue to support Leader Pelosi.\u201d\n\nFirst elected in 2008, Fudge was a mayor in Ohio and a local prosecutor before coming to Congress. She previously led the CBC and served as Democratic National Committee chair, and she is well respected in the caucus.\n\nIt is unclear whether CBC members will try to persuade Fudge to back down. Asked about that possibility Thursday, Clyburn said it wasn't his place to lobby Fudge.\n\n\"I'm supporting Pelosi, I'm supporting Hoyer, and I hope they're supporting me,\" Clyburn said. \"But I'll never tell anybody not to run for [something], not even my own children.\"\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report."}]
