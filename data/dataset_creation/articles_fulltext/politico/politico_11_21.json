The intra-party schism underscores McConnell\u2019s long-running reluctance to spend a week or more of floor time on a criminal justice proposal that splits his party \u2014 despite winning the president\u2019s vocal endorsement.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMcConnell had warned Trump last week during a meeting at the White House that the Senate likely would not have time left on the lame-duck session\u2019s already crowded docket to take up the criminal justice bill, which would lower mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenders while creating new prison training programs aimed at reducing recidivism.\n\nThat conversation suggested that McConnell would ultimately pump the brakes on a bill backed by Trump and some of his closest allies in the Senate, including Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). But both Rand and Graham took to the TV airwaves on Sunday to tout the criminal justice bill\u2019s prospects.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nPaul was joined by his wife, Kelley, in spending the week trying to whip up pressure on McConnell in Kentucky through numerous media appearances. McConnell is up for reelection in 2020 and has made a point of staying firmly tuned into his conservative state as he runs the Senate.\n\nMcConnell told the president, in an interaction first reported by the New York Times, that there may not be time on the Senate calendar for a long and drawn out debate with a key government funding deadline on Dec. 7 and a farm bill on the line. But Paul said he wants people to know that if criminal justice reform stalls out this year, McConnell will be \"single-handedly stopping criminal justice reform.\"\n\n\u201cHe has complete and absolute power to allow this to happen ... I don't think it\u2019s over yet. He\u2019s resisting somewhat,\" Paul said in a Tuesday interview. \u201cIt\u2019s important that everyone knows he has power.\u201d\n\nFor all his talk about the timeline, McConnell also wants to avoid further cleaves in his conference. And there's no chance of the bill coming up and passing through the Senate without an ugly fight. Cotton and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), another supporter of the criminal justice legislation, foreshadowed what that battle would like in a bitter Twitter battle about the bill this week.\n\nCotton called for hearings on the bill and said it will give \"early release\" to hardened criminals. Lee said Cotton was spreading \"fake news\" about the bill he supports.\n\n\u201cI support prison reform. I oppose sentencing reduction for serious offenders,\u201d Cotton told reporters last week.\n\nMcConnell spokesman Don Stewart reiterated the Kentucky Republican's previous comments on the criminal justice bill, that the majority leader has pledged to conduct a whip count of GOP senators and to consider making floor time if the legislation were shown to have 60 votes in the chamber. That whip count hasn't yet occurred, given that the deal was formally released on Thursday.\n\nTrump publicly endorsed the package during a White House event last week, putting new pressure on McConnell to take action. The president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has been working for months on the bill and helped convinced Trump to throw his weight behind it.\n\nThe president\u2019s embrace of the legislation marks a stark shift from his pre-midterms messaging, which was characterized by divisive partisan barbs. Since the election, Trump has emphasized bipartisanship and sought to find areas of compromise with the newly ascendent House Democrats.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows that true bipartisanship is possible,\u201d Trump said in announcing his support for the measure last week, \u201cand maybe it\u2019ll be thriving, if we\u2019re going to get something done.\u201d\n\nBut even if something can get done in the Senate, the House will still have to take another vote on the deal before it can get to Trump's desk to become law. That vote would likely take place in mid-December, when House Republicans who have lost the majority are likely to have little desire to stay longer in Washington.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unclear if Democrats will join Trump\u2019s call for unity. No Democratic lawmakers participated in the president's criminal justice reform event last week.\n\nThe criminal justice agreement does count three influential liberal Democrats as initial cosponsors, however, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) \u2014 who had come out against a narrower, prisons-only version of the bill that passed the House on an overwhelming bipartisan vote earlier this year.\n\nBooker told POLITICO last week that he would be \"reaching out\" to others in the Democratic caucus to help rally support for the criminal justice bill.\n\n\"This is not a perfect bill,\" Booker said. \"But I\u2019m not going to let perfect be the enemy of the good when the lives of thousands of people hang in the balance.\"\n\nSome Republicans like Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) are willing to take up the bill next year when Democrats take control of the House. But that might require rebuilding a fragile compromise that has little more than a month to be signed into law before Washington enters a new phase of divided government.\n\n\u201cWe have a carefully balanced agreement now that can pass both houses and get the president\u2019s signature,\u201d said one GOP senator who supports the bill. \u201cIf we wait until the next Congress the concern is: What would be demanded of the House of Representatives side would probably more aggressive than what we can pass through the Senate and get signed by the president.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "tmeyer@politico.com (Theodoric Meyer)", "title": "T-Mobile hires firm to lobby New York lawmakers", "description": "GMA plans to be more proactive \u2014 Bankers' pot push gets boost", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2018/11/21/t-mobile-hires-firm-to-lobby-new-york-lawmakers-426366", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:58:48Z", "content": "With Daniel Lippman, David Beavers and Sarah Cammarata PROGRAMMING NOTE: PI will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22, and Friday, Nov. 23.

In what could be a turning point, senior House Republicans who had resisted taking up the legislation will be gone, as is Jeff Sessions, who as attorney general tried to crack down on the legalization of marijuana.

Now we\u2019ll see what she asks me\u201d to do, Mattis said Wednesday, referring to Nielsen. He also referred to the Posse Comitatus Act, the 19th-century federal law that prohibits the use of active-duty troops for domestic law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll decide if it\u2019s appropriate for the military, and at that point, things like Posse Comitatus obviously are in play,\" Mattis said. \"We\u2019ll stay in strict accordance with the law.\u201d\n\nAsked why the White House issued the memo if it does not significantly change the troops' role, Mattis seemed to suggest that Trump himself had directed Kelly to issue it out of concern for the protection of Border Patrol agents.\n\nKelly \u201chas the authority to do what the president tells him to do,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an unreasonable concern on the part of the president that we may have to back up Border Patrol.\u201d\n\nBut Mattis said the military's main way of protecting the agents will be what it has been \u2014 stringing concertina wire and constructing other barriers at U.S. ports of entry.\n\nThe Army commander overseeing the border mission, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, told POLITICO this week that his troops do not have the authority to defend Border Patrol agents \u2014 only to defend other military personnel. \u201cWe have the authority to protect ourselves, but essentially this becomes a law enforcement task, and so it takes the president to direct us to do so,\u201d Buchanan said.\n\nOn the other hand, the rules governing military activity in the U.S. already grant troops the explicit authority to protect nonmilitary personnel involved in their missions. It was not clear whether the Kelly memo constituted the extra step Buchanan referred to.\n\nMattis also downplayed the risk that the military mission could lead to troops firing on migrants \u2014 a possibility Trump has raised by saying he would respond to anyone throwing rocks as if they had firearms.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even carrying guns, for Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Mattis said when asked how the military would avoid a repeat of a 1997 incident in which Marines on the border mistakenly shot a teenager. The military has said the work parties building fortifications on the border include one pistol-armed military police officer for every three or four unarmed combat engineers.\n\nIf troops are used to defend Border Patrol agents in violent situations, either under the existing authorities or new ones, they will be \u201cunarmed MPs with shields, batons, no firearms,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nThe only circumstance under which troops might detain migrants even for \u201cminutes\u201d at a time, he added, would be if they were \u201cbeating on a Border Patrolman and we\u2019re in a position to stop them.\u201d In such a case, the troops would promptly turn the detainee over to civilian authorities, he said."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Matthew Choi", "title": "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts calls out Trump for his attack on a judge", "description": "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts took a swipe at President Donald Trump, saying there are no \u201cObama judges or Trump judges\u201d after Trump attacked the judge who ruled against his attempt to restrict asylum-seekers at the border.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/21/supreme-court-chief-justice-john-roberts-calls-out-trump-for-his-attack-on-a-judge-1011203", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/e0/27/7c2272eb43b686582c5c01ed30fd/181121-john-roberts-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:13:29Z", "content": "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement seen as rebuking the president. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts took a swipe at Donald\u2026 [+2532 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump urged Chief Justice John Roberts to \"study the numbers,\" after Roberts rebuked him for saying a federal judge gave his administration an unfavorable ruling because of the president who appointed him. | Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool Image via AP legal Trump hits back at Chief Justice Roberts, escalating an extraordinary exchange The president had originally attacked a District Court judge who ruled against his asylum policy as an 'Obama judge.'\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and President Donald Trump took swipes at each other Wednesday in an extraordinary exchange over just how partisan federal courts really are.\n\nRoberts said Wednesday morning there are no \u201cObama judges or Trump judges\u201d after the president attacked the judge who ruled against his attempt to restrict asylum seekers at the border earlier this week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d Roberts said in a statement. \u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.

Chief justices have historical avoided fighting with the other co-equal branches of government, but Tobias said he was \u201cheartened\u201d by Wednesday\u2019s break from deference to keep Trump in his lane.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that the chief justice has said something, because the Senate has done nothing on these issues and somebody has to protect the independence of the judiciary,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not troubled.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press first reported Roberts' comments.\n\nTalking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump criticized Judge Jon Tigar of U.S. District Court in Northern California, who ruled against his policy announced this month that would require migrants to apply for asylum at legal border crossings. Currently, migrants can present themselves to immigration officers after illegally crossing the border and request asylum. Cases from the Northern District of California are appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nA number of advocacy groups sued the Trump administration shortly after it announced the policy, and Tigar issued a temporary restraining order effectively thwarting the president's efforts. Trump on Tuesday accused Tigar of being an \"Obama judge\" and called the 9th Circuit a \"disgrace.\" Tigar was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\n\"Every case gets filed in the 9th Circuit because they know that's not law. They know that's not what this country stands for. Every case that gets filed in the 9th Circuit, we get beaten.\" Trump said. \"People should not be allowed to immediately run to this very friendly circuit and then file their case.\"\n\nHe also said, \u201cThe 9th Circuit is really something we have to take a look at because it\u2019s not fair.\"\n\nTrump added that he felt confident the case over his asylum policy would go to the Supreme Court where his administration would prevail \u2014 similar to his travel ban on citizens of several majority Muslim countries. A modified version of that policy was upheld in the Supreme Court after several challenges in lower federal courts, with Roberts writing the majority opinion in that case.\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans have tried to fill federal courts with conservative judges, blocking Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from getting a Senate vote. Trump ultimately filled the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death with Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nSenate Republicans stalled several of Obama's appointees to federal courts until former Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) unleashed the \"nuclear option\" to change Senate rules requiring only a simple majority to approve most federal judicial nominations.\n\nThis year, Republicans and Democrats engaged in a dramatic fight over the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 Trump\u2019s second nominee to the high court \u2014 which was mired in allegations of sexual assault. Both parties accused each other of toying with parliamentary procedure and manipulation in order to block or ram through the confirmation.\n\nTrump has a track record of attacking the judiciary. He disparaged a federal judge in Hawaii last year as practicing \"unprecedented judicial overreach\" when he blocked an executive order barring entry to citizens of some majority Muslim countries.\n\nIn another Wednesday tweet, Trump even toyed with dividing the 9th Circuit into two or three circuits because, he said, it is \u201ctoo big.\u201d\n\nTrump also lambasted U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who presided over a class-action lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump University in 2016. Trump called Curiel, who is of Mexican descent and was born in Indiana, a \"Mexican judge\" to discredit his rulings. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called the remarks at the time the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\"\n\nThe president continued his attack early Thursday, tweeting: \"Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster. It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, & is used to get an almost guaranteed result. Judges must not Legislate Security...\n\n\"....and Safety at the Border, or anywhere else. They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe.

Pleading guilty[.]\u201d he wrote on Nov. 9 \u2014 as well as media appearances where he had questioned his original decision and began signaling his plans to withdraw from the agreement with Mueller.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019 new attorneys last week initially asked Moss to delay the prison sentence, and they followed up Wednesday with a motion formally requesting a stay.\n\nThe attorneys haven\u2019t relied on any new factual allegations in their motion but instead argue that an appeal in another case \u2014 filed by the former Stone aide who is resisting a Mueller grand jury subpoena \u2014 raised serious issues about the special counsel\u2019s legitimacy and should be resolved before Papadopoulos is required to begin serving his sentence.\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Papadopoulos is required to surrender during the pendency of his motion for bail pending appeal, the purpose of his motion would be frustrated,\u201d Christopher LaVigne, one of Papadopoulos\u2019 new lawyers at the firm of Pierce Bainbridge, wrote on Wednesday.\n\nA three-judge panel heard oral arguments earlier this month in the case involving Mueller\u2019s authority, which pits former Stone aide Andrew Miller against the special counsel.\n\nMiller\u2019s attorneys have signaled they want to see their case taken all the way to the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority that includes new Justice Brett Kavanaugh would be a more receptive audience. But that fight is likely to take months with no guarantee it will even get a hearing before the Supreme Court.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "hcaygle@politico.com (Heather Caygle)", "title": "Another Pelosi opponent flips, weakening effort to block her speaker bid", "description": "Rep.

Brian Higgins' support deals a setback to the group looking to oust the California Democrat.\n\nNancy Pelosi picked off another Democratic detractor Wednesday, putting the California Democrat one step closer to regaining the speaker\u2019s gavel as the opposition against her appears to be slowly crumbling.\n\nRep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat who has criticized Pelosi for months and vowed repeatedly to vote against her in the new Congress, announced his support for the California Democrat.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"It is likely that Nancy Pelosi is going to be the speaker,\" Higgins said in an interview explaining his change of mind. \"To be truthful about it, not only is there not a viable alternative, right now there\u2019s not an alternative.\"\n\nThe Buffalo News first reported Higgins\u2019 reversal on Pelosi. Just days before, Higgins had signed onto a letter opposing her, and he told POLITICO repeatedly in an interview that he wouldn\u2019t back Pelosi \u201cunder any circumstances.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi is winning now, so circumstances apparently have changed enough for Higgins to reconsider his recent fervent opposition to her.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

His Medicare buy-in proposal is central to this debate, as we work to build on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement released shortly after news of Higgins' volte-face.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working together to lower the cost of health care for hard-working families and raise their paychecks by building infrastructure of America, which is also an important issue to Congressman Higgins.\u201d\n\nHiggins is the latest Pelosi critic to make a dramatic change in direction. Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) announced she was backing Pelosi on Tuesday, just days after openly considering a bid against her, leaving the anti-Pelosi rebels without a challenger.\n\nHiggins was one of 16 current and incoming Democrats who signed a letter Monday promising to vote against Pelosi on the floor. Fudge was on a draft version of that letter but took her name off before it was finalized Monday, according to Democratic sources. A handful of other incoming Democrats have said they will oppose Pelosi for speaker but did not sign onto the letter either.\n\nSecuring two significant endorsements from Fudge and Higgins within a day of each other is just the latest example of Pelosi's continued strength inside caucus, despite facing the most credible threat to her leadership to date.\n\nPelosi has gone about winning her critics over in a most Pelosi-like way. Over the past two weeks, Pelosi and her allies have launched a full-scale assault to round up support and persuade House Democrats to support her through a mix of deal cutting, flattery and arm-twisting when needed.\n\nThere's no timetable for more announcements by \"flippers,\" according to sources close to Pelosi, but she has time on her side, and maybe more importantly, momentum. Pelosi looks likes she's winning, which will make it harder for anti-Pelosi Democrats to stand pat. If they want to cut a deal with her, the time to go is sooner rather than later.\n\nHiggins said he will now back Pelosi after she agreed to support two of his key legislative priorities in the new Congress: a major infrastructure package and legislation that lowers the Medicare enrollment age.\n\nFor Fudge, the incentives to flip were different. Pelosi cut a deal with Fudge to reinstate a House Administration Committee panel overseeing elections and naming Fudge chairwoman.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Fudge made headlines after it was disclosed that she had written a letter of support years ago for a former Ohio judge and state lawmaker who is now accused of killing his ex-wife. Even if Fudge had not cut a deal with Pelosi, Fudge's bid for speaker would have likely failed due to controversy.\n\nSo far, none of the other 15 signees of the anti-Pelosi letter have changed their positions.\n\nHowever, Higgins said he's in touch with a few who are considering cutting their own deals with the longtime Democratic leader, and he thinks they would be smart to do so.\n\n\"They\u2019re talking about trying to cut their own deal on legislation about them or a committee assignment or whatever, and that\u2019s what this process is all about,\" Higgins said.\n\nThe big question now is whether other Democrats who have said they\u2019ll oppose Pelosi for speaker stand firm in their opposition or relent, clearing her path back to the gavel.\n\nDemocrats meet next Wednesday for a closed-door vote for speaker and other leadership positions. Pelosi is expected to easily win the vote, which only requires a majority of the caucus.\n\nThe expected victory will give Pelosi and her allies more than a month to try to persuade Democratic opponents to back her on the House floor in January. The House will hold a roll-call vote for the next speaker on Jan. 3.\n\n\n\nEven members-elect in swing districts \u2014 the Democrats who faced a barrage of GOP TV ads linking them to Pelosi \u2014 say they might vote for her.\n\nRep.-elect Colin Allred is not a member of the never-Pelosi group but said Wednesday he still hasn\u2019t made up his mind how he\u2019ll vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still kind of waiting to see how some of this plays out. Obviously, right now, there\u2019s only one candidate for speaker,\u201d he said after the Higgins\u2019 news broke.\n\nAllred, who knocked off longtime GOP Rep. Pete Sessions in north Texas, said he\u2019s hoping to use his pull to secure a spot on either the Transportation or Education committees.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for me to use whatever leverage I have,\u201d Allred said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve met with Leader Pelosi and I\u2019ve made clear what I think is most important for my district.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mparthasarathy@politico.com (Maya Parthasarathy)", "title": "ZINKE doubles down on fires -- Key PELOSI challenger exits -- BAIL referendum gets boost -- More BIG TECH POLITICS warnings", "description": null, "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2018/11/21/zinke-doubles-down-on-fires-pelosi-gets-more-california-backing-349828", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:06:08Z", "content": "THE BUZZ: So much for not pointing fingers. -- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke doubled down Tuesday on his criticism that radical environmental groups and unsustainable and unacceptable forest management practices are to blame for the wildfires in California, w\u2026 [+16186 chars]", "fulltext": "ZINKE doubles down on fires -- Key PELOSI challenger exits -- BAIL referendum gets boost -- More BIG TECH POLITICS warnings\n\nTHE BUZZ: So much for not pointing fingers.\n\n-- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke doubled down Tuesday on his criticism that \u201cradical environmental groups\u201d and \u201cunsustainable and unacceptable\u201d forest management practices are to blame for the wildfires in California, where back-to-back seasons of costly firestorms that have claimed hundreds of lives and caused billions in damage.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n-- Zinke , who joined with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Purdue in a call with reporters Tuesday, sidestepped a question from POLITICO to identify the environmental groups he has repeatedly charged were responsible for the state problems; he also did not address a question about whether President Donald Trump would carry out his threats to cut federal funding to the state because of what he has charged were \u201cmismanagement\u201d of forests.\n\n-- But the interior secretary \u2014 while acknowledging persistent drought and rising temperatures in California \u2014 heaped blame on \u201clawsuit after lawsuit, by yes, the radical environmental groups that would rather burn down the entire forest than cut a single tree or thin the forest.\u201d He urged Congress to expand his department's authority to bypass environmental restrictions.\n\n-- How Zinke talks about the wildfires seems to depend on the audience.

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), indicated Tuesday that, under his leadership, the panel would continue its probe of personal email use in the White House.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

She \u201csometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\u201d the spokesperson told The Washington Post, which first reported Trump's use of personal email.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed the story as \u201cfake news\u201d and claimed his daughter\u2019s private email use differed from that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who exclusively used a private email for official business and was found to have sent and received classified information on that account.\n\n\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified Sen.

Our next Morning Ag installment will publish on Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nIN THE HOPPER: Romaine lettuce. Do not eat it. Throw it away, even if some of it was eaten and no one got sick. Restaurants and grocery stores should trash it, too. That\u2019s per a consumer alert the CDC released Tuesday as it investigates the latest E. coli outbreak linked to the leafy green.\n\n\u2014 Floor procedure for the farm bill: Sen. Chuck Grassley, after a convo this week with a farm bill conferee, predicted that a compromise measure could hitch a ride on a year-end government spending deal.\n\n\u2014 Life after being pardoned: President Donald Trump said this year\u2019s National Thanksgiving Turkey was \u201clucky.\u201d But like other commercially bred turkeys, this year\u2019s turkey (Peas) and alternate (Carrots) are likely to live only live a few more months.\n\nCDC ISSUES \u2018BROAD\u2019 ROMAINE WARNING: The agency released an unusually forceful and sweeping alert for consumers on Tuesday not to consume romaine lettuce, and for retailers and restaurants not to sell or serve it. The reason: An E. coli O157:H7 outbreak in the U.S. and Canada has sickened at least 32 people. No deaths have been reported.\n\nCDC\u2019s pre-Thanksgiving action signals that government officials have pinned the outbreak on romaine lettuce, but haven\u2019t narrowed down the source or region more specifically, Pro Ag\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich reports.\n\nThe sweeping nature of the warning appears to break new ground. In the past, federal health officials did not take such a step until they had more specific information on the exact source of a foodborne illness outbreak. This time, officials are taking swift action as they try to prevent future illnesses.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb acknowledged to POLITICO that the warning was \u201cbroad,\u201d but the agency believes the source of the outbreak is isolated to one region \u2014 likely California. The industry needs to improve its ability to track and trace a product back to its source when problems arise, he added.\n\n\"We're in a position to prevent future cases of human illness,\" Gottlieb told POLITICO. \"Our first mandate is to protect public health, fully recognizing that this is going to cause extreme hardship for growers and for consumers.\"\n\nMajor produce industry groups said they\u2019re following FDA\u2019s direction on pulling the product. \u201cIn order to be sure that any romaine lettuce that may have been responsible for illnesses is completely gone, we are urging full compliance with the government\u2019s request for a voluntary withdrawal of all romaine,\u201d said the California and Arizona leafy green marketing agreements along with other national and regional groups in a joint statement.\n\nRomaine D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: The strain of E. coli in the current outbreak appears to be similar to a strain that caused an outbreak across the U.S. and Canada last year, but unrelated to the deadly outbreak this year tied to product from Yuma, Ariz.\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY, NOV. 21! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host is giving thanks this year for her family, friends and her dislike of romaine lettuce and ground turkey. Send news and tips to cboudreau@politico.com and @ceboudreau, and follow the whole team @Morning_Ag.\n\nTHE ADAGE \u201cWORK HARD AND GET AHEAD\u201d is a waning reality in America today. The question is: What can Washington do to foster more opportunity and prosperity in struggling communities across the country? POLITICO convened a bipartisan group of 14 business leaders, thinkers and policymakers to explore the problem and identify solutions that have a realistic path forward with political leaders of both parties. Read the latest issue of The Agenda to learn more.\n\nGRASSLEY PREDICTS FARM BILL-SPENDING PACKAGE: The Iowa Republican said Tuesday that a compromise farm bill could be attached to a fiscal 2019 spending measure that Congress must pass by Dec. 7 \u2014 that is, if House and Senate farm bill negotiators clinch a deal in the coming days. Grassley said he talked Monday with a farm bill conferee (whom he did not name) about floor procedure for passing the agriculture and nutrition legislation, your host reports.\n\nClearing the House: Grassley suggested that by wrapping a compromise farm bill into an end-of-year spending package, House Republican leadership could still abide by its so-called Hastert rule. It\u2019s an informal principle that legislation should not be voted on unless a majority of the Republican conference supports it, even if the measure would pass the House.\n\nIt has been difficult for House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) to secure enough GOP support for his farm bill, H.R. 2 (115), even after proposing stricter work requirements for millions of adults receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits \u2014 a concept popular among many conservatives. A compromise farm bill that doesn\u2019t go far enough to tighten SNAP eligibility, or limit farm subsidies, could risk the support of Freedom Caucus members.\n\nTURKEY AND FOOTBALL, MA EDITION: In the lead-up to the Thanksgiving season, consumer advocates pressured USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service to disclose the owners of 22 turkey slaughter operations and seven processing plants tied to an outbreak of Salmonella that has caused 164 illnesses and one death. The outbreak has persisted for more than a year, and only ground turkey has been recalled, but the Thanksgiving holiday renewed food safety advocates\u2019 sense of urgency.\n\nFSIS responded to the calls with a terse statement. The agency said authorities have yet to pinpoint a single common supplier of the tainted turkey products. It then used a football metaphor to push back, arguing that trace-back investigations aren\u2019t done through \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking from the comforts of an urban high rise in New York City or K Street in Washington, D.C., with fundraising pleas attached.\u201d\n\nSarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the statement \u201cdisappointing\u201d and said FSIS officials were \u201ctaking a page from Trump\u2019s playbook.\u201d\n\nThe drama underscores a little-known fact: FSIS doesn\u2019t have the authority to issue a mandatory recall because it is legal for the meat industry to sell Salmonella-contaminated meat in the marketplace. The rationale is that consumers can protect themselves by cooking the meat thoroughly, thus killing the bacteria.\n\n\u201cEssentially, it\u2019s not the responsibility of the industry to fix a salmonella outbreak, but it\u2019s up to the consumer to cook the s--t out of their food,\u201d said Bill Marler, a leading food safety plaintiffs attorney based out of Seattle.\n\nFSIS can gather evidence that a company is linked to a foodborne illness outbreak and request that they issue a voluntary recall. That threshold is incredibly high, however.\n\n\u2018Holy grail\u2019: The agency has to locate an unopened container of the product in a sick person\u2019s home before it can request a voluntary recall. That unlikely event \u2014 which Marler calls \u201cfinding the holy grail\u201d \u2014 occured in Arizona last week, when FSIS officials found an intact, unopened package of Jennie-O ground turkey in the home of someone who had reported an illness. The package tested positive for the outbreak strain, and Jennie-O issued a voluntary recall of 91,000 pounds.\n\nBut Jennie-O is only a piece of the larger outbreak puzzle, as FSIS officials said patients have reported eating and handling a variety of different turkey brands.\n\nGIVE PEAS A CHANCE: Trump on Tuesday observed the White House Thanksgiving tradition of pardoning a turkey, sparing Peas and his alternate, Carrots, from the dinner plate and sending them off to the Gobbler\u2019s Rest sanctuary at Virginia Tech. The president said the turkeys were \u201cso lucky,\u201d but the reality is that Peas and Carrots may not have much time to enjoy their freedom.\n\nLike other conventionally raised birds, they\u2019ve been grown so big that their skeletons simply can\u2019t handle their weight, leading to joint and cardiovascular problems. Previous presidential turkeys have only lasted a few months and it\u2019s considered exceptionally rare for them to live to see another Thanksgiving. POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Zimmerman delves into this fowl news here.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 RFS mandates expected next week: EPA will release the final rule setting biofuel blending requirements on Nov. 30, reports Pro Energy\u2019s Eric Wolff. Expect the numbers to be pretty close to what was proposed in June, with 19.88 billion total gallons, including 15 billion gallons of conventional ethanol. Despite the expectation for a release next week, the agency has dropped the final rule the day before Thanksgiving in the past, so stay on your toes for news.\n\n\u2014 Lighthizer: China not changing its trade ways: Beijing has not changed \u201cunfair, unreasonable, and market-distorting practices\u201d that led the Trump administration to impose tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Tuesday. He made the statement in conjunction with a 53-page update to USTR\u2019s investigation of China\u2019s intellectual property practices. The report\u2019s timing underscored the depth of U.S. concerns ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of next week. More here.\n\n\u2014 GMA pivoting to \u2018offense\u2019 in 2019: Geoff Freeman, the Grocery Manufacturers Association\u2019s president and chief executive, outlined in a memo to staff how the embattled lobbying group will take a more proactive approach to advocacy and public relations next year, Helena reports. Freeman is restructuring GMA following an exodus of major food companies, including household names like Nestl\u00e9 and Kraft Heinz.\n\n\u2014 \u2018They just care about the strawberries\u2019: Advocates supporting California migrant workers say that many of the roughly 36,000 farmworkers in the parts of state affected by the wildfires were exposed to the dangerous air because some field managers ignored safety rules. State law requires employers to provide protective gear to outdoor workers during wildfires. The Washington Post has more.\n\n\u2014 Corn growers ask Perdue for greater trade aid: The National Corn Growers Association wrote to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue this week asking for the second round of trade aid to include more money for the corn sector, your host reports. NCGA President Lynn Chrisp wants USDA to include ethanol and distillers grains in its calculation of damages this time. Corn growers got just $96 million out of a total $4.7 billion in direct payments in the first round.\n\n\u2014 Antibiotics debate at Codex: The Codex task force on antibiotic resistance is currently negotiating global guidance on antibiotic use in agriculture. It will meet in South Korea next month. This week, a coalition of 25 public health, consumer advocacy and animal rights\u2019 groups urged Gottlieb to make clear at the meeting that the U.S. opposes use of antibiotics important to human medicine for growth promotion in livestock.\n\n\u2014 Congress likely won\u2019t renew most temporary tax breaks: Grassley, the incoming Senate Finance chairman, said Tuesday there\u2019s little interest among House tax writers in renewing most of the 25 so-called tax extenders during Congress\u2019 lame-duck session, with the exception of one dealing with biodiesel and a few others, Pro Tax\u2019s Brian Faler reports.\n\n\u2014 This Thanksgiving may be some Haitian\u2019s last: Trump\u2019s plan to end temporary protected status for nearly 60,000 Haitians who immigrated to the U.S. after a 2010 earthquake leveled their homeland would have ripple effects in both nation\u2019s economies, The Washington Post reports: fewer workers at meatpacking plants like Butterball, which have helped revive rural communities, and further destabilization of Haiti, where many residents rely on money from relatives in America.\n\n\u2014 Swiss vote on cow horns: Switzerland on Sunday will vote on whether to subsidize farmers who raise horned cows, after one farmer advocating for the \u201cdignity of livestock\u201d garnered enough signatures to trigger the referendum. The government and some producers are opposed, arguing it would be too expensive and could endanger the animals. Reuters has the story.\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MA! See you again on Monday.

The legislation, to be introduced as H.R. 1, will serve up a smorgasbord of election and government ethics provisions, according to Rep. John Sarbanes, who\u2019s responsible for drafting it. While the aide couldn\u2019t provide further details on the election security component, a House Democratic task force last year spelled out the party\u2019s wish list, which included additional funding, mandatory pre-election intelligence agency assessments and requirements for election vendors to meet cybersecurity standards and provide notice of breaches.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she would restore the House Administration Elections Subcommittee, which Republicans eliminated in 2013. That subcommittee would likely play a role in advancing the Secure Elections Act (H.R. 6663), one of the leading election security bills in the current Congress. Pelosi appointed Rep. Marcia Fudge, who had been considering a challenge to Pelosi for House Speaker, to lead the subcommittee. Fudge on Tuesday announced she would support Pelosi.\n\nPelosi also laid out other committees\u2019 election security responsibilities. \u201cThe protection of the vote is well served by House Democrats and is needed at this crucial time when the vote is under assault,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cTogether with Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson\u2019s oversight of critical election infrastructure, Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Lucille Roybal-Allard bolstering election security resources, and House Administration Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren, Chairwoman Fudge\u2019s subcommittee will expose and confront disenfranchisement and strengthen fair elections across America.\u201d\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

John Katko says he\u2019ll vye to replace outgoing House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul as the top Republican on the panel next year. Katko, who served as an assistant U.S. attorney before being elected to Congress in 2014, chairs the committee\u2019s transportation subpanel. In a statement announcing his bid, Katko noted that in his four years as chairman, the subcommittee advanced 33 bills, 29 of which were signed into law.\n\nKatko will face off against Rep. Mike Rogers, a more senior committee member who launched a bid to helm the panel in 2012 before losing to McCaul. \u201cHaving served on the committee since its inception, he has the knowledge, experience and communication skills to lead the fight for our Republican principles and President Trump\u2019s priorities,\u201d Rogers spokeswoman Shea Miller said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, McCaul is one of three GOP lawmakers jockeying to succeed retiring House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce. \u201cWe need a battle-tested leader who will hit the ground running and I believe that I am the best fit for the job,\u201d the Texas Republican said in a statement. He\u2019s up against Reps. Joe Wilson and Ted Yoho. Wilson, the most senior of the trio, touted his previous experience chairing a host of House Armed Services subcommittees, serving in the minority and his loyalty to the president as qualifications for the job.\n\nYoho, who currently chairs the Foreign Affairs Asia and the Pacific subpanel, has quickly made a name for himself when it comes to digital policy on Capitol Hill. In September, the full House passed bipartisan legislation he sponsored requiring the president to designate countries that represent the nation's top cyber threats and sanction them. The former large animal veterinarian also backed a bill that would establish a vulnerability disclosure program at the State Department. Yoho, who created a website to boost his candidacy, sat down with Martin earlier this year to talk about both bills and other cyber and national security threats. Pros can read the full interview here.\n\nHackers\n\nHACKER SPECIAL \u2014 Dark web forums are offering their own Black Friday specials, according to a report out today by cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. Hackers are selling tutorials for $20 to $30 to teach aspiring cyber criminals to carry out credit card fraud against major retailers. Hackers are also pooling their money together to carry out joint credit card fraud schemes \u2014 and once products are bought, drop point locations using P.O. boxes and empty houses to ship the products are sold alongside \u201cpickers\u201d to collect the goods, the report said.\n\nBotnets for use in ransomware attacks sell for $400 for 500 devices in the U.S. and Canada. Coupons for proxy services offer unlimited bandwidth for $35 for 50 ports. Digital Shadows said merchants and retailers should use web crawlers to search forums for mentions of their company to prevent further fraud.\n\nCRACKING THE CASE \u2014 A cybersecurity research firm has revealed what it says is the identity of a notoriously secretive hacker who sold data stolen from Twitter, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Dropbox and other major services. A Russian man named Maksim Donakov is the human behind the handle \u201ctessa88,\u201d Recorded Future said in a blog post published Tuesday. The group also listed several of Donakov\u2019s aliases, which used social media photos that were \u201cnearly identical\u201d to his passport photo. \u201cThe goal of our research was to prove that even the most skillful and determined criminals inadvertently leave a trail of \u2018breadcrumbs,\u2019\u201d Recorded Future Director of Advanced Collection Andrei Barysevich said in a statement.\n\nSPAIN-RUSSIA \u2014 QUID CYBER DEAL?: Josep Borrell, Spain's foreign minister, was surprised to hear his country reportedly agreed to a deal with Russia to work together on cybersecurity intelligence. (The Associated Press reported on the agreement earlier this month.) When asked about the deal by POLITICO's Ryan Heath on Tuesday, Borrell reacted: \"Who signed it, it was me? No ... You don't have to believe everything you read.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that, during Catalonia's referendum, \"it was an unusual traffic on the network coming from servers on the Russian territory. Seventy percent of traffic on the network, criticizing the Spanish government, pushing for independence, were coming from servers in Russia or Venezuela,\" Borrell said. \"We decided that next time such a thing happened, we would meet together and analyze together where the flows come from and try to identify who is doing it. This is a kind of agreement that needs a follow-up just to make sure we don't blame each other.\" He said \"someone said this is a cybersecurity agreement, but we didn't sign anything.\" Watch the answer here.\n\nIT\u2019S LIKE THEY\u2019RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION, OR THEY JUST DON\u2019T CARE \u2014 Only 18 percent of consumers surveyed believe that online retailers are doing a bad job of protecting their personal information, according to a poll out Tuesday from the Computing Technology Industry Association. More than half, 54 percent, said retailers who make every possible effort to protect their information should be judged differently from those who are more lax. \u201cToday\u2019s patchwork of state regulations and legislation mean that consumers often times are receiving multiple and competing information about the size and scope of a breach,\u201d said Elizabeth Hyman, executive vice president of public advocacy for CompTIA. \u201cIt has reached such a point where only 25 percent of consumers factor a company\u2019s privacy policies and security practices \u2018most of the time\u2019 when they decide to use an app, website or online service.\u201d\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Palo Alto Networks warned of suspect Russian hackers hiding malware in documents to target governments in North America and elsewhere. \u2026 \u201cA leading tax practitioners' group urged the IRS to reconsider its plans for transcript processing changes aimed at combating identity theft, saying they \u2018will unnecessarily delay the process for obtaining transcripts.\u2019\" \u2026 President Donald Trump defended Ivanka\u2019s private email use. \u2026 Incoming House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings will likely renew a probe into the White House\u2019s use of personal email. \u2026 Who\u2019s coming and going from Trump\u2019s Cabinet. \u2026 Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general doesn\u2019t affect special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, his office said in a court filing.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 \u201cTonight, on Cold Case: Cyber\u2026\u201d\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 Trump wanted the Justice Department to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and Hillary Clinton.

The conflagration, the worst in the state\u2019s history, has killed at least 79 people and scorched 150,000 acres, and still burns. Many patients in the fire area have records accessible to PULSE, and clinicians have downloaded at least 100 of them at six shelters for Camp Fire victims, says Leslie Witten-Rood, who directs PULSE for the Emergency Medical Services Authority of California.\n\nPULSE, created with help from a $2.7 million ONC grant in 2015, is the spearhead of the national effort to create an emergency HIE system. One disaster after another has created a real urgency to the program. PULSE plans to link up soon to Carequality and eHealth Exchange, and with the help of the Californian Association of Health Information Exchange will add additional local California organizations. The California EMS has also been working with Texas, North Carolina and Florida, hit hard by storms over the past two years and lagging behind in their HIE disaster preparedness. The Sequoia Project has copied PULSE\u2019s architecture and is starting to offer it to other states, Witten-Rood said.\n\nSeptember\u2019s Delta Fire, around Redding, Ca., motivated PULSE to integrate SacValley Medshare, a health information exchange that includes most providers in Butte County, including Adventist Health\u2019s Feather River hospital in Paradise, which was destroyed in the blaze. The availability of a patient\u2019s EHR on a laptop or iPod in an emergency tent or high school auditorium improves patient triage, she said. Instead of sending everyone to clogged emergency departments, those who simply need refills or exams can be seen and get prescriptions on the spot. The PULSE record provides a consolidated care document with 21 data points completed by the last physician who saw the patient.\n\n\u201cSeeing this used to help people at one of the lower points of their lives, to expedite their medical treatment was one of the most rewarding things in my career,\u201d Witten-Rood said.\n\nShe described helping a patient who was running out of insulin get a refill in Chico, where a pharmacy couldn\u2019t find his records. \u201cThe guy was trying to explain, \u2018I can\u2019t call my doctor, his office burned down. Our CVS burned down, my house burned down, the hospital burned down.\u2019 We were able to pull up his records and get one of the emergency clinicians to assess him and prescribe his meds.\u201d\n\nEMSA has pulled in a series of medical emergency reserves and volunteers to deal with the firestorms as well as clinicians from the 143rd and 144th California Air National Guard units, and the California Army National Guard\u2019s 297th Area Support Medical Company. All trained on PULSE at the organization\u2019s headquarters in Sacramento before their deployments.\n\nTweet of the Day: Lucia Savage @SavageLucia If everyone who has had a comparable experience retweeted this, we would number millions.\n\nAaron E.

This would give Apple access to nine million VA patients and their interactions with app makers who use the Apple platform to provide the veterans services. Talks on the issue started with Bruce Moskowitz, the internist who is a member of the Mar-a-Lago country club, the report says.\n\nSECURING TELEHEALTH: The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence at NIST is seeking comments on a draft paper describing how to secure remote monitoring devices and systems. It is intended to provide a reference architecture that will address the security and privacy risks for providers using telehealth and remote patient monitoring. As telehealth spreads beyond medical offices, \u201cit is important to ensure the infrastructure supporting [it] can maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data, as well as ensure the safety of patients,\u201d the agency said.The public comment period on the position paper is open until Dec. 21.\n\nCYBER THREATS WORRY FINANCE COMMITTEE CHIEF-TO-BE: In a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Sen. Chuck Grassley asked how the agency is dealing with cybersecurity issues highlighted in a recent HHS Office of Inspector General report. The OIG pointed to a lack of preparedness at FDA for cybersecurity attacks aimed at medical devices.\n\nECRI LAUNCHES GUIDELINE PORTAL: The ECRI Institute has launched a free-access portal to expert, evidence-based guidelines in response to the outcry from health care professionals when federal funding cuts forced AHRQ to shut down its National Guideline Clearinghouse. ECRI had developed and maintained the NGC website for 20 years. The ECRI Guidelines Trust features new summaries of evidence-based guidelines from participating guideline developers, medical specialty societies, and other health care organizations. Details here.\n\nFDA TURNS TO 'ACTIVE' MONITORING ON WOMEN'S HEALTH DEVICES: The agency on Tuesday announced a break from its current post-market surveillance system that largely relies on device users to report problems and sometimes results in underreporting. Instead, it will focus on what it calls real-world evidence \u2014 especially with regard to vaginal mesh, long-term birth control devices, certain breast implants and other products for women. More here.\n\nGO GO LIVONGO: The CDC gave Livongo Health\u2019s diabetes prevention program full recognition as meeting its standards, the company announced Tuesday. The company has a year-long program that combines live or recorded classes with digital self-monitoring tools, along with an online community and coaching possibilities. Noom, Omada and Canary Health are among the other CDC-recognized virtual programs.\n\nRESEARCH CORNER\n\nDeep neural networks are as good as sleep experts at scoring laboratory polysomnography data \u2014 the charts produced by wires hooked up to slumbering patients to assess their sleep stages, apnea and limb movements, according to a Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA) study. The computer model examined 10,000 clinical reports as well as 5,800 research reports and did about equally well on both. The authors, led by Siddharth Biswal at Massachusetts General Hospital, say scoring automation \u201copens the path toward broader and more timely access to sleep diagnostics\u201d by spreading expertise beyond sleep clinics.\n\n\u2026 Researchers running a pragmatic trial on aspirin dosing found that querying EHRs to find patients who met the study criteria was a good way to recruit them, according to another JAMIA paper by Emily Pfaff and other University of North Carolina researchers.\n\n\u2026 Veterans undergoing mental health therapy got more involved in their care and improved their communication with clinicians when they read provider notes, according to a third JAMIA study. The Portland VA researchers, led by Lauren Denneson, used a web-based educational program designed to educate patients on the content of the notes.\n\nWHAT WE'RE CLICKING\n\nWSJ: Walgreens and Humana in talks to take stakes in each others' business\n\nShould we pay $2 million to save one baby? asks a special issue of Technology Review on precision medicine\n\nA Hastings Center essay on how bioethics can shape artificial intelligence and machine learning"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "rrainey@politico.com (Rebecca Rainey)", "title": "A pension deal brews", "description": "Undercover in the caravan \u2014 Backup on pullback", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-shift/2018/11/21/a-pension-deal-brews-424972", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:01:29Z", "content": "With help from Ian Kullgren Editor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Shift is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Employment &amp; Immigration subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLIT\u2026 [+6369 chars]", "fulltext": "A pension deal brews\n\nWith help from Ian Kullgren\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Shift is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Employment & Immigration subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Shift will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22 and Friday, Nov. 23.

More from NBC here.\n\nBACKUP ON PULLBACK: Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who is overseeing 5,800 active-duty soldiers sent to the border, told POLITICO in an interview Monday that he expected to send some troops home later this week. But on Tuesday an Army spokesman threw cold water on that, \u201cemphasizing instead that some troops will be shifted from Texas to California as the caravans of northward-bound migrants through Mexico shift direction,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Wesley Morgan reported. More here.\n\nDOJ EXODUS: \u201cThe Justice Department is facing a likely senior staff exodus once President Donald Trump taps a permanent replacement for ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Gabby Orr reports, \u201ccreating a leadership vacuum that has troubled hard-line immigration activists.\u201d Among the staffers are Danielle Cutrona, \u201ca senior counsel to Sessions who had been with him since his Senate days,\u201d who departed DOJ Friday; Rachael Tucker, a senior counselor to the attorney general, who may exit \u201cin the next couple of months\u201d; and Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeff Wood, who may also leave soon. \u201cEven Trump\u2019s critics concede that Sessions\u2019 staff has dutifully guided the president\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, propped up the president's most contested executive actions, and added a record number of adjudicators to U.S. immigration courts,\u201d writes Orr. More here.\n\nHILL HARASSMENT OVERHAUL: The House ethics committee on Tuesday called for a final deal this year on overhauling Capitol Hill's sexual misconduct system after months of stalled talks, POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor reports.\n\nIn a letter to Congressional leaders, members on both sides of the ethics panel \u201clauded the Hill misconduct legislation that the House passed in February \u2014 amid multiple sexual harassment scandals that ended careers on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Schor writes. \u201cThat House-passed bill would hold lawmakers personally liable for harassment and discrimination settlements that stem from their own actions and would require claims to be sent to the ethics committees for potential further inquiries.\u201d More here.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S POWER TESTED ON IMMIGRATION: \u201cTrump may soon be out of options for impeding the recurring migrant caravans that he has proclaimed a national security threat \u2014 in what Democrats and some retired commanders have called an attempt to boost GOP election turnout,\u201d writes POLITICO\u2019s Ian Kullgren.\n\nIn a ruling late Monday night, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar temporarily halted the administration\u2019s efforts to prohibit migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum. Meanwhile, the Army is sending mixed signals on how long troops will remain at the border.

(USCIS later added a limited exception for students with pending visa applications.)

Lipsitt said hundreds of her complaints were dismissed after the Education Department said earlier this year it would toss bulk complaints posing a burden to OCR. Lipsitt told Morning Education that she was recently informed her complaints would be reopened.\n\n\u2014 The Education Department\u2019s reversal on the mass filer issue \u201ccertainly looks like a response to litigation,\u201d said Catherine Lhamon, who led the agency\u2019s civil rights office during the Obama administration. The latest revisions to the case processing manual show that legal action \u201cis working,\u201d said Denise Marshall, executive director of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates Inc. COPAA and other groups that advocate for individuals with disabilities sued over changes to the case processing manual, which took effect in March. Hill said the revisions announced on Tuesday came after the agency received feedback on those changes.\n\n\u2014 Lipsitt said she sees a \u201cpartial victory\u201d in the reversal and in the reopening of her complaints. But she\u2019s not confident the complaints will receive adequate resolutions. The Education Department has rewritten dozens of agreements with school districts found in violation of the website access issue. Administration officials have said the renegotiated contracts are aimed at more \"efficiently\" resolving civil rights complaints. But Lipsitt said those new agreements are much shorter and are all identical.\n\n\u2014 Miriam Rollin of the National Center for Youth Law said the other changes outlined Tuesday amount to a \u201cmixed bag\u201d and should be viewed through a wider lens. While the Education Department won\u2019t dismiss bulk complaints, the agency has still moved away from investigating whether civil rights complaints are part of broader, systemic discrimination, Rollin said.\n\n\u2014 Rollin also pointed to revisions that could have a negative effect on complainants. For example, the March case processing manual said the Office for Civil Rights \u201cwill \u2026 specifically identify the information necessary for OCR to proceed\u201d with investigating a complaint. The latest version says OCR \u201cmay\u201d do that, meaning filers could be left in the dark if their complaints are missing information, Rollin said.\n\nGOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING, NOV. 21.

In a recent letter, Frank Brogan, who leads the Education Department\u2019s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, outlined how states can submit proposed changes for federal approval.\n\n\u2014 Any changes that could affect how a state identifies schools for low performance next school year must be submitted to the Education Department by March 19, Brogan writes. He says states must submit a \u201credlined version\u201d of their plan that reflects all proposed changes and \u201ca cover letter describing the proposed changes.\u201d The whole package must include the state education chief\u2019s signature and a \u201cdescription of how the state provided the public a reasonable opportunity to comment on the plan.\u201d Read Brogan\u2019s letter.\n\nVETERANS' EDUCATION\n\nVETS\u2019 GROUPS TARGET LEAD-GENERATOR SITES: Twenty-eight veterans groups seek a greater push to target websites that appear to be official military recruitment sites but really lead a user to what they call a \u201cbad actor\u201d college. In a letter dated Monday, the groups urged the Federal Trade Commission to release the names of schools that participated in fake military recruiting websites. They also urged the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees to take up the issue in a separate letter.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIt is hard to conceive of a more reprehensible scheme,\u201d said Carrie Wofford, president of the group Veterans Education Success. \u201cThe colleges that participated in this ugly scheme should not be protected.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In September, the FTC announced it had settled with two companies that targeted people seeking to join the armed forces and tricked them by falsely claiming to be affiliated with the military in order to generate sales leads for post-secondary schools.\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION\n\nWARREN PRESSES NAVIENT ON INTERNAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT REVIEW: The student loan giant Navient may have pushed some federal loan borrowers into a repayment plan that was more expensive for them than alternatives, according to an internal Education Department report made public on Tuesday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\n\u2014 Warren said the internal report bolsters claims being made against Navient in court by five states and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Those lawsuits, which Navient is fighting, accuse the company of illegally cheating borrowers by steering them into forbearance rather than helping them enroll in income-based repayment plans that could be more favorable to them. Forbearance allows borrowers to temporarily stop making payments on their loans but interest continues to accrue.\n\n\u2014 The internal Education Department document was first provided by Warren's office to The Associated Press on Tuesday. Shares of Navient fell by more than 10 percent after the AP reported the news. Michael Stratford has more.\n\n\u2014 Navient CEO Jack Remondi fired back in a letter to shareholders on Tuesday evening: \u201cA full reading of the report, our responses included in the report and comments provided by the U.S. Department of Education clearly and unequivocally refute the accusations that Navient was improperly steering borrowers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also affirmatively conclude that in those instances where forbearance was used, it was applied appropriately.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Remondi also posted his letter responding to Warren. Read it here.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nIVANKA TRUMP USED PERSONAL EMAIL TO CONTACT DEVOS: Ivanka Trump used her personal email address to send hundreds of emails about government business last year, including emails to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, The Washington Post reports. Many of the emails violate federal records rules, the Post reports, citing \u201cpeople familiar with a White House examination\u201d of Trump\u2019s correspondence. In March 2017, she emailed DeVos and suggested that their staffers meet to discuss ways to collaborate on \u201clocational/workforce development and k-12 STEM education.\u201d More.\n\nTITLE IX\n\nREPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WARNS TITLE IX RULES COULD HURT LGBTQ STUDENTS: New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said he's concerned that a Trump administration proposal on how schools should handle allegations of sexual harassment and assault could have \u201cunintended consequences\u201d that harm LGBTQ students and others. Sununu is a rare Republican to join Democrats in criticizing the Title IX proposal unveiled by DeVos on Friday.\n\n\u2014 DeVos\u2019 proposal narrows the definition of sexual harassment as unwanted conduct that is \u201csevere, pervasive, and objectively offensive.\u201d In a letter to DeVos, Sununu writes: \u201cOne of the most common reasons that LGBTQ students do not report incidents of harassment is because they doubt that effective intervention will occur. Narrowing the definition to only the most severe of cases may have an overly negative effect on LGBT students, many of which are already fearful to report harassment in schools.\u201d More from Kimberly Hefling.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, DeVos writes in The Washington Post, \u201cIt\u2019s time we balance the scales of justice in our schools.\u201d\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\n\u2014 Margie Vandeven is returning to the role of Missouri\u2019s commissioner of elementary and secondary education, the state board announced on Tuesday.

The GOP tax bill signed by President Donald Trump last year expanded those plans to cover up to $10,000 a year in K-12 expenses, including expenses for private, religious schools.

Meanwhile, the U.S. trade chief is the one to watch ahead of the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. And oil and gas companies are worried that NAFTA 2.0 could leave them at the mercy of Mexican courts. Let\u2019s start here:\n\nLIGHTHIZER FIRES NEW SALVO AT CHINA: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Tuesday bolstered the administration\u2019s case for imposing tariffs on around $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, just 10 days before President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in Buenos Aires for talks on trade and security concerns.\n\nIn a move that underscored the depth of U.S. concerns ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, USTR released a 53-page update to its earlier report on China's intellectual property practices. That probe under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act provided the legal basis for Trump to impose tariffs on nearly half of all imports from China.\n\n\u201cThis update shows that China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable, and market-distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation,\u201d Lighthizer said in a statement.\n\n\u201cChina, however, made clear \u2014 both in public statements and in government-to-government communications \u2014 that it would not change its policies in response to the initial Section 301 action,\u201d USTR\u2019s new report noted.\n\nKeeping Trump\u2019s eyes on the prize: Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, said the release of the updated Section 301 report is a message to Trump that China is not taking any meaningful action to address its IP practices. If anything, the updated report shows how China may have gotten worse \u2014 a direct counter to Trump\u2019s remarks earlier this month that Beijing \u201cgot rid\u201d of its state-backed Made in China 2025 policy aimed at boosting the country\u2019s high-tech sectors, he said.\n\n\u201cUSTR is trying to take the idea of Chinese IP concessions off the table for the G-20,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese are going to push hard for it. And if the president does believe that Made in China 2025 has been gutted, he may agree that strong U.S. action on IP is no longer necessary.\u201d\n\nMore here from Doug Palmer.\n\nIT'S WEDNESDAY, NOV. 21!

Be sure to check in each week to keep up with the policies and personalities shaping the second Space Age. Learn more here.\n\nLOOK TO USTR FOR THE MAN IN CHARGE: Lighthizer\u2019s unexpected announcement confirmed why many trade experts believe he\u2019s the person to watch ahead of the upcoming summit between Trump and Xi. Lighthizer is the architect of the current strategy of pressuring China by piling on the tariffs, said Scott Kennedy, director of the Chinese business and political economy project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and chief White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow often have a higher public profile on China trade \u2014 possibly because Lighthizer has spent much of the past year in NAFTA renegotiations and seldom appears on TV \u2014 but \u201cpaying attention to [Lighthizer] is really where most of the focus should be pre-Buenos Aires,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nThe White House confirmed as much to POLITICO in October. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Lighthizer is \"the lead negotiator\u201d on China trade issues. \u201cBut we have a deep bench of people with a strong understanding of trade policy that are part of the team\u201d and ultimately, Trump is \u201cthe final decision maker,\u201d Sanders added.\n\nHowever, keeping track of Lighthizer is not easy. USTR\u2019s press office does not publish his schedule and regularly ignores reporters\u2019 requests for information about his activities. That happened again Tuesday.\n\nCHINESE VP LIU NOT COMING TO WASHINGTON: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Germany next week for talks with German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday, killing chances he would stop in Washington for talks with the Trump administration ahead of the G-20 summit. Liu will also attend the eighth \"Hamburg Summit: China Meets Europe\" on his Germany tour.\n\nScissors says he believes the potential Liu trip to D.C. was scrubbed because he wanted to meet with Lighthizer as head of the U.S. delegation, but Lighthizer did not want to meet with him. \u201cWe needed some sort of step on the American side, which as far as I know never occurred,\u201d Scissors said. \u201cThe plan wasn't [Liu] is coming here and we're working out the arrangements. The plan was he's only coming here if\u201d certain conditions were met.\n\nKUDLOW: \u2018VERY DETAILED\u2019 CHINA TALKS GOING ON: In an interview on Fox Business, Kudlow gave a somewhat optimistic view of the chance for progress in Buenos Aires. \u201cAs we move toward the G-20 meeting, communications, very detailed communications are occurring at all levels of government,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a much better place than where we were two, three, four weeks ago, and I think President Trump restarted that.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kudlow also stressed Trump\u2019s view that any deal must be in America\u2019s interest, which means China must address concerns about intellectual property theft, ownership restrictions, tariff and non-tariff barriers, forced technology transfers and the enforceability of any agreement that is reached. The chances of reaching a final deal covering all those issues by the G-20 meeting on Nov. 30-Dec. 1 is virtually nil.\n\nOIL, GAS COMPANIES SPOT HOLES IN USMCA: Oil and gas industry groups are raising concerns that the NAFTA replacement deal could leave many U.S. companies at the mercy of Mexico\u2019s courts in legal disputes rather than granting them access to the international arbitration system, Pro Energy\u2019s Eric Wolff reports this morning.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement preserves the right of U.S. companies to sort out disputes in international arbitration. But companies that do not work directly with the government \u2014 like gas pipeline operators and refiners \u2014 may have to rely on the Mexican courts to solve legal battles.\n\nConfusion on the Hill: Lawmakers are also unclear over whether companies working with Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company, PEMEX, would get access to the protections. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told POLITICO he\u2019s been told both \u2014 that it would and would not apply to them. More here.\n\nGRASSLEY: \u2018HOPE\u2019 IS THE WORD AHEAD OF G-20: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday expressed optimism for what could come from Trump\u2019s trip to Buenos Aires later this month.\n\n\u201cThere is hope that steel and aluminum tariffs with Mexico and Canada will come off. There is hope there will be progress made with China so we won\u2019t impose additional tariffs,\u201d said Grassley, who will take the high-profile gavel for the Senate Finance Committee in 2019.\n\nGrassley added that he hopes the U.S.-China meeting will jump-start negotiations that address \u201cour complaints and take off some of the tariffs they have on our agricultural products.\u201d\n\nGrassley-Neal meeting: The Iowa Republican noted that he has not yet met Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who is expected chair the House Ways and Means Committee. Grassley said they have to schedule a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d soon. Grassley previously served as Finance chairman in a GOP-majority Congress but will have to work with a Democrat-controlled House next year.\n\nSECOND TIME\u2019S THE CHARM AT THE DSB: A group of World Trade Organization members will get a second and final chance to request dispute panels against U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum during a meeting today of the Dispute Settlement Body. A proposed agenda shows that China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Turkey, India and Switzerland will make panel requests challenging the tariffs as a violation of the WTO\u2019s Safeguards Agreement. The U.S. has disagreed with the premise of the case, arguing that it has justified the tariffs under a U.S. law that allows the president to impose trade restrictions to protect national security, which is an exception allowed under WTO rules.\n\nU.S. vs. the world: The meeting will also feature the U.S. making its second and final request in establishing a panel to challenge China\u2019s intellectual property practices. The case is part of a broader Section 301 investigation. The U.S. will also get a second shot at requesting panels challenging retaliatory tariffs from Canada, China, the EU and Mexico.\n\nA year of disputes: WTO members will also adopt the annual report of DSB, which details dispute activity for the past year.

Learn more here.\n\nTRADE REMEDY CORNER\n\nCHINESE STEEL RACKS EDITION: The Commerce Department announced Tuesday it has found evidence that imports of steel racks from China are being unfairly subsidized at rates ranging from 5 percent to 150 percent.\n\nIn its preliminary finding, the agency imposed countervailing duties against imports of the product, which were valued at approximately $200 million last year. Commerce is scheduled to make its final determination around April 1, at which point the case would move to the U.S. International Trade Commission for final approval.\n\nTrade remedy status update: Each time it announces a new anti-dumping or anti-subsidy ruling, Commerce tends to make note of how many such decisions it has made since the beginning of the Trump administration. Commerce said in its announcement Tuesday that it has initiated 137 new trade remedy investigations since the start of the administration in January 2017 \u2014 an increase of 242 percent from the same period of the Obama administration.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Treasury hits Iran, Russia with new sanctions over illicit oil sales to Syria, POLITICO reports.\n\n\u2014 German car CEOs invited to White House as Trump weighs auto tariffs, Bloomberg reports.\n\n\u2014 U.S. manufacturers call for crackdown on fake \u2018Made in America\u2019 labels, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\n\u2014 EU agrees to investment screening rules with eyes on China, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 A look at China\u2019s \u2018tantrum diplomacy\u2019 at APEC in a Washington Post opinion piece.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

It depends on who you ask. Senate Democrats seemed to shoot down the idea of making fixes to the new tax law, and now incoming Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) says he\u2019s seen \u201cvery little interest in the Ways and Means Committee\u201d for tax extenders, \u201cexcept maybe for a couple,\u201d our Brian Faler reports. The \u201ccouple\u201d includes one near and dear to Grassley's heart: a biodiesel tax credit. Last week, the current Finance chairman, Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), indicated there would be a package. But he did leave plenty of wiggle room, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but there usually is an extenders package, so we\u2019ll probably have extenders.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) isn\u2019t a big fan of extenders, especially after most of them were made permanent in 2015. Nonetheless, he said last week that he would soon circulate extenders legislation, though he acknowledged he wasn\u2019t sure how much appetite there would be for a vote. A spokesperson for Brady didn't respond to a request for comment on Grassley\u2019s remarks.\n\nSeveral of the roughly two dozen tax incentives benefit renewable energy, and the industry has been working hard to persuade lawmakers to extend them before the current Congress adjourns. But Grassley told reporters, \u201cCongress is getting very timid on tax credits for alternative energy because of the abundance of petroleum and cheapness of natural gas.\u201d One investment advisory group expects a split decision on the biodiesel incentive and the tax credit for electric vehicle buyers, which has been under siege by some lawmakers and the oil industry. With Grassley \u201cset to retake the Senate Finance Committee chair, we think it is a pretty good bet that the tax credit gets extended to cover 2018 retroactively and perhaps 2019 as well,\u201d Capital Alpha Partners said in a newsletter. It added, \u201cGiven the opposition to extending the EV credit, we think the most likely outcome is a stalemate with no action.\u201d\n\nWE'RE TAKING A COUPLE DAYS OFF. But we'll be back at it on Monday. Let's hear from you: bfaler@politico.com, alorenzo@politico.com, teckert@politico.com and bbecker@politico.com. You can also reach us on Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brianfaler, @aaronelorenzo,@POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nBILLIONS OF QUESTIONS: When it comes to the new \u201cOpportunity Zones\u201d established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115), the big question is will they work? But it could be hard to determine whether they meet their goal of reviving economically struggling urban and rural areas. A requirement that the Treasury Department provide Congress with detailed information on the areas and the impact of investments, included in the original OZ legislation, was dropped after the legislation was tucked into the TCJA, Danny Vinik reports in POLITICO\u2019s Agenda. \u201cWithout better reporting requirements in this version, critics say, it\u2019s hard to know if the law will have any effect besides saving investors money and draining federal tax revenues,\u201d Danny writes.\n\nProponents are hoping that billions of dollars in investments will be drawn to the zones, which will give investors a big tax break if they pump unrealized capital gains into \u201cOpportunity Funds\u201d that, in turn, will be used for economic development in the zones. \u201cGiven the disagreements over the potential for the program, experts on both sides agree that good data is essential,\u201d Danny writes. The reporting provision was dropped \u201cbecause the Republican Congress passed the tax law through budget reconciliation \u2014 a process that, by Congress\u2019 rules, can include reforms that only affect taxes or spending. The reporting requirement fell outside that boundary.\u201d\n\nNothing is keeping Treasury from measuring and reporting details about economic activity in the zones. And a spokesperson for the department said it is \u201cconsidering whether the initiative could benefit from a more robust data collection effort in future tax years,\u201d adding, \u201cWe believe we can spend some time to get this right and still have enough data to analyze its effectiveness.\u201d\n\nSCOTT SPEAKS: Another concern skeptics have about the program is that investments might largely pour into urban Opportunity Zones, leaving the rural zones behind. But Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the driving force behind the legislation, plays down those concerns. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to states like West Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire, that have large rural populations, including South Carolina \u2026 It absolutely works in rural areas, from poverty to the opioid crisis, and in inner cities,\u201d he told our Ben White. \u201cAs long as there is need, I think the Opportunity Zone legislation provides an answer for those areas.\u201d\n\nScott said he believes \u201ca realistic estimate\u201d for the dollar amount of investments that will be drawn to the zones \u201cwould be about $100 billion\u201d in the program\u2019s early years. \u201cThere\u2019s over a trillion dollars [of unrealized capital gains] on the sidelines that could be deployed,\" he said.\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nDIGITAL TAX CARVEOUT: The European Union continues to tinker with its proposed digital tax. The latest change would excuse financial services firms from the tax, which is designed to hit the revenues of Facebook, Google and other online giants. But the financial services industry still isn\u2019t happy, POLITICO Europe\u2019s Bjarke Smith-Meyer reports. Industry officials \u201cfear the latest compromise text still falls short of offering a full carve-out, due to its emphasis on EU \u2018regulated\u2019 firms,\u201d Bjarke writes. \u201cGiven this and the inclusion of \u2018digital interfaces\u2019 in the language of the text mean financial firms like some trading platforms that are based outside the EU could be impacted, they argue.\u201d\n\nTAX AMNESTY TURMOIL: Tax policy has become a wedge between the Italian government\u2019s coalition partners. The League promoted a tax amnesty that offered a \u201ccondonation\u201d \u2014 or debt forgiveness \u2014 of up to 500,000 euros (about $570,000). But a \u201ccondonation of half a million euros does look like legitimation of fraud to many, including a lot of M5S (Five Star Movement) MPs who spent most of their political career denouncing the privileges of the upper classes, taken at the expense of the majority of citizens, through financial malpractices, corruption and economic scams,\u201d Forbes contributor Annalisa Girardi writes.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nY'ALL COME: The home of Music City and Beale Street is trying to lure companies that make original music for films, television, video games and other digital media. Tennessee is offering them up to a 25 percent rebate on their costs if they spend at least $50,000 in the Nashville area or at least $25,000 in other parts of the state, the Memphis Commercial Appeal reports. Bob Raines, executive director of the Tennessee Entertainment Commission, said \"it only makes sense for us to leverage Tennessee's unparalleled concentration of music talent and production services to attract additional music scoring projects.\u201d\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nBank profits hit new highs thanks, in part, to tax cuts.\n\nGOP will let Dems walk the plank on reviving earmarks.\n\nThe AICPA is unhappy with IRS transcript access changes\n\nNational Review editor likes the idea of hiking the EITC.\n\nHedge fund managers dinged by TCJA.\n\nNational Tax Security Awareness Week set for Dec. 3-7\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nTurkeys like the one President Donald Trump pardoned usually don't live very long afterward. \"Like other turkeys that are raised for human consumption, they\u2019ve been bred to be plump and tasty, but they grow so big that they are likely to suffer from a variety of health problems that put their lifespan at less than a year,\" according to POLITICO's Sarah Zimmerman. \"Wild turkeys generally live three to five years.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "smintz@politico.com (Sam Mintz)", "title": "Record numbers hit the roads, skies", "description": "FRA finalizes high-speed rail rule \u2014 Larsen outlines aviation subcommittee priorities", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-transportation/2018/11/21/record-numbers-take-to-roads-skies-423688", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:00:48Z", "content": "PROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Transportation will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22, and Friday, Nov. 23.

Let\u2019s break it down:\n\nAir: Airlines for America says a record 30.6 million passengers are expected to fly between Nov. 16-27, up from around 29 million last year. Sunday will be the busiest day, with a projected 3.06 million passengers flying, followed by today. As our Stephanie Beasley reported, TSA is ramping up its staffing for airport screenings and rolling out new tech to prepare for the onrush. And FAA has been planning for months, as is common practice, to open up airspace typically reserved for military use.\n\nHighways: There will be 48.5 million people hitting the road for Thanksgiving, a projected increase of nearly five percent over 2017, according to AAA. The volume will result in mind-numbing delays: The most congested cities could see drive times nearly quadruple. This probably goes without saying, but AAA says the best days to drive are Thursday, Friday and Saturday. \u201cOur advice to drivers is to avoid commuting times in major cities altogether or plan alternative routes,\u201d said Trevor Reed, a transportation analyst at mobility analytics firm INRIX. Gas prices will also be the highest on Thanksgiving in four years, with the national average at $2.79 per gallon. And AAA estimates it will have to rescue nearly 360,000 poor souls from dead batteries, flat tires and lockouts.\n\nRail: Amtrak is planning extra trains and capacity, including putting to work every available passenger car in its fleet, to prepare for the hundreds of thousands expected to use the rails to get to their Thanksgiving. Last year set records for the Thanksgiving period with 777,000 riders taking Amtrak during that week and 160,000 on the Sunday after the holiday alone.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

POLITICO convened a bipartisan group of 14 business leaders, thinkers and policymakers to explore the problem and identify solutions that have a realistic path forward with political leaders of both parties. Read the latest issue of The Agenda to learn more.\n\nRail\n\nHIGH-SPEED RULE FINALIZED: FRA issued a final rule Tuesday that sets new passenger equipment safety standards. The regulation, which was first proposed in December 2016 after being developed throughout the Obama administration, adds a new tier of standards to aid the implementation of nationwide high-speed rail service up to 220 mph. The new standards will allow the fastest trains to share track with a wide variety of other services. The rule will \u201cremove regulatory barriers and enable use of new technological designs, allowing a more open U.S. rail market,\u201d according to the FRA\u2019s Federal Register notice, which will be published today. Our Tanya Snyder has more for Pros.\n\nAviation\n\nLOOKING AT LARSEN'S PLANS: Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat who\u2019s in line to chair the House Transportation Aviation Subcommittee next Congress, sat down with our Brianna Gurciullo to talk about his priorities. He said the recent passage of an FAA reauthorization gives lawmakers the chance to zoom out and look broadly at the future of aviation. His first hearing, Larsen said, will be about aerospace and aviation in 2050. And his first trip? To the FAA\u2019s William J. Hughes Technical Center. \u201cIt's kind of a geeky thing to do, but that's where all the research is going on,\u201d he said.

The mission of these unregistered foreign agents \u2013 that\u2019s what they are, unregistered agents \u2013 is to pressure this president into some kind of a deal.\u201d\n\nKudlow dismissed Navarro\u2019s accusations a few days later, calling his comments \u201cway off base\u201d.\n\n\u201cI actually think he did the president a great disservice. I think Peter very badly misspoke. He was freelancing, and he\u2019s not representing the president or the administration,\u201d Kudlow said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nTrump has significantly toned down his rhetoric about China and trade since late September, when the administration imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nFrom July 6, when Washington slapped the first round of duties on Chinese goods, to the most recent tariff announcement on September 18, Trump tweeted about China 20 times, trade 42 times and tariffs 21 times.\n\nSince then, Trump has only mentioned China five times \u2013 the latest on November 1, when he said he had a \u201ca long and very good conversation\u201d with Xi on many subjects, with a \u201cheavy emphasis on trade\u201d. He has mentioned tariffs twice since September 18, and trade 19 times \u2013 mostly in reference to the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or in relation to other trade partners.\n\nMeanwhile, his administration is divided between the hard-line hawks like Navarro and Lighthizer seeking maximum concessions from China versus pragmatists like Kudlow and Mnuchin who are more willing to seek a compromise \u2013 and that will make it more difficult for Trump and Xi to reach any deal.\n\nLighthizer, the U.S. trade chief and a key architect of the tariff war, released a report on Tuesday saying China had so far failed to change the behavior that had prompted the U.S. to impose tariffs on around $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nHe made the statement in conjunction with an update to the U.S. investigation into China\u2019s intellectual property theft under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. That investigation and its initial report in March provided the legal basis for Trump to impose tariffs on nearly half of all U.S. imports from China.\n\n\u201cThis update shows that China has not fundamentally altered its unfair, unreasonable and market-distorting practices that were the subject of the March 2018 report on our Section 301 investigation,\u201d the trade chief said in a statement.\n\nAlan Wheatley, an associate fellow of international economics at British think tank Chatham House, said U.S.-China relations would be bumpy with or without an agreement on a trade war ceasefire in Argentina.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has made it clear that it regards China as posing a much broader strategic challenge to U.S. economic and military supremacy,\u201d Wheatley said. \u201cA truce would spell welcome short-term relief to nervous global markets but wouldn\u2019t be a game-changer for relations between the two.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Chad Bray\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "nmccaskill@politico.com (Nolan D.

After a shutdown fight over border wall funding, Thune will play a leading role in protecting a half-dozen Republican incumbents up for reelection in 2020 in states with large populations of the kind of suburban voters who rejected President Donald Trump in the midterms.\n\n\u201cThune comes in with a chairman\u2019s pedigree after running the Senate Commerce Committee for four years.

Read the latest issue of The Agenda to learn more.\n\nSHUTDOWN WATCH -- With a government funding deadline a little more than two weeks away, both sides are dug in: The president wants at least $5 billion for his border wall, and Democrats are considering a push for legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller and eliminate a citizenship question from the next census. \u201cMeanwhile, House Democrats are embroiled in a divisive leadership fight, limiting the energy that Nancy Pelosi can devote to the year-end spending negotiations,\u201d Burgess writes. \u201cAnd House Republicans, set to enter the minority in just a month and a half, recognize this is their last chance to get a down payment for Trump\u2019s wall before entering legislative obscurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stakes have been lessened somewhat by deals this summer to fund about 75 percent of the government until next fall,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut a partial shutdown isn\u2019t what either party is looking for, either.\u201d Neither side wants a shutdown.

Trump reportedly sent emails from that account to White House aides, Cabinet members and her assistants.

But his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, intends to ask the president to make a direct appeal for McConnell to take up the bill once it has more GOP support.

McConnell insisted to senators on Monday\u2019s call with Grassley that he wasn\u2019t trying to kill the bill. \u201cAllies of Mr. McConnell said he was not opposed to the legislation, but was wary of bringing up a bill that could divide his caucus,\u201d Fandos reports. \u201cHe made no firm commitments to the senators but said he would look closely at the results of a formal whip count taken next week.\u201d More: https://nyti.ms/2BnVg11\n\nLOVE LOST -- Democrat Ben McAdams has defeated Rep.

We\u2019ll be back Monday.\n\nTHE BUZZ\n\nCall it a second blue wave. With mail-in ballots finally counted in Lake County, Democrat Mary Edly-Allen defeated Republican state Rep. Helene Miller Walsh.\n\nIt was one of four races to swing from red to blue Monday, two weeks after the general election. In the Lake County Sheriff's race, Democrat John Idleburg defeated incumbent Republican Mark Curran. Because just 137 votes separate the candidates, Curran is expected to ask for a recount.\n\nOn the Lake County Board, Jessica Vealitzek (District 10) and Jennifer Clark (District 15) defeated Republican incumbents Charles \"Chuck\" Bartels and Carol Calabresa, respectively. Calabresa was acting chair of the Lake County Board. Democrats now have a majority on the board\u2014a first.\n\n\"These victories show that Democrats in the 10th District are energized, organized, and winning over voters while local Republicans prove themselves to be out of the mainstream and out of touch,\u201d Tenth Dems' founding Chair Lauren Beth Gash said in a release.\n\nLake County is considered a battleground area. So everyone has a view on why it's swinging more left in this election cycle. Were voters pushed there by President Donald Trump's rhetoric? One Democratic campaign strategist credits J.B. Pritzker\u2019s investment of millions of dollars in mail ballots for giving Edly-Allen and other Lake County races a boost. \u201cThose down-ballot races are won on the margins and being able to have that program and money taken care of from the top of the ticket is huge,\u201d he said. A GOP lawmaker grumbles that it was Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s negatives that pulled Republican candidates down in Lake County. And a Democratic observer says those anti-Mike Madigan ads back-fired.\n\nAll those theories go against what's happening in a suburban Cook County race: It looks like Republican state Rep. Tom Morrison has a 37-point lead over Democrat Maggie Trevor.

It will allow the center to expand services in financial literacy, after-school care and enterprise training.\n\nThe center learned of the out-of-the-blue gift in October, when Bezos\u2019 attorney called to say Primo Center was a finalist. An advisory committee submitted the Chicago nonprofit\u2019s name as a candidate for the prize.

Dick Durbin.\n\nWHERE'S THE MAYOR\n\nNo public events.\n\nWHERE'S THE GOV\n\nNo public events.\n\nA message from the Illinois Car Sharing Coalition: With transportation expenses on the rise, Illinoisans are looking to car sharing to help them earn extra income and save costs on transportation. Yet, legislation that lawmakers are considering, SB 2641, would deny Illinoisans from an opportunity to make money while their cars sit idle and unfairly double tax car owners. Car sharing is not the same as car rental, and the two industries cannot be treated the same. With car sharing, car owners can benefit financially while they aren\u2019t using their cars. When regular Illinoisans buy a car, they pay sales tax. Rental car companies don\u2019t because they have a sales tax waiver. But, this bill would force a car owner who has already paid sales tax to pay twice if they want to earn extra money sharing their car. Legislators should VOTE NO on the SB 2641 override. www.ILCarSharing.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter Shia Kapos @shiakapos"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mfriedman@politico.com (Matt Friedman)", "title": "Ten Sacco relatives get public paychecks", "description": null, "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-jersey-playbook/2018/11/21/ten-sacco-relatives-get-public-paychecks-350283", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:16:14Z", "content": "Good Wednesday morning!

A close associate of Mayor Nicholas Sacco at the Board of Education has 11 of her relatives in local tax-payer funded jobs, most with the North Bergen school system.

Phil Murphy and his wife settled into dinner at an upscale restaurant in Middletown during last Thursday\u2019s storm. It had been a long day for the Democratic governor, who had spent the afternoon into the evening scrambling to deal with stronger-than-expected snowfall that officials later admitted they weren\u2019t prepared for, and Restaurant Nicholas, located a mile from his house, was an inviting and convenient option. The New York Times, in a glowing four-star review in 2006, raved that the lobster, served over a homemade lemon-zest pappardelle, was \u2018outstandingly sweet and tender.\u2019 The dinner menu starts at $75 per person, while the bar menu is somewhat more affordable, according to the restaurant\u2019s website. \u2018The Governor ate dinner late Thursday night near his home after being stuck on the road for several hours during the storm,\u2019 Mahen Gunaratna, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement on Tuesday morning after this story was first published. \u2018Earlier in the night, he held a conference call with cabinet officials on the storm response and visited the Statewide Traffic Management Center to monitor conditions.\u2019\u201d Read more here\n\nGIVING AWAY THE COMMISSARY \u2014 Murphy administration, corrections union reach contract agreement, by POLITICO\u2019s Katherine Landergan: The Murphy administration has reached a projected $84 million contract agreement with the state\u2019s corrections officers union, ending three years in which the officers had no contract. The deal gives bonuses and some retroactive pay to the PBA Local 105 officers who haven\u2019t received a raise since their contract expired in 2015. The agreement also restores salary increases that were frozen during the Christie era. Former Gov. Chris Christie froze so-called step increases \u2014 or boosts in pay for employees who reach service milestones \u2014 for many public workers on expired contracts. The contract gives some back pay to the 5,200 corrections, parole and juvenile justice officers that are in the union, but doesn\u2019t appear to give the full retroactive amount the union was seeking.

The State Commission of Investigation in 2015 first detailed the alleged abuses of \u201cmulti-dealer locations.\u201d A company essentially sets up a front for hundreds of the dealers to rent cubicles in a space they never actually occupy, simply to comply with the requirements for a used car sales license, SCI said. Those dealers often sell cars in other states that have more stringent licensing requirements. A follow-up report released Tuesday shows little progress in combating the abuses. Regulatory reforms adopted by the Motor Vehicle Commission to address some of the problems have been threatened by pending legislation \u2014 pushed for by the same lobbyist the SCI called out in 2015 for helping enable some of the industry\u2019s worst practices.

The thousands of New Jersey homeowners who count on Homestead to help offset their property taxes will file one application for payments made in 2016, but their credits and rebates will be issued in two semi-annual disbursements next year. Homeowners left scratching their heads over the cumbersome procedure need to keep one thing in mind: Their applications must be submitted to the state Division of Taxation by November 30 (by mail or online).

The slain family includes Keith and Jennifer Caneiro, who owned the home, and their two children, according to a law enforcement source. Jennifer Caneiro and her two children were found inside the mansion on Willow Brook Road and the fourth victim, Keith Caneiro, was found shot to death outside the home, according to a source. The revelation that the Caneiro family were the victims of a quadruple homicide was a bizarre and grisly twist to a tragic story which may have started at a home in Ocean Township owned by Keith Caneiro's brother, Paul. A fire at about 5 a.m. was reported at that house on Tilton Drive.\u201d Read more here\n\n\u201cLakewood home invasion victim speaks out after vicious assault,\u201d by The Asbury Park Press\u2019 Stacey Barchenger: \u201cFrederick \u2018Rob\u2019 Robison and his wife of 13 years, Patricia, were brutally assaulted during an overnight home-invasion Aug. 29 at their residence on Eagle Ridge Circle.

The expenditures are a key reason why the recruiting budget increased 33.5 percent to a record $1.27 million in the 2016-17 school year -- the first season that Rutgers football coach Chris Ash, men's basketball coach Steve Pikiell and Athletics Director Pat Hobbs were in their respective positions. Rutgers officials say the flights were paid for through funds privately raised via the Rutgers University Foundation and transferred to the university's athletics department for the purpose of recruiting \u2026 Rutgers' $1.27 million recruiting budget represented 1 percent of the athletic program's budget in 2016-17.Overall, Rutgers' athletics ledger revealed a $47.4 million shortfall in a $99.2 million budget that was made up by $21.3 million in support from the university's operating budget, $11.8 million in student fees, and a $14.3 million internal loan.\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014Judge rejects racetrack\u2019s attempt to collect damages from NCAA Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cNo charges will be filed in connection to Mallory Grossman's suicide\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cN.J. has seen an 'exponential' increase in hoax threats of violence\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cN.J. moving companies jacked up costs, held items hostage in $2M fraud, feds say\u201d Read more here\n\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter Matt Friedman @mattfriedmannj"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "coprysko@politico.com (Caitlin Oprysko)", "title": "Trump says he may attend next WHCA dinner after news it won't feature comedian", "description": "Last year's speaker, Michelle Wolf, set off a firestorm with her polarizing jokes.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/21/trump-go-to-whca-dinner-comedian-1010116", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/15/86/6a8ecf824d9bb8c6e3accf25c6d1/181121-trump-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:12:52Z", "content": "President Donald Trump, who has lambasted the White House Correspondents Dinner since he hit the political scene and some of event's jokes began to target him, has not been to the dinner since he was sworn into office. | Alex Wong/Getty Images President Donal\u2026 [+2642 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump, who has lambasted the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner since he hit the political scene and some of event's jokes began to target him, has not been to the dinner since he was sworn into office. | Alex Wong/Getty Images white house correspondents' dinner Trump says he may attend next WHCA dinner after news it won't feature comedian\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday night praised the decision by the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association to break its tradition of featuring a comedian at its annual dinner, and suggested he may attend the dinner for the first time in his presidency.\n\nThe WHCA on Monday announced that it had invited Ron Chernow, a presidential historian and author, to speak at its annual dinner, which is typically known for featuring a stand-up set by a popular comedian.

In Lawrence, temperatures will peak at 21 degrees on Thanksgiving, and the low temperature will be 12 degrees. More than a quarter of residential meters impacted still don't have gas service, meaning residents are using hot plates and space heaters, or even living elsewhere.\n\nThe response to the crisis, which killed one person and injured others, looks like it will enter its next stage after the holiday.

In the meantime, Columbia Gas plans to provide more than 16,000 Thanksgiving meals to people impacted by the disaster.\n\nAnd Gov. Charlie Baker filed legislation yesterday to \"strengthen natural gas safety procedures.\" The proposed law would require a certified professional engineer to sign off on natural gas work that poses a risk to public safety, his office said in an email. Baker also announced on Tuesday plans to leverage an additional $10 million for the 600 businesses impacted by the disaster.\n\nColumbia Gas says it supports Baker\u2019s legislation, which is based on safety recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. Lieberman pointed to the company's new $150 million program to install \"slam-shut\" devices that would shut down gas if unsafe pressure levels are detected.\n\nColumbia Gas is confident gas service will be fully restored by Dec. 16, Lieberman says, and 670 families have returned to their homes from temporary housing. The company initially said service would be restored Nov. 19, but moved the deadline after hitting delays in October. As of Wednesday night, 5,374 residential meters \u2014 73 percent of those impacted \u2014 had been restored gas service.

That might not seem particularly controversial, but there were five Thursdays in November, 1939 (as there are this year). And Americans had been celebrating Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of November since the Civil War. It was tradition, not anything official, but it was a tradition begun by Abraham Lincoln himself in 1863, months after the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg.\n\nAs with many things Lincolnian, his Thanksgiving edict became sacred writ. Until, that is, the squire of Hyde Park decided to question this piece of dogmatic Americana.\n\nRoosevelt had a practical, some might say crass, motive for moving the holiday. The nation\u2019s big retailers thought it would be a good idea to get shoppers to the stores ASAP to buy things like BB guns designed to shoot your eye out. Fixing Thanksgiving on Nov. 23, 1939, rather than waiting for the fifth Thursday, Nov. 30, gave merchants an extra week to peddle their goods; back then it was considered gauche to start shopping for Christmas before everybody had their fill of turkey.\n\nNot everybody was so keen on this idea. Some referred to the new date as \u201cFranksgiving.\u201d FDR didn\u2019t notify the country of the change in date until Halloween, which was too late to reschedule all those Thanksgiving football games. Alf Landon, who lost the 1936 presidential election to Roosevelt, complained that FDR was acting like Adolf Hitler.\n\nTwenty-three of the 48 states ignored FDR\u2019s new date and celebrated on Lincoln\u2019s Thanksgiving, which made the whole family reunion thing difficult since not all states celebrated on the same day. In one of the great Solomon-like compromises of all time, two states, Texas and Colorado, celebrated the holiday on both dates that year. And it got worse \u2014 Roosevelt proclaimed Thanksgiving on the third Thursday of November in 1940 and \u201841 (the next-to-last Thursday of the month) while large portions of the country ignored him and celebrated a week later. It took an act of Congress to unify Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November beginning in 1942. So sometimes the holiday follows the Lincoln tradition, and sometimes it follows the Roosevelt idea. Ah, if only everything could work out so nicely.\n\nIT\u2019S WEDNESDAY.

City Comptroller Scott Stringer rejected the city Law Department\u2019s proposed $2.6 million contract with the firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, which has represented de Blasio in a federal investigation into his fundraising practices dating back to the spring of 2016. In his rejection letter, which was sent to the department on July 3 and made public on Tuesday after the mayor overrode it, Stringer said the contract did not properly distinguish between coverage for personal and governmental reasons. \"New Yorkers deserve to know how their money is being spent,\" Stringer spokeswoman Ilana Maier said in a statement.

Five judges, led by Michael Garcia, wrote that nothing in the laws creating the pre-K programs \u2018gives school districts unilateral authority to impose curricular and programmatic requirements on charter schools\u2014by contract or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jimmy Vielkind\n\nTAMING THE AMAZON BACKLASH: \u201cState and city officials have been quietly trying to cajole opponents into supporting the deal by phone and in person. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say that some regret was expressed about how things were handled\u2019 during the rollout of the Amazon deal, said [Jimmy]. Van Bramer, describing his meeting on Monday with top officials from the state\u2019s economic development arm, Empire State Development, including its president, Howard Zemsky. Later that day, he met with James Patchett, the president of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. Amazon, too, has reached out to Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris to set up a meeting. (Mr. Gianaris said he had already turned them down.) ...\n\nNone of the state officials involved in the deal felt that it was rolled out in an ideal manner, said a person with direct knowledge of the conversations.

The mayor, the police commissioner and the city\u2019s district attorneys all said they worried that public safety might be put at risk. At first blush, those concerns may have been misplaced. In October, hundreds of volunteers acting on behalf of the advocacy group posted $1.2 million in bail to free 105 people from Rikers Island and other city jails. Of the 90 who have since had scheduled court appearances, only two failed to show up as of Friday, according to the group.

THE NEW YORK TIMES: \u201cOver the last several weeks, a note of discontent about The New York Times\u2019s editorial board has crept into Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s public statements. In a radio interview on WAMC, Cuomo compared The Times to the Wizard of Oz, and that when you pull back the curtain, there\u2019s \u2018just a little man there.\u2019 At the memorial service for Drew Zambelli, an advisor to both him and his father, Cuomo knocked the newspaper for what he said was ethnic bias against Mario Cuomo...And now as he defends the project to bring tens of thousands of jobs from Amazon to Long Island City, Cuomo is at war with The Times\u2019s editorial board, which has been opposed to the agreement\u2019s $3 billion in tax credits linked to the job creation.Cuomo on Monday released a statement slamming both The Times and The New York Post for opposing the deal in their editorial pages while also pointing out the newspapers\u2019 parent companies reap many of the same tax benefits.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cuomo responded to The New York Times\u2019s response in The Daily News, renewing the fight. \u2018On a practical level, Amazon could have moved to New Jersey and received their $7 billion incentive package, which is a multiple of New York\u2019s incentive package, and still had access to New York\u2019s talent pool,\u2019 Cuomo said. \u2018In addition, if there was ever a business that one could say was captive to New York and could not leave and hence required no government incentive package it is the New York Times.

While some are wealthy space enthusiasts who have wanted to be part of the space industry since watching the Apollo missions other as children, others are investors who just see a smart business opportunity.\n\nAnderson also talked about how the government is driving private sector growth and why more people are wanting to invest in space during a recent interview in New York.\n\nTranscript has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy did you found Space Angels?\n\nThis was a matter of reading the tea leaves and seeing the different pieces come together... 2012 was the first year that SpaceX berthed with the space station...This was a really pivotal moment...and it was really about recognizing the barrier to entry coming down in this storied industry...It was this really off limits market, but very big and lucrative, sort of old fashioned, stuffy. We were just witnessing the barriers to entry come crashing down. You saw this wave of innovation and entrepreneurship come flowing in. That\u2019s really why I got involved and why I dedicated my career to this.\n\nThe way Space Angels operates is we have an investment platform that we developed ourselves. Accredited investors can apply to be members. They go in front of a membership committee and they\u2019re approved. When they're approved, they come onto the platform and have access to a wealth of information about investment opportunities. Space Angels goes out and does the leg work, going to conferences and events to establish relationships with all these incubators and universities. We source all of the deals, we screen all of the deals, we do all the diligence on the deals, then we make that available to our members.\n\nOur members come on the platform knowing that if a deal makes it onto the platform, it\u2019s been thoroughly vetted. We also put all of the information at their fingertips. It\u2019s sort of like if you were the investment committee making decisions for a venture capital fund, this is the type of information you would be given. [It includes] everything you want to know about the team, the market, the competition, their business model.\n\nWho are your investors?\n\nAll kinds of people...A lot of it is older individuals who have been successful in some other industry. They grew up watching Apollo and have been fascinated by space their whole life and now they want to find a way to get involved...That\u2019s what I would call space enthusiasts. But there\u2019s also people who are just noticing what\u2019s happening...It\u2019s exciting. There\u2019s a ton of growth and a ton of opportunity.\n\nWith this increased access to space comes all these new markets as well...What are the opportunities if you land on Mars and you become the transportation, railroad, utilities, communications? What does that look like?\n\nThese are really, really, really large opportunities and I think people are starting to see the opportunity as well. You\u2019re getting a lot of people that...don\u2019t necessarily have any affinity towards space, but see the opportunity. That\u2019s been the big change over the last three to five years.\n\nAre you seeing more people wanting to invest in space?\n\nYes. When we started this thing, there were four investors, [and they were] all space enthusiasts. It took a long time to grow that to 20, [who were] again, all space enthusiasts. Then things really started to tick up in 2015, 2016, 2017 and now 2018. The last four years, we\u2019ve seen growth.\n\nIn Space Angels, we have 250 members. We cap it at 250, and we have a long wait list. We have new applications coming in all the time.

MARCIA FUDGE (D-OHIO) endorsed NANCY PELOSI for speaker. Fudge toyed with a run for the chamber\u2019s top job after the election, and was seen as a prime choice for the Never-Pelosi\u2019ers. In fact, in recent days, members of the \u201crebel\u201d faction told us that they thought Fudge was getting closer to running against Pelosi. Instead, she became a Pelosi booster.\n\nYES, Pelosi has a math problem in that more than a half dozen Democrats have said they don\u2019t want to vote for her. But Pelosi is continuing to rack up support and dole out largesse -- leadership roles in the caucus are attractive perks. THE FLOOR VOTE for speaker is 43 days away.\n\n-- HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHAN: \u201cFudge\u2019s endorsement is a significant blow to efforts by more than a dozen current and incoming Democrats to oust Pelosi, who has ruled over the caucus for the last 16 years. Fudge\u2019s backing leaves the rebel faction without a potential challenger against the longtime Democratic leader.\n\n\u201cAt the same time Fudge announced her support, Pelosi\u2019s office released a statement naming the Ohio Democrat chairwoman of a House subcommittee overseeing elections in the next Congress. Fudge said Pelosi had promised her an opportunity to work to protect voting rights and assured her that \u2018the most loyal voting bloc in the Democratic Party, black women, will have a seat at the decision-making table.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- PEOPLE GETTING WORN DOWN: CNN\u2019S MANU RAJU and ANNIE GRAYER: \u201cFreshmen Democrats feel the squeeze as Pelosi fight intensifies\u201d: \u201cAs Gil Cisneros completed a Democratic sweep of Orange County, the incoming House freshman fielded a phone call from a person heavily invested in his victory.\n\n\u201cIt was Nancy Pelosi. The House Democratic leader congratulated her fellow California Democrat in a warm phone call for a hard-fought victory in what used to be reliably Republican terrain. \u2018I told her, 'Thank you very much for calling' and that was pretty much it,\u2019 Cisneros told CNN. \u2018And we'll probably talk later.\u2019 Indeed, they probably will.\n\n\u201cCisneros is one of 12 incoming freshmen Democrats who vowed on the campaign trail to back new leadership in the new Congress, distancing themselves from Pelosi whom the GOP vilified in nearly $100 million worth of ads throughout the country. \u2026 \u2018Right now, I'm just focusing on talking to my constituents -- focusing on spending time with my family with Thanksgiving coming up,\u2019 Cisneros said when asked if he'd support Pelosi on the floor.\n\n\u201c\u2018And then after that, I'll start talking to people about what's going to happen and how we're going to vote.\u2019 While Cisneros says, \u2018I still believe it's time for new leadership -- it's a time to hear new voices,\u2019 he also says he hasn't made a decision on how he'll vote on the floor.\u201d CNN\n\n-- OBAMA WEIGHS IN ON 'THE AXE FILES' -- \u201cHer stamina, her ability to see around corners, her ability to stand her ground and do hard things and to suffer unpopularity to get the right thing done, I think, stands up against any person that I've observed or worked directly with in Washington during my lifetime.\u201d CNN\n\nPELOSI also sent a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter late last night recommending the caucus create a new position \u2014 \u201cChair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\u201d This is in addition to the three co-chairs, which were recently filled by Reps.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), and ranking member, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), specifically asked on Tuesday whether the administration believed that bin Salman was involved in the murder of Khashoggi, who wrote for The Washington Post and was killed in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, last month. Trump gave no ruling on bin Salman\u2019s involvement in a statement earlier Tuesday that largely sided with Saudi Arabia, declaring that \u2018maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u2019\n\n\u201cBut under the Magnitsky Act, Trump can be required to make a determination about human rights violations by global leaders. The law requires the president to do so within 120 days of the committee\u2019s request, as well as apply any sanctions. Corker and Menendez made their first request on Oct. 10, without specifically asking about bin Salman.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT\u2019S MARK MAZZETTI in D.C. and BEN HUBBARD in Beirut: \u201cPresident Trump has long viewed foreign policy as a series of business deals, stripped of values and idealism. But his 633-word statement on Tuesday about the brutal killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi showed the extent to which he believes that raw, mercantilist calculations should guide the United States\u2019 decisions about the Middle East and the wider world.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump made clear that he sees alliances as transactional, based on which foreign partners buy the most weapons. American jobs outweigh American values. And all countries act abhorrently, so an American president should never hold friends to different standards than enemies.\n\n\u201cTuesday\u2019s message could become something of a blueprint for foreign leaders \u2014 a guide to how they might increase their standing in the eyes of the American president as well as how far they can go in crushing domestic critics without raising American ire.\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cSaudi Arabia Accused of Torturing Women\u2019s-Rights Activists in Widening Crackdown on Dissent,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Margherita Stancati in Beirut and Summer Said in Dubai\n\nGood Wednesday morning.

Comey, according to two people familiar with the conversation.\n\n\u201cThe lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, rebuffed the president, saying that he had no authority to order a prosecution. Mr. McGahn said that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. To underscore his point, Mr. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo for Mr. Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face a range of consequences, including possible impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe encounter was one of the most blatant examples yet of how Mr. Trump views the typically independent Justice Department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies.\u201d NYT\n\nTHE INVESTIGATIONS \u2026\n\n-- DARREN SAMUELSOHN: \u201cMueller got some answers, but he's not done with Trump,\u201d: \u201cPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday finally submitted a set of written responses to Robert Mueller, signaling that he was done for good with the special counsel's questions. But Mueller is far from done with him.\n\n\u201cThe special counsel still wants to question the president over his actions while in the White House \u2014 Tuesday's answers only covered Russian hacking during the 2016 election. It's a fight that could result in a historic subpoena and eventual Supreme Court ruling, pulling a defiant Trump into a legal squabble that could set groundbreaking precedent for presidential investigations for years to come. Depending on how the battle plays out, House Democrats may even try and pounce and launch impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThings could get explosive fast. Next comes the perilous round of negotiations between Trump\u2019s lawyers and Mueller\u2019s prosecutors covering topics like Trump's intentions when firing FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. That line of questioning \u2014 which Trump says he shouldn't have to answer \u2014 is tied to Mueller's ongoing obstruction of justice investigation.\u201d POLITICO\n\nIN MISSISSIPPI \u2026 JAMES ARKIN: \u201cHyde-Smith apologizes 'to anyone offended' by public hanging remark,\u201d: \u201cMississippi Sen.

Scott Applewhite/AP photo trade GOP senators seek quick passage of Mexico-Canada trade deal\n\nA group of Senate Republicans is pushing for Congress to approve President Donald Trump's new trade deal with Canada and Mexico before Democrats take the House in January.\n\nIn a letter to Trump obtained by a POLITICO, a dozen Senate Republicans with wide-ranging views on trade policy urged the president to submit the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement by the end of November to Congress to allow a vote on it before the end of the year. GOP leaders are currently focused on funding the government past Dec. 7 and clinching an agreement on the farm bill, but this bloc of Republicans says it's in Trump's best interest to move now on the hard-fought trade agreement in case House Democrats refuse to bring it up.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"We are concerned that if the administration waits until next year to send to Congress a draft implementing bill, passage of the USMCA as negotiated will become significantly more difficult,\" the senators wrote. \"It is still possible for the current Congress to consider and and vote on the USMCA before the end\" of the year.\n\nThough Republicans are far from unified on trade themselves, there is significant worry among the GOP that House Democrats will have their own demands in order to approve the new trade agreement \u2014 if they approve it at all. Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declined to bring up a Colombia free-trade agreement in 2008 when George W. Bush was president, though it was later passed during Barack Obama's presidency after being renegotiated.\n\nRepublicans are worried about taking a similar risk with the USMCA after months of tariff spats with Mexico and Canada and tough negotiations, particularly as Trump seeks a win on trade heading into his reelection campaign. The letter to Trump is signed by Republicans in lockstep with the president's policies, as well as senators that have recoiled from them.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

And he made clear the agreement still needs work.\n\n\"For free traders like me, the recently negotiated USMCA is a mixed bag of trade-enhancing and trade-restricting changes to the current North American Free Trade Agreement. Unfortunately, the benefits of these enhancements are more than offset by the trade-limiting provisions,\" Toomey said. \"However, I would be willing to vote for the agreement if the President takes steps to strengthen it in the coming weeks through pro-trade modifications in the implementing legislation.\"\n\nEven under the most aggressive timetable, the Trump administration and Congress would be able to consider the trade agreement at the end of December, and most lawmakers will want to be home by then. Outgoing Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said Wednesday's it's \"not realistic\" to pass the agreement in the Lame Duck.\n\nBut the biggest problem for these senators is the agenda crush at the end of the year: After returning from Thanksgiving, Congress will have less than two weeks to figure out how to avoid a partial government shutdown. GOP leaders also want to finish the farm bill, and a group of criminal justice reformers are pushing for passage of sentencing reform. Other Republicans are hoping to vote on more tax cuts before giving up the House.\n\nAll of those competing priorities will make it difficult to vote on a divisive new trade deal before next year. But if Trump submits it to Congress, those Republican senators say they are \"committed\" to working with Trump on legislation to implement his trade deal \"that could win our votes, as well as a majority in the House and Senate.\"\n\nDoug Palmer contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "John P.

In just a decade, from age 11 to 21, he went from gaming to hacking to killing, an arc the world had never seen before, unfolding faster than anyone might have imagined. For the first half of his digital life, the hacker operated with impunity, bragging in an interview that he was many steps ahead of the authorities: \u201cOne hundred percent certain they have nothing on me. I don\u2019t exist to them, I\u2019ve never used my real details online, I\u2019ve never purchased anything. My real identity doesn\u2019t exist online\u2014and no, I don\u2019t fear getting caught.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBy 2015, at age 21, he knew different\u2014he was a marked man, hunted by the United States, the No. 3 leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on the government\u2019s most wanted list. Living on the run in ISIS-controlled eastern Syria, Hussain tried to keep his stepson close by, ensuring that U.S. airstrikes wouldn\u2019t target him. Inside the Justice Department where I worked at the time, as assistant attorney general for national security, Hussain\u2019s efforts made him a top threat. Nearly every week of 2015 brought a new Hussain-inspired plot against the United States; FBI surveillance teams were exhausted, chasing dozens of would-be terrorists at once. We\u2019d pulled agents from criminal assignments to supplement the counterterrorism squads. Within the government, alarm bells rang daily, but we attempted to downplay the threat publicly. We didn\u2019t want to elevate Hussain to another global figurehead like Osama bin Laden, standing for the twisted ideology of Islamic jihad.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t even really talk about him publicly until he was dead.\n\nHussain represented an online threat we long recognized would arrive someday\u2014a tech-savvy terrorist who could use the tools of modern digital life to extend the reach of a terror group far beyond its physical location. In the summer of 2015, he successfully executed one of the most global cyber plots we\u2019d ever seen: A British terrorist of Pakistani descent, living in Syria, recruited a Kosovar hacker who was studying computer science in Malaysia, to enable attacks on American servicemen and women inside the United States.\n\nJunaid Hussain/YouTube\n\nHussain\u2019s path to becoming a cyber terrorist started with a simple motive: revenge. According to an interview he gave in 2012, Hussain\u2014who originally went online by the moniker TriCk\u2014said he started hacking at around age 11. He\u2019d been playing a game online when another hacker knocked him offline. \u201cI wanted revenge so I started googling around on how to hack,\u201d he explained. \u201cI joined a few online hacking forums, read tutorials, started with basic social engineering and worked my way up. I didn\u2019t get my revenge, but I became one of the most hated hackers on this game.\u201d\n\nBy 13, he found the game childish, and by 15, he \u201cbecame political.\u201d He found himself sucked online into watching videos of children getting killed in countries like Kashmir and Pakistan and swept into conspiratorial websites about the Freemasons and Illuminati. Those rabbit holes led Hussain to found a hacker group with seven friends; they called themselves TeaMp0isoN, hacker-speak for \u201cTeam Poison,\u201d based on their old hacking forum p0ison.org. They became notorious in 2011 for their unique brand of \u201chacktivism,\u201d defacing websites, often with pro-Palestine messages, and attacking online key websites such as BlackBerry and NATO and figures such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2014they hacked his personal assistant and then released his address book online. Hussain dismissed other \u201chacktivist\u201d groups such as Anonymous, saying they symbolized the online equivalent of \u201cpeaceful protesting, camping on the street,\u201d whereas his TeaMp0isoN executed \u201cinternet guerrilla warfare.\u201d In April 2012, TriCk told a British newspaper, \u201cI fear no man or authority. My whole life is dedicated to the cause.\u201d\n\nHis online exploits didn\u2019t last long: By September 2012, he had been arrested and sentenced to six months in prison for the Blair stunt. TeaMp0isoN faded away, but Hussain\u2019s anger and resentment at Western society continued to boil. Sometime soon after his release, he made his way to ISIS\u2019s territory in Syria and married another British would-be musician-turned-ISIS-convert, Sarah Jones. There, he threw himself into ISIS\u2019s online propaganda war, remaking himself as Abu Hussain al-Britani with a Twitter avatar that showed him, his face half-covered by a mask, aiming an AK-47-style rifle at the camera. He turned everything he\u2019d learned about online culture and tools into what one journalist called \u201ca macabre version of online dating,\u201d as he quickly gained prominence as ISIS\u2019s lead propagandist in the CyberCaliphate, recruiting disaffected youth like himself to the global battlefield. \u201cYou can sit at home and play Call of Duty or you can come here and respond to the real call of duty \u2026 the choice is yours,\u201d he announced in one tweet.\n\nHussain\u2019s tactics weren\u2019t necessarily new, but he and fellow ISIS terrorists executed them at a level we\u2019d never seen before. Hussain represented, in some ways, the most dangerous terrorist we\u2019d yet seen\u2014a master of the emerging world of digital jihad.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWe knew that sooner or later terrorists would turn to the internet\u2014the same principles that make the web great for insurgents and niche communities\u2014its openness, ease of use and global reach\u2014made it useful for supercharging extremism online. I spent much of my time in government\u2014first at the FBI, then at the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, eventually serving as assistant attorney general overseeing the division\u2014watching this rising threat and anticipating when we would first see a \u201cblended attack,\u201d one that mixed online operations with a kinetic real-world assault\u2014an attack, for instance, that would see terrorists explode a car bomb at the same time they attacked a city\u2019s communication system, multiplying an attack\u2019s fear, confusion and effect. The terrorists saw the possibilities, too: Al Qaeda even released a video comparing the vulnerabilities in computer network security to weak points in aviation security before 9/11.\n\nTerrorism online presented a new twist\u2014never before had the United States been involved in a conflict where the enemy could communicate from overseas directly with the American people. And just months before I arrived at the FBI in 2007, working as a special counsel and later chief of staff to Director Robert Mueller, a new online tool named Twitter launched. We had no idea then how much power it would give to online extremists.\n\nBy the time I moved into my new office on the seventh floor of the hulking J. Edgar Hoover Building on Pennsylvania Avenue, something else had changed too: The threat from al Qaeda had morphed. Whereas Osama bin Laden\u2019s terror group originally relied on its own centrally executed plots\u2014such as 9/11 and the 2006 plot against transatlantic passenger planes\u2014the relentless post-9/11 campaign by NATO, Western intelligence agencies, and every tool of the U.S. government severely compromised their ability to organize and direct attacks from afar. Instead, \u201ccore\u201d al Qaeda effectively allowed \u201cterrorist franchises\u201d to continue their mission for them, groups like al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and al Qaeda in Iraq, the terror movement that evolved into ISIS. It was these next-generation terrorist franchises that really took al-Qaeda\u2019s online operations to the next level, using the internet to turn the jihadist movement into a networked global threat, with a reach far beyond the war zones of Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria.\n\nIslamic extremism had mainly developed in countries with state-controlled media, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, so the movement naturally invested heavily in alternative means of communication from the beginning. \u201cCore\u201d al Qaeda relied primarily on in-person lectures and fundraising tours in mosques and community centers around the world\u2014and even, before 9/11, inside the United States\u2014with some brief forays into \u201cWeb 1.0\u201d technologies such as forums, bulletin boards and listservs, to spread its message.\n\nAl Qaeda\u2019s media operations specifically shied away from covering the more violent side of its global jihad. It saw the global battle for \u201chearts and minds\u201d as best won with ideas, not searing images. When its Iraqi affiliate, led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, began distributing videos of brutal beheadings online in the mid-2000s, with the then-horrifying but now-too-familiar iconography of hostages in orange jumpsuits, bin Laden\u2019s top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, wrote a letter warning the Iraqi group to dial back its horror show: \u201cI say to you: that we are in a battle, and that more than half of this battle is taking place in the battlefield of the media. And that we are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of our Umma [Muslim people],\u201d Zawahiri wrote, gently chastising his hotheaded Iraqi colleague. \u201cThe Muslim populace who love and support you will never find palatable \u2026 the scenes of slaughtering the hostages.\u201d\n\nThat difference in approach represented a sign of a generational divide, between the older leaders of al Qaeda\u2014such as bin Laden and Zawahiri\u2014and a new, more tech-savvy generation who understood the power of images online. It mirrored a generational divide that we\u2019re seeing play out in every sector of the world. Companies and institutions around the globe are living this divide, between those who remember an age before computers and those for whom using an iPhone is as natural as breathing.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long before this new generation began to play a key role for al Qaeda. In the early 2000s, Irhabi 007 (irhabi is Arabic for \u201cterrorist\u201d) became something of an online webmaster for al Qaeda, emerging as a leader in key password-protected jihadist forums, before being unmasked as a British teenager. As a Scotland Yard official, Peter Clarke, said at the time, \u201cWhat it did show us was the extent to which they could conduct operational planning on the internet. It was the first virtual conspiracy to murder that we had seen.\u201d\n\nThe first, but not the last. Jihadist leaders like an American named Adam Gadahn\u2014who adopted the moniker Azzam the American\u2014began to adopt new media tactics, starring in online videos and serving as something like a public spokesperson for the group. His well-produced videos laid out the group\u2019s philosophy and included English subtitles, to ensure as large an audience as possible. Other jihadists followed similar models: In Chechnya, Islamic extremists created a genre of videos known as \u201cRussian Hell,\u201d depicting their surprise attacks on Russian forces, a not-so-subtle message aimed at undermining the morale of occupying troops, who never knew where the next attack might come. In East Africa, a 20-something Alabama-raised Muslim who traveled to join al-Shabaab, Omar Hammami\u2014a.k.a. Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki\u2014began appearing in terrorist videos, becoming, over time, one of the group\u2019s best-known leaders.\n\nNext, a one-time American imam, Anwar al-Awlaki, built a national and then international audience for his teachings, publishing sets of CDs with his lectures for sale through Islamic bookstores and online websites. Hiding in Yemen, he become the public face of AQAP, the most effective and dangerous of the first-generation of al Qaeda affiliates. Beyond the online lectures, he worked with another American, Samir Khan, to help AQAP reach new audiences and build slick, compelling marketing materials for their cause, including a well-produced PDF magazine called Inspire that encouraged extremists from afar not to worry about journeying to distant locales like Pakistan or Yemen to attack the infidels\u2014to stay home and launch what the magazine called \u201cOpen Source Jihad,\u201d by turning a rented pickup truck into a \u201cdeath mobile\u201d or, as one article written by \u201cthe AQ chef\u201d explained, \u201cMake a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\u201d By the late 2000s, Awlaki\u2019s fingerprints were on almost every major terrorist plot we found in the United States, including the 2007 attack at Fort Dix, the 2009 shooting at a Little Rock military recruiting office, and the 2010 Times Square bomber\u2014all of which featured attackers who subscribed to Awlaki\u2019s message, were devoted to his religious lectures, and had never met him in person.\n\nTop left: Imam Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.

Bottom left: AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams. Bottom right: AP Photo/Brian Chilson.\n\nA U.S. airstrike killed Awlaki in September 2011. Days later, AQAP announced, \u201cAmerica killed Sheikh Anwar, may Allah have mercy on him, but it could not kill his thoughts. The martyrdom of the Sheikh is a new and renewing life for his thoughts and style.\u201d Indeed, we saw all too clearly in the years ahead that his tactics were unfortunately here to stay. His lectures helped inspire the bombers of the Boston Marathon in 2013 and even as a new threat arose\u2014ISIS\u2014we continued to see many would-be terrorists devoting themselves to Awlaki\u2019s online teachings.\n\nFor a moment after Awlaki\u2019s death, it seemed the terror threat in the United States ebbed. Little did we know we were about to live through the worst period of terror since 9/11 itself.\n\nWhen \u201cal Qaeda in Iraq\u201d split from \u201ccore\u201d al Qaeda and evolved into the fighting force known as ISIS, the group\u2019s leadership managed to dramatically evolve the multimedia efforts of other terror groups, particularly as use of social media such as Twitter exploded around the world. As ISIS advanced on Baghdad in 2014, social media showed photos of its black flag flying over the Iraqi capital, and the terrorist army tweeted 40,000 times in just a single day.\n\nISIS videos became a horrific staple of our morning threat briefings at the FBI; each morning, the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s counterterrorism and national security leadership gathered inside the bureau\u2019s state-of-the-art command center at the Hoover Building to review the nation\u2019s top threats for the day\u2014everything from geopolitical developments to individual plots and suspects across the country. Too many mornings that included watching the grisly death of a hostage, captured fighters in Syria or other victims of ISIS.\n\nISIS\u2019s large and sophisticated propaganda arm understood how to command the public\u2019s attention: by showing horrific graphic executions of Syrian fighters, hostages and almost anyone else who crossed ISIS\u2019s path. ISIS\u2019s brutality was unlike anything the world had experienced; while barbarism has long been part of war, fighters often go to great lengths to keep it secret. ISIS trumpeted its own awfulness wherever it went, elaborately choreographing mass slaughter with multiple camera angles and working so hard to achieve the \u201cperfect\u201d shot that executioners sometimes read their lines off cue cards. The videos were meant to intimidate adversaries, giving the group an air of omnipotence and power often belied by conditions on the ground. According to the videos, every day of combat amounted to victory\u2014and even when the videos showed ISIS casualties, they were carefully posed and celebrated as righteous martyrs. It was an honor to die for ISIS.\n\nWhereas \u201ccore\u201d al Qaeda long celebrated bin Laden, with most of its recruitment and propaganda efforts stemming from his personal messages, and Awlaki\u2019s long lectures focused tightly on a twisted ideological interpretation of Islam, these later incarnations of Islamic extremism celebrated the individual fighters, portraying the appeal of jihad less as a religious experience and more\u2014as Junaid Hussain said in his tweet\u2014as a chance to live out adventure, to move from playing Call of Duty to participating in the glories of combat. In fact, one study of 1,300 ISIS videos, conducted by George Washington University\u2019s Javier Lesaca, found that one out of five of them appeared to be directly inspired by American entertainment like Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto or American Sniper.\n\nThose horrific videos that came to be their global brand for most of the public represented only a small fraction of ISIS\u2019s total\u2019s multimedia efforts\u2014most videos they produced flew below the world radar, focused instead on providing would-be jihadists an equally distorted view of how lovely it was to join the jihad and live in ISIS-controlled territory. Fully half of all of ISIS\u2019s communications and social media focused on the \u201cutopia\u201d they were creating in the Middle East. Videos depicted a vibrant, socially active, Pleasantville-like atmosphere inside ISIS territory. Fighters posted photos of themselves fishing on the Euphrates, holding up freshly caught fish while wearing masks or with assault rifles slung over their shoulders. Two ISIS fighters were even shown smiling and snorkeling in a bright blue body of water. Other images, shared in recruitment efforts on the messaging app Telegram showed images from inside the self-declared \u201ccaliphate\u201d that strived to depict the sheer ordinariness of daily life: rainbows over beaches, fruit hanging in trees, flowers blossoming. One video showed a masked terrorist playing with a kitten in one hand and holding an AK-47 in the other. (Even terrorists know the internet\u2019s one universal constant: Cat videos sell.) Just like any global marketer, they developed sophisticated microtargeting efforts; in the United States, they literally distributed videos featuring terrorists and lollipops or cotton candy, while in Europe, they pushed videos with terrorists and Nutella.\n\nThe propaganda was meant to be just one part of a suite of digital tools ISIS deployed\u2014they saw it as a way to begin a conversation with would-be recruits the world over. Those interested in joining the jihad could then contact ISIS recruiters and sympathizers on Twitter or other social media platforms or internet forums. From there, the conversations often moved to secure, encrypted messaging platforms, such as Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp. At one point, ISIS even created its own messaging app, known as Amaq Agency.\n\nOur experience behind the scenes showed \u201clone wolves\u201d didn\u2019t really exist. Individuals who pursued radicalization online\u2014I\u2019m always careful to not say \u201cpeople who were radicalized online,\u201d because it\u2019s rarely that simple\u2014were often in touch with other extremists, sometimes even from their own community. Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, a Somali-American from Minnesota who joined al-Shabaab in Africa, was a key contact and conduit in luring other Somali-American youths from the Twin Cities. That approach turned out to be common: There simply weren\u2019t regular people who woke up one morning, read a Twitter thread and decided then and there to kill Americans. There\u2019s not one track to radicalization, and the web doesn\u2019t provide some magical radicalization potion. Radicalization is a process, a journey, but online propaganda and dialogue drastically lowers the barriers and complications of recruiting would-be terrorists from far away. Terrorists overseas can communicate directly, intimately and in real time with kids in our basements, here.\n\nThese online radicals were also deeply challenging for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to identify. In the years after 9/11, we became very good at successfully interdicting plots and identifying would-be terrorists through spotting their physical \u201csignatures\u201d\u2014the path they traveled to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen or other terror havens, the routes through which money was funneled to them from overseas, the way they made phone calls or sent emails to known terrorists overseas, the way they attempted to purchase the ingredients for explosives or procure rare, high-powered weaponry and so forth. Yet as the world intelligence community got better at disrupting the physical movement of would-be fighters to Syria or places like Yemen, the threat morphed again and the groups began to push recruits to just \u201ckill where you live.\u201d It was amazing to see the speed of this shift; changes that took the better part of a decade in al-Qaeda happened in just months with ISIS.\n\nThe new tactics from al Qaeda and ISIS eluded all of our well-placed trip wires; by switching to encouraging would-be recruits to remain at home, in the United States or Europe, and carry out attacks there, terror recruiters made it nearly impossible for us to spot typical behaviors\u2014suspicious travel or money transfers\u2014that would indicate a looming attack. The terror groups effectively had no investment, in time or money, in most of these guys, so they didn\u2019t care if nine out of 10 of them\u2014or 99 out of 100\u2014weren\u2019t successful. \u201cSomeone can do it in their pajamas in their basement,\u201d then FBI director James Comey told Congress in the fall of 2014. \u201cThese are the homegrown violent extremists that we worry about, who can get all the poison they need and the training they need to kill Americans, and in a way that is very hard for us to spot.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, though, as I looked at the problem, the situation was even more grating than that. We were, as a country and a society, providing technology to our adversaries\u2014technology developed with our creativity and through our national investments in education; technology that allowed them to communicate securely and instantly among themselves and potential recruits; technology that was specially designed to allow them to keep their conversations private and prohibit law enforcement from listening even with a valid court order; technology that allowed them to reach into our schools, our shopping malls and our basements to spread poison to our children, tutor them and provide them operational directions and supervision to kill fellow Americans. And we\u2019d given it all to them for free\u2014available for an easy download in the app store, just a few clicks away. It was as if we developed game-changing military command-and-control technology at the height of World War II and just handed it over to the Nazis and Japanese.\n\nIn the midst of this already threatening environment, we began to hear the name Junaid Hussain.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWorking among a dozen cyber jihad recruiters, Hussain and his fellow terrorists declared themselves the head of the CyberCaliphate in mid-2014 and applied some of his old TeaMp0isoN tactics to ISIS, defacing websites and seizing control of home pages and social media accounts. He played a constant cat-and-mouse game with Twitter, which suspended or deleted his accounts only to have him pop up with a new one. He promised online that the ISIS flag would fly over the White House and called for the murder of Israelis. In February 2015, ISIS hackers accessed accounts belonging to Newsweek, among other sites, and tweeted out threats against First Lady Michelle Obama. They were trying hard to enable and inspire attacks far from the Middle East, posting in March 2015 a \u201ckill list\u201d of 100 airmen from two U.S. Air Force bases.\n\nThroughout, Hussain was in steady contact with dozens of would-be ISIS recruits and adherents the world over through his main Twitter account, @AbuHussain_l6. His online encouragement touched off a violent\u2014and, to his recruits, deadly\u2014spree in 2015, one that overwhelmed FBI agents as they chased ISIS recruits across the country. According to the Los Angeles Times, Hussain \u201ccommunicated with [at] least nine people who later were arrested or killed by U.S. law enforcement.\u201d \u201cThe FBI was strapped,\u201d Director Comey said later. \u201cWe were following, attempting to follow, to cover electronically with court orders, or cover physically, dozens and dozens and dozens of people who we assessed were on the cusp of violence.\u201d The need was so great that the FBI actually pulled agents from criminal squads to work counterterrorism surveillance. For those on the front lines of counterterrorism, it marked one of the darkest periods since the 9/11 attacks themselves.\n\nWe often talked about a terrorist\u2019s \u201cflash-to-bang,\u201d the length of time a would-be attacker took to go from radicalization to attack, a metaphor drawn from lighting the detonation cord of a stick of dynamite, the \u201cflash,\u201d to when the stick exploded, the \u201cbang.\u201d With the new social media-driven push to \u201ckill where you live,\u201d ISIS transformed the problem we faced with al-Shabaab\u2014where a relatively specific geographic population of the Somali diaspora had been targeted for recruitment\u2014into a national one with dangerously unpredictable results. There was no geographic center and often the would-be ISIS recruits weren\u2019t even especially religious to begin with. Over the course of 2015, we found ourselves confronting dozens of seemingly half-crazed young men whose flash-to-bang was both short and erratic. There was no larger plot to unravel, no travel to monitor. The threat cut across geography and ethnicity. Thirty-five different U.S. attorney\u2019s districts found themselves chasing cases. Half the suspects were under 25, and, a statistic that is burned into my memory, one-third were 21 years or younger. ISIS was targeting our kids. So many cases involved literal children that we issued special guidance to prosecutors about how to handle juvenile terrorism suspects in federal court\u2014not an issue that commonly arose in such cases in the past.\n\nIn April 2015, Hussain helped encourage a 30-year-old from Arizona, Elton Simpson, to embark on a homegrown jihad. As court documents later alleged, the two exchanged messages through an encrypted messaging program known as Surespot, and, in early May, Simpson and a friend, Nadir Soofi, drove to Garland, Texas, to attack an exhibit there put on by anti-Muslim agitator Pamela Geller that featured cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad, depictions commonly considered offensive in Islam. Hussain evidently knew the attack was coming\u2014an hour before their attack began, he tweeted, \u201cThe knives have been sharpened, soon we will come to your streets with death and slaughter!\u201d\n\nThe two men\u2014one of whom used a photo of Awlaki as his Twitter avatar\u2014opened fire on a police car at the event entrance and were killed by police who returned fire. Hussain celebrated the attack on Twitter, saying, \u201cAllah Akbar!!!! Two of our brothers just opened fire.\u201d\n\nThere was Munir Abdulkader, a 21-year-old from outside Cincinnati, who said online he hoped ISIS would \u201crule the world.\u201d He and Hussain connected online, and Hussain encouraged him to kidnap and behead a U.S. soldier right there in Ohio\u2014even providing a soldier\u2019s specific home address\u2014and suggested that the Xavier University dropout should also try to attack a police station. The Los Angeles Times later reported, \u201cThe FBI initially tracked Abdulkader by secretly monitoring Hussain\u2019s Twitter direct messages. But agents were stymied when the suspects switched to apps that encrypt messages so they can only be read by sender and receiver.\u201d The FBI relied on an informant to help figure out their plan; as part of figuring out what attack he might want to launch, Abdulkader conducted surveillance on a police station and, when he went on May 21, 2015, to purchase an AK-47, the FBI arrested him.\n\nTop left: Members of the FBI Evidence Response Team investigate the crime scene outside of the Curtis Culwell Center after the shooting the day before.

Bottom left: Buncombe County Detention Facility via AP. Bottom right: Keith Bedford/Globe Staff.\n\nThe long reach of Hussain\u2019s recruitment efforts encompassed the entire country. One of the shortest flash-to-bangs we saw unfolded in Boston: On June 2, 2015, an FBI agent and local police officer confronted 26-year-old Usaamah Abdullah Rahim in the parking lot of a convenience store. Hussain online had also encouraged Rahim to target Geller\u2019s exhibit for a second attack in Garland, Texas, but Rahim grew impatient and decided to just improvise, launching his own attack at home to attack local law enforcement. Hussain had urged him to carry knives in case he was cornered by the \u201cfeds,\u201d and Rahim bragged about his new acquisition in a telephone call to a friend, saying, \u201cI got myself a nice little tool. You know, it\u2019s good for, like, carving wood and, you know, like, carving sculptures\u2014and you know.\u201d Indeed, Rahim pulled a knife when the officials approached, and he was killed. Later that month, the FBI arrested Justin Nojan Sullivan, a North Carolina man who promised Hussain online he would carry out a mass shooting attack on ISIS\u2019s behalf. When Sullivan, who went online by the name TheMuhahid, texted Hussain, \u201cVery soon carrying out 1st operation of Islamic State in North America,\u201d Hussain responded quickly to make sure ISIS got the social media credit for the attack: \u201cCan u make a video first?\u201d\n\nInside the government, the tide seemed overwhelming. In most ways, the country\u2019s counterterrorism resources were far better organized and far more sophisticatedly structured than they had been during the period of al-Awlaki\u2019s inspired plots, yet we were still barely keeping up. Earlier in my career at FBI, we thought 10 simultaneous terror cases represented a huge number; at this point we faced dozens. We struggled with the balance of not appearing to be alarmist but realizing that we didn\u2019t have the resources to confront this social media-inspired wave. Since 2009, the FBI had greatly boosted its surveillance resources; back then, the FBI struggled to simultaneously watch two terror plots, one linked to Najibullah Zazi, who was plotting to attack the New York City subways, and one linked to David Coleman Headley, who helped plot the terrorist attack on hotels and key sites in Mumbai in 2008. But even with the increased resources, the terror threat seemed to overwhelm us. Thorough round-the-clock surveillance requires dozens of people, and we confronted tracking dozens of cases in every corner of the country.\n\nIt felt like we were just waiting for the next terrorist attack. Too often, it seemed like luck kept us safe\u2014that we\u2019d only discover a plot because a would-be terrorist spoke to the wrong person or because his device failed to work. All told, according to a George Washington University analysis, of the 117 people arrested in the United States for ties to the Islamic State between January 2014 and the beginning of 2017, more than half were caught over the course of 2015.\n\nThroughout that year, we lived what amounted to tactical success but strategic failure\u2014interdicting plots one by one, but failing to stem the tide of social media inspiration emanating from ISIS. Junaid Hussain and his fellow online recruiter terrorists constituted the key link in almost all of them. We debated in our daily briefings how public we should be about his role\u2014we needed to focus government resources on him but didn\u2019t want to make him 10,000 feet tall, a hero to his own cause. The battle against Anwar al-Awlaki\u2019s work had elevated him to global prominence, increasing his power, and we didn\u2019t want to repeat that with Hussain. We pressed the Pentagon to focus its attention \u201cin theater\u201d on hunting Hussain and the other online recruiters. Sure, they weren\u2019t major figures on the ground for ISIS, but they were having an outsized impact far from the battlefield. Hussain was no longer \u201cjust\u201d a recruiter; he was an operational figure, attempting to direct attacks against the homeland. The Pentagon agreed; they understood that the fight against ISIS was one that took place on many different battlefields.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe summer of 2015 brought perhaps the most troubling case of all\u2014a dangerous combination cybercrime and terrorism that revealed a new face of the global war on terror. On August 11, 2015, Hussain posted a series of tweets that, at first, seemed just his normal bellicose rhetoric. He announced, \u201csoldiers \u2026 will strike at your necks in your own lands!\u201d Then he followed up with a surprise: \u201cNEW: U.S. Military AND Government HACKED by the Islamic State Hacking Division!\u201d He linked to a 30-page document that made instantly clear this was something different.\n\nHussain\u2019s document began with a warning designed to chill: \u201cWe are in your emails and computer systems, watching and recording your every move, we have your names and addresses, we are in your emails and social media accounts, we are extracting confidential data and passing on your personal information to the soldiers of the [caliphate], who soon with the permission of Allah will strike at your necks in your own lands!\u201d The subsequent pages of the document included the names and addresses of 1,351 members of the U.S. military and other government employees, as well as three pages of names and addresses of federal employees and even Facebook exchanges between members of the U.S. military.\n\nThe posting set off a scramble across the government to determine where the information came from\u2014and to potentially protect the affected servicemen and women. What we discovered was that, just as most cyberthreats over the last decade, this particular case originated with an unlikely target.\n\nThe first clue came one week after Hussain\u2019s tweet, when a U.S. online retailer in Illinois received an angry email from someone using the email address khs-crew@live.com. On August 19, the writer, who identified himself as an \u201cAlbanian Hacker,\u201d complained that the company deleted malware from its servers that he used to illegally access it. \u201cHi Administrator,\u201d the email began. \u201cIs third time that your deleting my files and losing my Hacking JOB on this server ! One time i alert you that if you do this again i will publish every client on this Server! I don\u2019t wanna do this because i don\u2019t win anything here ! So why your trying to lose my access on server haha ?\u201d The system administrator wrote back the next day, \u201cPlease dont attack our servers,\u201d at which point the hacker demanded a payment of two Bitcoins\u2014then worth about $500\u2014in exchange for leaving the server alone and explaining how he\u2019d accessed it in the first place.\n\nAfter the retailer reported the email exchange, the FBI was able to trace the internet address of the sent email to Malaysia, where they began to piece together a picture of the prime suspect: Ardit Ferizi. An ethnic Albanian, Ferizi came from Gjakova, Kosovo, a region deeply affected by the war there in 1999. As a teen, Ferizi formed a group called the Kosova Hacker\u2019s Security (KHS), a pro-Muslim, ethnic Albanian collective that attacked Western companies like IBM and Hotmail and organizations like the National Weather Service.\n\nIn early 2015, just after he turned 20, Ferizi journeyed to Malaysia on a student visa, both to study computer science at Limkokwing University and, we later understood, because the country\u2019s broadband offered better opportunities to carry out cyberattacks.\n\nFerizi, using his Twitter account @Th3Dir3ctorY, volunteered to assist ISIS in April, offering help with their servers and also communicating directly with another Twitter account @Muslim_Sniper_D, which belonged to Tariq Hamayun, a 37-year-old car mechanic who was fighting with ISIS in Syria and went by the name Abu Muslim al-Britani. In one exchange, Hamayun told Ferizi that Hussain \u201ctold me a lot about u,\u201d an indication the Malaysian hacker had already been in contact with the British ISIS recruiter. Hamayun encouraged Ferizi, \u201cPliz [sic] brother come and join us in the Islamic state.\u201d\n\nThen, on June 13, Ferizi hacked into that online retailer\u2019s server in Phoenix, Arizona, stealing credit card information of more than 100,000 customers. He culled through the data to identify people who used either a .gov or .mil email address, ultimately assembling a list of 1,351 military or government personnel, and passed their information to ISIS. That became the basis for the kill list Hussain tweeted in August with his warning \u201cwe are in your emails and computer systems.\u201d What started out as an attempt for criminal extortion ended with a chilling terror threat and a plot to kill.\n\nAs investigators traced Ferizi\u2019s actions and his ties to Hussain, I knew this was a case we could prosecute. It was, in some ways, the culmination of years of work to transform the way that we approached cybersecurity threats at the Justice Department and in the U.S. government. We\u2019d spent years pushing to raise the profile of these threats, to train prosecutors and agents to pursue them, and fought dozens of small battles behind the scenes to ease the secrecy that surrounded so many of America\u2019s activities in cyberspace. We convinced the White House, the National Security Council and other intelligence agencies that cybersecurity needed to move out of the shadows\u2014that we needed to use the traditional tools of the legal system to prosecute and publicize cyberthreats in the same way that we tackled terrorism threats. Now we saw a case that constituted both.\n\nIn September, Malaysian police closed in on Ferizi, catching him with the Dell Latitude and MSI laptops he\u2019d used to hack servers. In announcing the charges, I said, \u201cThis case represents the first time we have seen the very real and dangerous national security cyberthreat that results from the combination of terrorism and hacking. This was a wake-up call not only to those of us in law enforcement, but also to those in private industry.\u201d\n\nIt was a message I\u2019d echo to businesses and organizations many times in the years to come: You need to report when your networks have been attacked because you never know how your intrusion, however seemingly minor, might impact a larger investigation. What to you might be a small inconvenience could, with broader intelligence, represent a terrorist, a global organized crime syndicate, or a foreign country\u2019s sophisticated attack.\n\nIn court proceedings, Ferizi came off as a confused youth\u2014like many of the would-be ISIS recruits we saw. He explained that in the spring of 2015 he had been angry that a Kosovar journalist falsely accused him of joining the Islamic State\u2014and so he retaliated, confusingly, by stealing the personal information from Phoenix, Arizona, and actually giving it to the Islamic State. \u201cI was doing a lot of drugs and spending all day online,\u201d he explained later.\n\nThe judge in his case didn\u2019t buy the argument and sentenced Ferizi to 20 years in prison. \u201cI want to send a message,\u201d U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said. \u201cPlaying around with computers is not a game.\u201d\n\nHussain, too, met his own kind of justice. In Syria, he was far beyond the reach of American law enforcement, living in an ungoverned space. As part of the new post-9/11 approach to counterterrorism, the government had moved to what we called an \u201call-tools\u201d approach, bringing to bear on the threat everything from criminal prosecution to financial sanctions to kinetic military action. The goal was that no one across the world should be free from consequences if they sought to attack the United States. Hussain\u2019s actions clearly made him an imminent threat to the American homeland, and since we couldn\u2019t reach him with handcuffs, he was a top priority for the military.\n\nJust weeks before we arrested Ferizi, on the night of August 24, 2015, Hussain was alone as he left an internet cafe. As U.S. Central Command confirmed publicly the following day, U.S. military forces operating far overhead fired a single Hellfire missile at his vehicle while it was at a gas station in Raqqa, Syria.\n\nThe blast killed him instantly.\n\nJohn P.

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to be House speaker in the new Congress, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult survey.\n\nFar more Democratic voters (48 percent) want Pelosi to be speaker next year than say she shouldn\u2019t be speaker (22 percent), a result that\u2019s in line with a handful of other polls conducted in the wake of a historic Democratic victory in the midterm elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters (53 percent) would like to see Pelosi be the next speaker, according to a Quinnipiac University poll, while only 27 percent don\u2019t want to see that.

Among all voters, just 27 percent think she should be made speaker, compared with 43 percent who think she should not be the next speaker.\n\nPelosi is vying to become speaker eight years after losing the gavel following the 2010 GOP wave election. But even though Democrats are poised to claim a healthy majority in the House next year \u2014 with just two races still unresolved, Democrats have won 233 seats, compared with Republicans\u2019 200 \u2014 she has yet to secure the votes of a 218-member majority.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

If they all opposed Pelosi, she would be right at the threshold to win the gavel. There are a handful of other incoming members who didn\u2019t sign the letter but have also pledged to vote for someone else.\n\nIn the latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, fewer than 3-in-10 voters overall (29 percent) say they have a favorable opinion of Pelosi, while 46 percent view her unfavorably. That is slightly more positive than the national exit poll of voters in this year\u2019s elections, which showed her favorability at 31 percent, compared with 56 percent who had an unfavorable opinion of her.\n\nAmong Democrats, Pelosi is far more popular: the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows her favorable rating at 52 percent, versus 22 percent unfavorable.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi continues to be a polarizing figure in politics, but Democrats still have confidence in her taking the gavel as House speaker in January,\u201d said Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult\u2019s vice president.\n\nBy a wide margin, Republican voters say Pelosi should not be made speaker: Just 11 percent support her candidacy, while 61 percent oppose it. But support for Pelosi is also tepid among independent voters: Only 22 percent say she should be speaker, while 44 percent say she shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nBefore the new Congress convenes after the new year, both chambers must advance legislation next month to keep the federal government fully funded, with each party staking out ground to attach its priorities to a must-pass spending bill. But few voters say funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border (31 percent) or protecting the special counsel\u2018s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election (27 percent) is important enough to warrant shutting down the government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed for an increase in funding for his proposal to build a border wall and has, in the past, suggested Republicans in Congress should not approve spending bills that don\u2019t provide those funds. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s removal of Jeff Sessions as attorney general earlier this month has set off calls from Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans, like outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \u2014 for legislation that protects the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted November 15-18, surveying 1,957 registered voters.

It\u2019s a job fraught with opportunity and peril: The chance to become a leading spokesman for the Republican agenda and dealmaker in divided Washington, which will almost certainly require occasionally breaking with a certain sharp-tongued president down the road.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf Thune can strike that balance well, the South Dakota Republican could eventually position himself for McConnell\u2019s job, if and when the Kentuckian eventually calls it quits. For now though, Thune is showcasing his Midwestern nice, talking up outgoing Whip John Cornyn's (R-Texas) own leadership prospects to cool any thoughts of future drama.\n\nThe 57-year-old Thune \u2014 who stormed into the Senate in 2004 by defeating Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle in a stunning upset \u2014 has more immediate worries: Namely a shutdown fight over President Donald Trump\u2019s top priority. After that, he\u2019ll play a leading role in protecting a half-dozen Republican incumbents on the ballot in 2020, in states with large numbers of the kind of suburban voters who lashed out at Trump in the midterms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to execute,\u201d Thune said in an interview after winning the whip\u2019s job, aware that he and the GOP majority will be under new scrutiny as they go from electoral offense to defense in 2020.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThune comes in with a chairman\u2019s pedigree after running the Senate Commerce Committee for four years. Though a conservative, his mild-mannered politics contrast with the bare-knuckled partisan jabs of outgoing whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), a two-time chairman of the party\u2019s campaign arm.\n\nThe South Dakota senator isn\u2019t as close to Trump as Cornyn is, yet. He describes a warm relationship with the president and aligns with Trump on the border wall and the president\u2019s opposition to legislation protecting Mueller.\n\nBut he knows they won\u2019t always see eye to eye. If it makes the most sense for his members, Thune is willing to put distance between himself and the president, as he\u2019s done occasionally on issues from trade to foreign policy to immigration.\n\n\u201cWe need to look for opportunities to partner with him. But I also think there are times where you may be in different places. And that\u2019s where you\u2019ve got to speak out,\u201d Thune said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be, probably, somebody that is on every issue: \u2018Whatever you say.\u2019 That\u2019s just not my style,\u201d Thune added. \u201cThere are times when you express your differences and do it in a way that\u2019s respectful, understanding there\u2019s always another fight around the corner.\u201d\n\nThune likes Trump\u2019s policies on the economy, judges and deregulation, and he acknowledges that his role as one of the most powerful Republicans in Washington will be executing the president\u2019s agenda. That means long days perfecting the whip counts on nominees, keeping watch on the Senate floor and working over recalcitrant Republicans.\n\nBut Thune also recognizes that the Senate is an independent institution. He mostly ignores the president\u2019s Twitter controversies and concentrates on \u2014 to use one of the many sports metaphors he\u2019s partial to \u2014 putting \u201cpoints on the board\u201d with bipartisan legislation.\n\nThe outlook for that is cloudy: Perhaps Thune can help strike a deal on roads and bridges or improving nationwide wireless networks. After that, he acknowledges the legislative agenda looks \u201cthinner,\" with a brutal fight approaching before Thune even gets his new office.\n\nTrump wants billions for his border wall when the next spending bill is due by Dec. 7, and he\u2019s refused to rule out a partial government shutdown to get what he wants. Thune agrees this is the best opportunity for Republicans to wring some money out of Democrats on border security, but the word \u201cshutdown\u201d makes him recoil.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a shutdown to me, is like\u201d \u2014 Thune says, cringing to make his point. \u201cThe president in the past has expressed a view that if that\u2019s what it takes to get his wall funding, he\u2019s willing to go there. But I don\u2019t think that probably helps.\u201d\n\nCornyn speaks about the wall fight in similar terms, hoping cooler heads will prevail. Republicans and the president can expect a similarly optimistic outlook from Thune, in contrast to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s calculated, unemotional style.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fair amount of consistency\u201d between Cornyn and Thune, said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is close to GOP leaders. Differences between the two \u201care more stylistic\u201d than substantive.\n\nThough he\u2019s tight with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) from their time in the Senate gym, Thune has some networking to do. As the No. 2s in their respective conferences, he and Schumer\u2019s whip, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) will handle much of the behind-the-scenes work of running the Senate floor, and they have little experience working together.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really tested the waters with him on anything,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nThere is some irony to Thune\u2019s rise: By beating Daschle, he became the first insurgent to defeat a Senate party leader in more than 50 years. From there Thune moved quickly up the ranks of the Senate\u2019s calcified leadership structure. Eventually, he could be party leader.\n\nBut just a few hours after taking Cornyn\u2019s job, Thune lavished praise on the term-limited Texan, dousing any fears of a cold war over who will succeed McConnell, who has vowed to run for reelection in 2020.\n\n\u201cJohn, if the opportunity comes along sometime in the future, I suspect will want to take a shot at being leader. Certainly, I think he\u2019s paid his dues,\u201d Thune said.\n\nCornyn returned the favor, giving Thune\u2019s nominating speech for whip during the private caucus meeting. He also dispensed advice: Sometimes the whip is most effective by delegating someone else to do the arm-twisting or cajoling.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that our success doesn\u2019t just depend on one person. It depends on the team effort. And part of that is to find out who the best person is to talk to a senator who might be able to get them on board,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nOf course, no one is more important than Trump, whose political prospects are intertwined with keeping the Senate majority and its ability to unilaterally confirm lifetime judges and restock his ever-changing Cabinet.\n\nTo do that, McConnell\u2019s new deputy wants a message of economic prosperity from Trump, not necessarily the dire immigration warnings and culture wars that turned off suburban voters this fall.\n\n\u201cThe independent voters that were with him and have moved away from him a little bit can be pulled back,\u201d Thune argued. \u201cIt\u2019s in his own political self-interest and in the interest of our majority here in the Senate when he starts to focus on \u2026 jobs, economy, growth and tax relief and regulatory relief.\u201d\n\nThere are signs the president is listening: He\u2019s talking optimistically about working with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), wants a bipartisan criminal justice deal and is looking for movement on infrastructure.\n\nFirst, though, Thune and other Republicans might need to convince the president that a shutdown will distract from all that, and that it\u2019s in everyone's best interest to take what they can get from the Democrats even if it\u2019s not the entire \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d Trump wants.\n\n\u201cThere will be probably be a certain amount of give and take.

We know they work,\u201d Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said in introducing his bill to get President Donald Trump more money for a border wall a sticking point for his Democratic colleagues. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo Congress Stalemate on Trump\u2019s wall amid threat of shutdown Both parties are refusing to bend, with a government funding deadline two weeks away.\n\nCongress just can't help itself: With a partial government shutdown potentially two weeks away, Democrats and Republicans are dug in, each side upping its demands and vowing not to buckle to the other.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pressuring Republicans to obtain at least $5 billion for his border wall, far more than what Senate Democrats are prepared to give. Democrats in turn are considering pushes for legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller and the elimination of a citizenship question from the next census, according to people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeanwhile House Democrats are embroiled in a divisive leadership fight, limiting the energy that Nancy Pelosi can devote to the year-end spending negotiations. And House Republicans, set to enter the minority in just a month and a half, recognize this is their last chance to get a down payment for Trump\u2019s wall before entering legislative obscurity.\n\nThe stakes have been lessened somewhat by deals this summer to fund about 75 percent of the government until next fall. But a partial shutdown isn\u2019t what either party is looking for, either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to screw with those deadlines; I don\u2019t want to engage in shutdown politics. Let\u2019s fund the federal government and move on,\u201d Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said on Tuesday. \u201cI wish Democrats would cooperate. They all said they want to secure the border, so OK: It\u2019s going to require better barriers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that gets in the mix, there has to be something in return for that,\u201d shot back Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). \u201cI myself have a pretty hard position that Democrats should not even be engaged in discussions about that because [Trump] made it very clear that Mexico was going to pay for that wall.\u201d\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIndeed, though a shutdown would be viewed as poor optics for both sides, backing down might be worse, with each party\u2019s base eager to fight.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has made clear he\u2019s in no mood to swallow a major concession on wall money that would boost the president, publicly urging Trump to stay out of the negotiations.\n\nBut Trump is unbowed. He\u2019s refused to rule out a shutdown and has told GOP leaders that he wants no less than $5 billion for the wall, according to sources familiar with internal talks. That\u2019s more modest than Trump\u2019s earlier demands, which went as high as $25 billion.\n\nAnd some Republicans are still eager to help him get there. Last week, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) introduced a bill providing $25 billion for the wall while proposing to pay for it by cutting benefits for undocumented immigrants and levying fines on people who cross the border illegally.\n\n\u201cHere is the thing: Walls work. We know they work,\u201d Inhofe said in introducing his bill.\n\nStill, that sum of money is now out of reach, and Democrats would need major concessions from Republicans to deliver even $5 billion at this point. Some Republicans have discussed providing that amount over two years, but the GOP has yet to rally around that position, and it\u2019s not clear that the president would view that as enough.\n\nPeople in both parties say there would be little reason for a shutdown if not for the wall demand. Both parties have broadly agreed to spending levels for 2019, but the border security portion is bedeviling Capitol Hill and has given Democrats an opening to ask for legislation protecting the special counsel and removal of the citizenship question.\n\nSenate Democrats have endorsed $1.6 billion for the wall in a bipartisan Homeland Security funding bill, an amount that made some in the caucus queasy. Democratic leaders say they will go no further.\n\nThat amount is \u201cmore than adequate,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \u201cThey are still sitting on money from a year or two ago that they can\u2019t spend.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to deliver Trump more wall money while they are in the majority and meet the president\u2019s demand of $5 billion in their spending bill. A senior House Republican aide said the House is still working toward that number in year-end spending talks, and Senate Republicans say they are right there with them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very committed to that. We are too,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the incoming majority whip. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we\u2019re able to get closer to what he\u2019s trying to do in terms of funding the wall.\u201d\n\nIf both sides remain at odds, congressional leaders will have to begin weighing fallback plans. Already some Republicans think they may need a weeklong stop-gap bill to give more time for spending talks, according to one senior aide close to the talks. Government funding currently runs out on Dec. 7, and most congressional leaders view that as a hard deadline and do not wish to prolong negotiations.\n\nBut if the deep ideological rift between the two parties still can\u2019t be bridged, leaders might need to consider a continuing resolution to fund agencies through next September. That might be preferable to kicking the fight until January, when House Democrats take over; a spending deadline is not an ideal way to kick off a new majority. But it would result in billions less in spending for domestic programs, a major blow to Democrats' funding priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, the possibility of a partial shutdown still looms if the president decides he will not sign any bill that falls short of his border wall goals. Johnson made clear that\u2019s not ideal, but he also played down the consequences if Congress fails to come to an agreement by the deadline.\n\nEveryone, it seems, is beginning to prepare for the worst.\n\n\u201cHow much would actually shut down? Particularly [the Department of Homeland Security] \u2014 most of DHS is deemed necessary for national security; it doesn\u2019t shut down,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to shut down the vast majority of the federal government. The federal government is going to keep going along no matter what happens.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle and John Bresnahan contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "clima@politico.com (Cristiano Lima)", "title": "Zuckerberg says neither he nor Sandberg stepping down over political controversy", "description": "\u201cI hope that we work together for decades more to come,\u201d he says of Sandberg.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-sheryl-sandberg-1009786", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/f1/2e/9777b9f341ce87a172346d7fa35a/181120-zuckerberg-politico-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T03:16:08Z", "content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments came during his first interview after the New York Times' expos\u00e9 on the social network. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday he plans to stay on as company chairman and work with COO Sheryl \u2026 [+1688 chars]", "fulltext": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments came during his first interview after The New York Times' expos\u00e9 on the social network. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Technology Zuckerberg says neither he nor Sandberg stepping down over political controversy\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday he plans to stay on as company chairman and work with COO Sheryl Sandberg \u201cfor decades more to come,\u201d remarks that come amid mounting scrutiny of their management efforts.\n\nThe embattled Facebook chief was pressed on whether he plans to step down from leading the company board. \u201cThat's not the plan,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI'm certainly not currently thinking that that makes sense.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe remarks came during Zuckerberg's first interview since The New York Times reported on Facebook's ties to the Definers Public Affairs communications firm, which sought to link critics of the company to liberal financier George Soros, a favorite target for conservative criticism.\n\nAsked whether he could definitively rule out Sandberg leaving Facebook, Zuckerberg said, \u201cYeah.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe exchange came during an hourlong debate in which the two sparred over ethics, health care, President Donald Trump and his proposed wall on the Mexican border. Hyde-Smith attacked Espy over money he'd received from an Ivory Coast dictator as a lobbyist \u2014 a charge to which Espy had an anemic response. Espy tried to portray Hyde-Smith as a blind ally of the president, even when his policies hurt Mississippians, such as farmers and people with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nThe debate came one week before the Nov. 27 election between the two, which was forced when neither candidate received more than 50 percent in the first round of voting on Nov. 6. Hyde-Smith opened and closed the debate by hyping two campaign rallies Trump is holding to support her Monday, the eve of the election, a sign of how much she is relying on the president to help turn out voters given the unusual timing of the runoff.\n\nHyde-Smith also repeatedly attacked Espy as a liberal who would follow Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's marching orders.\n\nShe repeatedly brought up the hundreds of thousands of dollars Espy received from a former Ivory Coast dictator, attacking his past work as a lobbyist as corrupt. Espy said he went to the Ivory Coast to help local farmers, and that once he learned about the nation's leader, he reported those facts to the CIA and canceled the remainder of his contract.\n\nEspy tried to paint himself as above partisan squabbling. He also disagreed with several administration policies, calling Trump's tariffs a \"wrongheaded policy\" that hurt Mississippi farmers and labeling the proposed border wall \"impractical.\"\n\nHe attacked Hyde-Smith repeatedly on health care, claiming that her opposition to a resolution that would have banned skimpy insurance plans was a vote against protections for pre-existing conditions. Hyde-Smith said she knew what she was voting for, and claimed the bill would not have hurt patients. She also touted her co-sponsorship of a bill from Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) that would protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Espy said that particular bill was a \"sham\" that wouldn't actually provide those protections.\n\nHyde-Smith came under fire in the days leading up to the debate over her remark to a supporter early this month that she would be in \"the front row\" if he invited her to a \u201cpublic hanging.\u201d In addition to repeatedly attacking her about it during the debate, Espy released a TV ad hours before in which a narrator warns Mississippians, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a senator who embarrasses us and reinforces the stereotypes we\u2019ve worked hard to overcome.\u201d\n\nOutside Democratic groups have pounced on the \"public hanging\" remark and another offhand comment by Hyde-Smith, also caught on video, that it was a \"great idea\" to make it harder for \"liberal folks\" to vote. Hyde-Smith said she was joking in both cases and that there was no racial intent in her remarks.\n\nSeveral major companies, including Walmart, asked for their campaign donations to Hyde-Smith to be returned.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have attacked Espy, a former congressman and Cabinet secretary, as both a run-of-the-mill Democrat and a corrupt Washington insider. They\u2019ve criticized Espy for his past as a lobbyist and for his time as Agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton. One ad, from the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund, called him a \u201cshady Clinton crony.\u201d\n\nEspy was forced to resign following an indictment on charges that he improperly took gifts while in office, though he was later acquitted on all charges.\n\nHyde-Smith has also leaned heavily on Trump in a state he won by nearly 20 percentage points. Her campaign released a TV ad this week featuring clips of Trump bashing Espy and endorsing Hyde-Smith during his most recent rally in Mississippi, in early October.\n\nA Democrat hasn\u2019t won a Senate seat in Mississippi since 1982, and both parties view Hyde-Smith as a clear favorite in the race, though Democrats hope that the combination of Hyde-Smith's recent remarks and the odd timing of the election just a few days after Thanksgiving could give Espy a boost.\n\nHyde-Smith was appointed to the seat by Gov. Phil Bryant earlier this year after Republican Sen. Thad Cochran retired for health reasons. Hyde-Smith and Espy are in a runoff after neither candidate received a majority in the first round of voting on Election Day. Republican Chris McDaniel, who nearly toppled Cochran in a primary four years ago, finished a distant third.\n\nIf Hyde-Smith wins, Republicans will have a 53-47 Senate majority in the next Congress.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Gabby Orr", "title": "Trump complained to aides about no DOJ probe of Clinton, Comey", "description": "The president shared those views with the White House counsel at the time, Don McGahn, as well as with several other former White House officials.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/trump-complained-no-doj-probe-clinton-comey-1009551", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/ec/f4/b2351ce3427fae1e331c89e59d31/181120-donald-trump-gtty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T02:02:56Z", "content": "The presidents private comments about Hillary Clinton and James Comey mirror his public statements about the two ex-officials. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump repeatedly expressed frustration during his first year in office that the Justic\u2026 [+4710 chars]", "fulltext": "The president\u2019s private comments about Hillary Clinton and James Comey mirror his public statements about the two ex-officials. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images White House Trump complained to aides about no DOJ probe of Clinton, Comey\n\nPresident Donald Trump repeatedly expressed frustration during his first year in office that the Justice Department was spending more time investigating his political campaign than some of his biggest adversaries, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nThe president shared those views with the White House counsel at the time, Don McGahn, as well as with several other former White House officials, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

During those appearances, he expressed skepticism about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Those remarks and his reported tight relationship with Trump have led Democratic lawmakers and some legal ethics experts to call for Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing that investigation.\n\nSeveral legal challenges to Whitaker\u2019s appointment are underway, in criminal and civil actions, as well as a case already pending at the Supreme Court. Critics say Trump was legally obligated to abide by the succession order Congress established for the Justice Department, but lawyers at the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel have held for more than a decade that the president has the authority to appoint senior Justice officials under a broader law passed in 1998.\n\nWhile drawing the half-million in salary from the conservative group, Whitaker had a more modest law and consulting practice on the side that generated $65,000 last year, one of his reports said. The top Justice official also reported having between $20,000 and $30,000 in credit card debt when he became Sessions\u2019 chief of staff in late 2017."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "bgriffiths@politico.com (Brent D.

Mia Love was once viewed as a rising star in the Republican Party. | Scott G Winterton/Deseret News, via AP, Pool Rep. Mia Love loses to Democrat in Utah\n\nRep. Mia Love was ousted Tuesday night after late returns pushed Democrat Ben McAdams ahead of the two-term incumbent in deep-red Utah.\n\nThe Associated Press called the 4th Congressional District race for McAdams, who holds a lead of just under 700 votes two weeks after the midterm elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA rising Republican star, Love was the first black female Republican ever elected to Congress. She was often viewed a figure who could signal the future of a more diverse GOP, and she was the sole GOP member of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nBut like many Republicans, Love faced an up-current of dissent over President Donald Trump that she was able to overcome in 2016 but was unable to defy two years later. For its largely Republican makeup, Utahans have always been uneasy about Trump and Love's district was the GOP\u2019s weakest point. Add to that McAdams\u2018 status as Salt Lake County mayor and Love's race was pegged by many prognosticators, including POLITICO, as a toss-up.\n\nTrump mocked Love along with a handful of other House Republicans the day after the midterms for refusing to embrace him enough.\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love and she lost,\u201d Trump said. \u201cToo bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\"\n\nLove was among more than a dozen Republicans who distanced themselves from then-candidate Trump when the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201c tape came out in October 2016; earlier, she had skipped the Republican National Convention.\n\nAfter his election, Love called out the president for reportedly calling Haiti, home of her parents, a \"shithole\" country, deeming his comments racist.\n\n\"I can't defend the indefensible. You have to understand that there are countries that struggle out there. But their people, their people are good people and they're part of us. We're Americans,\" Love said during an interview on CNN.\n\nMcAdams\u2019 victory means House Democrats will hold at least 234 seats as the majority party in January when the new Congress is sworn in. The party has now flipped 42 seats, a net gain of 39.\n\nAccording to Cook Political Report editor Dave Wasserman, Love's loss means House Republicans will lose 43 percent of their female members at a time when there will be more women serving in Congress than ever before \u2014 a historic result powered almost entirely by newly elected House Democrats.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this report misidentified where Ben McAdams is mayor."}]
