Light streams through an open window. Down below stretch dim, crowded streets, where the air is thick with diesel fumes from motor scooters and the stench of rotting rubbish. Up here in her family\u2019s tidy rented flat, the curious and resourceful girl who wants to become a nurse seems a world away.\n\nLara al-Khaled, 15, in Shatila. The camp is acutely overcrowded: at least 14,000 people live there, nearly nine times the 1992 population \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\nLara is Syrian. Her family escaped their country\u2019s civil war six years ago, seeking refuge in Lebanon. Their adopted neighbourhood is a kind of landmark to the wars that have ravaged this region, created by the people who survived them. This is Shatila, a refugee camp in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs that has existed for almost 70 years.\n\nThe labyrinthine slum has been built over decades by people fleeing conflict and poverty; a century of migration that has shaped Lebanon \u2014 a small country bordered by Syria and Israel \u2014 like a geological force.\n\nArmenians fled here in the early 20th century, then Palestinians started to arrive in 1948, when the creation of Israel displaced hundreds of thousands across the border. Syrians are the latest to seek shelter, fleeing from a civil war that is entering its eighth year.\n\nLebanon, with a population of 4.5 million, now has an additional estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees and more than 250,000 Palestinians, giving it the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. There are 12 other Palestinian refugee camps across the country, mostly embedded within poor neighbourhoods. I visited one other in Beirut, called Burj al-Barajneh, and there is an additional smaller camp in the capital called Mar Elias.\n\nShatila is on prime real estate, in the middle of the city, yet is largely hidden from Lebanese society. \u201cIf you live in municipal Beirut, the camps are invisible to you,\u201d says Mona Harb, professor of urban studies and politics at the American University of Beirut. The Lebanese government does not exist here. Aid agencies provide services, though they increasingly struggle for funding.\n\nThe dangerous tangle of wires in Shatila. The threat of accidental electrocution is ever present: multiple deaths are reported every year \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\nThe camp is acutely overcrowded. At least 14,000 people live there, nearly nine times the 1992 population. Encircled by other neighbourhoods, Shatila\u2019s roughly 1 sq km footprint cannot grow to accommodate newcomers. The cemetery is running out of plots. It is common for a six-storey building, with four rooms per floor, to hold 24 families.\n\nResidents build upwards, adding a floor here, a joining passage between buildings there, an extra room on a roof \u2014 like Lara\u2019s \u2014 until the concrete layer-cakes reach as high as seven storeys and lean ever closer to each other, blocking out the sun. There is no planning and no enforcement of building regulations, despite the fact that Lebanon lies on an earthquake faultline.\n\nLara\u2019s family study, eat and sleep in their one-room home. It\u2019s baking hot in summer and wind-whipped in winter, but on the roof at least the children see the sky. The room is spotlessly tidy; the children are neat and clean, playing with a little chicken they caught on the street and brought up here as a pet.\n\nTheir place was not so together when they moved in. With money and engineering help from Habitat for Humanity, an international housing aid charity, Lara\u2019s father, Musif, has plugged leaks, painted walls, put in a proper toilet and fixed their electricity supply. \u201cNow it\u2019s great,\u201d he says.\n\nAhmad, Lara\u2019s brother, with the family\u2019s pet chicken \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\nIn Lebanon, the charity has mended and improved 260 homes in the past year, helping Syrians, Palestinians and impoverished Lebanese. Since 2001, it has helped more than 4,500 families in the country. Its aim is to make the most meagre accommodation safer and more dignified.\n\nWith a budget of up to $1,500 per home, it either pays the tenants to make improvements themselves or helps them find labour and materials. Work ranges from installing windows and doors to putting in plumbing and fixing leaking roofs.\n\nHabitat\u2019s team in Lebanon is small, only 24 people, and is made up of engineers, social workers, evaluators and accountants. Richard Cook, the Middle East director, says the number could grow, depending on the money it can raise. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant struggle to get the right amount of funding,\u201d he explains.\n\nMoney has been particularly scarce in the past two years, with the continuing Syrian crisis and all manner of other disasters, man-made and natural, competing for humanitarian aid dollars. \u201cIt\u2019s really been a case of gradual fatigue from donors,\u201d adds Cook, a chartered surveyor by trade who spent 27 years working in the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. The charity is seeking institutional donors, such as governments, to expand what it can do.\n\nNo tour of Shatila is complete without a visit to the camp\u2019s unexpected treasure trove. Behind a flimsy iron door in an alley is a one-room museum created by a man named Mohammed Eessa. Refugees donate artefacts from Palestine \u2014 rusted farm tools, crockery, a model galleon \u2014 turning this room into a symbol of resistance through memory.\n\nEessa arrived in Lebanon as a baby, one of the many Palestinians displaced in 1948 in what is called the nakba (catastrophe). His family headed to south Lebanon. Around the same time, Palestinian refugees pitched tents on an open plot close to Beirut that would become Shatila.\n\nSuch camps mostly sprung up where there was demand for cheap labour. Sprouting squat concrete houses, they became staging grounds for Palestinian armed resistance. The Lebanese government withdrew jurisdiction over the camps in 1969, the same year Eessa left to study in Spain.\n\nIn Shatila, much of the concrete is made using salty water, causing the structures to corrode from the inside \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\nIn 1975, Lebanon\u2019s tense sectarian balance dissolved into fighting between Christian groups, Druze, Sunni Muslims, Palestinians \u2014 all internally factionalised. In the civil war that followed, refugee camps became battlegrounds. Twice displaced inside Lebanon by fighting, Eessa\u2019s mother finally ended her journey in Shatila. He says he moved to the camp in 1979, hoping one day to return to Palestine. There they survived the 1982 massacre and three years of fighting that reduced much of the camp to rubble.\n\nAlthough initially intended as temporary shelters, camps such as Shatila have become permanent slums. Some families have lived here for generations. Professor Nasser Yassin, director of research for public policy and international affairs at Beirut\u2019s American University, says people cling to the word \u201ccamp\u201d because it supports an impression of temporariness. For many Palestinians, the camp \u201cembodies and crystallises that we\u2019re going back to our place, our homeland\u201d.\n\nThat hope, however, is fading. The peace process has stalled. A rightwing Israeli government continues to sanction Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Trump administration has recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and cut funding to the UN aid organisation dedicated to supporting Palestinian refugees.\n\nPalestinians in Lebanon are barred from at least 39 professions including law and medicine, and even from buying property. These policies push them into society\u2019s shadows, deterring them from being able to think of Lebanon as home. Hopelessness permeates Palestinian society in Shatila, says Eessa, who is now 70. \u201cWhen I was a child, all the families wanted their children to study. Now, no.\u201d Shatila, he says, has become \u201cunliveable\u201d.\n\nThis is partly where Habitat for Humanity aims to make a difference: by making the most basic accommodation more homely, and by offering assistance to people who feel disempowered and abandoned. In the absence of the state, the charity also tries to make the camps safer. In Shatila, tangled vines of cables and plumbing pipes snake overhead, with water dripping through live electric wires that lurch downwards when they get too heavy.\n\nHabitat staff separate wires from pipes, installing trays to keep them apart, letting in light. A simple solution, but they don\u2019t have the funding to complete a large area yet. Threat of electrocution runs throughout the camps, with multiple deaths reported every year. This year, Ali Eessa, a 26-year-old Palestinian plumber (no relation of Mohammed), was electrocuted by dangerous wiring in Shatila and killed. He was about to propose to his girlfriend.\n\nAs I walk around the camp with Habitat\u2019s Richard Cook, we come across a chunk of concrete, about 1 sq ft, lying on a street. Cook looks up to the crumbling third-floor staircase it fell from. The rusty struts of the building\u2019s skeleton are exposed. He winces. \u201cThe concrete is made using salty water,\u201d he explains. The structures are corroding from the inside. In his decades of working in Palestinian camps, Cook says: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen conditions as bad as they are today.\u201d\n\nElectricity and falling concrete are not Shatila\u2019s only dangers. Like many of the Palestinian refugee camps, which became battlegrounds during Lebanon\u2019s 1975-90 civil war, Shatila has seen terrible violence. In 1982, it was the site of one of the Middle East\u2019s worst 20th-century atrocities, when thousands of Palestinians and Shia Lebanese in the camp and surrounding streets were murdered by Christian militants. An Israeli commission later accused occupying Israeli forces, along with the militants, of indirect responsibility for the massacre.\n\n\"I\u2019m afraid for my daughter, not for me\u201d. Sausan Ali al-Sayyed in Shatila \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\nMany residents have lived through trauma. Sausan Ali al-Sayyed, a young Palestinian shopkeeper who was born in Lebanon, hops over stagnant pools of water and mounds of rubbish, which sometimes contain needles, to reach her home. Tomorrow will be her 33rd birthday.\n\nAsked how she plans to celebrate, al-Sayyed lets out a grim laugh. Her abusive ex-husband was Lebanese. She left him after eight years, but not before he knocked out all her top teeth. The dark first-floor apartment she lives in belonged to her brother, who was killed when terrorist group Isis bombed the Burj al-Barajneh refugee camp in November 2015. Now al-Sayyed pays rent to her brother\u2019s three orphaned children.\n\nBefore Habitat for Humanity helped her fix the place, it had no proper doors or windows. Mistaking her corner of the alley for a trash heap, people would hurl rubbish in. Rats bit her. \u201cPoverty is not something to be ashamed of, but what can I do, I\u2019m on my own,\u201d she sighs. People smoke marijuana outside her window, and there is little she can do to prevent them. \u201cNo matter how strong I am, I\u2019m afraid for my daughter, not for me,\u201d al-Sayyed says. Her daughter is five and a half.\n\nIn 2013, 65 years after Palestinians first arrived, hundreds of frightened Syrians started crossing the Syrian-Lebanese border. Lebanon\u2019s government responded by debating what to call them. The word laji\u2019in (refugees) carried international commitments that the Lebanese government was unwilling to shoulder (Lebanon has not signed UN treaties that protect refugee rights) and officials argued that they should use a different term.\n\nHaytham al-Sayyad, a Ministry of Social Affairs employee who attended the government meetings, says he suggested dioof (visitors). Eventually the government chose the word naziheen, meaning displaced. Usually this refers to people within their own country, denoting temporariness.\n\nNo one, according to al-Sayyad, thought the Syrians would stay more than three months. With an MBA in marketing, he accidentally ended up becoming refugee co-ordinator for Beirut and the south, spending months shepherding Syrians across the Masnaa border crossing.\n\nShatila is on prime real estate, in the middle of the city, yet is largely hidden from Lebanese society \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\n\u201cOf course the policy is extremely informed by the Palestinian refugee experience in Lebanon,\u201d explains Harb. \u201cIn 1948 there was a sense [of], \u2018We\u2019re hosting them . . . \u2019 People provided their own private land to put up tents . . . convinced it would be a matter of weeks, months, and then they would go back.\u201d The reality of what followed \u2014 including the civil war in 1975 \u2014 left many Lebanese politicians with a deep ambivalence about how to respond to future arrivals.\n\nCrucially, Lebanon\u2019s governance system is based on sectarian power sharing. Christians and minority groups fear they are becoming outnumbered by growing Sunni and Shia Muslim populations. Both Palestinian and Syrian refugees are predominantly Sunni, while poorer Lebanese people are largely Shia.\n\nLebanon\u2019s political elites are so afraid of acknowledging that the Christian to Muslim ratio is no longer 50:50 that the government has not taken a census since 1932. Fearing that new Syrian refugee camps would become a replica Shatila, Lebanon refused to authorise any.\n\nSome Syrians did end up in makeshift camps but the rest disappeared into Lebanon\u2019s informal housing. Many live alongside Palestinian refugees in shanty towns; some rent basic houses in rural areas; wealthy Syrians buy in downtown Beirut, where the average apartment costs $1m.\n\nLebanon had an affordable housing crisis before the arrival of Syrian refugees. The plots of land on which the Palestinian camps stand are what Mona Fawaz, urbanisation scholar, calls \u201ca precious reserve of affordable housing\u201d.\n\nAbu Marwan, a Palestinian real estate broker in Shatila, sits outside a caf\u00e9 and explains the area\u2019s informal housing economy. He makes his living managing properties inside Shatila, collecting rents, making deals for landlords living elsewhere in Beirut, and taking a cut. But he, too, is a refugee from Syria, having fled with his children six years ago from Damascus\u2019s Palestinian camp, Yarmouk, which now lies in ruins after years under siege and bombardment.\n\n\u201cSince Syrians came, the rent increased. There\u2019s a lot of taking advantage,\u201d explains Abu Marwan. A Palestinian NGO worker in the camp estimates there has been a $50 to $100 a month increase. \u201cIt\u2019s because people don\u2019t have proper paperwork,\u201d says Abu Marwan.\n\nBeirut, as seen from Mount Lebanon \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\nThanks to Lebanon\u2019s vague and fast-changing refugee policies, many Syrians there are undocumented. Depending on how you look at it, landlords charge a premium for default risk or cynically exploit the vulnerable. NGO cash, helping the worst-off refugee families, may have inflated prices too.\n\nFor landlords, these basic shelters are an investment. Abu Marwan estimates a Shatila apartment costs $20,000 to buy. The market appears active: signs stuck up near fuse boxes advertise apartments for sale and rooms for rent. Just one room can fetch $200 a month.\n\nTo save money, families are packed in tightly. Abu Marwan points down the street to a two-bed home housing 22 Syrians. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have money for bread,\u201d he says. \u201cI go back to the landlord and ask if they can push it, and I try to get contributions from the shops.\u201d\n\nA 35-year-old Syrian woman in an apartment managed by Abu Marwan says she is always worried about paying rent, about $250 a month. Her two-room-plus-kitchen home has a curtain for a door, no shower, no windows, no beds \u2014 just thin mattresses in the main room. Sewage bubbles up the drains. Yet her sister plans to join them, which will bring the total number of children in the flat to 10. \u201cDon\u2019t come back to Aleppo,\u201d her family told the woman. \u201cIf you do, you\u2019ll die of starvation.\u201d\n\nRussia, backing Syria\u2019s Assad government, has tried to paint Syria as safe and shift international negotiations towards Syrian refugees returning. Some Lebanese politicians have enthusiastically supported this.\n\nStarved of space, residents build upwards, adding a floor here, a joining passage there \u2014 until the concrete layer-cakes reach as high as seven storeys \u00a9 Charlie Bibby\n\nRhetoric against refugees has turned harsh. But the UN and other western countries maintain the country is still too dangerous. Lebanon\u2019s refugees affairs minister alleged last month that at least 20 refugees who returned from Lebanon to Syria had been killed by the regime.\n\n\u201cSyrian workers rebuilt Lebanon in the 1990s,\u201d says Yassin, explaining that Syrians crossed the porous border and provided cheap labour after Lebanon\u2019s civil war. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see them . . . But now the Syrians are in our face.\u201d Syrian women clad in black beg in Beirut traffic; Syrian children rifle through bins, salvaging scrap metal. Their visibility has stoked anti-refugee sentiment in Lebanon, he says sadly.\n\nIn most cases, it is the poorest Lebanese, not wealthy politicians, who have taken refugees into their communities. \u201cIt\u2019s not the middle-class partygoers,\u201d says Yassin. \u201cPeople who complain most are not those necessarily feeling the burden.\u201d Some 87 per cent of registered Syrian refugees and 67 per cent of the poorest Lebanese live together in the 251 areas of Lebanon most vulnerable to poverty. An estimated 32 per cent of Lebanese live in poverty.\n\nAn ongoing economic downturn has put many Lebanese out of a job. One engineer at Habitat joined the NGO after he found there were no more shopping malls to work on. Construction is also where many refugees find illicit employment, but Syrians have limited rights to work and no recourse to law if they suffer abuse. Many are trapped in debt, and the increasingly difficult circumstances have pushed a number of refugees back to Syria (it is unclear how many).\n\nBack in Lara\u2019s building, her father Musif climbs the steep stairs to the sixth floor. A wiry man with a lined face, he is working today, hauling buckets of wet cement through the streets. His hands are so calloused he can barely feel anything, he says. In Syria\u2019s Hama province, he worked as a driver. Lara\u2019s mother, who did not work before, now cooks at a restaurant in Beirut.\n\nHaving a properly functioning home can\u2019t solve all the family\u2019s problems. Rent for their room is about $175 a month, not including electricity. One day\u2019s labour earns Musif roughly $15 and, three months ago, the UN stopped the family\u2019s food aid. He worries about his daughters walking home from school after dark. His youngest son, Ahmad, seven, who was born in Lebanon just after they arrived, has no papers and therefore cannot go to nursery.\n\nShatila bustles with activity; people hawking radishes or cooking pizza; a lullaby escaping from a nursery school. But at night time the atmosphere can change. With so many people lacking options for proper work, and a strong desire to block out the present, the camp is rife with drugs and crime.\n\nAlthough Musif wants to return to Syria, he is afraid to take his children back. He says they are still affected by the bombing they saw, and the frontline with rebel-held Idlib is not far from their village.\n\nShatila has its problems, but they feel they are safer there than they would be in Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s all right here [in Shatila],\u201d Musif says. \u201cThere are some disturbances, but there are also people who helped us.\u201d\n\nChloe Cornish is the FT\u2019s Middle East correspondent\n\n\u2022 Your gift will be doubled\n\nIf you donate to Habitat for Humanity through the FT\u2019s Seasonal Appeal, the Hilti Foundation, a charitable organisation, has generously agreed to match your gift.
