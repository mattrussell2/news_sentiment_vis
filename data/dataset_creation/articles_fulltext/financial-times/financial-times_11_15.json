It is also a heavy responsibility. That is true at any time, but especially when the stakes are so high.\n\nAnd negotiating the UK's withdrawal from the EU after 40 years and building from the ground up a new and enduring relationship for the good of our children and grandchildren is a matter of the highest consequence. It touches almost every area of our national life, our whole economy and virtually every job. The livelihoods of our fellow citizens, our integrity as a United Kingdom of four nations, our safety and security, all of these are at stake. My approach throughout has been to put the national interest first, not a partisan interest and certainly not my own political interest.\n\nI do not judge harshly those of my colleagues who seek to do the same, but who reach a different conclusion. They must do what they believe to be right, just as I do. I am sorry that they've chosen to leave the government. And I thank them for their service.\n\nBut I believe with every fibre of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people. From the very beginning, I have known what I wanted to deliver for the British people to honour their vote in the referendum - full control of our borders by bringing an end to the free movement of people once and for all, full control of our money so we decide ourselves how to spend it on priorities like our NHS, full control of our laws by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom, getting us out of the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy for good. That is exactly what this agreement will deliver - free movement ended, vast annual payments stopped, the jurisdiction of the ECJ over, out of the CAP, out of the CFP. This is a Brexit that delivers on the priorities of the British people.\n\nIn achieving these objectives, I am also determined to protect the things that are important to us, protect the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs that put food on the tables of working families right across the UK. Those jobs rely on cross-border trade in goods, with parts flowing easily in and out of the UK, allowing for integrated supply chains. This agreement protects that. Protects the close security co-operation that helps keep us safe, this agreement does that. Protects the integrity of the United Kingdom and peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland, by leaving the EU as one United Kingdom and having no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. This agreement does that as well.\n\nYes, difficult and sometimes uncomfortable decisions have had to be made. I understand fully that there are some who are unhappy with those compromises. But this deal delivers what people voted for and it is in the national interest. And we can only secure it if we unite behind the agreement reached in cabinet yesterday.\n\nIf we do not move forward with that agreement, nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow. It would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it.

To basically mean that there is no hard border across Ireland and no hard border between the UK and the rest of the EU in terms of goods.\n\nThere are two things, however, that are going to worry hard Brexiters about that deal. Number one, there's no very clear watertight exit mechanism from the old UK customs arrangement. The UK can't unilaterally leave that arrangement. It needs to make a case to an independent panel of judges. It's not clear how that would go. It's not a firm guarantee it could leave.\n\nAnd secondly, it looks as though Northern Ireland would remain very firmly and tightly inside both the customs union and the single market under that arrangement, while the UK was outside the single market and also much more loosely related to the customs union. And that is something that's going to really worry, not only hard Brexiters, but of course, the Democratic Unionist party who will fear that a border will go down the Irish Sea.

Thank you, Mr Speaker. And with permission, I would like to update the House on our negotiations to leave the European Union. Mr Speaker, what we agreed yesterday was not the final deal. It is a draft treaty - it's not. It is a draft treaty that means that we will leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way on 29th of March, 2019.\n\nWe were told that we had a binary choice between the model of Norway or the model of Canada - that we could not have a bespoke deal. But the outlined political declaration sets out an arrangement that is better for our country than both of these, a more ambitious free trade agreement than the EU has with any other country.\n\nI believe this issue can best be solved through our future relationship with the European Union, but the withdrawal agreement sets out an insurance policy should that new relationship not be ready in time at the end of the implementation period. I do not pretend that this has been a comfortable process, or that either we or the EU are entirely happy with all of the arrangements that have been included within it. But of course, this is the case. This is an arrangement that we have both said we never want to have to use. But while some people might pretend otherwise, there is no deal which delivers the Brexit the British people voted for, which does not involve this insurance policy.\n\nI know it's been a frustrating process. It has forced us to confront some very difficult issues. But a good Brexit, a Brexit which is in the national interest, is possible. We have persevered and have made a decisive breakthrough. Once a final deal is agreed, I will bring it to parliament. And I will ask MPs to consider the national interest and give it their backing. Voting against a deal would take us all back to square one. So Mr Speaker, the choice is clear.\n\nWe can choose to leave with no deal. We can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose -\n\n- or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated. This deal - a deal that ends free movement; takes back control of our borders, laws, and money; delivers a free trade area for goods with zero tariffs; leaves the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy; delivers an independent foreign and defence policy; while retaining the continued security co-operation to keep our people safe; maintain shared commitments to high standards; protects jobs; honours the integrity of our United Kingdom; and delivers the Brexit the British people voted for.\n\nI choose to deliver for the British people.

And what kind of deal is it - a good deal, or a bad deal? To be honest, it's neither of those things. It's a deal the prime minister is trying to argue is in the national interest.\n\nShe's tried to get her cabinet onside after a five-and-a-half hour tortuous meeting yesterday, but it hasn't gone quite to plan. The resignation of her Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday morning shows that many of her colleagues simply do not agree with the prime minister and cannot support this deal in good conscience. The question now is how many more agree with Mr Raab? In the Conservative party there are dozens of MPs who are unhappy with the prime minister's direction and may now move in a leadership challenge against her. The same could be true for other cabinet ministers, such as Esther McVey, Penny Morden, and Andrea Latimer, also unhappy at the state of these negotiations.\n\nEven if Mrs May survives the next 24 hours, she's still got to get it through the House of Commons. We've heard from MPs like Jacob Rees-Mogg, who are not particularly happy at this deal at all. They will be rallying support against Theresa May's deal.\n\nI hope parliament will block it. I think what we know of this deal is deeply unsatisfactory.\n\nUltimately, though, Mrs May will try going above their heads and say to the country, at this stage in negotiations, there is no alternative. With the UK set to leave the EU within five months, the only real alternative at this stage to Mrs May's deal is no deal at all, and the consequences of that could be pretty harsh.

But it has more to do with the expectation that the average effective mortgage rate will go from 2.2 per cent to 4.2 per cent over the same period,\u201d said Lucian Cook, Savills residential research director, who said the study assumed a 25-year mortgage term repaying capital and interest.\n\nThe outlook for different English regions pointed towards a \u201crebalancing\u201d between London and the rest, Mr Cook said. In its November inflation report, the Bank of England noted that the slowing market in the capital had already \u201cbrought London house prices relative to income somewhat closer to other areas\u201d, citing regulatory and tax changes, as well as lower net migration from the EU.\n\nSavills predicts house prices will rise at a faster pace outside London over the next five years, with prices growing by a modest 4.5 per cent in the capital against 21 per cent in the Northwest.\n\nWhile mortgage payments for first-time buyers will rise everywhere, they will climb faster in the Midlands and the North, where wage rises will lag behind the more rapid growth in house prices. In London, first-time buyers\u2019 annual mortgage costs are expected to rise to \u00a319,100, up from \u00a313,800 today, while in the Northwest, payments will rise proportionately higher, from \u00a36,400 to \u00a39,500.\n\nMr Cook said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to get a bit harder in the Northwest and it\u2019s probably going to ease a little bit in London without that rampant house price growth we\u2019ve had from 2005 to 2016.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned, however, that the trend would still be a long way from closing the gap between the two. \u201cGiven where interest rates are going to sit and what we expect to happen to house prices over the next five years, first-time buyers are still going to face a big barrier to entry with housing deposits,\u201d said Mr Cook, who used mortgage data from UK Finance and economic forecasts by Oxford Economics in its analysis.\n\nFalling house prices in London, alongside rising wages, mean the average deposit needed by a first-time buyer there is likely to fall by around \u00a312,000 by 2023, he said. But that would still leave it at an eye-watering \u00a382,000 \u2014 a figure that far exceeds the annual household income of the average first-time buyer.\n\nThe research was published as figures from the Office for National Statistics reinforced the robust picture for the English regions. Average house prices rose by 6.1 per cent and 6.0 per cent respectively in the West and East Midlands in the year to September and by 3.3 per cent in the Northwest. In London, by contrast, they fell by 0.3 per cent over the year."}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Brexit backstop drawbacks pose problems for UK and EU", "description": "Opposition by Brexiters as well as European reservations obscure flaws of default deal", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6b6f8a98-e811-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7c30f558-e819-11e8-8827-ff56e7163c11?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T05:00:23Z", "content": "There is one striking feature of the customs union backstop plan as drafted in Britains withdrawal treaty from the EU: it is designed not to work.

We have so many fabulous tools available.\n\nBut tools without a craftsman is pointless. And if you're a parent right now, particularly upper middle class, and you're thinking what I desperately need to do is build the right tools, study the right things, get great test scores, the right university, onto the right job, you're not building a craftsman. This is the mistake so many parents make trying to guess the life that their kid will lead at and then leading it for them in their heads.\n\nYou want to know why Google pays a million dollars as a bonus to sign a high-end data scientist nowadays?

I see what's different than what was there before. You know what the best reward for a kid is? Attention.\n\nIt's not praise. It's not stuff. You need them to be passionate about their craft, and that will never come from being worried about whether they're getting the right grades or worried about whether they're making you happy, or whether their friends will think less of them.

Mr Cummins adds that idiosyncratic contracts may be liked by law firms, which bill by the hour for drafting them, but they are often unnecessary \u2014 and achieving efficiency in contracting is good for all.\n\nAine Lyons, deputy general counsel at US-based software company VMware, says one of the main aims of \u201csmart contracting\u201d is to make legal services simple and to replicate in digital form what people are used to in daily life.\n\nVMware\u2019s legal department has developed some digital innovations that make the process of contracts and negotiation easier, including a self-service portal for creating non-disclosure agreements. When employees need to generate an NDA, usually on sharing commercially sensitive information with suppliers, they use a smartphone app or tablet to answer a few questions, from which a contract is generated.\n\n\u201cThere [are] considerable efficiencies in the process but, as importantly, we\u2019re empowering our employees to take responsibility [for] the process and protect our data,\u201d says Ms Lyons.\n\nIn Ukraine, Yuriy Zaremba is exploring how machines rather than lawyers can handle contracts. The co-founder of Kiev-based AxDraft says people are surprised by the breadth of work that can be automated. \u201cEven the most complex M&A deals have a lot of code-able patterns,\u201d he says.\n\nFor shipping and manufacturing clients, AxDraft can develop \u201csmart forms\u201d for common requirements such as claims against suppliers for delay of delivery and violation of contracts. Almost any legal document can be coded and formulated in about a week, he says. \u201cThe key is to determine the pattern and develop a template.\u201d\n\nUS tech start-up Ironclad is also working on improving the efficiency of contracting by applying technology to \u201cproblems [that] machines are better at than humans\u201d, says James Honsa, who oversees deployment at the company, based in Silicon Valley. He says legal teams in many industries are dealing with the \u201csame poor contracts problems\u201d of inefficiency and lack of helpful analytics.\n\nAutomation and good data processing are not the only benefits technology brings to contracts. Security and trust are also vital to contracting parties, which is where innovations such as blockchain can help. \u201cThe whole point of a contract is to create an unassailable account of an agreement. But when an organisation is dealing with tens of thousands of contracts, traditional contracting becomes burdensome,\u201d says Chad Jerdee, general counsel at Accenture.\n\nThe management consultancy\u2019s legal team has developed a platform based on years of contract analytics and blockchain technology, which provides an immutable record of every contract, including the contract\u2019s lifecycle and an auditable history. \u201cThis platform helps [Accenture] build trust in relationships,\u201d Mr Jerdee says. \u201cAccess to legal services beyond the privileged few who can afford it is becoming an increasing issue in society.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneur David Fisher says trust is the key to better contracting, which led him to set up Integra Ledger, a blockchain to support legal documents.\n\nWhile most blockchains \u2014 such as the one governing bitcoin \u2014 are public and can be accessed and interrogated by anyone, Integra Ledger is a private blockchain overseen by the legal industry and is a system for hosting contracts and other legal documents.\n\n\u201cLegal contracts, which need to be kept confidential, can benefit from the immutability that blockchain provides,\u201d he says.\n\nFor Mr Fisher, blockchain technology has good potential to improve access to legal documents in developing countries.\n\n\u201cIn the developed world, where there is already a high degree of social trust, blockchain will create incremental value and add efficiencies to contracting,\u201d he says. \u201cFor developing countries \u2014 especially where the rule of law is more tenuous \u2014 blockchain will become a massive disrupter in the same way that mobile technology leapfrogged wired telephone lines.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Calves, cobalt and keeping track of the supply chain", "description": "Blockchain can cut paperwork and clarify provenance, from beans to baby food", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/2b565c54-d08b-11e8-9a3c-5d5eac8f1ab4", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7547d7ac-e6e8-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T04:50:28Z", "content": "From beans to bananas, and rice to wine, the amount and complexity of paperwork involved in shipping foodstuffs around the world means the ships travel almost as fast as the documents.

HSBC and ING handled a letter of credit backing the shipment for US food group Cargill relying on blockchain technology developed by software company R3. This cut the time needed to exchange documentation to 24 hours instead of the traditional five to 10 days.\n\nIt was billed as the first commercially viable trade-finance transaction using blockchain, an electronic distributed ledger of transactions that records data in digital blocks. Blockchain promises to save time and money for the shipping industry, which still relies heavily on paper documents such as bills of lading, cargo insurance and invoices, as well as letters of credit.\n\nAlisa DiCaprio, head of global trade strategy and research at R3, says the sheer extent of paperwork involved in a typical shipping transaction frequently produces some kind of query or discrepancy.\n\n\u201cThe packing list might say this is a cargo of \u2018soyabean\u2019 not \u2018soyabean meal\u2019, and so the documents would have to go back and forth to confirm what was being shipped,\u201d she says. \u201cWith blockchain, both sides have to confirm simultaneously, so that catches any problems or discrepancies straight away.\u201d\n\nThe food industry has also been quick to adopt blockchain technology, in part to improve food safety after a series of scandals. In China, six babies died and thousands were ill in 2008 after drinking milk laced with a harmful chemical, melamine. In the UK and Ireland in 2013, consumers learnt they might have eaten horsemeat after it was mislabelled as beef in frozen burgers and ready meals.\n\nFood companies are now using blockchain platforms to track their supply chain. One use is to help prove to consumers that the free-range egg they had for breakfast did not originate from a factory farm and that palm oil in their biscuits is not produced by child labour.\n\nUse of blockchain means retailers can trace back in detail to where a particular crop was grown. \u201cA baby food retailer of a sweet potato and pumpkin meal, for example, can see in the system which farm the sweet potato came from. So if there is any problem . . . they can find the farm and even which batch it came from,\u201d says Ramesh Gopinath, vice-president of supply chain solutions at IBM.\n\nSuch detailed information can help companies quickly identify and recall batches of goods if contamination is suspected.\n\nIt also helps demonstrate ethical credentials to consumers concerned about the sourcing of products.\n\nIn Wyoming, some cattle ranches log the identities of calves via blockchain so the ultimate buyer can prove these are open-range cattle, which command a higher price.\n\nOlinga Taeed, visiting professor in blockchain at Birmingham City Business School, says consumers are demanding more transparency. \u201cWhere [blockchain] has been adopted by businesses like food and logistics, that\u2019s where businesses can use it to improve the bottom line and differentiate themselves,\u201d he says.\n\nSome technology start-ups, such as Provenance, help food and drink companies track the origin of their supplies using blockchain. Jessi Baker founded the business while working on her computer science doctorate. The idea was inspired by her upbringing in the rural English county of Wiltshire, where her mother grew garden vegetables and bought local produce.\n\n\u201cThe information helps businesses themselves know where their products are coming from, and also consumers who want more and more information,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be for quality reasons or because of allergies or diet issues or because of their personal values.\u201d\n\nProvenance recently took part in an international pilot tracking tuna from Maluku in Indonesia through the south-east Asian fishing industry and works with companies such as the UK\u2019s Co-operative Group.\n\nUse of blockchain to verify the supply chain in other industries such as mining is also driven by growing ethical concerns among consumers and investors. Investment manager Hermes recently called for carmakers to adopt blockchain technology to help prove where the cobalt in their batteries comes from. More than half the world\u2019s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Amnesty International recently claimed child labour was being used in its extraction.\n\nDe Beers is trialling digital tracking to ensure the diamonds it sells are sourced ethically\n\nDe Beers, the world\u2019s largest diamond producer, is trialling digital tracking to ensure the diamonds it sells are sourced ethically from small miners in Sierra Leone.\n\nLord Hodge, a justice of the UK\u2019s Supreme Court, said in a speech last month that blockchain\u2019s distributed ledger technology could provide a record of who owns what, stamping out illegal trading in conflict diamonds. Another advantage was that it provides a permanent record. \u201cThe preservation of an accurate historical record would be an important weapon in holding people accountable for the performance of their fiduciary and other duties,\u201d he said.\n\nThe data stored on blockchain cannot be changed and some believe this could lead to fewer legal disputes. However, Christina Blacklaws, president of the UK\u2019s Law Society, says there could still be litigation. \u201cIt may lead to fewer disputes or to different types of disputes \u2014 perhaps ones about expectations of a contract rather than the execution of a contract.\u201d\n\nOthers point out that blockchain relies on information entered by people. \u201cBlockchain is dependent on a human being for information and if you have a human being taking a bribe to put information on the blockchain, that could potentially happen,\u201d warns IBM\u2019s Mr Gopinath."}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Big Four circle the legal profession", "description": "Accountancy firms are using technology to muscle in on traditional law firm territory", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9b1fdab2-cd3c-11e8-8d0b-a6539b949662", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa6542c10-e6ed-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T04:42:33Z", "content": "In March, the head of the UKs Financial Reporting Council suggested the time had come to consider breaking up the Big Four accounting firms.

Stephen Haddrill called on the Competition and Markets Authority to examine the case for \u201caudit only\u201d firms.\n\nThe argument for breaking up the Big Four \u2014 Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC \u2014 and separating their audit function from the range of other professional services they offer looked quite compelling in the wake of the collapse of Carillion, the British outsourcing company which was linked to aggressive accounting practices.\n\nNor are anxieties about the effect on audit quality of the expansionist ambitions of the Big Four restricted to the UK. This year, the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators said it had identified accounting failures in two-fifths of the 918 audits of listed companies it inspected in 2017.\n\nGiven that the growth of the Big Four has been particularly pronounced in the legal services market in recent years, leading law firms will be watching the arguments for and against spinning off these companies\u2019 audit arms with keen interest.\n\nSome argue that the global business and political climate has become less hospitable to the Big Four\u2019s designs on the legal sector. Having surfed the wave of globalisation and the deregulation of legal services around the world that followed the UK\u2019s liberalising Legal Services Act in 2007, they now face the twin forces of protectionism and populism. These political developments threaten to close lucrative global markets, particularly in emerging economies that are lightly regulated.\n\nDoes all this spell danger for the Big Four\u2019s dream of absorbing law-related services into their \u201cintegrated services model\u201d? One leading expert has warned the legal profession against celebrating prematurely.\n\n3,600 PwC lawyers\n\nIn a recent article written with Maria Jose Estaban, David Wilkins, director of the Center on the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School, declared: \u201cReports of the death of the Big Four\u2019s legal ambitions have been greatly exaggerated.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, as Prof Wilkins points out, we have been here before. In the 1990s, the then Big Five (today\u2019s Big Four, plus Arthur Andersen) made a concerted effort to move into the legal market. That attempt foundered in the wake of the Enron scandal, in which Arthur Andersen was centrally implicated and which led to its disintegration in 2002. The so-called Magic Circle law firms grew rapidly as the remaining Big Four drew in their horns.\n\n\u201cThe legal profession thought they\u2019d banished [the Big Four] to Middle Earth,\u201d Prof Wilkins says. \u201cBut in fact they reformulated their strategy to take advantage of changing dynamics.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, the accounting firms have sought not to replicate the large law firm model but rather to refine an integrated services model that operates at the intersection of tax, finance, consulting, strategy, information technology and project management.\n\nThe Big Four reformulated their strategy to take advantage of changing dynamics\n\nNick Roome, head of KPMG\u2019s UK legal services business, recently told The In-House Lawyer magazine: \u201cOur model is . . . not to go head to head with law firms. We offer something different.\u201d The same is true of the other members of the Big Four, whose legal activities have grown prodigiously: PwC employs 3,600 lawyers in 98 countries; EY has 2,200 lawyers in 81 countries; KPMG about 1,800 lawyers in 75 jurisdictions; and Deloitte has more than 2,400 lawyers on its books.\n\n2,400 Deloitte lawyers\n\nThe most nimble and innovative law firms recognise they must respond and also that the Big Four\u2019s multidisciplinary model offers op\u00adportunities for collaboration. The status quo is not an option.\n\n\u201cClients want integrated solutions,\u201d says Prof Wilkins, because they do not think of their challenges in legal terms \u2014 they are just challenges. \u201cLaw firms have to respond to this.\u201d\n\nThis need not mean that the complete convergence of law firms with the providers of integrated, business-oriented solutions is inevit\u00adable. \u201cThere is always room for various forms of specialisation,\u201d he says.\n\n1,800 KPMG lawyers\n\nHowever, there is one area in which the Big Four do have a head start and which they plan to conquer: harnessing technologies such as machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence to provide more efficient and better legal services.\n\nRichard Susskind, author of Tomorrow\u2019s Lawyers, an influential study of the future of the legal profession, and a consultant to Deloitte Legal, says: \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about the Big Four is their commitment to new technology. They come to a market where they have no legacy to protect, so they are able to start with a blank sheet of paper. It seems to me self-evident that the Big Four will be hoping to emerge as market leaders in legal technology.\u201d\n\nWhile most leading global law firms will, Prof Susskind says, have \u201ca story to tell\u201d about innovation and technology, these are yet to have shown a decisive effect either on turnover or on ways of working.\n\n2,200 EY lawyers\n\nThere are exceptions, however. Prof Susskind picks out Margin Matrix, a digital derivates compliance system developed by Allen & Overy with Deloitte. Or take Schillings, a firm that has transformed itself in recent years from a law practice into an integrated professional services partnership.\n\nProf Susskind says he often asks law firms who their competitors are. \u201cThey\u2019ll mention someone who looks quite like them. But I tell them that the competition that will kill them won\u2019t be like them.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "FT Intelligent Business", "description": "The report highlights the integration of people, processes and data to solve business\u2019s operational challenges.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nWhen a machine is analysing a legal document, every word counts. For example, the insertion of \u201cnot\u201d \u2014 just a three-letter word \u2014 changes the entire meaning of a contract\u2019s clause. But while teaching machines to assess legal data is not easy, the benefits of doing so \u2014 from increased efficiency to better risk management \u2014 have spurred efforts to train computers to become more sophisticated in how they interpret the written word.\n\n\u201cThe real challenge is teaching machine learning models to understand the wording,\u201d says Lucy Shurwood, a partner at Pinsent Masons. The law firm is developing its own artificial intelligence platform, called TermFrame, to extract, review and analyse contract risks. \u201cSomething might be worded differently but mean the same thing and sometimes one word change will fundamentally alter the meaning of the clause,\u201d she adds.\n\nNatural language processing \u2014 systems that interpret speech and text \u2014 is already part of this effort. However, the next step is to enable machines to make qualitative analyses of legal documents. \u201cThe golden ticket is being able to classify them,\u201d says Ms Shurwood.\n\nIn the case of contracts, this might mean being able to identify unnecessarily obstructive clauses such as the need for a specific party\u2019s consent before contractual obligations can be transferred. \u201cIf we can capture and understand what our clients are doing, we can advise them better because we can spot trends in the way they\u2019re contracting,\u201d she says.\n\nTo teach computers to make these qualitative assessments, Pinsent Masons is creating machine learning models by inputting different examples, which can take up a lot of time. \u201cWhen we were doing some analysis of our contracts, we had 7m examples of clauses \u2014 and that\u2019s just for one provision,\u201d says Ms Shurwood.\n\nHowever, as machines read and analyse more data, the process will speed up. \u201cAs new models come into existence that can understand the context and the syntax, that task is becoming easier,\u201d she says.\n\nNot all obstacles to handling legal data are digital. \u201cThe context is always different and the law is always changing,\u201d says Vasant Dhar, professor of information systems at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cThat makes it a messy arena for AI to operate in.\u201d\n\nSeparating legal data from business and operational data is not always easy. Contracts, for example, contain operational data such as the names and addresses of relevant parties, as well as legal data such as change of control provisions \u2014 agreements that give a party certain rights, such as payment or termination.\n\nAlso, legal data is often scattered across an organisation. In the case of allegations of wrongdoing, those relating to harassment and discrimination might exist in the HR department, those relating to fraud and bribery in compliance, and those relating to embezzlement with the chief security officer.\n\n\u201cEach has different systems and nearly all [organisations] have these entirely siloed,\u201d says Eugene Soltes, a Harvard Business School professor, who specialises in studying corporate wrongdoing.\n\nAnother hurdle is that legal data tend to be particularly confidential by nature. This means that even within an organisation the information is often unavailable to analytics experts such as the statisticians and programmers.\n\n\u201cThese are the skeletons in the closet that, short of the legal division, outside counsel and the chief executive, people don\u2019t know or talk about,\u201d says Prof Soltes. \u201cSo it\u2019s not typically exploited.\u201d\n\nThose that overcome the technological and organisational hurdles, however, can reap benefits that range from greater efficiency in processes and lower legal spending to better management of risk and compliance.\n\nThese are the skeletons in the closet that . . . people don\u2019t know or talk about. So legal data is not typically exploited\n\nAnalysis of past contracts might reveal that legal teams are spending too much time negotiating low-risk items, while those where risks are higher are receiving insufficient attention.\n\nIn litigation, more accurate predictions of the likelihood of winning a case could help companies decide whether and how to settle.\n\nBy examining claims data, technology can enable companies to run fraud detection investigations much faster, says Greg Schneider, co-founder and executive director of Quantium, a data analytics company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going through a thousand cases to find ones that just don\u2019t look right,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can do it at [an acceptable] level of quality and time and, because of computing, it\u2019s infinitely scalable.\u201d\n\nUse of data enhances management of internal risks too, says Ms Shurwood, who cites employment claims. \u201cWe can identify geographic trends or trends in types of claims that we can flag up to the client,\u201d she says. This might reveal that discrimination claims are frequently filed against the client in one business unit, enabling it to take action.\n\nFor multinationals, regulatory compliance technology \u2014 known as \u201cregtech\u201d \u2014 helps ensure they are meeting legal obligations in dozens of jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cA big regtech idea is to computationally process these obligations and have a flag any time those obligations change,\u201d says Daniel Martin Katz, professor of law at Illinois Tech and co-founder of LexPredict, a consulting and technology firm.\n\nEven so, he adds, given the cognitive biases present both in humans and algorithms, technology will not provide a complete solution. \u201cYou want to correct the biases of one with the other,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you can intelligently thread them together, that\u2019s ideal.\u201d"}]
