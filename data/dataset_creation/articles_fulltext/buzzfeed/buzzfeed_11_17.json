I didn't think anything would make that much of a difference, but after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I am so happy I did. I use just a little once or twice a week as a quick conditioner and then when my hair starts really frizzing and look dull and damaged. When I rinse and dry after, it's like I have different hair. No frizz, no dryness \u2014 it's soft, silky, and smells great! I also get far fewer tangles than I used to and the ones I do get are much easier to comb out, which is a big plus for me. I've been using it for over a year now, and I always make sure to rinse it out completely.

There was no sugarcoating it: Mars bars could run out within weeks if the UK left the EU without a deal. According to an industry insider present, the environment secretary was left reeling by a briefing from the Food and Drink Federation that of the 21 ingredients that make up a Mars bar manufactured at their factory in Slough, two imported products go off within a few days. In the event of no deal, gridlock at the port of Dover would effectively shut down one of the country\u2019s main routes for food imports. The ingredients couldn\u2019t be stockpiled. The experts told Gove the UK\u2019s entire supply of Mars bars would run out within two weeks. The striking case study helps explains the former Vote Leave campaigner\u2019s decision to stay in the government on Friday. Allies of Gove told BuzzFeed News that, despite warmly backing the deal at cabinet on Wednesday, he privately loathes the agreement Theresa May has made with Brussels. But, they said, his experience running the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs had convinced him that the alternative of no deal was unconscionable. According to a person who has been briefed on DEFRA\u2019s internal discussions on no deal, officials are forecasting that the disruption to food imports and exports could last for more than six months, leading to shortages on supermarket shelves and putting enormous financial pressure on businesses that depend on exports to the EU. \u201cThe other Brexiteers in the cabinet and a lot of those on the backbenches would go for no deal,\u201d said one friend of Gove. \u201cBut Michael would never, because he has seen what it means in DEFRA.\u201d A second source familiar with his thinking said he did not want to be the person who brought down May and put the country on course for a no-deal Brexit that he would then be blamed for. Gove\u2019s decision to remain in post sent shockwaves through the Brexiteer ranks and led many in Westminster to conclude he had saved the prime minister, for now.\n\nDan Kitwood / Getty Images Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit secretary on Wednesday.\n\nThis was not how the week was supposed to go for those sceptical of May\u2019s deal. BuzzFeed News can reveal how a small group of cabinet ministers calling itself the \u201cburger club\u201d (in contrast to Andrea Leadsom\u2019s larger \u201cpizza club\u201d), consisting of Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt, and Geoffrey Cox, had been meeting for weeks to discuss their various gripes. In conversations ahead of the crunch cabinet meeting, several of the burger club ministers resolved to tell May that they each opposed different aspects of the deal and wanted her to go back to Brussels and try again. In further conversations, other colleagues agreed, and by the time cabinet sat down a total of 10 ministers had committed to raising opposition to the deal. Chris Grayling \u201cspent several days complaining\u201d to colleagues about what May had signed up to, said a source familiar with the conversations. But when it came to the showdown, only Raab and Esther McVey made good on their threats to quit when May rejected their demands. \u201cThey all spoke against it, then they all fell into line,\u201d said a Whitehall official familiar with the cabinet discussion. Raab was given advance sight of the agreement, but despite being the Brexit secretary, he was not involved in its drafting. He was said to be shocked at new language in the text committing the UK to a future relationship that would \u201cbuild on\u201d a customs union with the EU. He decided immediately after reading the document that there was no way he could support it, and that he would have to go if changes were not made, an ally said. May\u2019s aides were convinced Raab would back the PM, and spent Wednesday making farcical attempts to finalise travel arrangements for him to meet Michel Barnier to confirm the deal. Raab knew he was either resigning or forcing May back to the negotiating table \u2014 there was no way he was going to Brussels that night. At Wednesday lunchtime, the DExEU team tried to politely inform those making the arrangements that their minister would likely not be travelling. Then a senior Downing Street official offered to let Raab out of cabinet early so he could fly via helicopter across the Channel, promising him a movie-style entrance to the Barnier photo opportunity. This was rebuffed. With time running out, an RAF aeroplane was readied. Instead of boarding it, Raab told the chief whip Julian Smith he was resigning.\n\nTolga Akmen / AFP / Getty Images Former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey."}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Natalia", "title": "Fill Your Bag At Urban Outfitters And We'll Guess Your Zodiac Sign", "description": "Enjoy your shopping spree!

His name is Nathaniel Hall. He has neat, even features, light brown hair teased into spikes, and beads round his neck. No one knows he is gay \u2014 he cannot say the words \u2014 but wearing a dinner jacket that colour is his way of at least saying something: that he\u2019s different. He has no idea how much more different from his classmates he is about to become. A few minutes later, a man in his mid-twenties called Sam will look over, catching Nathaniel\u2019s eye before striking up a conversation, sparking in the teenager a mounting excitement that, with college imminent, there might be a chance he can at last explore being gay \u2014 and maybe meet someone like him. Nathaniel does not know that theirs will be a short fling with lifelong consequences; that the first time he has sex he will contract a virus that will fill his life with silence. Fifteen years later, he sits in his flat in Levenshulme, south Manchester, a few miles from the park bench, telling BuzzFeed News what unfolded from that day: the HIV diagnosis, how the shock muzzled him, preventing him from telling his parents, and how that corroded everything that followed. The silence will end soon \u2014 for Nathaniel at least. Three weeks from now, just in time for National HIV Testing Week and World AIDS Day, he will stand on stage to perform the play he has written about what happened to him, a middle-class boy from the suburbs who became HIV-positive on his first time. He is, to put it another way, about to leave the second closet that formed around him when he had not even escaped the first. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he says, now aged 32, \u201cand exciting. It\u2019s changed who I am.\u201d But in writing the play, and revisiting the teenage boy he was, Nathaniel Hall has stumbled upon something beyond the silence of HIV, something that spreads even further: the isolation that still engulfs LGBT teenagers, and how that leads to danger.\n\nSam looked to Hall like a mythical creature in Stockport that afternoon in 2003: a real gay man, hair flecked with peroxide, T-shirt tight enough to leave little doubt, tanned so deeply as to summon the exotic. Hall, who had never seen someone so obviously, definitely like him before, was entranced. Sam glanced over a few times. \u201cIt was the summer I was leaving school, with that sense of becoming an adult and starting to find my way in the world,\u201d he says, smiling under his thin-wired glasses and angular, cropped haircut. \u201cI was ready to go out there and be gay and find out what that meant.\u201d\n\nHall Nathaniel Hall, aged 16.\n\nUntil then, all it had meant was being called names in school: faggot and poof, mostly. He remembers being kicked in the back so hard he was smashed into a vending machine. The only mention of homosexuality came during sex education: a video about a gay man dying of AIDS. There was no advice about how to ask a man to use a condom, or what to do when he says you will be fine without. It all seemed so remote. \u201cI came from white, middle-class suburbia,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018People like you don\u2019t get it.\u2019 That was the overriding attitude in the back of my head.\u201d So when Sam ambled over and sat with Hall on that bench, only the heady prospect of connection loomed. They started talking. \u201cHe looked like Will Young. Seeing someone openly gay was wild.\u201d To this day he cannot remember if Sam was 23 or 26, only that he seemed like an adult. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel menacing or predatory at the time,\u201d he says. Now he is not sure. They arranged to meet again. After a few times they went back to Sam\u2019s flat, where exploration progressed further: Clothes came off, a safer sex pack appeared. But Sam put the condoms to one side, removing only the lubricant from the cardboard wallet. \u201cI\u2019ve been tested, it\u2019s alright,\u201d he told Hall. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to use those.\u201d It did not occur to Hall to question this. \u201cI knew nothing,\u201d he says. All he did know was that this older, experienced man was his gateway to the future. \u201cHe had showed me the gay world. We went down to Canal Street [Manchester\u2019s Gay Village]. He was opening the door to that life, so at that point when the condoms were left out it was like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re showing me how to have sex, so I\u2019m going to take your lead on that.\u2019\u201d It happened a few more times that summer. Hall\u2019s mother suspected something, and asked if he was gay, prompting him to tell her about Sam. She said he was too old and that Hall should end it. Sensing she was right, he did. But just before starting college, Hall fell ill on a family holiday in Menorca: vomiting, diarrhoea, a fever. A doctor, when examining him on his return, thought it was a waterborne virus. Only weeks later when he had discharge from his penis did Hall think to go to a sexual health clinic. By then he was quietly building a relationship with a boy at his new sixth-form college. At the clinic they found gonorrhoea, but he refused to have an HIV test initially \u2014 scared, in denial, rejecting the creeping dread he felt. It would be another few weeks before the staff at the clinic persuaded him, and a further fortnight for the results to return. \u201cThe clinic had this really long corridor and they took me all the way down to the counselling room at the end. They said it straight away: \u2018We got your test results back and you\u2019re HIV-positive.\u2019\u201d Shock set in. \u201cI don\u2019t think I said anything. I remember crying. It felt like being hit by a bus.\u201d\n\nChristopher Nunn\n\nThe health adviser at the clinic told him, based on the evidence available at the time, that he could expect to live for another 36 years, taking him to age 52. Although a huge increase from the two-to-five-year death warrant issued to people diagnosed in the 1980s, this was still a limit, and much less than the near-normal life expectancy those diagnosed today can expect. The staff kept him there for hours, long after the clinic closed for the day, seemingly aware how young and vulnerable he was. \u201cI knew only that it was untreatable and that I was infectious,\u201d he says, \u201cso another layer of shame and self-hatred was added to the stuff I already had as a gay man.\u201d The clinic encouraged him to telephone a friend to come and look after him, but even she could not help with the most important decision. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I had to go home and tell my family, but I had already had that conversation with my mum about using condoms and it was too late: I\u2019d already ballsed it up. The horror of feeling I had to tell them means that even now I can feel the anxiety \u2014 that comes back \u2014 of having to say, \u2018I\u2019m human and I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u2019\u201d As Hall put the key in the door to his family home he knew there were two options. \u201cI could have walked straight into the kitchen and just said it, or I could go upstairs into my bedroom and shut the door.\u201d He did the latter. He didn\u2019t tell them for 14 years. Instead, he phoned the boy he had been secretly kissing at college, who, unfazed by the news, ran the several miles between their houses that evening to see him; to tell him it made no difference, that they could still carry on. They stayed together for the next eight years. But Hall went through college without his family knowing. He was able to tell his personal tutor, who suggested informing the principal because he had a sister who\u2019d been a nurse for AIDS patients in the 1980s. The principal would invite Hall to have lunch in his office. \u201cWe used to sit and talk, and he would offer advice, always with the best intentions, but not always the best advice because it was coming from stories he\u2019d heard from the AIDS ward.\u201d\n\nHall\n\nThe difference in the impact of HIV in the early noughties compared to the 1980s was vast: The introduction of effective antiretroviral medication in 1996 transformed lives and prevented HIV from being an automatic death sentence. The general population was scarcely aware of this, however, ensuring stigma remained. Hall only told a few select friends. He went through university and the rest of his twenties without telling his family: through being constantly exhausted while studying for his degree because the virus had been left untreated; through then being put on antiretroviral medication that would wake him in the night with heart-pounding anxiety; and through the depression that arose later on, when the accumulative effects of being alienated from those around him while managing the condition hit. Or, as Hall puts it simply, \u201cliving with this trauma and not talking about it. I always remember that feeling of isolation from people.\u201d So, for example, when he saw Sam in the HIV clinic one day, years later, and Sam avoided him, Hall could not tell his family about it \u2014 the choking resonance of it all. Instead, it would take a \u201cbit of a breakdown\u201d aged 30 to force Hall\u2019s hand. \u201cI was partying too much, drinking too much, taking drugs in the middle of the day, getting really angry at things that shouldn\u2019t make me angry. I put my hand through a plate-glass window.\u201d It escalated to a stage where, he says, \u201cI looked in the mirror and didn\u2019t recognise who I was anymore.\u201d Hall knew that what he had to do was write about his experience; to exorcise it by retelling it as drama. He had already been accessing support from a local HIV charity, the George House Trust, and had begun giving talks about his life. But dramatising and performing it would also mean having to tell his parents, along with everyone else. After several failed attempts, this was the only way. \u201cThe longer I left it, the more it felt like they\u2019re going to be upset that I kept it from them,\u201d he says. \u201cWould my mum think she was a bad mother because her son can\u2019t talk about this with her? I blamed myself too much for what I\u2019d done \u2014 that I had failed, that towering shame and stigma I was putting on myself, when actually it\u2019s just a virus and I was really, really unlucky. All these things were racing through my head. It\u2019s exactly like the things that go through your head before you come out: the fear of doing it is worse than the act itself.\u201d He wanted to tell his older brothers and younger sister, too. So, a year ago he wrote his parents a letter. \u201cDear Mum and Dad,\u201d it began. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to say and I\u2019ve needed to say for a long time. I\u2019m HIV-positive.\u201d Two days later, he received texts back saying they loved him. His mother then arrived at his flat with a houseplant. He shrieks with laughter at the memory. \u201cI said, \u2018Why have you got a houseplant?\u2019 She said, \u2018I don\u2019t know. What do you bring when your son tells you that?\u2019\u201d They sat talking. \u201cI don\u2019t feel hurt or upset you\u2019ve not told me,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI\u2019m just upset that you\u2019ve gone through that.\u201d Recounting this, Hall begins to cry. He says his father, after reading the letter, thought he would lose him, unaware of how much things had changed since the 1980s. They are still acclimatising to talking about his condition, says Hall, but something on the horizon is about to provoke more conversation: the play.\n\nChristopher Nunn\n\nHe has been working in theatre, with young people, for years. And it was an experience with a group of 15-to-25-year-olds last year, in which they worked together on a theatre project about sex and relationships, that finally persuaded him to commit his story to performance. \u201cThey were so bold, they made this really beautiful show,\u201d he says, \u201ctaking their personal stories and traumas \u2014 that made me want to create the show.\u201d He started using short pieces he had already written as a basis for the play: a letter to his 16-year-old self, the letter to his family. He also knew that he had to perform the one-man show himself. \u201cBecause it\u2019s me standing up on stage and going, \u2018This is me, I\u2019m HIV-positive.\u2019\u201d There are, he says, many people in London who speak out about HIV but fewer up north. He hopes someone will see it and live more openly. As he talks \u2014 self-assured, observant \u2014 he seems far removed from that na\u00efve boy sitting on the bench. He has a stable boyfriend now, along with a career and, soon, a voice. But the writing of the play has taken him back to who he was then, with an adult awareness of what happened with Sam. It has unleashed a series of realisations. \u201cThe idea that that first time wasn\u2019t romantic,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that it might not have been the way I saw it at 16.\u201d He does not know what to make of Sam. Was he predatory? Did he know he had HIV? It seems Hall does not want to judge him too harshly, not least because that would be more painful. He remembers a time in his flat with two friends of Sam\u2019s, of smoking cannabis and then the memory cutting out. One day, immersed in memories, Hall wrote everything down suddenly. \u201cIt all came out. I read it and thought, \u2018Where\u2019s that come from?\u2019\u201d He workshopped it with colleagues and a performance artist friend, and the eventual result was his play. It's called First Time. \u201cThe first few scenes of the play are of a younger me,\u201d he says. Although this poses a problem in the performance of revisiting innocence long eroded, it has also been eye-opening.\n\nHall\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really clear to me that he\u2019s a child, that he\u2019s not grown up,\u201d Hall says of the teenager he was. Something strange happened during this process. Where before, when Hall had written the letter to himself at 16 telling himself he was going to be OK, now, by revisiting that age, it was as if a message was being sent the other way: \u201cThe 16-year-old me said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I fucked it up and that what you\u2019re going through now is because of what I did.\u2019\u201d The effect was transformative. \u201cEverything shifted in my head because I thought, \u2018Actually, yes, I do need to forgive myself.\u2019\u201d In doing so, he realised that his entire adult life had been spent pressurising himself with perfectionist demands, as if to rectify his own imperfect mistake. \u201cThat\u2019s within the play,\u201d he says, \u201cthis idea of fucking up and then not having to be perfect to make up for it.\u201d The instinct to pressurise oneself in this way is, he says, remarkably common among gay men, regardless of their HIV status, because of how the overall message from the world remains: You are different; you are not good enough. The effects of this for Hall have been both perfectionism and an inability to assert himself in sex and relationships \u2014 a reaction shared by many gay men bullied in their youth. \u201cIt\u2019s made me realise that I sometimes allow things to happen to me when I don\u2019t want them to be happening to me,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don\u2019t say anything.\u201d For others, he sees this low self-worth, and the accompanying isolation, spilling out into other areas. \u201cIt\u2019s painful and hard to go through and sadly for a lot of people that I know they don\u2019t make it through it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey commit suicide or they overdo it on drugs and we lose them. And then that\u2019s portrayed in a certain way, of leading a \u2018hedonistic lifestyle\u2019, but people don\u2019t realise the pain that\u2019s underneath that.\u201d Only this week has some hope of this changing emerged. The Scottish government \u2014 the first in the world to do so \u2014 announced it would introduce mandatory lessons on LGBTI issues, in an attempt to reduce homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic bullying, and the resulting slide into mental ill health and self-destruction. For many, the need has never been greater: Where Hall sat on a bench and met someone, teenagers today have phone apps and social media, escalating opportunities both for connection and for risk. The proportion of young people contracting HIV has not shifted, either, in the 15 years since Hall was diagnosed. Just over 1,000 people in Britain under the age of 24 were told in 2003 they were HIV-positive, compared to over 9,000 overall. In 2017, despite all the attempts to educate young people and equip them with prevention methods, over 500 were still diagnosed, out of over 4300 in total. While the trend for transmissions overall is reducing, the percentage of young people being diagnosed persists.\n\nChristopher Nunn"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Elena Garcia", "title": "34 Things You'll Want To Add To Your Wardrobe For The Holiday Season", "description": "You better be hungry, because holiday realness is about to be served!

I watched them walk down the street and he was STILL TALKING. Like, get a room with yourself, guy. You're obviously the man of your dreams.\" \u2014oOshwiggity\n\n11. This divorce settlement: \"I served a couple one time who had met up to discuss the terms of their divorce at the fancy-ish restaurant I worked at at the time.

The gist of the call was that the guy was her mother's coworker and her mother had set the date up. About 15 minutes later, a guy her age came in, threw some cash on the table and excused them. She cited some vague emergency and was escorted out.\" \u2014mesoziocera\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Comedy Central\n\n13. This I'm NOT lovin' it moment: \"I worked at McDonald's and a couple came in. The woman sat down and the man tried to order. There was lots of 'umm'-ing and 'ahhh'-ing over what he wanted to buy, then he ordered two meals, we gave them to him, and he went to sit down. What followed was a 10-minute shouting match about how he wouldn\u2019t take the woman on a \u2018proper date\u2019 and how messed up a McDonald\u2019s date was. Guess he ordered the wrong thing?\" \u2014shadez36\n\n14. This flirty facade: \"I worked at a Chili\u2019s and, one Valentine\u2019s Day, a girl gave me her number while her boyfriend was in the bathroom. I came back and had to deal with her being sweet to him the rest of the dinner. I did not call or text her, but it was weird every time she\u2019d flirtatiously look me.\" \u2014PrinceLemonade\n\n15. This absolute mess: \"When I was waitressing in college, I witnessed the single most embarrassing thing to happen to a person. Right in the middle of their dinner (and in the middle of our Friday night dinner rush) this poor guy stood up, tapped his wine glass to get EVERYONE'S attention, and then proceeded to tell EVERYONE what a fantastic person his girlfriend was. The whole time this is happening, she was just sitting there with the most bored look on her face. Then the poor guy pulled out a ring, got on one knee and asked her to marry him. She gave him the most disgusted look imaginable and said, 'THIS is the ring you expect me to say yes to? Could you be any cheaper?' She got up and walked out, leaving the poor guy just kneeling there. I didn't charge him for the meal.\" \u2014Penya23\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF NBC\n\n16. This affair to remember: \"Not a waiter, but I was working as a supervisor in a restaurant. There was a couple that came to lunch everyday and, everyday, they went to the bathroom together for like 20-30 minutes, so we all assumed they were having sex. It was inappropriate, but there was nothing we could do. Then, one day the woman came to the restaurant with another man. That man was her husband, which made for a pretty awkward moment.\" \u2014big_ma05\n\n17. And finally, this horrible request: \"A couple was at a table with two crying children. I went up and started with, 'How are you doing tonight? What can I get you started with to drink?' The father then said, 'Do you have a shotgun back there so I can blow my head off?' The wife\u2019s glare at him was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen, I honestly hope that man is still living.\" \u2014RhodeIslandIsFake\n\nTap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Universal Pictures"}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Nora Dominick", "title": "19 Reasons Why Eleanor And Tahani From \"The Good Place\" Are Actually Soulmates", "description": "\"Side note, I might legit be into Tahani.\" View Entire Post \u203a", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/noradominick/the-good-place-eleanor-tahani-soulmates", "urlToImage": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-11/15/17/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/original-31012-1542321194-17.jpg?crop=819:429;0,0", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:23:47Z", "content": "NBC William Jackson Harper even addressed Eleanor's bisexuality in an interview saying, \"There's a million different possibilities and one of the things I think the show does well, and [I'm] really kind of into, is the fact that Eleanor is super bisexual and \u2026 [+41 chars]", "fulltext": "NBC\n\nWilliam Jackson Harper even addressed Eleanor's bisexuality in an interview saying, \"There's a million different possibilities and one of the things I think the show does well, and [I'm] really kind of into, is the fact that Eleanor is super bisexual and it's not something that we just focus on.\""}, {"source": {"id": "buzzfeed", "name": "Buzzfeed"}, "author": "Jenna Guillaume", "title": "19 Charts For People Who Kinda Suck At Makeup", "description": "Up your game with these easy-to-follow tips.
