Crude futures have dropped dramatically in the last month as U.S. crude prices plunged as much as 30 percent from a four-year high.\n\nGarner, the co-founder of DeCarley Trading and author of Higher Probability Commodity Trading, \"believes much of the recent weakness in equities can actually be blamed on shortsighted managers liquidating stocks to pay for these commodity market margin calls,\" Cramer said. \"By the way, that's why you should never, ever buy anything on margin.\"\n\nAnd Garner doesn't think oil prices are out of the woods yet. Besides the fact that the end of the year tends to be tough for oil prices, which usually peak in October and hit bottom in January or February, she worried that too many investors are still heavily invested in oil futures.\n\nAccording to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's \"Commitments of Traders\" report, money managers, small speculators and commercial hedgers still have substantial long positions in West Texas crude futures, she noted.\n\n\"This has been a very crowded trade for a long time. That's why Garner's been warning us nearly all year that lower oil prices could be in the cards,\" Cramer said. \"Large speculators were net long roughly 230,000 contracts as of this latest reading. [...] That's down dramatically from 730,000 at the peak \u2014 the largest net long position, by the way, in history (how wrong were those people?) \u2014 it's not down enough to make Garner believe we're ready to bottom.\"\n\nAdding to that, the Consensus Bullish Index, a sentiment gauge, suggests that investors could still get more negative on oil, Garner said. Considering the past swings she's seen in oil prices, she said the commodity still has more downside, with one floor of support at $51 a barrel and another at $42.\n\n\"Here's the problem: despite the recent meltdown, Garner points out that the oil futures, amazingly, are still not oversold, meaning they haven't actually gone down so far so fast that they're due for a bounce,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nAnd while Garner doesn't think it's very likely that oil prices fall to the low $40s \u2014 where Cramer has predicted they could go \u2014 she warned that the $51 level will only hold if the fundamentals of the oil space significantly improve.\n\nAll in all, her charts \"suggest that oil could have some more downside, which therefore could lead to still more ... selling of stock because of the margin calls,\" Cramer said. \"You know what?

The romaine lettuce linked to the E. coli outbreak earlier this year was from Yuma, Arizona. That outbreak, which sickened about 200 people and killed five, was blamed on tainted irrigation water.\n\nNo deaths have been reported in the current outbreak, but 13 people in the U.S. and six in Canada have been hospitalized. The last reported U.S. illness was on Oct. 31, while and the most recent illness in Canada was early this month.\n\nTracing the source of contaminated lettuce can be difficult because it's often repackaged by middlemen, said Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. That can mean the entire industry becomes implicated in outbreaks, even if not all products are contaminated.\n\n\"One of the problems with produce is that it can be very hard to trace back,\" she said.\n\nShe said washing contaminated lettuce won't ensure that harmful germs are killed.\n\nInfections from E. coli can cause symptoms including severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Most people recover within a week, but some illnesses can last longer and be more severe.\n\nHealth officials have also been reminding people to properly handle and cook their Thanksgiving birds amid a widespread salmonella outbreak linked to raw turkey. Last week, Hormel recalled some packages of Jennie-O ground turkey that regulators were able to tie to an illness.\n\nBut unlike with romaine lettuce, regulators are not warning people to avoid turkey. Salmonella is not prohibited in raw meat and poultry, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which overseas raw meat, said cooking should kill any salmonella.\n\nWATCH: Diabetics are hacking their own insulin pumps\n\nALSO WATCH: How brands like Domino's and PepsiCo profit from school lunches"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Dawn Giel", "title": "U.S. seeks halt in civil suit accusing JP Morgan of manipulating metals market, citing criminal case", "description": "The move comes days after a lawyer sought permission to reopen questioning of two former J.

P. Morgan Chase, citing an ongoing probe into a \"related criminal case\" that involves alleged manipulation of precious metals markets.\n\nThe department wants a six-month postponement in the proceedings of the civil lawsuit, which was filed in 2015 by hedge fund manager Daniel Shak and two commodity traders. The government also says it could ask for a longer delay in the case, according to a court filing on Monday.\n\nThe move comes days after Shak's lawyer, David Kovel, sought permission to reopen questioning of two former J. P. Morgan traders and the bank's current global head of base and precious metals trading.\n\nKovel, in making the request with the Manhattan federal judge in the civil case, cited last month's guilty plea by one of those former traders, John Edmonds, in federal court in Connecticut.\n\nEdmonds admitted making bogus bids on precious metals contracts while working at the bank from 2009 to 2015.\n\nNeither J. P. Morgan Chase nor Kovel's clients have opposed the Justice Department's request.\n\nIn arguing for a delay, the Justice Department said Shak's lawsuit is \"related\" to Edmonds' criminal case and that Edmonds has \"pleaded guilty and acknowledged his own participation in such conduct, as well as that of other traders.\"\n\n\"Edmonds awaits sentencing, but the broader investigation is ongoing,\" the Justice Department said. The U.S. wants to delay the civil case \"to protect the integrity of its ongoing criminal investigation,\" it said.\n\nJ. P. Morgan did not respond to a request for comment by CNBC. Kovel declined to comment.\n\nTuesday night, after this story first was published, Judge Paul Engelmayer ordered the federal prosecutors to explain in detail by Monday why postponing proceedings in the civil lawsuit would not harm those involved, and why reopening questioning \"would be detrimental to the Government's ongoing criminal investigation.\"\n\nEnglemayer also wrote that he regards Edmonds' guilty plea \"as potentially highly consequential\" to the civil case.\n\nIn his guilty plea, the 36-year-old Edmonds said he had learned to make bogus trade orders from senior traders at the bank and that he used the strategy hundreds of times with the knowledge and consent of his immediate supervisors. He admitted to working with \"unnamed co-conspirators\" at J. P. Morgan, according to the Justice Department.\n\nKovel wants to question Edmonds again as well as Michael Nowak, the bank's global head of base and precious metal trading, and former J. P. Morgan Chase Managing Director Robert Gottlieb. The three had previously answered questions under oath in the civil case.\n\nKovel said in court filings that Nowak was the immediate supervisor of Edmonds, while Gottlieb was Edmonds' mentor.\n\nIn his prior deposition, Edmonds said that Gottlieb sat only a \"couple feet\" away from him for about five years, and that he was \"somebody [he] looked up to in the business,\" who helped guide and train him.\n\nNowak is described by Edmonds as his direct supervisor, with whom he would sometimes discuss trading strategies. Nowak was also the person responsible for overseeing the performance and risk of Edmonds' portfolio, according to the deposition.\n\nEdmonds also stated in his prior deposition that he would enter precious metals trades for both Nowak and Gottlieb, among others.\n\nThe civil lawsuit claims Shak and his fellow plaintiffs lost tens of millions of dollars as a result of actions by J. P.

Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal brokered during the Obama administration, and reimposed economic sanctions on Iran in recent months.\n\nIn the days after Khashoggi's disappearance had first been reported, a growing chorus of politicians came forward to warn that there would be \"hell to pay\" if Saudi Arabia had indeed killed Khashoggi. Trump, too, had warned of \"very severe\" consequences against the kingdom.\n\nIn the last White House press briefing on Oct. 29, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump had met with CIA Director Gina Haspel and that the administration was \"weighing different options, and we'll make an announcement about what the decision of that action is.\"\n\nBut in an interview Sunday with Fox News' Chris Wallace, Trump signaled that he was reluctant to harm relations with Saudi Arabia. \"You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia is \"absolutely vital to America's national security,\" Pompeo said.\n\nRead the president's full statement below:\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia America First! The world is a very dangerous place! The country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq's fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" Iran is considered \"the world's leading sponsor of terror.\" On the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States! The crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \"enemy of the state\" and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2013 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn't! That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world! I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2013 so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm.

Award raises and promotions. Despite workers saying they would part with earnings to hold meaningful jobs, a big indicator of whether a person was engaged and finding purpose in their work had to do with the last time they got a wage increase or new title. Those who had earned a recent accolade were far more likely to say they had a \"highly meaningful\" job than those without a recent advancement.\n\nSo next time you're after a pay bump, maybe spin the request as a way to make you more engaged at the company, keep you in the role longer and lead to you putting in extra hours.\n\nLike this story?

Those decisions would include approving subpoenas or indictments, or even firing the special counsel, Goldstein told CNBC.\n\nThe other challenges could take longer. In a case brought by the state of Maryland, which is also represented by Goldstein, a district court in the state has scheduled arguments for late 2019, and has not indicated when it plans to make a ruling. Goldstein has sought a preliminary injunction in the case that would bar Whitaker from carrying out his official duties.\n\nAttorneys representing a client in an immigration case before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals have filed for a similar preliminary injunction. The government has until Dec. 10 to respond to their claim.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Democrats Mazie Hirono, Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse brought their own case challenging the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment. That case, the latest, is likely to run into technical hurdles about standing and possible remedies, legal experts say.\n\nCritics have called on Whitaker to resign from his oversight role, citing his previous criticism of Mueller's investigation and his close ties to Sam Clovis, a witness in the investigation. Whitaker has said there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump team and Russia, an echo of Trump and his attorneys' own language.\n\nMueller's prosecutors broached the topic of Whitaker's effect on the probe in a court filing Monday. A panel of judges in Washington is overseeing a case brought by a target of the probe, Andrew Miller, who was held in contempt after failing to comply with grand jury subpoenas obtained by Mueller in May and June.\n\nThe special counsel's office wrote in its brief that Whitaker's appointment had \"no effect\" on the grand jury subpoenas issued to Miller. But, they wrote, that was because the subpoenas were issued before Whitaker was appointed. Any \"new\" challenges should be argued in a different venue, they wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTo be sure, there are ways that Mueller can go about inoculating himself from challenges to future actions. For instance, Mueller could obtain approvals from both Whitaker and Rosenstein. But it may not be politically viable for Whitaker to do so if it is perceived to be in response to questions about his legitimacy.\n\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said Whitaker's appointment \"is lawful and comports with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, past Department of Justice opinions, and actions of U.S. Presidents, both Republican and Democrat.\"\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel signed off on Whitaker's appointment in a 20-page legal memo earlier this month.\n\nMueller's use of a grand jury could also bolster his legal case against any future challenges.\n\nWilly Jay, a former assistant to the solicitor general and a partner at the law firm Goodwin Procter, said that \"there are an awful lot of things that generally cannot be litigated after an indictment.\"\n\n\"The grand jury returns the indictment, it is not the attorney general,\" Jay said. \"Once the grand jury returns the indictment, things that go into that cannot be second guessed.\"\n\nJay also pointed to the de facto officer doctrine, under which actions taken by officials can be upheld even if it is later discovered that they were improperly appointed. But that would not necessarily apply if the target of a subpoena or indictment challenges Whitaker's appointment at their first opportunity to do so.\n\nA case from 2016 involving actions taken by the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could be instructive.\n\nThe case arose after the Supreme Court ruled that Richard Cordray, the first head of the CFPB, was improperly appointed by President Barack Obama in 2012. Obama reappointed Cordray in 2013, after which Cordray retroactively affirmed the actions he had taken while he had been improperly serving.\n\nA federal appeals court in California upheld decisions Cordray had made before his renomination. The Supreme Court, however, has never said that the courts can retroactively bless the decisions of an official appointed unconstitutionally, Jay said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Silvia Amaro", "title": "UK leader Theresa May heads to Brussels for crucial Brexit talks with EU chief", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is set to meet the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday afternoon, hoping to strike a rough agreement on the future links between the U.K. and the EU.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/uk-leader-theresa-may-heads-to-brussels-for-crucial-brexit-talks-with-eu-chief.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/08/104887028-GettyImages-888054754.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:34:00Z", "content": "If all goes well, the exit deal will then move to the EU and U.K. Parliaments for approval.

However, the European institutions have yet to confirm when that important political text will be published on Tuesday.\n\nSome EU countries have raised concerns regarding fishing and unfair advantages to U.K. businesses. Spain is also concerned about the future status of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory that Madrid maintains a claim on.

Bloomberg has estimated that becoming a professional gamer could cost you over $17,000, including all of the necessary equipment, just to get started.)\n\nEtue started playing Fortnite shortly after Epic Games launched the game's free-to-play battle royale iteration in September 2017. He'd previously competed in a few tournaments playing another online battle royale game, Daybreak's H1Z1, but he never won any money.\n\nAfter the popularity of Fortnite exploded at the start of 2018 (at one point in February, Fortnite had 3.4 million people playing at once), Etue says he saw \"the potential it had as an esport\" and he shifted his focus to the hot new game. It was a smart gamble, as Epic Games is expected to generate over $2 billion in revenue from Fortnite this year and the company gave notice in May that it would put some of that money to use by launching a series of esports tournaments with $100 million in total prizes (the Summer Skirmish was the first such event).\n\nEtue's skills from other battle royale games like H1Z1 and Player Unknown's Battlegrounds transferred over to Fortnite and he spent hours on end practicing to reach the upper echelon of players. Starting around February, Etue says he was playing Fortnite for roughly eight hours a day, practicing his shooting while learning to become better at building the virtual structures that Fortnite players create for shelter and to gain a vantage point from which they can get the drop on competitors.\n\n\"I've been grinding it for the past seven months,\" he says.\n\nNow that he's won Summer Skirmish, though, Etue has stepped up his practice routine, playing anywhere from 10 to 14 hours each day. That includes playing in competitions and the Fortnite Playground practice mode (where players practice and improve their skills), or even just playing for fun.\n\n\"I definitely think that there's better builders than me. I definitely think there are better shooters than me,\" Etue says. But, what set him apart at PAX West was his ability to strategize the best times to attack opponents or to hang back and wait for the fight to come to him. \"Knowing when to take fights and when not to take fights,\" he says. \"Obviously, I have some talent and some skill when it comes to building and shooting, but that isn't what got me the $250,000.\"\n\nEtue wasn't even close to the best Fortnite player as recently as a few months before the Summer Skirmish. \"I didn't immediately become the best \u2014 I actually got clapped, to say the least\" by some of the best players online, he says. \"But, I learned; I studied everybody else [and] I saw what I was doing wrong. I practiced and refined my strategies,\" he says, adding that he started to become a top player in mid-summer.\n\nHe calls the victory in Seattle \"definitely a major break\" that will allow him to hold off on starting college or another career while he focuses on kicking off his professional gaming career. \"This definitely changed my life and changed the plans I have right now,\" he says.\n\nWhen he was 6 years old, Etue told his parents he wanted to play video games for a living when he grew up. At the time, they told him that wouldn't work, and to pick a real career, but that was before esports became a nearly $1 billion industry.\n\nHis family was going \"absolutely crazy\" after he won and made a \"super emotional\" phone call to his parents from Seattle, Etue says. (\"They're probably screaming in the living room right now with my brothers, just absolutely going wild. I can only imagine,\" he said in his post-match interview.)\n\nNow, Etue and his parents are meeting with financial advisors to plan out the best way to save and invest his quarter-million dollar prize.\n\n\"Oh, I'm definitely investing almost all of it,\" he tells CNBC Make It.\n\n\"I don't think I'm really going to make any fun purchases; maybe some shoes, maybe something like that,\" he says. He also bought a projector screen where he and his little brothers can play Fortnite on a larger backdrop.\n\nMostly, Etue is focusing on leveraging the momentum of winning the Summer Skirmish into a legitimate gaming career. He's streaming several hours a day on Twitch in order to keep building his following, which will bring in money through a partnership with the streaming company.\n\nEtue is also in talks with various professional esports teams about signing a contract. His Twitter bio directs anyone with \"business inquiries\" to an email for the esports talent agency Evolved Talent. \"I'm in talks and definitely interested in joining a team,\" he says, though he hasn't made a decision yet.\n\nAnd though he fell short in the follow-up Fortnite Fall Skirmish in October (which gave away $10 million in prize money), Etue is keenly focused on all future competition events in Epic Games' ongoing $100 million Fortnite tournament series.\n\n\"Oh, 100 percent. You know, just because I won one tournament, doesn't mean I'm going to be complacent about it,\" he says. \"I'm going to keep the grind up ... If I want to stay being the best, you know, I can't sleep or I can't let up.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe company behind the billion-dollar game 'Fortnite' was founded by a college kid in his parents' house\n\nHow this 35-year-old turned the gaming fan site he started as a teen into one of esports' biggest franchises, worth multimillions\n\nLike this story?

Corsi pushed the \"birther\" conspiracy theory that falsely alleged Obama was not born in America.

But deGrasse Tyson, who also hosts the show \"StarTalk\" on the National Geographic Channel, argues that space colonization could have a tremendous impact on civilization, potentially eliminating the need for warring over dwindling natural resources.\n\n\"Because there's unlimited resources in space; resources that, on Earth, we fight wars over,\" deGrasse Tyson tells CNBC Make It. \"In space, you don't need to fight a war, just go to another asteroid and get your resources. A whole category of war has the potential of evaporating entirely with the exploitation of space resources, which includes the unlimited access to energy as well.\"\n\nThat's the sort of universal issue that Musk is trying to tackle, deGrasse Tyson argues, which gives him the potential to have the greatest long-term effect on our civilization. \"[H]e will transform civilization as we know it,\" deGrasse Tyson says.\n\nGranted, Musk has had his share of detractors over the past year. Musk was forced to step down from his role as Tesla's chairman as part of a settlement with the SEC over a series of tweets in August in which he discussed taking Tesla private (the SEC alleged the tweets constituted fraud on Musk's part). The billionaire CEO has also received quite a bit of criticism for, among other things: seemingly smoking marijuana on video, calling a British cave diver a \"pedo\" on Twitter, and clashing with journalists during an earnings call.\n\nHowever, deGrasse Tyson feels that Musk is somewhat underappreciated, though he argues that Musk is beloved by many people, including Tesla owners and anyone interested in space exploration. (\"Go, Elon Musk! And, I don't care if he gets high,\" deGrasse Tyson jokes about the controversy over Musk supposedly using drugs.)\n\n\"People who own Teslas love their Tesla \u2026\" deGrasse Tyson says. \"Anyone who knows and cares about space exploration knows and cares about Elon Musk.\"\n\n\"[W]e're on the frontier of the future of civilization, and no I don't think he gets his full due from all sectors of society,\" says deGrasse Tyson, \"but ultimately he will when the sectors that he is pioneering transform the lives of those who currently have no clue that their life is about to change.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nElon Musk and others 'are not acting like men\u2014they're acting like children,' says NYU professor\n\nElon Musk: Starting SpaceX and Tesla were 'the dumbest things to do'\n\nLike this story?

Two million members use Wikibuy to automatically find low prices and coupon codes and earn loyalty points.\n\nBig banks have been snapping up fintech firms to better serve customers who have quickly become accustomed to digital products. For Capital One, the move fills out its strategy of helping customers save time and money while shopping online. In 2016, the bank bought Paribus, which helps users get refunds when prices drop after a purchase. The company also created tools like Second Look, which cuts down on accidental or fraudulent transactions.\n\nBut Capital One needed something to help customers comparison shop before purchases are made, according to Joseph Poellnitz, who runs the bank's upmarket cards division.

Those talks eventually led to the acquisition this month, about a week before Cyber Monday, when retailers promote deals for online shoppers.\n\n\"We're constantly looking for things to solve the problem of the day in that end-to-end shopping experience,\" Poellnitz said. \"Online shopping is of huge and growing importance to our customers, so we've invested a lot in that space.\"\n\nIf Capital One can anticipate users' needs and solve them with technology, they're more likely to remain loyal to its cards and checking accounts, he said. The McLean, Virginia-based bank is known in the industry for being forward thinking on technology; it purchased tech consultancy Notch in January to accelerate its deployment of machine learning for its card customers.\n\nCapital One is the third-biggest U.S. issuer of credit cards after J.P.

Few of us are immune to chronic stress. In fact, according to the Global Organization of Stress, 75 percent of the U.S. adult population is living with it. This condition of chronic stress, or what I call \"stress brain,\" is the culprit for not only mental and physical illness, but also for poor judgment when it comes to financial decision-making.\n\nIn the realm of financial investment, a level of stress is commonplace.\n\nSuccessful investors know how to thrive \"under the gun.\" There is a very fine line between success and failure, however, when it comes to operating under the influence of stress. Periodic stress, or that which comes and goes, leaves room between experiences to decompress. The brain can then respond to the next round of stressful decision-making episodes with even more effective thought process that yields a strategic level of risk-taking with investments.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nThese credit cards can keep you in debt\n\nThis 71-year-old still has $60K in student loans\n\nWatch out for these job interview red flags\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube\n\nHowever, when we have to contend with consistent stress in and outside of work, the break the brain needs to restore itself is eliminated. Stress brain becomes the norm. The benefits of the situational, periodic stress of financial decision-making are lost to the chronic stress condition. In fact, with chronic stress, the brain goes into a type of \"airplane mode\" to conserve and protect itself.\n\nStress brain is typically caused by this accumulation of stress from a high-pressured job combined with strain from other parts of life, such as family demands, health concerns and/or ongoing social challenges. With higher levels of cortisol maintained over long periods of time, stress brain takes a toll on cognitive functioning.\n\nOn the most basic level, we think and act at a much slower pace. Given the timeliness of some of the best financial investments, this delay in pulling the trigger therefore can result in missed opportunities. Stress brain, however, can cause greater long-term detriment to the mental sharpness for the investor as it thwarts creative thinking, diminishes memory function and detracts from ability to focus.\n\nIronically, chronic stress doesn't detract from wise financial decision-making just because it slows you down mentally and inhibits innovative strategic thinking. It also distorts the perception of potential outcomes as the brain tries to \"feel better.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rain could hamper the search for victims of the California wildfires", "description": "With 79 people killed in the nation's deadliest wildfire in at least a century, there are still nearly 700 names on the list of those unaccounted for.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/rain-could-hamper-the-search-for-victims-of-the-california-wildfires.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/13/105570891-1542115050269gettyimages-1066666786.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:18:00Z", "content": "Survivors and relatives of those caught in the fire in Northern California are using social media to get the word out: In some cases, to post that their loved ones were safe; in others, to plead for help. \"Aunt Dorothy is still missing.

And an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit ended on Sunday with leaders failing to agree on a final statement for first time in the forum's history.\n\nThat has lowered expectations Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a breakthrough when they meet at a G20 summit later this month.\n\nThe recent sell-off on Wall Street had some expecting the Fed to soften its tone on policy tightening at its November meeting, but the central bank did no such thing.\n\nEconomists in the latest poll unanimously said the Fed will raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2.25-2.50 percent in December.\n\nMedian forecasts show three more increases next year, taking the federal funds rate to 3.00-3.25 percent by end-2019. But the third rate rise is a close call, with just over half, 54 of 102 economists forecasting that outcome.\n\nTraders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures expect only two hikes in 2019.\n\nThe range of forecasts around how much the Fed will raise rates next year was wide. While one contributor expected no change to rates at all in 2019 after a December rise, another predicted a 50 basis point hike at the June meeting.\n\nPart of the reason for the lack of conviction for more rate rises stems from still-tame inflation pressure. Wage inflation has picked up recently, but overall, economists have not made any major upgrades to their inflation forecasts.\n\nSimilarly, there is not a lot of conviction over exactly when the next economic slump will arrive.\n\nTwelve respondents in the latest poll said there was a greater than 50 percent chance of a recession in the next two years. But only one, Fathom Consulting, has actually put down a point forecast for GDP to contract in the full year 2020.\n\nJust over half of 65 economists who replied to another question said there was no impact on their growth outlook from the November midterm elections, in which the Democratic Party made major gains and took control of the House of Representatives but left the Republican party in control of the Senate.\n\nTwenty-seven said this new Congressional setup, which will make it more difficult for the White House to pass the kind of sweeping tax cuts as those signed into law late last year, was negative. Five said it was positive.\n\nWATCH:How the Fed could cause the next recession, according to Gary Shilling"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Berkeley Lovelace Jr.", "title": "Tech pulls market lower | Bitcoin drops 15% | Target tumbles on earnings", "description": "Monday's sharp losses are likely to extend into a second day on Wall Street, with futures sharply lower and a loss of confidence in leading tech names continuing to weigh on investors.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/tech-pulls-market-lower-bitcoin-drops-15percent-target-tumbles-on-earnings.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/02/02/104984821-RTX47680r.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:08:00Z", "content": "Intuit (INTU) reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 29 cents per share, beating the consensus estimate of 11 cents, while the financial software company's revenue also came in above Street forecasts.

It has also installed movable, wire-topped barriers, apparently to stop a potential mass rush of people.\n\nAs of Monday, 107 people detained between official crossings have sought asylum since Trump's order went into effect, according to DHS, which oversees Customs and Border Protection. Officials didn't say whether those people's cases were still progressing through other avenues left to them after the proclamation.\n\nDHS has said it wants asylum seekers at the southern border to appear at an official border crossing. But many border crossings such as San Ysidro already have long wait times. People are often forced to wait in shelters or outdoor camps on the Mexican side, sometimes for weeks.\n\nACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said that some people seeking asylum cross between official ports because \"they're in real danger,\" either in their countries of origin or in Mexico.\n\n\"We don't condone people entering between ports of entry, but Congress has made the decision that if they do, they still need to be allowed to apply for asylum,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Uptin Saiidi", "title": "The NBA is China's most popular sports league.
