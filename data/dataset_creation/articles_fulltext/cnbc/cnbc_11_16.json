The unit of Edison International is also under scrutiny for its possible role in connection with another major wildfire, the deadly Woolsey Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The blaze has been blamed for at least three deaths and the loss of hundreds of homes.\n\nEdison last weekend submitted a safety incident report to the state regulator regarding the Woolsey Fire. The cause of the fire remains under investigation but there are reports Edison's equipment may have malfunctioned near the start of the blaze.\n\n\"Fire has become the most pressing hazard faced by Californians,\" said Neal Driscoll, professor of geoscience and geophysics at Scripps Oceanography in San Diego and co-leader of the AlertWildfire site.\n\n\"The plan is we're probably going to have about 100 new cameras in before the end of this year,\" he said.\n\nDriscoll said the ultimate goal is to have hundreds of the early warning cameras around the state. He said the technology also can be useful to look at the impacts of fires on landscapes and to spot areas that can be subject to erosion, mudslides and other risks after blazes.\n\nCalifornia doesn't have any specific legislative requirement for the early warning fire cameras in the nearly 30 fire-related bills Gov. Jerry Brown signed in September to help deal with the state's wildfire challenges. However, one of the new laws \u2014 state Senate Bill 901 \u2014 requires electric utilities to create a new wildfire mitigation and safety plan and submit the plan for approval to the California Public Utilities Commission.\n\nNewsom, who is California's current lieutenant governor and will take the full reins of power in Sacramento in early January, is well known to have a keen interest in technology. Sources say he's spoken to executives of some of the utilities as well as some artificial intelligence experts about how to use high-tech more to combat wildfire threats. He declined a request for comment for this story.\n\n\"Fires are becoming more frequent and more intense, and fire season is getting longer \u2014 sometimes stretching for most of the year,\" Newsom told the Los Angeles Times in September. \"This has to be a top priority for the next governor, and our state needs a comprehensive strategy to protect Californians.\"\n\nThe state also is said to be considering using its own satellite in two to three years to help with wildfire detection and response efforts. NASA satellites already are helping in tracking smoke and performing other roles during fire disasters, according to officials.\n\nThe fire cameras were originally installed at locations where seismologists had put equipment to monitor earthquakes. In doing so, scientists realized there was extra bandwidth available on the sites, so they added high-definition cameras.\n\n\"We had plenty of bandwidth,\" Graham Kent, director of the Nevada Seismological Lab in Reno and one of the chief architects of the AlertWildfire camera network.\n\nKent said cameras aren't the only effort being used to address the wildfire threat. There's also fire modeling, weather stations, the prepositioning of fire equipment, as well as utilities taking more proactive steps to turn off electrical grids during extreme fire danger conditions.\n\n\"There's lots of things going on that can be helpful on those really bad days,\" he said. \"So we play a role with the cameras, no doubt. But there's more than that.\"\n\nThe data from the early warning fire cameras in California and several other Western states is sent to the Amazon Web Services cloud. The public can look at the video, and sometimes they are the first to spot fires. Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nSempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric currently has 16 of the early warning fire cameras installed in its highest fire-risk areas, including inland mountain and foothill areas, and is looking at expanding them into coastal canyons, where fires can start.\n\n\"I can't speak highly enough about these cameras, and it really was an easy decision to make to invest in them,\" said Caroline Winn, chief operating officer for SDG&E. \"It really has been a game-changer in terms of raising our situational awareness and helping us to mitigate the risk of wildfires.\"\n\nLast December, Winn said the San Diego area had \"some of the worst conditions that we'd seen in terms of Santa Ana winds\" in the north county area and a fire broke out along one of the freeways. She said the cameras helped the utility to quickly determine the location of the blaze and alert fire personnel.\n\nThe high-definition cameras can zoom in on terrain to identify the source of fires and on a clear day can see up to 70 miles away.\n\n\"In a way they are like the modern [version] of what used to be a lookout,\" said Jonathan Cox, a division chief with Cal Fire. \"There used to be staff lookouts on mountain tops across the forested areas. A lot of these areas now have early detection cameras and sense a change in landscape and alert authorities.\"\n\nAccording to Cox, the cameras are used by Cal Fire's command centers and can be valuable in getting fire resources to the right area. \"Also, if someone has trouble describing where a fire is, they can look on cameras and see where smoke might be,\" he said.\n\nCal Fire and some local fire agencies in the state also are starting to do more nighttime aerial firefighting with helicopters. The early detection infrared fire cameras can spot fires both day and night.\n\n\"Our goal is to have an aerial asset over any fire in California within 20 minutes,\" said Cox. \"Right now all our assets are still staffed because of the weather.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Elizabeth Gurdus", "title": "Cramer's lightning round: Don't buy shares of Target until after it reports", "description": "Jim Cramer advises callers' on their favorite stocks at lightning speed, including a retail play under pressure.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/cramers-lightning-round-dont-buy-target-stock-until-after-earnings.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/10/12/102079128-1539342565979105501689.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:50:00Z", "content": "Target Corp. : \"I think that the sector has to go down because it's part of the fact that the Fed keeps tightening.

Today I'm going to be fishing for my dinner, so let's see how that goes.\"\n\nZauo is a new, unique spot for Japanese dining in Manhattan.\n\nThe catch? Your own fish!\n\nGeneral Manager Rui Higuchi: \"Zauo opened up in Japan in Fukuoka in 1993.\"\n\n\"We want to greet the customers from the moment they step in. We want them to feel like they just walked into a restaurant in Japan, and so we greet them like very cheerfully with a lot of enthusiasm and say, 'Welcome to our restaurant.'\"\n\n\"We do have lobster. We also have abalone. We have some fluke, flounder and we also have rockfish and striped bass. We want the customers to appreciate their own catch and having their fish prepared minutes after they caught it.\"\n\nMoore: \"So I'm getting ready to fish now, I have my fishing instructor here to help me, so let's do this!\"\n\nHiguchi: \"Let me just set up your rod for you. Be careful with the hook. My advice to you is try to keep the bait very still. Wait for the fish to come to the bait and nibble on it. Once they nibble, just pull it out as quick as you can, you should be able to hook it.\"\n\nMoore: \"Okay.\"\n\nMoore: \"I used to go fishing a lot with my grandfather. I still try to whenever I see him over the summers. I definitely learned a lot of patience from my grandfather while fishing.\"\n\nIt took a few seconds before there were bites, but they weren't very successful.\n\nBut then\u2026\n\nHiguchi: \"Congratulations! Wow, that's a nice catch.\"\n\nHiguchi: \"So here at Zauo, when the customer catches a fish, we like to celebrate with the customer. We want them to be able to feel like, 'Wow, I've really caught something.' And then we want to be there to actually cheer for the customer and show them some support. We congratulate the customers and we hit the Taiko drums as we congratulate them.\"\n\nMoore: \"So what's the process when it comes to preparing your catch?\"\n\nHiguchi: \"So here at Zauo, we can prepare it four ways. We can prepare it sashimi, tempura, simmered in soy sauce, or grilled with salt. But for this specific catch I would go with sashimi and tempura.\"\n\nMoore: \"Okay, sounds good to me!\"\n\nMoore: \"So can you explain for me what we have spread across here?\"\n\nHiguchi: \"Sure. So this is our sashimi, the rainbow trout that you caught earlier. You see it's presented with the fish's head. It's only because we want to ensure the customer that it is your fish and it's very fresh. And over here is our tempura, your rainbow trout tempura.\"\n\nMoore: \"Awesome, great. Thank you so much.\"\n\nHiguchi: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nMoore: \"So I'm super excited. Everything looks delicious and I think I'm going to start with the sashimi. I'll get some wasabi. It's super good. I definitely like it best with the soy sauce but the wasabi is a must. Each different thing gives it a completely different flavor and is really good. I'm going to have another one.\"\n\nDon't miss: This entrepreneur is getting people to eat $100,000 worth of a venomous fish to save the ocean"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Tucker Higgins", "title": "Supreme Court says it will hear 2020 census case, setting up showdown over citizenship question", "description": "The Supreme Court on Friday said it would hear a case concerning whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can be questioned about his reasons for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/supreme-court-will-hear-census-case-setting-up-showdown-over-citizenship-question.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/05/105552724-1541429611990gettyimages-860564356.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:37:00Z", "content": "The Supreme Court on Friday said it would hear a case concerning whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can be questioned about his reasons for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; The case will be one o\u2026 [+3271 chars]", "fulltext": "The Supreme Court on Friday said it would hear a case concerning whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can be questioned about his reasons for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.\n\nThe case will be one of the most closely watched of the term. Eighteen states and more than a dozen cities have sued the administration over the question, alleging that it will lead immigrant populations to be systematically undercounted.\n\nThe justices said earlier this month that a trial in New York testing the legality of the question could move forward, but they temporarily blocked Ross's deposition in the matter.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that Ross's testimony is unnecessary for a ruling on whether the question itself is lawful. It has argued that adding the question is necessary in order to uphold provisions of the Voting Rights Act that protect minority populations.\n\nThe census is generally politically contentious. It is used to determine the number of congressional seats each state has in the House of Representatives, and is only conducted once every 10 years, meaning the political ramifications of the 2020 census will be felt through 2030. Keeping the question on the census could disadvantage Democrats, who tend to live in cities, where immigration populations are higher.\n\nThe census was an issue in this month's midterm races. The state legislative races on the ballot determine which party redraws congressional district lines after the census is completed. That enables the victorious party to draw favorable districts and has proven influential in determining the makeup of Congress.\n\nOpponents of adding the citizenship question have alleged that it was inserted to intentionally undercount certain populations for political purposes. They cite research produced by the Census Bureau, which has found that including the question would lead to a \"higher fieldwork costs and a lower-quality population count.\"\n\nThey have also pointed to a shifting timeline in how Ross has said he came to his decision to include the question. At first, Ross said that his decision was based on a recommendation from the Department of Justice. But documents have surfaced as a result of ongoing litigation showing Ross asked staff members to solicit the recommendation.\n\nThe documents also contradict testimony Ross provided to lawmakers in March saying he was \"not aware\" of speaking to the president or anyone else in the White House about the matter.\n\nIn a document filed by the DOJ in a related case in New York, the government said that in the spring of 2017, Ross discussed the addition of a citizenship question with Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, as well as Jeff Sessions, who was attorney general until last week.\n\nThe Commerce Department has said that the document supplements but does not contradict Ross's testimony.\n\nThe controversy is likely to be probed by House Democrats, who will take control of Congress's lower chamber early next year. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has said it is one of his chief investigative priorities.\n\nThe government requested that the high court hear argument in the case after a federal appeals court ruled that Ross would have to be deposed. The justices placed a temporary halt on the deposition in October. That halt will remain in place until the court reaches a decision in the case, which is expected by late June.\n\nOral argument is scheduled for Feb. 19."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Jordan Malter", "title": "What will cause the next recession?

That puts pressure on new CEO Larry Culp to quickly raise cash and cut debt to keep its debt rating from falling further to sub-investment grade junk status, otherwise known as high-yield.\n\n\"When the market begins to price you to junk status, you have a very limited time to clear that up before you become junk,\" said Thomas Tzitzouris, director and head of fixed income research at Strategas. \"Whether their plan is viable or not, they're running out of time.\"\n\nTzitzouris said GE is not even close to becoming high-yield rated yet, but it will have to prove it deserves to stay investment grade. The company's goal is to regain its A rating after S&P cut it to BBB-plus last month. But should GE become a 'fallen angel,' its debt service costs would rise and it would face a new round of selling pressure on both its stock and bonds.\n\nGE's stock market value has slipped to just below $70 billion, about $300 billion less than where it was in 2005, when it was last America's most valuable company, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nSix weeks ago, Culp replaced John Flannery, who was viewed as too slow at fixing what ailed the conglomerate after he took over from long time CEO Jeff Immelt. Culp was once CEO of Danaher Corp., a science and technology conglomerate\n\nThis week GE moved to sell $3.7 billion of its stake in oil field services company Baker Hughes. On Friday, GE took another step toward its previous announced planned $25 billion reduction in GE Capital assets with the sale of its $1.5 billion healthcare equipment finance portfolio to TIAA Bank.\n\nBut GE needs to continue to show results and too many questions remain, strategists say.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity analysts Friday cut their target on GE shares to $9 from $12, and said they do not \"see GE as inexpensive given its leverage profile... and tail risk associated with GE Capital.\"\n\nGE stock fell more than 2 percent and was trading below $8 Friday. Goldman analysts said it is still unclear how much of a capital infusion GE Capital will need. They said the funding gap could be as much as $20 billion through 2020, which could be filled by asset sales and an equity infusion from its parent.\n\nThe Goldman analysts also said GE's power business sales continue to decline, and they expect 2019 to be another down year.\n\nThese are the type of doubts swirling around both GE's stock and debt.\n\n\"What investors generally don't like is uncertainty and lack of direction. We're transitioning through that period right now,\" Jonathan Duensing, director investment grade corporate debt at Amundi Pioneer. \"The more clarity and the more action the management team can deliver on, that will start to really repair the situation, not only for the business itself but from a confidence standpoint. A lot of this is because investors' confidence has been shaken.\"\n\nCulp said, in an interview this week, that he feels the \"urgency\" to reduce the company's leverage and will do so through asset sales. He said there could be a possible IPO of the company's health care business.\n\n\"We have no higher priority right now than bringing those leverage levels down,\" Culp said Monday in an interview on \"Squawk on the Street\" with CNBC's David Faber.\n\nGE has about $115 billion in debt, which it easily built up when it was one of just a few blue chips with a coveted triple-A standing. But GE lost that crown in 2009. The company has a mix of debt, and has access to $40 billion in revolving credit lines.\n\nOnce beloved for its healthy dividend and earnings consistency, GE found it no longer could afford the quarterly payout and recently reduced it to just a penny to free up cash. GE stock has cratered to levels it reached during the financial crisis. On top of that, the SEC has been investigating its accounting, including the $22 billion non-cash charge it took in the third quarter related to acquisitions in its power business.\n\nGE's ripples were felt across the bond market this week, and its woes are one reason for the jump in spreads in corporate and high-yield debt. Investment grade spreads widened out by about 10 basis points and high yield by about 40 through Thursday.\n\n\"The big fear in the market all year has been that you have a lot of very large BBB rated structures and eventually some of these could be downgraded into high yield. Then comes GE. GE obviously is an ongoing story but now recently they actually got downgraded to BBB. GE is a very large BBB rated structure and it's pricing like high yield,\" said Hans Mikkelsen, head of high grade credit structure at Bank of American Merrill Lynch. Mikkelsen said he's not an expert on GE but the market views it as having downgrade risk.\n\nA big credit sliding into the junk bond world would pressure yields in that market and trigger forced selling in the downgraded credit.\n\n\"Is this the beginning of a downgrade to high yield? My view is no. This is not that story. To me, GE was a single A-rated name that may or may not end up high yield for completely idiosyncratic reasons,\" Mikkelsen said.\n\nMikkelsen said other factors were also moving the market this week, including the steep drop in oil, and the turbulence in bonds of PG&E, the California utility which said earlier this week its insurance may not cover its potential liabilities related to fires. He expects to see the corporate debt market stabilize and firm up into year end.\n\nGE BBB-plus senior debt is now three steps above junk, and it is also part of the largest BBB tier in the $5 trillion investment grade debt market. Half the investment grade market is now rated BBB, another concern in the market.\n\nMikkelsen said GE has about $50 billion in debt that is BBB rated, which is equal to about 0.8 percent of the investment grade market but would be 3.9 percent of the roughly $1.2 trillion high yield market. It is 1.5 percent of BBBs.\n\n\"Our view is that GE is small enough, and the story sufficiently idiosyncratic, to leave other large BBB capital structures relatively little affected as this story plays out,\" Mikkelsen noted.\n\nBut strategists say GE has to clarify where it is going. In the interview, Culp said the troubled power business was close to bottoming.\n\nDuensing also said GE is not representative of trouble for the BBB tier of the market. \"It's not a BBB thing.

Since the 2016 election, both the government and your own internal investigations have revealed that your company failed to adequately protect the data of its 2.2 billion users. Your company also failed to implement protocols to prevent manipulation by foreign adversaries working to undermine America's political system. Both elected officials and the general public have rightfully questioned whether Facebook is capable of regulating its own conduct. According to recent reports, your company hired contractors to retaliate and spread intentionally inflammatory information about people who have criticized Facebook, which, if not properly disclosed, may have campaign finance and other potential legal implications. In addition, the staggering amount of data that Facebook has collected on both its users and people who have not subscribed to or consented to use of the platform, raises concern that the company could improperly or illegally use its vast financial and data resources against government officials and critics seeking to protect the public and our democracy. In light of these concerns, we respectfully request you answer the following questions: 1. To your knowledge, did your company hire any entity \u2013 including, but not limited to research firms and contractors \u2013 to collect or find information to be used in retaliation against people who criticized Facebook, including elected officials who were scrutinizing your company? 2. Did your company hire any entity \u2013 including, but not limited to research firms and contractors \u2013 to spread negative or intentionally inflammatory information in retaliation against people who criticized Facebook, including elected officials who were scrutinizing your company? 3. Did your company \u2013 or any entity affiliated with or hired by your company \u2013 ever use any of the vast financial and data resources available to Facebook in retaliation against people who criticized Facebook, including elected officials who were scrutinizing your company? 4. Did your company \u2013 or any entity affiliated with or hired by your company \u2013 ever seek to conceal information related to foreign interference with the 2016 U.S. election from the public or government investigators? 5. Did your company \u2013 or any entity affiliated with or hired by your company \u2014 ever contact any media outlets with negative or misleading information, or suggest, promote, or amplify negative or misleading social media about your critics, including elected officials scrutinizing your company? 6. How much money have you expended or paid other entities to collect, find, spread or amplify information about people who have criticized Facebook, including elected officials scrutinizing your company? Has any of that spending been publically disclosed? 7. Some of us have requested that the Deputy Attorney General expand the scope of the Department of Justice's existing investigations to include the latest reports that Facebook hired contractors to retaliate and spread negative information about people who criticized the company. If the Department's investigation is expanded to include this recent report, will you commit to co-operating with any investigation into this matter?

Though they've had to adjust to their new realities, they are very glad they made the choice they did. \"In terms of the constraints on lifestyle and requirements to show up every day at 8 a.m. and do things and be on a schedule and have deadlines, I definitely don't miss it at all,\" Justin says.\n\nDon't miss: This couple who retired in their 30s with over $1 million are living their best lives\n\nLike this story?

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is retiring at the end of his current term.\n\nHatch, who currently leads the Finance Committee, said in a statement that the Senate panel \"will be in good hands with Senator Grassley at the helm.\"\n\nHe added: \"Chuck has a proven history of leadership at the committee and knows the ins and outs of its sprawling jurisdiction.

A year ago, Greene announced that Diane Bryant, formerly the head of Intel's data center business and a potential CEO candidate at the chipmaker, was joining Google Cloud as its operating chief. Seven months later she was gone.\n\nHere's Greene's full blog post:\n\nTransitioning Google Cloud after three great years\n\nHello All,\n\nWhen I joined Google full-time to run Cloud in December 2015, I told my family and friends that it would be for two years. Now, after an unbelievably stimulating and productive three years, it's time to turn to the passions I've long had around mentoring and education.\n\nThe mentoring will include investing in and helping female founder CEOs who have engineering or science backgrounds. I want to encourage every woman engineer and scientist to think in terms of building their own company someday. The world will be a better place with more female founder CEOs.\n\nThe work in education will especially be initiatives that combine technology with in-person teaching to make high-quality education that is low-cost, scalable and personalized. When bebop was purchased by Google, I committed all of my proceeds to philanthropy, it is high time to put that money to work!\n\nThomas Kurian, a respected technologist and executive, will be joining Google Cloud on November 26th and transitioning into the Google Cloud leadership role in early 2019. Sundar, Urs and I all interviewed Thomas, and I believe that he'll do an amazing job helping to take Google Cloud to the next level.Thomas has 22 years of experience at Oracle; most recently he was President of Product Development.\n\nI will continue as CEO through January, working with Thomas to ensure a smooth transition. I will remain a Director on the Alphabet board.\n\nThe Google Cloud team has accomplished amazing things over the last three years, and I'm proud to have been a part of this transformative work. We have moved Google Cloud from having only two significant customers and a collection of startups to having major Fortune 1000 enterprises betting their future on Google Cloud, something we should accept as a great compliment as well as a huge responsibility.\n\nWe've built a strong business together\u2014set up by integrating sales, marketing, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Google Apps/G Suite into what is now called Google Cloud.\n\nWe established a training and professional services organization and partnering organizations. We revamped customer engineering and added a team of experts in the Office of the CTO. We also pioneered a way to help enterprises adopt AI through our Advanced Solutions Lab. We built out a full marketing organization that in just three years has received many recognitions including Cannes Lions awards. We set up our industry verticals org where we have achieved massive traction in health, financial services, retail, gaming and media, energy and manufacturing, and transportation. We set up the Cloud ML and the Cloud IoT groups. We acquired Apigee, Kaggle, qwiklabs and several great small startups. Our technology development has been recognized throughout the industry, and Google Cloud is differentiated in security, AI, open hybrid application modernization, G Suite, and many other areas. We are now recognized as a leader in 11 Gartner Magic Quadrants and Forrester Waves.\n\nBut here's what I'm most proud of: the phenomenal team assembled and how we together have built out all of our functions for customer-facing enterprise readiness and engineering enterprise execution. When this journey started, some people would say that Google had great technology but they weren't sure that customers would rely on Google as their enterprise partner. At our recent Google Cloud Next event in San Francisco, we had over 23,000 attendees, representing 10x growth from 2016. With nearly 300 customers speaking about how Google Cloud is helping to transform their businesses, no one was questioning our seriousness or our abilities.\n\nThe cloud space is early and there is an enormous opportunity ahead. I have loved working with everyone. I am especially grateful to all of our customers, partners, and employees for an amazing three years of getting to work with you.\n\n\u2014Diane"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Adam Jeffery", "title": "Photos of a town reduced to ashes by California's deadly Camp Fire", "description": "", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/photos-of-a-town-reduced-to-ashes-by-californias-deadly-camp-fire.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/16/105579140-1542382073527gettyimages-1062031068.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:44:00Z", "content": "The Camp Fire in Butte County has become the deadliest wildfire in California's history as the death toll climbed to 63, with over 600 people still missing.

Take it away, Steve. We're looking forward to it.\n\nSTEVE LIESMAN: Joe, thanks very much. I am here live from the Federal Reserve with newly installed Vice-Chairman Richard Clarida. He took office in mid-September. Thanks for joining us Mr. Chairman.\n\nRICHARD CLARIDA: Thank you.\n\nLIESMAN: I think the place to start is what's going on in markets these days. It seems like it's been down a lot. Maybe 4%, 5% off the highs. What kind of signal do you get economically from these gyrations in the market?\n\nCLARIDA: You know, so far, Steve, I don't think there's any clear signal. You know, it's hard even after the fact sometimes to attribute any given move in markets. You know, year to date, the stock market is up and there's some volatility. So I think right now there's no clear signal that I would take from it.\n\nLIESMAN: We have several people who are coming on our air these days saying that the \u2013 this is the result of the market thinking the fed the going too far too fast.\n\nCLARIDA: Well first of all, Steve, the Fed began hiking rates three years ago. And so it's been a very gradual cycle. You know, the economy is growing north of 3%. Unemployment's at a 50-year low almost. And so I think also right now, you think at the policy rate we set, the federal funds rate is now just barely above the rate of inflation for the first time in a decade. SO i wouldn't agree with that.\n\nLIESMAN: Do you see any signs that the economy is slowing? You've been raising interest rates for three years. Is it having an effect in slowing the economy?\n\nCLARIDA: The economy this year as I said is going to be growing at a pace we haven't seen in a decade. Going forward, you have to look at a lot of trends including the global economy, I think, is something they have to pay attention to. Some evidence that it's slowing. So I don't see that now. But I think broadly we're going to set a policy that we think will help us achieve the mandate given to us by congress. We've got a strong labor market. We want to keep that. And we want to keep inflation around 2%.\n\nLIESMAN: November is right around the time you start thinking about forecasts for next year. Could you give us your outlook next year, both when it comes to interest rates and when it comes to growth?\n\nCLARIDA: Thank you, Steve. You know, the Fed, we'll be going through our forecasting round at the December meeting. I don't want to front run that either \u2013\n\nLIESMAN: It's okay \u2013 you can't do that -- it's fine.\n\nCLARIDA: Of course. But in terms of rates, I think it's important to note As I said that this process has been gradual. I think that served the fed well. If you look at the S.E.P. projections that we released in September, they show a range for continued projection next year some officials seeing two or three hikes. What I want to emphasize, Steve, to you and your viewers is at least from my perspective: we're at a point now we really need to be especially data dependent. The economy's doing well. We're looking for signals from the labor market, from inflation, to get a sense of both the pace and the destination for policy. So this is very much in data dependent mode right now.\n\nLIESMAN: Is that a shift from where we were? Were we at a place where it was kind of like we needed to get rates up?\n\nCLARIDA: Exactly.\n\nLIESMAN: And have we now reached the point where we could -- I guess the best thing is sort of come through the woods and then sort of take a look around now?\n\nCLARIDA: I think you said that very well. You know, I wasn't here three years ago, but three years ago under Chair Yellen's leadership, the Fed decided that it was time to get away from zero. And I have to imagine that everyone around that table agreed that ultimately rates needed to be above zero. Those are emergency interest rates. And so, I think in that point data dependence was perhaps a little bit less relevant because there was full agreement to get the policy rate up towards a more normal level. As you move into the range of policy that, by some estimates is close to neutral, then with the economy doing well, it is appropriate to sort of shift the emphasis towards being more data dependent. I think Chair Powell the other day made the analogy in Dallas, you know, about if you're in a darkroom, especially without your shoes on, you want to go slow so you don't stub your toe. So I think data dependence makes sense right here.\n\nLIESMAN: You said move into the range. Are we at neutral now? Are we -- how far from neutral are we?\n\nCLARIDA: Well, as you know as a student of the Fed, we plot our long-run policy rate projections four times a year. And as of September, the long run neutral policy by members of the committee was in a range of somewhere between 2.5% and 3.5%. So currently the policy rate is below that range. But as you can tell, it's getting closer towards the vicinity of that range.\n\nLIESMAN: You believe we need to at least get to that neutral rate.\n\nCLARIDA: I do. I think certainly where the economy is today and my projection for -- and the fed's projection of where it's going, I think being at neutral would make sense.\n\nLIESMAN: We had Mark Zandi on our air the other day.\n\nCLARIDA: Right. Mark's a good fellow.\n\nLIESMAN: I hope you still think that after I say this. He said: the Federal Reserve has never engineered a soft landing for the economy once we've gone below the neutral rate of unemployment or the natural rate of unemployment. Is that -- it possible \u2013 is there any history on your side that you could engineer this soft landing through?\n\nCLARIDA: Yeah, and Steve, I would argue that there is if you go back to the rate hike cycle that began in 1994, very aggressive, I mean the funds rate went up 300 basis points in about 12 months. And the economy continued to expand for another five-plus years. So that's an example of a cycle where you had a normalization of policy and the economy continued to expand for a number of years. I would point out another thing we've never seen, which we've never seen an expansion that lasts as long as this one likely will if it continues through next summer. So history's useful, but you can't be handcuffed to it.\n\nLIESMAN: You talked earlier about global weakness. How much of a threat does that represent to the U.S. expansion?\n\nCLARIDA: Well I think, Steve, it's important for your viewers to understand that although our mandate is full employment and price to building in the U.S., to achieve that we have to understand and factor in the global economy. And there is some evidence of global slowing. I think it's early days. You know, the IMF has marked down its global outlook a bit. But certainly, at least speaking for myself, that's something that is going to be relevant as I think about the outlook for the U.S. economy. You know, because it impacts big parts of the economy through trade and through capital markets and the like.\n\nLIESMAN: Two other issues that are out there: Taxes and trade, or tariffs. How are you factoring in what the tax cut will do the U.S. economy? Will it create, do you think, a permanent change in potential growth?\n\nCLARIDA: Well, I believe that we have seen the bottom in productivity growth raise. I think we've had some pickup in productivity. It's hard right now, Steve, to see how much of this is going to be sustained, but sort of put me in the camp of being an optimist on this. I think the legislation is one piece of that by lowering the cost of capital. I think there's innovation in the economy that's beginning to be adopted. And so, you know, productivity is important, but it's very notoriously difficult to make forecast about inflection points. But put me in the optimistic camp on that.\n\nLIESMAN: So do you have another number for potential growth that's above the 2% that everybody else has?\n\nCLARIDA: I'm in the camp that thinks that we have seen a rebound of productivity growth. Again, I'm going to look at the evidence to see how I revise up my forecast. Also near term, another important factor is growth in our labor force and employment. And we've had a pickup in labor force participation which is also at least now boosting the supply side of the economy.\n\nLIESMAN: Are there going to be enough workers though to fuel higher potential growth in the economy?\n\nCLARIDA: I think for several years there certainly could be. Because participation rates among prime age adults are still a point or two below where they were 15 years ago. So eventually demographic factors are going to kick in and eventually labor force growth is going to fall to about 0.5% a year. This year, for example, Steve, labor force growth \u2013 or at least I should say ours worked. And the business sector is up 2%. So I think there's still room to run the labor market.\n\nLIESMAN: I want to read you something you wrote in a speech earlier. Maybe you can help me understand it. \"As I look ahead, if strong growth and robust employment gains were to continue in 2019 and be accompanied by a material rise in actual and expected inflation, that circumstance would indicate to me that additional policy normalization might well be required.\" So what is it you expect when it comes to a policy and what would cause you to do more, what would cause you to do less? -- It's a little hard without some of the numbers here.\n\nCLARIDA: Understood. Well, I don't want to specifically get into my individual dot on the dot plot. But what I was trying to do in that speech and in talking to you and others is to give a sense about my own individual reaction function, how I would react to surprising data on either side. I don't expect right now for there to be a big pickup in inflation next year or certainly inflation expectations. But were that to happen, that would incline me to think about a need to adjust policy some more. It goes was the other way, too \u2013 if we get a slowdown, which I don't expect, I'd have to calibrate the other way.\n\nLIESMAN: So you're not among those who see the need for the Fed right now to go above neutral?\n\nCLARIDA: Well, we're certainly not at neutral yet. And I -- again, my view is in this range of the uncertainty of neutral, I don't think it's particularly for my individual perspective to think so much about overshooting something that I'm trying to estimate right now.\n\nLIESMAN: Apologies to the producers. I have one more question I need to ask you before you go.\n\nCLARIDA: Sure. Yes, please.\n\nLIESMAN: It's an unusual situation now. In the years I've been -- not having an economist in the chairman position. And you're a kind of pretty well known monetary policy expert. How does that dynamic work with the Chairman and you being the guy who sort of knows all the equations and the aggressions and the R-Star stuff and the formulas?\n\nCLARIDA: Thank you for asking that. Chair Powell and I an excellent working relationship. You know, monetary policy is really about the practice. My work was in economic theory. That's one input. You know, Chair Powell's background as a policy maker, also has been a Fed Governor since 2012 -- has a lot more experience than I do. So we work very well together. I have things I bring to the discussion. You know, Governors Quarles and Brainard and the Reserve Bank Presidents. It's a wonderful group of colleagues to work with and we all bring things to the discussion.\n\nLIESMAN: Richard Clarida, thanks for joining us.\n\nCLARIDA: Thank you.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nJennifer Dauble\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4721\n\nm: 201.615.2787\n\ne: jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.com\n\nEmma Martin\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4713\n\nm: 551.275.6221\n\ne: emma.martin@nbcuni.com"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Deirdre Bosa", "title": "Airbnb booked more than $1 billion in third quarter revenue", "description": "Airbnb is expected to hold its initial public offering as early as next year.

They do this using data a different way.\n\nAlthough banks have access to a small business's deposits and bank accounts, they often can't see the entire picture of a company's sales. PayPal and Square on the other hand own access to every transaction.\n\n\"The magic of this whole equation is data,\" said Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration during the Obama years. \"They have much better knowledge of when the small business really needs the money, everything they sell goes through their payment software, and they have more collateral.\"\n\nThe tech companies often shun what has been a barrier for small businesses with traditional banks: Credit scores. PayPal said it looks at the health of the business based on sales coming through its payment network. It can see which times of the year are busiest, the overall health of the business and compare that to an industry's or geography's health, Esch said.\n\nThat algorithm has improved over the years. When PayPal Working Capital started five years ago, it had a $20,000 cap on its loans. That amount has since increased that amount to $125,000 for the first two PayPal Working Capital loans, while any subsequent loans max out at $200,000. PayPal Business Loans range between $5,000 to $500,000.\n\nA former senior vice president of payments for Bank of America, Esch said he was shocked that PayPal was seeing demand for loans as big as half a million dollars.\n\n\"The surprise for me is how high up the demand goes for these loans,\" Esch said. \"I would have thought they would have been comfortably served by traditional system, yet a lot of business owners coming to us have sales in the multi-million dollar range.\"\n\nHow they collect the loan payments is also different.\n\nInstead of charging a fixed interest rate, Square and PayPal automatically skim a certain percentage off the top of each transaction without the merchant needing to file additional paperwork. In the case of PayPal, the vendor needs to be on the platform for at least three months in order to provide enough sales activity for a loan to be approved.\n\nEsch said collecting the loan repayments as sales come through, instead of setting payment dates on the 15th of the month or another arbitrary day, alleviates a burden for merchants and makes the loans less risky.\n\n\"It's a high frequency repayment,\" Esch said. \"For traditional loans, they have to send in payments when they might be looking at pile of bills. For us, it's every time the merchant makes a sale.\"\n\nThe repayment arrangement, however, can make it hard to compare interest rate options. PayPal and Square outline their fees upfront but they work on a case by case basis. These loans can take as little as five months, or as many as 15 years to pay back.\n\n\"I think there are cases where people are taking on loans where they don't really understand how much it's costing them. They aren't able to contrast and compare between a bank, a fintech, and Square,\" said Mills, author of forthcoming book \"Fintech, Small Business & the American Dream\". \"They should be able to make apples to apples comparison.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Matthew J.

I'm starting to agree with you.\"\n\nFed officials need to swallow their pride, Cramer said, though he added he did like Clarida's reference to the Fed being \"data dependent.\" Clarida did also say that the central bank is close to the point of being \"neutral\" on interest rates. But Cramer said any notion that a gradual path higher for the cost of borrowing money is being prudent, is the Fed \"fooling themselves\" and \"being rash.\"\n\nThe Fed may be starting to come around a bit, Cramer acknowledged, but he said Clarida and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell haven't been around as long as he has. Cramer added it should not be held against him that he's on television. He said if he were an academic, the Fed would listen to him.\n\nCramer said he should have spoken out sooner in 2007 about the Fed being on the wrong track and risking the economy. He said he vowed to himself, after his infamous \"They know nothing\" rant drew jeers from Fed officials, not to remain quiet in the future. He said that's why he's been so vocal lately. He said he doesn't think the economy is at risk of another Great Recession like in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But he said the current economy could really drag and American jobs could be lost if the Fed doesn't change its thinking.\n\n\"It's Cramer one; Fed nothing from 2007,\" Cramer said Friday. \"Their record is not as good as mine.\" He added that central bankers need to \"shape up\" and \"stop being ideological.\"\n\nOn his \"Mad Money\" show Thursday evening, Cramer said CEOs across industries have been telling him, not for attribution, that they're worried about a slowdown in the U.S. economy.\n\nCramer has been warning investors since October about a two-pronged, man-made slowdown in the economy, fueled by concerns over the Fed hiking interest rates too quickly and the Trump administration's trade tariffs. Cramer said the central bank probably needs to raise rates next month as the market expects, but it should pause after that. Neither the Fed nor the White House was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe stock market has been under pressure and prone to more volatility since Powell, in early October, said rates were a \"long way\" from neutral, a level where they're neither restrictive nor accommodative. The current range for the central bank's benchmark rate is 2 percent to 2.25 percent after increasing it three times so far in 2018."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Darla Mercado", "title": "Here are your new income tax brackets for 2019", "description": "The IRS has updated its individual income tax brackets for the new year.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell helped stoke market volatility in mid-October when he said the central bank remains \"a long way\" from neutral, an indication that it would be more aggressive with policy than investors had anticipated.\n\nWith his comments Friday, Clarida becomes the second central banker in as many days to suggest that neutral isn't so far away. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, in a speech delivered in Barcelona, said Thursday that the federal funds rate is \"not too far\" from neutral.\n\nClarida's remarks \"continued the process of softening the Fed's message, emphasizing the need for the Fed to be data-dependent as interest rates move close to the lower end of the range of estimates for the neutral rate,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note.\n\nClarida noted that the most recent projections from Federal Open Market Committee members indicate that the long-run funds rate projection is 3 percent. The current funds rate target range is 2 percent to 2.25 percent, with markets widely expecting the FOMC to approve another quarter-point increase in December.\n\n\"I think being at neutral would make sense,\" he said.\n\nIn the October interview with PBS, Powell said the Fed may actually want to go past neutral if it sees a need to stop the economy from overheating.\n\nWhile Powell's comments helped rankle markets, Clarida said \"there is no clear signal\" from the markets about the direction of the economy. He also defended the Fed's actions from criticism that it is moving too quickly with rates and could harm the momentum seen over the past two years.\n\n\"The Fed began hiking rates almost three years ago, and so it's been a very gradual cycle,\" he said. \"The economy this year is growing north of 3 percent, unemployment' s at a 50-year low almost, and so I think also right now the policy that we set, the federal funds rate, is just barely above the rate of inflation for the first time in a decade. So I wouldn't agree with that.\"\n\nWhile he said the U.S. economy continues to grow, he did not a slowdown globally that could factor into the Fed's decision-making.\n\n\"The economy this year as I said is going to be growing at a pace we haven't seen in a decade.

The firm's loading estimate suggests that U.S. imports of Saudi crude oil could soon fall toward the lowest levels on record.\n\nSending fewer barrels to the United States means U.S. crude stockpiles are more likely to drop, and shrinking inventories tend to push up oil prices. It's a tactic the Saudis used last year to amplify their main strategy for draining a global crude glut and propping up the market: cutting output alongside fellow OPEC members, Russia and several other producers.\n\nThe maneuver shows how Saudi Arabia's efforts to manage the oil market have evolved. During the 2014-2016 oil price crash, traders closely monitored weekly U.S. stockpile data to see whether oversupply was shrinking or growing. As the world's biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia realized it could nudge the data in a direction that boosts the cost of crude.\n\n\"It worked so well in 2017 for [the Saudis] to cut flows to the U.S. because people could see the inventories dropping because U.S. data is so timely and transparent,\" said Matt Smith, head of commodities research at ClipperData.\n\n\"The markets have become more transparent through tanker tracking,\" Smith said. \"You can see those changes being implemented more, and [the Saudis are] aware of that.\"\n\nNovember's drop in Saudi barrels bound for the United States follows a six-week oil market rout that saw prices plunge 25 percent into bear market territory. It also comes after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih warned on Monday that OPEC, Russia and several other producers may soon launch a fresh round of price-boosting output cuts.\n\nShortly after Falih issued the warning, Trump took to Twitter to voice his disapproval with that plan.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia may not be swayed by Trump's pressure campaign. In recent days, Smith and other energy analysts have claimed that Trump essentially duped OPEC and its allies into raising output earlier this year.\n\nThe analysts say Trump's threats to impose harsh sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third-biggest producer, played a part in convincing the producers to stop capping output and start pumping more oil. But Trump ultimately allowed some of Iran's biggest customers to keep importing its oil, which meant the oil squeeze the alliance feared never materialized.\n\nConsequently, the producers put even more oil into a market that is swinging toward oversupply, giving traders another reason to sell off crude futures and push prices lower."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Laura Galligan", "title": "Here's the most dangerous place to do your Black Friday shopping", "description": "One in 3 consumers who shop on their phones admit to having done so from behind the wheel, according to a new survey from Root Insurance.

That could happen \u2026 [+6030 chars]", "fulltext": "Stacey Abrams' campaign is preparing an unprecedented legal challenge in the unresolved Georgia governor's race that could leave the state's Supreme Court deciding whether to force another round of voting.\n\nThe Democrat's longshot strategy relies on a statute that's never been used in such a high-stakes contest. It is being discussed as Georgia elections officials appear to be on the cusp of certifying Republican Brian Kemp as the winner of a bitterly fought campaign that's been marred by charges of electoral malfeasance.\n\nTop Stacey Abrams advisers outlined her prospective case to The Associated Press, stressing that the Democratic candidate hasn't finalized a decision about whether to proceed once state officials certify Republican Brian Kemp as the victor. That could happen as early as Friday evening.\n\nAllegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams' campaign chairwoman, is overseeing a team of almost three-dozen lawyers who in the coming days will draft the petition, along with a ream of affidavits from voters and would-be voters who say they were disenfranchised. Abrams would then decide whether to go to court under a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \"misconduct, fraud or irregularities ... sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\"\n\nThe legal team is \"considering all options,\" Lawrence-Hardy said, including federal court remedies. But the state challenge is the most drastic. And some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statutes that set a high bar for the court to intervene.\n\nShe already faces a narrow path to the governor's mansion. Unofficial returns show Kemp with about 50.2 percent of more than 3.9 million votes. That puts him about 18,000 votes above the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a Dec. 4 runoff. The Associated Press is not calling the race until state officials certify the results.\n\nAbrams would assert that enough irregularities occurred to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 Georgians either had their ballots thrown out or were not allowed to vote.\n\nLawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams will weigh legal considerations alongside her belief that many of her backers \u2014 particularly minority and poorer voters who don't regularly go to the polls \u2014 heeded her call to participate and ran into barriers.\n\n\"These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,\" said Lawrence-Hardy, who was among the army of lawyers who worked on the Bush v. Gore presidential election dispute in 2000. \"It's just a much bigger responsibility. I feel like our mandate has blossomed. ... Maybe this is our moment.\"\n\nKemp, who served as the state's chief elections officer until two days after the election when he resigned as secretary of state and declared victory, has maintained that any uncounted ballots won't change the outcome. His campaign has called Abrams' legal maneuvers so far a \"disgrace to democracy\" and an attempt to \"count illegal votes.\"\n\nThe circumstances leave Abrams, a 44-year-old rising Democratic star, with a tough decision. The former state lawmaker became a national political celebrity with her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor. Her strategy of running as an unapologetic liberal who attracts new voters to the polls resonated in a rapidly changing state. Yet Abrams also must consider her own political future and the consequences of a protracted legal fight she might not win.\n\nAll of that is playing out against the backdrop of Kemp's unabashed embrace of President Donald Trump's nationalism.\n\nSince Election Day, Abrams campaign workers have transitioned from get-out-the-vote efforts to helping voters determine whether their ballots were counted and documenting reported problems. The idea is to assemble a body of evidence to support the claim that the problems could account for Kemp's 18,000-vote margin above the runoff trigger.\n\nAffidavits from poll workers reviewed by the AP describe long lines that discouraged people from voting, poll workers failing to offer provisional ballots to people who didn't show up on the rolls or were at the wrong polling place and election equipment that froze and had to be rebooted.\n\nCathy Cox, a Democrat who served as secretary of state from 1999 through 2007 and is now the dean of Mercer University's law school, said Georgia law puts a heavy burden on candidates such as Abrams who ask a court to intervene.\n\n\"I would say with pretty great confidence there has probably never been an election ... without some irregularity, where some poll worker did not make some mistake,\" Cox said in an interview. The key, she said, is proving someone erred to the point that it could change the outcome.\n\nLawrence-Hardy agreed the law requires a quantitative analysis. She said Abrams' team doesn't have a list of 18,000 disenfranchised voters. The evidence, she said, would consist of hundreds, if not thousands of such examples, along with data analysis of projected lost votes based on other problems, such as a lack of paper ballots at precincts where voting machines broke down and voters left long lines.\n\nCox said courts must attempt to apply a nonpartisan standard of \"doubt\" to the election. \"Would a reasonable person have a reason to doubt this election? Not would a hard-core partisan Democrat doubt a partisan Republican opponent,\" she said.\n\nAbrams and voting rights activists have argued for months that Kemp mismanaged the elections system as secretary of state, with Abrams often calling Kemp \"an architect of suppression.\"\n\nUnder Georgia law, Abrams could file a challenge against Kemp or his successor as the secretary of state. The challenge must be filed within five days of certification in a trial court of the county where the chosen defendant resides. The defendant has between five and 10 days to respond, and the presiding judge sets a hearing within 20 days after that deadline, a calendar that could push a dispute well beyond what would have been a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nIf the judge determines the election is so defective that it casts doubt on the results, the judge can declare the election invalid and call a new vote among the same candidates. Cox called that \"the real extreme remedy.\"\n\nA more \"surgical\" course, she said, would be to affirm irregularities but only order that certified results be reopened and recertified once those problems are remedied. The judge could then declare a winner or order a runoff if the results are close enough.\n\nThe judge could also declare a winner after hearing the evidence, but Cox said that's unlikely because the case will probably hinge on uncounted votes and there's no way to know before a count which candidate won those votes.\n\nOnce the judge rules, the loser has 10 days to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Ruth Umoh", "title": "15 great holiday gifts under $25 for 2018", "description": "", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/15-great-holiday-gifts-under-25-for-2018.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/12/105569381-1542054986773presents.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:23:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "There's no need to break the bank shopping for presents this holiday season.

If you choose to use anything, please attribute to CNBC and Christine Tan.\n\nChristine Tan(Christine): Uotani San, thank you so much for talking to me. Now, in 2014 you were appointed President and CEO of Shiseido. How does it feel like to be the first outsider brought in to jumpstart a traditional Japanese company?\n\nMasahiko Uotani(Masahiko): Well, I feel it's very challenging, and I really enjoy that right now. But when I made the decision, it was not easy. I had worked for Coca Cola for 18 years, as President and Chairman of Japan, and I was a little, kind of exhausted, you know doing a lot of business trips and uh working everyday looking at the numbers, numbers, numbers. My wife was actually sick and tired of it too. So when they came to talk to me, \"We want to appoint you as President and CEO of Shiseido\", I couldn't say yes immediately. I said to them, you know, give me three weeks to think about it, I don't know if I really would do it or not. I needed to get the approval from my wife.\n\nChristine: You needed to get approval from your wife. What did she say?\n\nMasahiko: Well, she was not willing to accept that idea in the beginning.\n\nChristine: What changed her mind?\n\nMasahiko: Well, the free product samples. (laughs)\n\nChristine: That was an upside to some.\n\nMasahiko: Joking. But you know, well I thought, this is a traditional Japanese company with 140 years of history. I thought my mission as a business person is to transform a traditional Japanese company to be a real global competitive company.\n\nChristine: Shiseido is a 146 year-old Japanese beauty company and it started out with a western-style pharmacy, then went to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and skin care. What was behind the company's success in the early years?\n\nMasahiko: From the beginning, Shiseido has built the combination, or I would call it \"hybrid model\" of Japanese values and Western values. The founder started the business with Western type of pharmacy only 5 years after major revolution, from old days of Japan to new days of Japan. Then second person, who was the son of the founder (Shinzo Fukuhara), started the cosmetics business. He studied in the U.S. at 18 years, when he was young, it was even before 1900. So from the beginning in Shiseido, we had that sort of mindset to nurture what we have in Japan and bring in new values from other parts of the world, combining it and creating new values, that's our DNA.\n\nChristine: When you took over, sales, growth and profitability were declining. The company itself was struggling and you were losing a lot of domestic business. How did the company lose its way? What were some of the problems it was facing?\n\nMasahiko: Well, as what happened to many other Japanese companies, you know the famous \"lost two decades\" of the bubble economy burst, it motivated many of the Japanese management to be really internally focused, and being more efficient. In other words, cost reduction was a huge kind of strategic initiative for many, many companies.\n\nChristine: So it lost touch with the market?\n\nMasahiko: Yeah, in a sense. Well, I mean the markets were changing very quickly with the younger generation of consumers coming in, so you really have to change yourself to adapt to the new kind of trends in the market. So they were a little behind that.\n\nChristine: As CEO, you laid out vision 2020. What were some of the tough decisions you had to make to boost sales?\n\nMasahiko: I had to really increase investments to build the brands. We are a consumer business company, B2C. So, what is the value of the company I have to grow? And the value of the company includes brand values which are intangible assets, just what I learned from Coca Cola. Coke physically is not a big company, in terms of the number of employees, in terms of the number of assets, physical assets. But it's a growing intangible asset which is the brand, same for Shiseido. We have to really build the brands. So we need investments to do that. In order to get there, my first decision after three months was to build a new R&D center, out of Tokyo \u2013 a $400 million investment that is creating innovations, innovation capabilities. Innovation is actually part of building brand values. People obviously choose our brand because differentiated values with what's new, what's exciting, that's important. So, I started from the innovation side and then went into investing in brands which is communication, advertising, promotions, merchandising the stores. Then, I shifted to supply chains, now we are building two new plants in Japan.\n\nChristine: What about the product line-up? Did you have to revamp the entire product line-up? Did you take out everything on the shelf and put in new ones?\n\nMasahiko: Uh, not necessarily, but actually (in) our analysis, we concluded we had too many brands, too many products, so we had to really start focusing on key brands - 6 brands in Japan. We decided out of many brands, we had to streamline some of the brands and businesses. Yes, we did it. At the same time, we had to work on the rebuilding of our organization, particularly in China, the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In Asia you know, we didn't even have any regional head office, so we put that regional head office in Singapore. By doing that we were able to attract many people, talents you know in that region. So, building new organization with new talents was a huge step for us.\n\nChristine Tan: As the first outside CEO, it was natural for people within the organization to feel a little bit apprehensive about the sort of changes you were going to make. How did you eventually win your staff over?\n\nMasahiko: Talking to people. In order to change a company, I believe we have to change the culture of the company: how we work, what we do. It's culture. In order to change the culture, you have to work on changing people's mindset and behaviours. In order to change the mindset of the people, you have to really show the vision and you have to show the analysis: why are we not doing well before and how are we going to solve that? Where we are going? We set the vision called Vision 2020, a six year program. We went to talk to people like beauty consultants who are working on the ground everyday as touchpoints with our customers. They know actually what's not going well, what's the value we can provide, what are the issues we are facing. In the beginning, when I went to talk to people in department stores, they said, we need more product samples. We are selling prestige luxury kind of product, which are very expensive like $100. Therefore, we want to give product samples for our consumers, our customers to test. But we don't do that enough. Okay, so you know, why don't you let them get more? \"Oh well, I have to get approval from the head office.\" So this indicates not only do we need more product samples for the customers, but our culture, the hierarchy, the decision making process of the company must be very centralized at decision-making, which I don't believe is going to work anymore. To put focus on our consumers, you have to be much closer to the market.\n\nChristine Tan: So you cut down the layers of bureaucracy. Have you cut down the hierarchy within the company?\n\nMasahiko: Not only just\u2026 you know, for example in Japan, where we were struggling before, when we had (our) headquarters and local sales companies merge into one, and people started working together. People who know the markets and the customers, and the people who are planning for the products and the brands, they are now staying together under one company, which is making a big change.\n\nChristine Tan: Well investors and markets seem to like your restructuring story. Looking at your 2008 earnings this year, what's going to drive most of that growth for you? Which markets?\n\nMasahiko: In terms of categories, prestige brands, luxury brands are driving the growth. In terms of markets, it's China. But you know, it's not only just the China market, I would call it the Chinese consumers who buy our products in China, and at the same time, they travel a lot, 130 million people travelled outside of China last year. And they go to airports, so we have now good merchandising now at the duty free shops in the airports. So it's what we call cross-border marketing.\n\nChristine: So, China is a big factor for you, because sales in China grew 20% last year. Has it become your fastest growing international market?\n\nMasahiko: Among the markets, yes, China is the fastest growing market for us.\n\nChristine : How fast do you see China growing for you this year?\n\nMasahiko: It's even accelerating the growth, higher than 20% yeah. Yes China is becoming the number 2 market next to Japan.\n\nChristine: When it comes to products, are you tailoring a specific range just for the Chinese consumer market?\n\nMasahiko: Getting there.\n\nChristine: Getting there? How soon could it happen?\n\nMasahiko: We're getting there. It is going to happen. You know, we expanded our R&D centers in Beijing and Shanghai, we have made them even bigger. So the R&Ds are going to really see to specific kind of needs in China and we're going to custom make products. Not only that, we are now working with big e-commerce companies and they are telling us based on their data, what are the specific needs they have identified, and we are trying to work with them to have even more customizable products.\n\nChristine: (With) so much reliance on the Chinese consumer right now, are you worried about a territorial dispute that's always been looming in the background between China and Japan? If that breaks out again, could this impact your sales? Are you worried?\n\nMasahiko: Well, we always have to obviously, get ourselves to be prepared for any risk - political risk, consumer (risk), reputation risk, whatever. It's one of them. I do hope it's not going to happen again, and it's not simply negatively impacting our business, it's not good for those two countries. I want the two countries to obviously be building good friendship. So, yes and no. If you ask me if I'm worried, I'm worried but I'm a bit more of an optimist. A lot of people are coming to Japan, you know 10 million people from China coming and a lot of people now are going to China. So among the ordinary people I would say, it's really friendly interaction happening.\n\nChristine: You worried about this so-called trade dispute we're having all over the world between the US, Europe, Japan, China? Are you worried about what's happening on the geopolitical side?\n\nMasahiko: If that lasts long term, that's going to influence consumer psychology. Just as a direct impact by increasing the trade tariff, we don't get the huge impact from that. So, I'm not worried a lot, but if that sort of relationship continues, you know people's mindset becomes very pessimistic, and maybe consumption activity and spending activity would be affected negatively. So that means economically, it's going to slow down. And then the business, not only our business, but everybody's business is going to be negatively affected. So, I hope it is going to be over soon.\n\nChristine: Well, in the process you're upping your R&D staff, you're increasing technology spend. What's the next big skin care technology you're working on?\n\nMasahiko: Well, a lot, new ingredients, new formulations. For example, the one we announced last year is to improve your wrinkles. At the same time, we stepped back and thought, we are now only working in what we call cosmetics. There are so many other kinds of categories to grow in, like you know surgeries. Cosmetic surgery is one of the areas which are growing in Korea, in China and now in Japan even in the Western countries. I don't think we're going to be there, but we thought, can we create a new kind of category in-between? For people who have some problems themselves, like scar conditions, spots, wrinkles, people want to cover that. Therefore, we found an interesting technology in the U.S. - artificial skin, and it's not requiring any surgeries. It's just putting cosmetics on your face. But it's not making you look just nice - just like having a serum. It is not medicine but it is a tube of some liquid, you just mix it and put your face where you want to cover, where you want to hide like maybe spots, and it creates artificial skin on your face, and you look younger.\n\nChristine: What's the potential like for the commercialization of this \"second-skin\" technology?\n\nMasahiko: Well yes, we're going to make sure that it's going to be commercialized, maybe in the next two, three years. Potential as far as we have surveyed so far, potential is going to be really big.\n\nChristine: Artificial intelligence seems to be the big talk these days when it comes to revolutionizing the skincare and beauty industry. And you bought a tech startup called MatchCo, which specialized in this particular area. Is this the next big bet you're taking when it comes to skin care, beauty and artificial intelligence?\n\nMasahiko: Yeah, that's what we believe, because market is becoming kind of saturated anywhere. Where will you go? There are so many products available, new brands are coming up. So consumers particularly younger generations of consumers are looking for, 'What's good for me? Can you really make something only for me, because I'm different from other people?\" Therefore, we look at this opportunity as new opportunities, personalized, custom-made kind of opportunities.\n\nMatchCo technology was developed by three entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. We talked to them and we bought (the company), and then we sent our R&D people there to work together, to develop sort of a new foundation. So consumers send their information, we capture that and come up with a perfectly matching color of foundation for that person specifically, and we send it to her. So it's a D2C model, direct to consumer.\n\nChristine: So, is this basically a strategy to capture the growing millennial market?\n\nMasahiko: Yes, it's a part of our (strategy) to capture the millennial market as well.\n\nChristine: It's become more innovative, more tech savvy.\n\nMasahiko: Detail oriented, yes.\n\nChristine: In the last couple of years, sales in your Japanese home market have been flagging, but I understand things are picking up sales are growing, is a meaningful recovery now in place in Japan?\n\nMasahiko: Yes, oh yes. Well, you know Japan business has turned around in the last few years. It is growing double-digit, which is good news for us. Obviously, it's driven by consumers, including Chinese consumers coming to Japan and buying our products, that's one factor. What's really important for me is we are increasing our sales with local Japanese consumers as well which is a big recovery.\n\nChristine: How did you manage to do that? What did you have to do to boost sales at home?\n\nMasahiko: Because the market is saturated, we have to be visibly showing what's new, what's exciting, what are the new values to them - more \"added\" values are very important. At the same time, we have to communicate that through media, through the stores and through our beauty consultants. So, organizational capability is really key for us.\n\nChristine: So you're number 1 in Japan now?\n\nMasahiko: Yes.\n\nChristine: And you continue to be?\n\nMasahiko: Oh yes, yes. Our aspiration is not only what's the position for Japan anymore, our aspiration is what we can do in the global markets, not only just in Japan. My aspiration clearly is to be a very significant player in the global markets. Top three in a prestige beauty company in the world by leveraging what we have built in our heritage in Japan.\n\nChristine: You're 64 years old, born in the region of Kansai Japan. You graduated with an MBA from Columbia University. You were basically retired. You had worked for these global consumer companies like Coca Cola and Kraft, before Shiseido has actually handpicked you to be the CEO in 2014, now you're in-charge of over 46,000 employees within Shiseido itself. How would you describe your leadership and your management style?\n\nMasahiko: My style is to be close to people. What I have worked in the companies like Coca Cola, I really thought about what is the core value of the company? It's a people business. Delivering brands to consumers, you need a lot of new ideas. I want people to be motivated and trying to add values to the society. So, I think my style is, as I said, without significant hierarchy. I don't like hierarchy. (Christine: You don't like hierarchy) I don't like that. I have no problem to go to talk to our beauty consultants, (who are) working hard every day.\n\nChristine: And how often do you do that?\n\nMasahiko: Oh, I do that almost every week. This week, I went to our branch in Osaka, because you know there was a typhoon that hit the Osaka areas. I spoke to our people there and then I went to the plant, to talk to our people working in the plants, and then I'm here. So I don't just stay in my office.\n\nChristine: One of the things you mandated as CEO was to make sure that English was spoken in your main head office in Tokyo. Why was that an important part of your transformation process?\n\nMasahiko: Well, to make the company really global, communication is indispensable. As I said, to have different background people coming (together) to talk and having communication motivates people to do something really new. If you don't understand what the other person is saying, then how can I expect them to work together? So, communication, communication, communication. Having translators, interpreters was the practice we had in the past, I think there's a limit. Now, people are shifting to -- I have to do something, I have to tell something myself in English. And English has been mandated as a common language for the entire Shiseido head office in Tokyo from October 1st this year.\n\nChristine: So, are we just talking about spoken English or emails also with English?\n\nMasahiko: Emails and all documents are going to be written in English. And if we have only even one person who is not Japanese speaking in the meeting, everyone has to be speaking in English. That's a rule.\n\nChristine: Well, within Shiseido itself for a long time and in any typical Japanese company, there's lifetime employment, not to mention promotion is always based on seniority. As CEO of Shiseido, are you trying to change that?\n\nMasahiko: Oh we are changing that. (Christine: How so?) Well you know, seniority simply doesn't make sense if that person is the right person for the position. So what's very important for us is, when you really think about a position, who is the right person to deliver the mission of the position? It doesn't have to be simply senior person, it doesn't have to be a super young person, it doesn't have to be just male, or female or Japanese, or non-Japanese. Who can really do this job the best? That's the point. So we are promoting younger generation to be taking up important positions, without simply going through the ages as the benchmark, and I'm promoting women to be in the senior positions. We actually achieved our goal of 30% of women being in managerial positions in 2017. Immediately after that, I announced we're going to be achieving 40% target by 2020. We're getting there.\n\nChristine: And finally, as the CEO of Shiseido, driving the company for the last 4 years as the first outside CEO within the company, what's your ultimate ambition for the world's oldest beauty and skin care company?\n\nMasahiko: We want to be a true global company with our Japanese heritage. So, how can we really make sure everybody sees Shiseido (and say), \"Oh, that's a great company that is embracing diversity, globally.\" (It) doesn't have to be maybe the CEO being Japanese anymore in the future. So, a real global company, but (with) a really strong background of our values which was built over 140 years in Japan.\n\nENDS\n\nFor more information:\n\nClarence Chen\n\nCommunications Manager APAC, CNBC International\n\nD: +65 6326 1123\n\nM: +65 9852 8630\n\nE: clarence.chen@cnbc.com\n\nAbout CNBC:\n\nCNBC is the leading global broadcaster of live business and financial news and information, reporting directly from the major financial markets around the globe with regional headquarters Singapore, Abu Dhabi, London and New York.
