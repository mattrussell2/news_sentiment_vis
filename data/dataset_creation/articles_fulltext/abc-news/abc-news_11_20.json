She then asks whether it was the house he'd been staying in that, at one time, suffered a fire.\n\n\"I've been out on the streets for a week,\" Richard tells her.\n\nBarnes offers to buy him some dinner. He declines but she asks him whether he'd like to ride the bus with her in order to stay warm. He agrees and video shows Richard riding along quietly in the back of the bus as Barnes covers her route, with passengers coming and going.\n\n\u201c \u201d We talk every couple of days and he thanks me every time he talks to me for helping him. He calls me his little guardian angel. I'm happy to say that he's progressing well.\n\nMilwaukee County Transit System\n\nAt one point, the two are seen getting back on the bus with what looks like bags of food.\n\n\"I don't know what to say but to say thank you,\" Richard tells her later. \"I'll get it back to you soon.\"\n\n\"I want to help you,\" Barnes tells him.\n\nLater, during another break, Barnes can be seen on her phone. The transit agency said that Barnes had reached out to a friend who helped get Richard into a temporary shelter. When the video picks up a few moments later, Barnes, back behind the wheel, asks Richard whether he needs some items from a store she plans to visit the next day.\n\nAs he exits the bus, she tells him to let her know how he's doing.\n\n\"Keep me posted,\" she says as he nods. \"Let me know what happens -- even tonight.\"\n\n\"See you tomorrow,\" she says.\n\nIn an interview during a ceremony in which she was honored by the transit agency, Barnes said she was moved to help Richard because he was an elderly man and it was cold outside. She said she saw Richard at least once a month.\n\n\"It was important that he found somewhere warm to stay for the night, at minimum,\" she said.\n\nBarnes, who has been driving with the transit agency for two years, encouraged the community to help when it comes to the homeless.\n\nShe said in the area that she covered as a public transit driver, there were \"a lot of people who are looking in garbages for food.\"\n\n\"They're underdressed,\" she said. \"They don't have anywhere to go. ... They need help. They should have basic necessities like food and like clothing just to survive.\"\n\nAfter that six-hour bus ride, Barnes said Richard had become a friend of hers and even now has her cellphone number.\n\n\"We talk every couple of days and he thanks me every time he talks to me for helping him,\" Barnes said. \"He calls me his little guardian angel. I'm happy to say that he's progressing well.\"\n\n\u201cNatalie\u2019s kindness, compassion and respect for this man in need are what MCTS Excellence is all about,\u201d said County Executive Chris Abele in a statement posted on the transit agency's website. \u201cNatalie demonstrated what we all need to do to fight homelessness: to look out for each other, to care for each other and to work together. I\u2019m deeply grateful for Natalie\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nThe transit system said that Barnes, a mother of two, was also known for bringing extra sandwiches on her shifts. This was her third commendation for outstanding service, according to the transit agency.\n\nCommunity Advocates, a local agency, has also found Richard permanent housing."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Business Highlights", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

I did nothing wrong and certainly did not commit any crime.\"\n\nMiniutti alleges in the court filing that she and Avenatti were in the master bedroom on Nov. 13 when they began arguing about money.\n\nAvenatti, 47, allegedly told Miniutti, that she was \"ungrateful,\" calling her a \"f------ b----,\" the court document stated.\n\nMiniutti then went to the guest bedroom to sleep, and Avenatti allegedly followed her and approached her in a \"threatening manner\" before \"forcefully hitting\" her in the face with pillows, she wrote in her filing.\n\n\"He then said words to the effect of, 'Do not disrespect me. You don't get to sleep in my house tonight,'\" Miniutti wrote.\n\nMike Blake/Reuters\n\nAvenatti then allegedly grabbed her wrist, attempting to pull her out of bed, but he slipped and lost his grip, according to her statements filed with the court.

He then allegedly blocked the door with his body to prevent her from leaving.\n\nMichael Owen Baker/AP\n\nAvenatti then followed Miniutti as she ran back into the guest room, according to Miniutti's court filing. She put on pants but \"did not have time to put on shoes,\" and was able to get around Avenatti, running toward the main elevator.

The next day, she returned to the apartment to pack her belongings, she wrote. Avenatti allegedly came home briefly during that time, but he left after Miniutti informed him that police were at the building, according to the order.\n\nPolice told Miniutti later that day that Avenatti had been arrested.\n\nA letter sent to the LAPD on behalf of Avenatti's attorneys, and obtained by ABC News, detailed efforts by private investigators to interview staff and view security camera footage from the building where the alleged incident took place.\n\nAccording to the letter from Avenatti's defense team, there was no evidence that Avenatti was physically violent with Miniutti.\n\nWhile the apartment complex contained multiple security cameras, at no point do they \"show force, violence or offensive touching of Ms. Miniutti by Mr. Avenatti,\" the letter obtained by ABC News stated.\n\nThis included video footage in the reception area, elevators, leasing office and foyer of the building, the letter said.\n\nWhile cameras did capture Avenatti and Miniutti together the night of the alleged incident, the videos, according to the document, \"conclusively demonstrate that Mr. Avenatti was calm and collected at all relevant times.\" the letter stated.\n\nAccording to the letter, both a security guard and building concierge, who spoke with investigators hired by Avenatti's attorneys, did not witness Avenatti \"use any force or violence against Ms. Miniutti, nor engage in any act of disrespectful or angry touching, nor make any threats, or even any threatening gestures, towards her.\"\n\nMiniutti's attorney, Michael Bachner, told ABC News that she \"stands by the accuracy of her statements to the LAPD.\"\n\n\"The suggestions contained in Mr. Avenatti\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter to the LAPD are vindictive, demonstrably contrary to the evidence, and unworthy of further reply,\" Bachner wrote.\n\nMiniutti wrote in her filing that she is afraid that Avenatti may \"harass\" and \"cause harm\" to her as a result of the events that allegedly occurred on Nov. 13. She also said that Avenatti \"has a history of being very verbally abusive and financially controlling towards\" her, has \"vehemently opposed\" to her desire to \"earn a living outside of Hollywood,\" and has \"made promises\" to take care of her \"financially and sometimes fails to follow through,\" according to the court document.\n\nThe temporary restraining order request included photos showing what appeared to be bruises on Miniutti's hands and leg. The request was granted on Monday and remains in force until a hearing on Dec. 10. A request to seal the case to avoid a media circus and national scrutiny was denied, as was a request for Avenatti to return an iPhone to Miniutti.\n\nThe order instructed Avenatti to refrain from harassing, threatening, striking or stalking Miniutti. He is also barred from contacting her or coming within 100 yards of her, her job, her home or her vehicle.\n\nAfter he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence with injuries last week, Avenatti maintained that he has \"never struck a woman.\" He has not been formally charged with a crime, and the Los Angeles Police Department had not sent the case over to prosecutors for a determination on whether to file formal charges as of Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I wish to thank the hard working men and woman of the LAPD for their professionalism they were only doing their jobs in light of the completely bogus allegations against me,\" Avenatti said in a statement released through his law firm last week. \"I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Avenatti tweeted that he has requested the \"immediate release\" of the video footage recorded on the date of the alleged incident to his counsel and the Los Angeles Police department to reveal \"the truth.\" He also blasted TMZ, the outlet that broke the news of his arrest, for its \"false reporting\" about the alleged incident, and threatened to sue them if they do not retract the story and issue an apology.

Add Interest\n\nDespite a band of House Democrats announcing their opposition Monday to Pelosi's bid for speaker, Pelosi has remained confident she will win the race for speaker, working behind the scenes to solidify support in the House Democratic Caucus in the aftermath of the midterm elections.\n\nIn an unexpected development Tuesday evening, Fudge threw her support behind Pelosi after she announced her intention to restore the Elections Subcommittee of the Committee on House Administration in the 116th Congress and name Fudge the new chair.\n\n\u201cThroughout her 20 years of public service, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge has been a relentless advocate for the right of every citizen to vote, and for all votes to be counted as cast,\" Pelosi, D-Calif., stated. \u201cI look forward to working with Chairwoman Fudge in this new role as we advance our efforts to offer all Americans a Better Deal for Our Democracy.\u201d\n\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nFudge, a veteran Ohio Democrat, last week openly called for a challenger to step up and face off against Pelosi. Though she flirted with the idea of taking on Pelosi herself, she emphasized that she was looking for someone else to step forward.\n\n\u201cLast week I announced that I was strongly considering a run for Speaker of the House. My consideration was due in large part to the lack of sustained efforts that ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels of the House,\" Fudge wrote in a statement Tuesday.\n\nFudge noted that she will work to reinstate and reform protections of the Voting Rights Act in her new post \u2013 giving her enough incentive to support Pelosi.\n\n\"I am now confident that we will move forward together and that the 116th Congress will be a Congress of which we can all be proud,\" Fudge stated. \"I now join my colleagues in support of the leadership team of Pelosi, Hoyer, and Clyburn.\"\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, 16 House Democrats and members-elect released a letter announcing their opposition to Pelosi as House Speaker. Despite her expressed opposition last week, Fudge did not sign the letter.\n\nIf all 435 members of the next Congress vote in the election for Speaker, Pelosi must lock in 218 votes to win. Democrats are on track to hold at least 233 seats in the next Congress, according to ABC News' projections, so she can only afford to lose 15 of her Democratic colleagues. One House race, Utah's 4th Congressional District, remains too close to call, though the Democrat there, Ben McAdams, has pledged to oppose Pelosi for Speaker."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: President Trump blasts judge's ruling blocking asylum restrictions", "description": "Trump blasted the judge as an \"Obama appointee\" and then once again lit into the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the judges who would consider an administration appeal pf the district judge's order.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/president-trump-blasts-judges-ruling-blocking-asylum-restrictions-59329415", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181120_vod_orig_9thcircut_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:24:06Z", "content": "Now Playing: Judge halts Trump asylum order, Ivanka's email controversy Now Playing: Trump signs order denying asylum-seeking, illegal border crossers Now Playing: President Trump blasts judge's ruling blocking asylum restrictions Now Playing: Ivanka Trump's \u2026 [+1180 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for President Trump blasts judge's ruling blocking asylum restrictions\n\nWhat you go to the ninth circuit and it did this great I'm gonna put major complaint.

Borax is known to be a mild irritant to skin and eyes and if swallowed can be fatal in children according to the Environmental Protection Agency. High levels of borax have been banned in the European Union, however the non-partisan group says it found a number of slime products to have 15 times the EU's legal limit. However in the U.S., there is no limit to the amount of borax in a product.\n\nThe group has called on lawmakers to require labeling of products with high concentration of borox and wants industry toy makers to use alternatives to borax such as lotions or glue.\n\n\"Parents can be assured that slime and all other toys sold in the United States are compliant and safe,\" said Rebecca Mond, vice president of government affairs for The Toy Association.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nThe trade association represents more than 950 members from Amazon to Kangaroo Manufacturing, a company which had four of its slime products recalled in Canada in September after the government said it didn't meet its Canadian toy safety requirements. Kangaroo said it didn't receive any incident or injury reports relating to the use of the recalled slime in the country.\n\nPrivate data may also be at risk according to the \"Trouble in Toyland\" report. Through an investigation with the Mozilla Foundation, the group found two popular toys can share private information about children for advertising purposes. The non-partisan group says that the Amazon Fire HD Kids Edition doesn't allow users to delete the data that it stores on the device and, according to the Mozilla Foundation, \"Amazon gets to know your kid from cradle on.\"\n\nThe non-partisan public interest group also found that 87 percent of latex balloons on Amazon failed to have choking hazard labels on the website's descriptions. According to the trade association all toys sold in the U.S. must comply with safety regulations and have to be tested by an independent accredited lab. Mond also said that balloons are not toys.\n\nAmazon didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Toy Association, which represents Disney, the parent company of ABC News, assures consumers \"the only thing that parents need to be concerned about this year is purchasing fun toys for their children.\"\n\nThe U.S. Public Interest Research Group said it's efforts over several decades have led to more than 150 recalls and precautions made by toy makers.\n\nRachel Weintraub, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, said \"parents should not have to be detectives.

Ellison, a former Home Depot executive, had been the CEO at J.C. Penney for less than four years.\n\nIn August, the Mooresville, North Carolina-based company announced it was closing the 99 Orchard Supply Hardware stores it owns in California, Florida and Oregon.\n\nAfter thinning executive positions at the company, Ellison began paring away what he sees as nonessential in the aisles of Lowe's. That means rethinking some of the goods it sells, getting rid of lower-selling items, and focusing on the top 2,000 products it carries. Lowe's also wants to bolster its business with professionals, something that has been Home Depot's forte.\n\nLowe's had lost its way and become more interested in things like international expansion and innovation. Customer traffic has long been strong, but shoppers have been left disappointed because they haven't found what they needed.\n\nEllison told analysts during a conference call on Tuesday that despite interest rates ticking up and housing turnover under pressure, the home improvement backdrop \"remains strong,\" fueled by robust real residential investment and home price appreciation. The average age of a home in the U.S. is 40 years, which creates a big opportunity for maintenance and repair, he noted.\n\nDuring an interview with The Associated Press, Ellison said that he sees the Chapter 11 bankruptcy by Sears Holdings Corp. as creating opportunities to pick up extra dollars.

Tigar was appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\nAs part of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, Congress \"clearly commanded ... that any alien who arrives in the United States, irrespective of that alien's status, may apply for asylum -- 'whether or not at a designated port of arrival,'\" Tigar wrote, citing the law.\n\nThe president's proclamation on Nov. 9 attempted to limit asylum to immigrants who crossed at designated ports of entry and deny asylum to those who entered at other locations along the 2,000-mile southern border.\n\nImmigration advocacy groups filed suit against Trump immediately after he signed the proclamation.\n\n\"At this very moment, massive numbers of aliens are arriving at our southern border, threatening to incapacitate our already overwhelmed immigration system,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\n\"Yet now, a single district judge has issued a nationwide temporary restraining order preventing the executive branch from performing its Constitutional duty to enforce our borders and control entry into the United States.

Kelly was 27 years old at the time and had just skyrocketed to No. 1 with his breakout \"Bump N' Grind.\"\n\nHe was about to embark on his first tour as a solo performer and was auditioning backup dancers.\n\n\"I remember I danced the paint off the walls,\" Drea Kelly said. \"They started clappin' and he was like, 'You got the job.'\"\n\nBob Levey/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nFor Drea Kelly, just 19 years old at the time, it was her dream gig.\n\nDrea Kelly appeared in the music video for the song \"Thoia Thoing\" and was front and center in several of his other videos and performances.\n\nShe said she quickly rose from backup to principal dancer and eventually choreographer. Shortly thereafter, Drea Kelly said her then-boss sought a more intimate relationship.\n\n\"I can't say that I remember, like, when it changed for me or when it was just like, 'Oh, I think I love him.' I do remember when he said he fell in love,\" Drea Kelly said. \"He said, 'I was sitting on the back of the tour bus reading the Bible.' And he said it was something about that moment that he fell in love. He said, 'And you remind me of my mama.'\"\n\nWhen asked by ABC News whether she'd seen any kind of indication that there may be any kind of violence or rudeness or inappropriate behavior from R. Kelly, Drea Kelly said, \"No, but what I did see is a man who was very controlling.\"\n\nR. Kelly continued to climb the Billboard charts. He soon became a household name with the release of the crossover megahit titled \"I Believe I Can Fly.\"\n\n\"After ['I Believe I Can Fly,'] we were married, but at that point I had seen him go from just an all-black audience knowing who he was to now you're doing [the movie] 'Space Jam.' You're getting Grammy nods. Winning Grammys,\" she said.\n\nDrea Kelly said the first time that R. Kelly got \"indirectly physical\" with her was during her pregnancy with first child Joann.\n\n\"He locked me in a bathroom and I slept in a bathtub,\" she said.\n\nCandice Elle Frank/ABC\n\nOutwardly, R. Kelly was the portrait of a doting father, cradling baby girl Joann in Celine Dion's video \"I'm Your Angel.\"\n\nAnd, even though the couple had two more children together, Drea Kelly said the marriage was crumbling.\n\nThen, in 2002, a tape emerged, purportedly showing R. Kelly engaged in sexual acts with a minor.\n\nDrea Kelly told \"Nightline\" that in the beginning, she did not believe the accusations.\n\n\"I'm thinkin' to myself, 'That's impossible 'cause he plays ball. Go to the studio. If he's not at the studio, he's performing.' But then again, he kept me very sheltered,\" she said. \"I'm too busy dealin' with my own abuse.\"\n\nIn 2004, R. Kelly sat down for an interview with ABC.\n\n\"Man, this is simple, man. You know, I'm a good person, man. I love people. People need to understand that R. Kelly is not who they think but it's who I know. You know, I'm not perfect. I'm not some Jesus that people should worship. But I am not no demon. I'm no devil. I'm no criminal,\" he said.\n\nR. Kelly did face trial on multiple charges of child pornography but he was acquitted on all counts. At home, Drea Kelly said, her husband grew more controlling and easily angered.\n\n\"It could be anything from the milk being too cold to the milk's not cold enough. ... There's no, 'Let's talk about it,' like a regular couple. You know?\" she said. \"No. It's his way or the highway. Period.\"\n\nBut it was a seemingly ordinary scenario that Drea Kelly claims led her to being attacked, restrained and ultimately hogtied by R. Kelly.\n\n\"The night that he hogtied me, we got into a conversation that I don't even really remember what it started fro,\" she said. \"I remember layin' on my stomach, and he had his arms and his knees. He's pressin' in my back, and he just grabbed both of my arms. And he took the rope tie, and he tied my arms behind my back. // And then he took my legs, and he tied my legs and my hands and arms together. And I just remember layin' on the side of the bed cryin', like, 'Let me go. Just untie me. Let me go.' And he fell asleep with me on the side of the bed like an animal,\" she said.\n\nShe said that she'd confided in no one about what she claims was happening to her. She said she did not ever call the police.\n\n\"I kept it all to myself,\" she said.\n\nIn 2005, however, she did file an order of protection but a few weeks later, she withdrew it.\n\n\"He's a powerful man. At this time, he's at the top of his game. So now I get this order of protection and it dawns on you, 'This is not bulletproof,'\" she said.\n\nEventually, she said a series of altercations while they were on vacation in Miami led her to a breaking point in which she almost tried to end her life.\n\n\"The only thing that kept me: first God, but my kids. 'Cause I remember I climbed out on the balcony and I looked down and it was, like, God had helped me to see my body was layin' in blood,\" she said. \"Then in the background I hear my kids go, 'Mama. Mama. Why did Mama jump? Why did she leave us?' And I remember jumpin' down and my heart was beatin' so fast and I prayed to God, 'OK, I need an answer and I need it now.' ... And he told me to get my laptop, of all things, and type in domestic violence. Put in domestic violence awareness. I go to their web page and there's a survey. I take the survey, and of the 17 things on the list, Robert had already done 15. And it just dawned, I was like, 'Wait.'\"\n\nShe said before that moment, she had not considered herself a victim of domestic violence.\n\nTim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\n\"I always had the ability. You're a performer. You're tough. You're a girl from the South Side. But the reality of it was, reading that, I'm like, 'Yes. Yes. Yes.' And the more I said yes, the more I would replay things in my mind. The things he's done. The things he's said. The sexual abuse. The physical abuse. The emotional abuse. The financial abuse. And I was like, 'No. This is you. You're that girl,'\" Drea Kelly said.\n\nShe said she was determined not to be that girl. After hiding any money she could find, Drea Kelly said, she packed one bag, grabbed her three children and went to her father's home. In 2006, she filed for divorce. She told \"Nightline\" she had not thought about changing her last name.\n\nWhen asked whether she minded the association with still being a Kelly, Drea Kelly said: \"Well, when people say association, that's, like, a club or fraternity or whatever. I paid for my name in blood, sweat and tears. Literally. Nobody knows what it was like to be Drea Kelly. Drea Kelly is strong. Drea Kelly is a survivor. Drea Kelly made it away from Robert Kelly. That is my badge. I will not and I know people wanna think, 'Oh, well, if the abuse is so bad, why keep the name?' The name didn't abuse me. Robert did.\"\n\nIn response to the allegations made by Drea Kelly, R. Kelly's manager told ABC News they had \"no comment.\"\n\nShe said the last time she'd had contact with R. Kelly was so long ago, that she couldn't remember.\n\n\"It has gotten so bad, and I believe because I no longer [live] my life as a victim that we don't communicate. It's lawyer to lawyer,\" she said.\n\nDrea Kelly said she'd decided to come out with her story after the summer of 2017.\n\n\"All these allegations start comin' out again and I'm like, 'God, OK. I don't think I can take this one,'\" she said.\n\nIn 2017, a Buzzfeed article detailed allegations from two parents, saying that their daughter was being \"held against her will\" by R. Kelly.\n\nThe article also alleged that \"six women live in properties rented by [R.] Kelly in Chicago and the Atlanta suburbs and that he controls every aspect of their lives.\"\n\nR. Kelly and several of the women -- including the daughter of the complaining parents -- have denied the claims.\n\nThe allegations sparked a movement with celebrities like Viola Davis and John Legend joining the call to with #MuteRKelly, demanding that people stop playing and promoting his music.\n\nToday we join the call to #MuteRKelly and insist on safety and dignity for women of all kinds. #TIMESUP pic.twitter.com/VcX0xLRnTi \u2014 Viola Davis (@violadavis) April 30, 2018\n\nThe platform Apple Music removed him from its featured playlists.\n\nLast summer, after months of silence, R. Kelly released \"I Admit,\" a 19-minute song that dove into many allegations and controversial headlines.\n\n\"I admit I\u2019m a freak who used to go to the strip club weekly and messed with all the ladies, that\u2019s both older and younger ladies. But tell me how they call it pedophile, because that is crazy. ... I am so falsely accused. ... I'm so falsely accused. Tell me how can you judge when you've never walked in my shoes,\" he sings.\n\nDrea Kelly called the song \u201cthe dumbest things he\u2019s ever done.\u201d\n\n\"You didn't admit anything. That was the classic, narcissistic response,\" she said.\n\nShe is now a full-time mother to her three children, Joann, Jay and Robert. The children, who range in age from 16 to 21, live close by, just outside of Los Angeles. They are well aware of the headlines about their father. They said his past led them to be bullied in school.\n\n\"I know that it doesn't have anything to do with me. I know that those people have a lot of healing to do. So I just kinda let it be with them. And like I said, I just go back to my family and let that be what it is, 'cause it has nothing to do with me,\" Joann Kelly said.\n\nABC\n\nAll three said that they did not have contact with R. Kelly and that it had been a long time since they'd communicated with him.\n\nWith dance and music in their blood, however, the Kelly children have musical aspirations of their own. They are currently working on an album together.\n\n\"We make our own music. I've produced music and they write, and they use the beats that I make,\" Jai Kelly said.\n\nAs for Drea Kelly, she said she'd tell her 19-year-old self \"don't change a thing\" if she could because her life brought her three children.\n\n\"They're my world,\" she said.\n\nShe now has become an advocate for victims of domestic abuse, speaking out at colleges and universities. On the day that \"Nightline\" met with Drea Kelly, she was in her hometown of Chicago, visiting a women's shelter called Margaret's Village to share her story with other women. She said the shelter had at one time been a school that she'd attended. The moment filled her with emotion.\n\n\"I feel like God finally answered me today. Because I was wondering like should I be doing this and should I come forward and should I keep going,\" she said.\n\nAfter her talk with the group, she shared with ABC News what she had learned about herself.\n\n\"I'm little but I'm lethal,\" Drea Kelly said. \"That's what I've learned about Drea Kelly. ... You know, it's not that I found out that I'm strong, 'cause I don't think I'm strong. In my humanness, I don't think I'm strong. What I have learned is that I'm a vessel. And when you're a vessel, you have amazing strength and courage that you would go into the lion's den when you're a vessel, because I know now that I'm being used for something greater than me.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "How investigators cracked unsolved murder of Harvard graduate student nearly 50 years later - ABC News", "description": "ABC News How investigators cracked unsolved murder of Harvard graduate student nearly 50 years later ABC News Investigators finally have cracked a cold case murder that has haunted the Boston area for almost 50 years.

Instead of looking inward and telling a story from his own perspective, Cuaron has stepped outside of himself and chosen pay tribute to the inner lives of two people who children only ever see in the context of themselves \u2014 his mother and nanny.\n\nAnd it is the nanny and housekeeper, Cleo, who gets the star treatment in \"Roma.\" Portrayed with astounding assuredness and depth by the novice actor Yalitza Aparicio, Cleo may appear quiet and reserved but she is acutely observant to everything that's happening around her, no matter how small. She treats seriously the loneliness of the youngest son of the four doctor's children she cares for. She seems to know that when her boss, Sofia (an exquisite Marina de Tavira) snaps at her to clean up the dog poop in the garage, that it isn't about her. She is used to absorbing the pain of others, which makes her own trials through the course of the film even more devastating to experience.\n\nAs with many families with a live-in housekeeper, Cleo may be getting paid for her service, but she is as much of mother figure to the children of the household as their birth mother, who has, at least lately, been distracted trying to keep the attention of her scoundrel husband. The men of \"Roma\" are little more than jerks, disappointments and nuisances who leave the women, and the audience, enraged.\n\nThis may all seem very vague, but \"Roma\" is a journey that doesn't really lend itself to simple plot points. It's simply a slice of this family's life, at the moment when they find themselves having to adjust to life without a father, and realizing that perhaps Sofia and Cleo are quite enough and always have been, as they go from the city, to the country for the holidays and back to the reality of home, where political turmoil has reached a violent boiling point.\n\nCuaron is content to take his time with \"Roma,\" allowing the camera to linger on his subjects and the frustrating banalities of ordinary, everyday life that sneak up on you with poetic significance as the film goes on, like a garage, the ever present dog poop that Cleo is always picking up, and a car that's too big to fit. It's the kind of patience that makes so many moments indelible and affecting \u2014 from something as small as Cleo sitting in a movie theater to a rowdy holiday party brought to a halt by a fire. It is filmmaking on the highest level.\n\nNetflix has given \"Roma\" a theatrical run before it hits its streaming service on Dec. 14, and there has been a lot of debate around how it \"should\" be seen. It is certainly a film that is enhanced by the big screen, and the implied focus that sort of viewing experience demands, but great films are great films no matter the medium. Just put the phone away, and allow yourself to submit to the serene, transcendent experience that is \"Roma.\"\n\n\"Roma,\" a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"graphic nudity, some disturbing images, and language.\" Running time: 135 minutes. Four stars out of four.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMPAA Definition of R: Restricted.

Did it is surprisingly close for red state. Yet no one really knows what to expect because the elections a week from today sits two days after Thanksgiving weekend you're asking people come out just three weeks after they voted the first time. This time is just the Democrat and a Republican and in this case the Republican Center City heights and it seems to have done anything in her power to make this closer than it should be in a state like Mississippi a series of racially insensitive remarks. I'm now a build the latest stuff FaceBook posting that's up from four years ago that surfaced of her. At the at a museum dedicated to Jefferson Davis the confederate president any confederate hat. So when you talk about the politics of race Democrats are finding new reasons to be motivated about this election and it is needs clear a one we have a one off election like this it's about getting your base in gauged and Democrats have lots of reasons to be engaged at this moment we're gonna see a lot of action with 20/20 contenders and of course president trump on the eve of the election. All right a lot of focus on Mississippi right now on both sides let's go to Mississippi right now doctor Dallas bringing. I joins us he is an expert in Mississippi politics at Mississippi State University doctor bring thank you so much for being here in the briefing Herm. There so I Dijjer hurt Rick just give sort of the overview of the race we certainly attractive from here in Washington but. Give us your take how things are filling their on the ground there hasn't been a lot of retirement reliable polling out there but. Is he your sense that this thing is actually very close does the Democrat actually have a chance. Well I always always tell people you know everybody had a chance I don't know I think one of the biggest backers that republics earlier. It's just that. We have that situation really did well. We talk about that but to let you know that almost election where you mobilized peso. It's gonna take it's gonna take a lot of boots on the ground and it has to quit you know are released from. From the general's suit runoff or generally run off. Yeah I'll ask where were ever brought to win and he predominately Republican state. As you know well and a doctor Breen knew just a few months ago a Democrat in the south. And Alabama actually Doug Jones staged quite surprising upset against Roy Moore Roy Moore pretty flawed Republican candidate for senate. Over there but do you see any parallels in Mississippi. Quoting Mike SPB the Dow Jones of Mississippi. I think they're the election Waller where he. Just sheer nature of the allegations. Are without arms. We're more race. We're that would yet you beat your absolute. Some comments have been many by surprise Smith where there's more attention than what was expected as two weeks three weeks ago. Leading up to the election so there's more attention but I just a seat. That lightning rod is it that some are speculating the big day here are eager senator state senator Daniels wrote base. And weird but. Certainly conservative very strong conservative group. He's progressing home words that route boats a conservative ticket and that's really weird yeah. That question how. I think it's going to be close that a lot of people but. Still I don't think that that vote by 8%. Or we'll look now. And doctor Reno there you of these active director of the John Stennis institute of government and that's not a name that dot. Is it known in in in politics these days the DOS Santos of course a long time democratic congressman from Mississippi. The Democratic Party though has since the days of John Stennis undergone. Quite a transformation maybe hibernation in a place like Mississippi how different is the Democratic Party today. Vs the Democratic Party that was less able to win statewide in Mississippi. It's insignificant part I mean that the state while collected off our our remark primarily Republican we have Santa BA the attorney general's Democrat. General good but the rest are Republicans see Harry. We are strongly conservative state and that you sent into Mexico Democratic Party had. Has shifted significantly changed in ice and growers to use.

Big load of those 401 k.s let's bring in mark Whitner now with an economist with with. With Wells Fargo mark thank you so much for being here obvious so everybody's asking why is this happening and why have we seen. So many major slide tomorrow we seen it today. Well we've we've seen a lot of and certainly come into the markets to come into the economy last few weeks. Some of that came from the Fed and that the the Fed is is is is bent on. Raising interest rates in normalizing. The federal funds rate bringing it to a level where it's neither stimulating. Bill restrain economic growth. And they really wanted to sell that message to the market and many fed governors and fed presidents. We're very outspoken that they that they were intended to raise rates. Several more times maybe even more than they had outlined in their dot plot and they may have oversold and I think it it introduced a little bit more risk into the markets. And then we have this ongoing trade dispute with China which doesn't seem to be getting any better. And and both of those things that have come together along with some signs of slower economic growth. That to really weak in the stock market and. And mark firfer nervous.

Correction if it's very hard to tell when it hits bottom I mean there there are all sorts of love indicators that you've kind of looked at in hindsight. One of them is that when this starts when you start seeing reports about the stock market. On mainstream news and did it probably. Has just about hit bottom and it's when it when people on main street start talking about how bad the market is market is that it's usually a sign that were at the bottom. But that you only know these things and hindsight you never know them when that when they're happening right under this happening and happening at the at the the very moment.

The effort to combat gun violence in this country we saw a lot of movement an animated. The campaign that's when he T mid term campaign. And now there is a surprising new development with the entry. Of one of America's popular companies times shoes and accessories is is getting into this. This campaign are joining the campaign we are joined now. By tons founder. But Blake might cost see might cost excuse me Tom it Blake. My cost he is it is taking Thompson to politics if you will and has recorded now the largest public corporate donation. And gun violence in American history. Blake thinks so much for joining us you are tossing and five million dollars to this effort tell us why you do and that. Cracked but first I can I'll I'll correct because I don't think this is political issue. When 90% of Americans are in favor of universal background checks. I truly believe or doing something that is more focus on human issue than a pilot never political and. There and why did you Blake what was it about this issue. Taking a pot setting that aside the politics. That sort of very compelled you to get into this arena you Tom's of sheriff says is famous for helping. Provide shoes all around the world 85 million pairs of shoes and unbelievable numbers shoes many of them for children. But why why did taken your company in your your public outreach in this direction. Shares so unfortunately about two weeks ago we had the shootings in Thousand Oaks which is about twenty minutes from my house. And my wife call mean she said look like I'm. I'm not gonna take our son to school today. I'm scared there is a shooting in the synagogue. Just two weeks ago. And she says someone has to do something about it and I thought it out everything we've done in twelve years that Toms and why customers have. And support us this much they support us as we. Try to create a better tomorrow and we stand for things that are important. So I decided this is the time to beacons on the sidelines anymore this is gotten so bad that we need to take a bold action and that's why. We pledged five million dollars rouge is the largest corporate gift in gun violence in the history of our country. And we totally transformed our business. To help customers could actually go online and make a difference or technology on Tom's dot com where they can isn't a postcards the representative. Urging them to pass universal background checks which 90% of Americans are in favor. You know one of the groups that could benefit from your gifts Blake is. Many of them that many and in the new town group for example the kids the Parkland kids in their organization. I have been out there pushing and you're backing them as well we're also joined by Wynn chairman Osce the national youth walk out organizers she was behind. That huge effort inspiring effort we saw earlier in the year with all those high school students walking out in support of efforts and gun violence winter thank you so much for joining us I'm gonna get this year reaction to what Tom's is done here and in do you think that contributions like theirs. We'll make a difference. Totally acting it's so amazing one to see. Tom's as a corporation in the business really that into this base of gun violence and give money but also the idea of the post's top cart action on their website allows people like me you're not even at age to vote to participate have a voice and making sure that elected officials are listening to us and hopefully we will pass comprehensive background check. And I want to ask you about that issue since this is specifically to both the view Blake here postcard campaign talked about has zeroed in on universal background checks is being. The issue to push for winter you just mentioned it is well being very important. Majorities of Americans in our point supported. How did you zero in on on on that particular issue NG USC. Any. Prospecting congress this year how optimistic are you that they'll actually do something in just come January. Sure yeah I'm very optimistic we focused on this issue one because 90% of Americans are for it and so we really felt there was a human issue not a political and the second is we want to have a victory here we believe this what is critical. Universal background checks will keep felons from getting guns. Domestic abusers and people have a mental health track record. I don't think anyone in our country winds that any of those groups to have guns. And we knew that if people spoke loud enough this is going to be on the house in January we know that for sure and we believe that. A lot of postcards are a lot of representatives who make a difference since we launched this campaign last night on Jimmy Fallon there's been over 90000 Americans they've gone to our website Tom's dot com. And use the technology to send a postcard. 90000 postcards are on their way right now. As we speak. To the members representatives and so we hope that in many many more is gonna get the attention and let people know they 90% of Americans is. Is speaking to you and you represented us and we need this law. Past. And Blake is there is there any concern on your part as the founder of this company is very popular. Among young people of all political persuasions that your involvement on this issue were regardless of whether you see it politically connected. Is is risky in any way from for free you from a business perspective. Sure I mean you know I mean I need to say there's no risk but you know we have an uninteresting. In very diverse audience that I think the reason why customer support us is because. We've committed our whole business to creating a better tomorrow we've given 86 million she used to children around the world. And I believe that's why our customers show up that's why they aware of the issues they are back to their values and so whether Republican or Democrat I think the you can have a lot of shared guy isn't. I believe Thomas represents and that's why we have you call on a customers on both sides. And winter before we let you go. Bring us give us a window into your world in the it didn't see the new political world 2019 you know we know your group has been very active through the mid term campaign but what's next for you guys in the movement you built. Where do you for cease spending your energies going forward. I think while one with some money that's being given out to the cold where. Organizations that they are going to be really pushing the work on the ground whether that's. Resources and urban communities that's focused on. And it's it's aggravation or just resurgence on the weapons even going on is gonna continue going on but now we're hoping to see a shift and corporate social responsibility and other corporations and brands also take part in standing for some. All right went from an Osce Blake my koskie thank you so much to both of you for your efforts and for being here and the briefing room we appreciate it very much here Felicia. Aren't these guys. Pretty inspiring to see then get in and and I do think for plate there's there is a bit of a political risk their you don't see a lot of companies go to hotel in this environment when the NRA. Can swoop in and and and knock it down. Yeah and he's right about it being 88 majority issue but it is not a majority political issue or voting issue and off and it is still wrapped up very much wrapped up. In the data they politics and that's where I think there could be pullback but he's right. The new democratic majorities likely take this on early in January and certainly the young people behind this movement ever since department's shooting him dead and so inspiring to march as well that energy will continue we'll track it.

Wednesday's meeting Wednesday excuse that they have never dryer ABC news Washington political director Rick Klein great to have you with us today. On a very busy news day before Thanksgiving holiday the president is just leaving town now to head to Florida and had his Turkey. And he's leaving in a wake of news with it started an extraordinary statement. Just a few minutes ago about the US relationship with Saudi Arabia now this is a statement that comes Rick. In light of this very brutal murderer Washington Post columnist Schumacher show be. The president was supposed to be getting a report today from the CIA on all the details intelligence on that murder. And he's basically gone all in for Andy yes the crown prince saying he didn't have anything to do with that he isn't think even if he did it wouldn't matter. And it does appear when he wrote the statement from but himself from all the explanation points in the weird punctuation paragraphs. Two dozen exclamation points and America first is the is a sub head but of course it looks like Saudi Arabia first and lease over American intelligence agencies is being take away is that may be NBS knew in advance we may never know. But essentially it doesn't matter. And and they did read from the White House the president saying. There's not going to be any further punishment any further recriminations that the saudis have to pay. As a result of this including some some accusations and air against the Shelby himself but a clear statement from the White House that they think they were bigger fish to fry and they need to launch in the. Spitz with that he trump ethos of utility first. The president has made clear that he cap refers to these relationships strong relationships in many cases that human rights abusers. Vladimir Putin one of them. Out of practicality what he sees as US business interest and in this case. Bob flouting once again the US intelligence community's findings and calls on Capitol Hill. Opt for something more some punishment to be. Exacted from Saudi Arabia Rick and I think we're likely to see in light of this just hearing from the number of Republicans and Democrats in the senate they are likely to take some action to try to check the president. Yeah I mean it at the eighty jeetz if you take away is as the American intelligence agencies are that MBS knew about this and those who lied about it for the week strides. Of straw tried to cover this up tried to cover up the crime itself in a cover up what they knew about it. It's hard to imagine just walking away from all of it this is a got in his living week legally in the United States working as a journalist columnist for the Washington Post. I'm murdered in this horrid fashion to save it yet they knew about it but we don't really care is not going to be a sufficient answer. And here's what the secretary of state Mike Pompeo had to say about the situation and why the president. Put out this statement today hitless. So it's a mean nasty world out there. To the Middle East in particular. There are important American interest to keep the American people safe. To protect Americans not only Americans who are here but Americans are traveling and working through business then. The Middle East. And let's forget our pentagon reporter who we Martinez who has been. Studying and insists it is is an expert if you will here at ABC news in the US Saudi relationship is specifically when it comes. To security military ties in the Middle East Louie. The message from Mike Pompeo and from the president today is those security ties particularly. Beasts of the Iran. Are Paramount to anything that happened to a journalist here. That is exactly right Evan I mean the president's statement actually began with talk about Iran. Aren't talking much about how Iran is a threat to the Middle East how would they be brought up to the situation in Yemen where you re a rod has been providing weapons to the that he rebels. I'm so eight he's kind of broadening and kind of explaining why the United States needs Saudi Arabia in the region needs soldering to be of a player for them. On the and you easiest around this statement and then also in the language that sectors they can't pay you issued. How were they essentially they're saying this is a dangerous world or his secretary Pompeo put it. This it's a mean and nasty world. And so I think they're picking their partners here trying to be pragmatic for the region and despite the international outcry that we're seeing over there to show you death. And also the resulting comments the critical comments that have come from the hill and from the Washington Post itself in the wake of the president's statement. And the president of. Horses you know Louie and Rick is set to be in the same place as crown prince Mohamed and saw Mon. In one week's time at the G-20 summit in Argentina will be fascinating to see. If they share a room together they are and it'd be decent sort a show of solidarity and how other leaders will respond to today's saint. And the saudis have to be happy with the way the president has responded you do though I every president has had a complicated relationship with Saudi for a very long time going back decades. The saudis made clear in the immediate wake of this incident that they had leverage they went public that letting people know about their leverage over things like oil prices. And we'll say the president bought it because that they're not going to be any recriminations as far as White House. Major news with respect as Saudi Arabia today another big blow to president trump though overnight. When it comes to his immigration policy that's our next big headline today overnight a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against president trumps order. Blocking immigrants who cross the border illegally from applying for asylum. Mandating that they apply for sound as a legal ports of entry the court saying that president trump. Has to continue hearing us asylum claims let's bring we Martinez back in Louis. All these troops down there at the border are we're starting to see members of the care caravan get there this is another setback to the president but he loves the show doubts. No doubt lousy showdowns and we're seeing here is continued emphasis that this military support for the Customs and Border Protection is still ongoing. We're gonna we got lowered overnight from the US army that is running this operation along the border that he might be shifting some of their troops from Texas and Arizona. Into California why because that's where the bulk of these caravan migrants have ended up. Most in an NT one about 3000 and right across the border from San Diego. That's where there gathering and they're gonna begin the process of Seeking Asylum this is what that temporary restraining order. I said was not valid. Because in in the past if you web across the border you can surrender yourself. QNECBP. Personnel and request asylum the president's order made it mandatory that that could only happen Olympic column port of entry that's in the the traffic lanes of where vehicles go and where individuals can step up to cross the border. But now would it we have. Additional resource is being sent to reinforce these ports of entry because. And that's where these migrants are gonna go and it's going to be a lengthy process the only see maybe several dozen a day. Individuals who cross our border who are processed for asylum. So soon if we have 3000 of them across the border and you wanna. And also in Mexicali of a hundred miles to the east. That's going to be a very lengthy process and restarted see some. The would Collie nasty comments from locals in mixing these Mexican cities themselves because they're concerned. About the drain on the resources of having these 3000 if not an additional thousands of migrants in their city draining resources so it's kind of an interesting situation is going on here in the border right now. Shifting of resources on the US side at the same time some recriminations on the Mexican side as well. Yes so far at least we haven't seen knows a caravan migrants were rushing the border trying to cross illegally as the president had warned they're just simply waiting there for sound. Other before we let you go Luis there was so much confusion yesterday created when. A top military official down there had suggested that perhaps these troops just in time for Thanksgiving would start to pull out and come home. As many suggested politically perhaps this was all just deployed for the election is it would give us the bottom line on that are they. How many troops are staying put is there any truth to this speculation in the reporting that that perhaps they are already coming back. Yes so what we're talking about is the 5800 troops that are on the border right now they're divided between Texas. California and Arizona now the bulk of those troops were sent. Two Texas with the anticipation that. These caravans might head gear because it's the shorter route towards the United States. But what they ended up doing was heading west where its tours T want us so now the idea is shifting those resources. Hop over to California. And so political had an interview with general JB can and he's the three star army general was in charge of the operation. Any kind of inferred that he was saying that while we build up. The concertina wiring and we built up these facilities for our troops. If they were involved in that then maybe it's time for some of them to come back. To their home bases now that led to lot of questions from reporters you're depending on when it ended up happening is that US army north ended up looking back at what they access the general might actually said in the release a statement this morning. Pretty much saying there is no timeline for when an additional four when these forces may leave beyond prior to the December 15 and date for this mission. Currently in Martinez force at the Pentagon thanks so much Louie and Rick back to the original headline here this temporary restraining order against the president's. Action on the asylum seekers. Except back and in district court here but he he's had a lock when these things get to the Supreme Court the travel ban that's remind everybody was upheld in 54 decision in the Supreme Court. Yeah we've seen the court some more generally give pretty wide discretion to the president when it comes to national security when it note regarding immigration. This sort of it came right after the election DeVon whose interest thing because unlike the movie troops of the border this didn't seem like it was is tied up in the politics of the moment. But this this caravan is still thing and there are people that that are going to be coming here I and the the White House you have to figure out how it is but. The the the what once again you're seeing at least be legal question marks around a big piece of policy you're gonna see courts meaning only conflicting directions and leaving this policy very much unsettled as the carving it's closer. All right moving on now one of the other big headlines of the day came from the Washington Post overnight reporting that a rocket front the president's daughter and senior advisor. And had in fact in the first you're the presidency used private email to conduct government business and FactSet hundreds of emails. Setting up scheduling events contacting cabinet officials. Doing exactly the kind of thing Rick that president trump he criticized Hillary Clinton for so hard we understand the president just now leaving for Florida defending his daughter. With the excuse that she simply didn't know which I find it so hard to to to fathom how could she. How you know and a it was never an issue and he remembered ever in the house a lot of government official does with their email and whether a private. A private email address was that is acceptable or not to never come up feels like maybe maybe once and then I sponsored the classic well I you can set of any caddie that you want the differences between what Hillary Clinton was doing as secretary of state. The idea the possibility for classified information on the servers vs what. The emails appear to be with the market troubles these scheduling matters small matters but the bottom line is I don't how you don't know matter if Europe market drop or really anyone. In this administration in the senior level this was such a key issue almost lock her up chants were about the email this looks horrible right now for the White House in its what do those areas DeVon that I. We see these things can afloat by. Democrats are gonna want answers for this and once they've got subpoena power making convene hearings imagine the spectacle of senior advisor to the to the White House Ibaka trump having to defend. Her her email use at a at a Capitol Hill committee hearing all of that is a possibility come January and this was low hanging. Troops for house the Democrats taking over the oversight committee and in fact today we already learned they are going to investigate a bucket trucks you know use. Meanwhile B mid term elections this Rick knows better than anybody are almost done but not quite down we talked about it here yesterday in a briefing room in Mississippi senate race. Remains of one of the biggest. A question mark still from mid terms when he eighteen Rick this is a hot race. It's it is surprisingly close for red state. Yet no one really knows what to expect because the elections a week from today sits two days after Thanksgiving weekend you're asking people come out just three weeks after they voted the first time. This time is just a Democrat and a Republican and in this case the Republican senator city heights and it seems to have done anything in her power to make this closer than it should be in a state like Mississippi a series of racially insensitive remarks. I'm now a build the latest stuff FaceBook posting that up from four years ago that surfaced of her. At the at a museum dedicated to Jefferson Davis the confederate president any confederate hat. So when you talk about the politics of race Democrats are finding new reasons to be motivated about this election and it is needs clear a one we have a one off election like this it's about getting your base engaged and Democrats have lots of reasons to be engaged at this moment we're gonna see a lot of action with 20/20 contenders and of course president trump on the eve of the election. All right a lot of focus on Mississippi right now on both sides let's go to Mississippi right now doctor Dallas bringing. I joins us he is an expert in Mississippi politics in Mississippi State University doctor Breen thank you so much for being here in the briefing her. So are huge hurt Rick just give sort of the overview of the race we certainly attractive from here in Washington but. Give us your take how things are filling their on the ground there hasn't been a lot of retirement reliable polling out there but. Is he your sense that this thing is actually very close does the Democrat actually have a chance. Well I always always tell people you know everybody has chants are I don't know I think one of the biggest backers that republics earlier. It's just thanks we have that situation really did well. We talk about that but to let you know that are also election where you mobilize and peso. It's gonna take it's gonna take a lot of boots on the ground and it passes he quit you know aren't released from. From the generals who run well we're derelict runoff. Yeah its past four or Democrat. To win and he predominantly Republican state. As you know well and a doctor Breen knew just a few months ago a Democrat in the south. And Alabama actually Doug Jones staged quite surprising upset against Roy Moore Roy Moore pretty flawed Republican candidate for senate. Are over there but do you see any parallels in Mississippi. Couldn't Mike SB bee that Doug Jones of Mississippi. I think they're the election while there are where he. Just the sheer nature of the allegations are strong without arms. We're more race is part of what you had you beaten absent some comments have been many by surprise Smith where there's more tension that. What was expected as a few weeks or three weeks ago. Leading up to the election so there's more attention but I just a seat that lightning rod is it that some are speculating that the big. They hear it experts yours senator asked 600 Daniels. Base. And we are where they go admittedly conservative very strongly conservative group. It is progressing at home or is that -- gonna come out and vote a conservative take it. And that's really where do you get that question how. I think it's going to be closer than a lot of people but. Still I don't think that that voted by 60%. What worked what we're now. And doctor Reno there you of these active director of the John Stennis institute of government and that's not a name that dot. Is it known in in in politics these days for John Stennis of course a long time democratic congressman from Mississippi. The Democratic Party though has since the days of John Stennis undergone. Quite a transformation maybe hibernation in a place like Mississippi how different is the Democratic Party today vs the Democratic Party that was last. Able to win statewide in Mississippi. It's a significant part I mean this blog. Our our remote primarily Republican we have seven FDA the attorney general's Democrat. Attorney general clues but the rest are Republicans are you Harry. We are strongly conservative state and this senate that you mention Democratic Party had. Has shifted significantly changed in race and growers to use all it makes called for a Democrat to win in Mississippi but on Saint Paul. I'll be keeping our eyes on now on Mississippi. Next Tuesday big race their. Moving on to another major headline today if you have been watching the markets go take a look check your 401K don't like her. Did you numbers are just spend taking a beating the stocks have been taking a beating today you see there the Dow is down over 500 points right now over 22%. I totally erased the gains of 2018. So far. Big blow to those 401 k.s let's bring in mark Whitner now with an economist with with. With Wells Fargo mark thank you so much for being here obvious so everybody's asking why is this happening and why have we seen. So many major slide tomorrow we seen it today. Well we've we've seen a lot of and certainly come into the markets is coming to the economy last few weeks. Some of that came from the Fed and that the the Fed is is is is bent on. Raising interest rates in normalizing. The federal funds rate bringing it to a level where it's neither stimulating. No restraining economic growth. And they really wanted to sell that message to the market and many fed governors and fed presidents. We're very outspoken that they that they were intended to raise rates several more times maybe even more than they had outlined in their dot plot. And they may have oversold and I think it it introduced a little bit more risk into the markets. And then we have this ongoing trade dispute with China which doesn't seem to be getting any better. And and both of those things and have come together along with some signs of slower economic growth. It's it's to really weak in the stock market and. And mark firfer nervous. Stock mutual fund owners at home or watching all this unfold cringing every time they see it take such a big dive. How do you know when it's hit hit bottom is this going to be something that's gonna continue or are we nearing the end. This correction. If it's very hard to tell when it hits bottom I mean there there are all sorts of the indicators that he's kind of looked at in hindsight. One of them is that when this starts when you start seeing reports about the stock market. On mainstream news that did it probably has just about hit Bob moments. Went when people on main street start talking about how bad the mark is mark it is that's usually a sign that were at the bottom. But but you only know these things in hindsight you never know them when that when they're happening right under this happening and happening at the at the the very moment. All right mark Finneran Wells Fargo thank you for that grim news. And we hope that things get a load of a rosier here at the end of the year mark thank you so much for fairness and briefing room. Always a year and when it comes to the markets get a little jittery. Moving on that and today we are close out this week hear the briefing room this holiday week shorter holiday week with a look at some of the issues that we track throughout this campaign one of those being. The effort to combat gun violence in this country we saw a lot of movement an animated. The campaign it's when he T mid term campaign and now I there is a surprising new development with the entry. Of one of America's popular companies Tom's shoes and accessories is is getting into this. This campaign your joining the campaign and we're joined now. By tons founder. Bill Blake might cost C my koskie skis me Tom it Blake. My cost he is it is taking Thompson to politics if you will and has recorded now the largest public corporate donation. And gun violence in American history Blake thinks so much for joining us you are tossing and five million dollars to this effort tell us why you're doing that. Cracked the first I can I'll I'll correct because I don't think this is political issue. When 90% of Americans are in favor of universal background checks. I truly believe or doing something that is more focus on human issue than a pilot never political and. There and why did you Blake what was it about this issue. Taking a pot setting that aside the politics. That sort of very compelled you to get into this arena you Tom's of sheriff says is famous for helping. Provide shoes all around the world 85 million pairs of shoes and unbelievable numbers shoes many of them for children. But why why did taken your company in your your public outreach in this direction. Sure so unfortunately about two weeks ago we had the shootings in Thousand Oaks which is about twenty minutes from my house. And my wife call mean she said look like I'm. I'm not gonna take our son to school today. I'm scared there is a shooting in the synagogue. Just two weeks ago. And she says someone has to do something about it and I thought it out everything we've done in twelve years at Toms and why customers have. And support us this much they support us as we try to create a better tomorrow and we stand for things that are important. So I decided this with a time the beacons on the sidelines anymore this is gotten so that that we need to take a bold action and that's why. We pledged five million dollars there's is the largest corporate gift in gun violence in the history of our country. And we totally transformed our business to help customers could actually go online and make a difference or technology on Tom's dot com. Where they can isn't a postcards the representative. Urging them to pass universal background checks which 90% of Americans are in favor. They're one of the groups that could benefit from your gifts Blake is. Many of them that many and in the new town group for example the kids the Parkland kids in their organization. I have been out there pushing an earlier backing them as well we're also joined by winter may not see the national youth walk out organizers she was behind. That huge effort inspiring effort we saw earlier in the year with all those high school students walking out in support of efforts and gun violence winter thank you so much for joining us I can't get this year reaction to what Tom's is done here in in do you think that contributions like theirs. We'll make a difference. Totally acting it's so amazing one to see. Tom's as a corporation in the business really that into the space of gun violence and give money but also the idea of the post's top cart action on their website allows people like me not even at age to vote to participate have a voice and making sure that elected officials are listening to us and hopefully we will pass comprehensive background checks. And I wanted to ask you about that issue ends this is specifically to both of you Blake here postcard campaign talked about has zeroed in on universal background checks is being. The issue to push for winter you just mentioned it is well being very important. Majorities of Americans in our point supported. How did you zero in on on on that particular issue NG USC. Any. Prospecting congress this year how optimistic are you that they'll actually do something against. Come January Sherry I'm very optimistic we focused on this issue one because 90% of Americans are for it. And so we really felt there was a human issue not a political one. The second is we want to have a victory here we believe this what is critical. Universal background checks will keep felons from getting guns domestic abusers in people have a mental health track record. I don't think anyone in our country winds that many of those groups to have guns. And we knew that if people spoke loud enough this is going to be on the house in January we know that for sure and we believe that. A lot of postcards are a lot of representatives who make a difference since we launched this campaign last night on Jimmy Fallon there's been over 90000 Americans they've gone to our website Tom's dot com. And use the technology to send a postcard. 90000 postcards are on their way right now. As we speak. To the members representatives and so we hope that in many many more there's gonna get the attention and let people know they 90% of Americans is. Is speaking to you and you represented us and we need this law passed. We and Blake is there is there any concern on your part as the founder of this company is very popular. Among young people of all political persuasions that your involvement on this issue were regardless of whether you see it politically connected. Is is risky in any way for me for free you from a business perspective. Sure I mean you know I mean I need to say there's no risk but you know we have an uninteresting. In very diverse audience that I think the reason why customer support us is because. We've committed our whole business to creating a better tomorrow we've given 86 million issues as children around the world. And I believe that's why our customers show up that's why they aware of the issues they are back to their values and so whether Republican or Democrat I think the you can have a lot of shared guy isn't. I believe Tom's rep princess and that's why we have you pull on a customers on both sides. M winter before we let you go. Bring us give us a window into your world in the it into the new political world 2019 you know we know your group has been very active through the mid term campaign but what's next for you guys in the movement you built. Where do you for cease spending your energies going forward. I think won't land with some money that's being given out to the cool black. Organizations that they are going to be really pushing the work on the ground whether that's. Resources and urban communities that's focused on. And so it's aggravation or just research on the white Goodman going on is gonna continue going on but now we're hoping to see a shift and corporate social responsibility and other corporations in brands also take part in standing for something. All right went from an Osce Blake my koskie thank you so much to both of you for your efforts and for being here and the briefing room we appreciate it very much here Felicia. Aren't these guys. Pretty inspiring to see then get in and and I do think for plate there's there is a bit of a political risk their you don't see a lot of companies go to the hotel in this environment when the NRA. Can swoop in and and and knock it down. Yet and he's right about it being a eight majority issue but it is not a majority political issue were voting issue enough and it is still wrapped up very much wrapped up. In the data they politics and that's where I think there could be fullback but he's right the new democratic majority is likely take us on early in January. And certainly the young people behind this movement ever since department shooting had had been so inspiring to watch as well that energy will continue we'll track it. Right here in the briefing are men and ABC news thank you for joining us today you get the latest on all these stories a lot of make headlines today.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn the first and only debate in the race, Hyde-Smith sought to address those concerns \u2014 reading an apology from her notes to \"anyone offended by my comments\" \u2014 a vague reference to the uproar over a racially tinged joke about \"public hangings\" that pushed the race into the national spotlight and unexpectedly shifted the tenor of the race in favor of Democratic candidate Mike Espy, with national party leaders, including 2020 potential contenders flocking to Mississippi to campaign for him.\n\n\"For anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize,\" she said. \"There was no ill will, no intent, whatsoever in my statements.\"\n\nBut then she called out Espy for using her comments as a \"a political weapon.\"\n\n\"I also recognize that this comment was twisted, and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" she said. \"A political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That is the type of politics Mississippians are sick and tired of.\"\n\nEspy stood only a few feet from her as he responded, \"Well, no one twisted your comments because your comments were live. You know, it came out of your mouth. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s caused our state harm,\" he continued. \"It\u2019s given our state another black eye that we don\u2019t need. It\u2019s just rejuvenating those stereotypes that we don\u2019t need anymore.\"\n\nRogelio V. Solis/AP, FILE\n\nEspy again admonished her comments in his closing statement, asserting, \"We got a senator here talking about public hangings and talking about voter suppression, ladies and gentleman, I am not going back to yesteryear. We are going to move forward.\"\n\nHours before the debate on Tuesday, photos surfaced on Facebook showing Hyde-Smith donning a Confederate soldier hat, with the caption \"Mississippi history at its best.\" The existence of the photos was first reported by Politico.\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign declined to comment to ABC News on the photos.\n\nThis new controversy comes amid numerous missteps by Hyde-Smith ahead of the special election \u2014 the last open Senate seat of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAlthough she failed to clinch 50 percent of the vote on Nov. 6 to win outright, Hyde-Smith was on a winning trajectory in the upcoming runoff on Nov. 27 against Espy, a former Clinton Cabinet secretary.\n\nThe Republican senator embraced a supporter at a Nov. 2 campaign stop in Tupelo after he praised her and said before a cheering crowd, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nOnly four days later, another video surfaced showing Hyde-Smith seeming to support voter suppression.\n\n\"Then they remind me, that there's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who that maybe we don't want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that's a great idea,\" she said to a group of supporters in Starkville on Nov. 3.\n\nDespite evoking language reminiscent of lynchings that scar Mississippi's history and also appearing to support voter disenfranchisement \u2014 another battle wound for African-Americans in the south \u2014 Hyde-Smith did not apologize for either comment before Tuesday's debate.\n\nInstead, she called the first \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" and the latter \"a joke.\"\n\nHer African-American challenger\u2019s long-shot bid has now edged closer into competitive territory and the national Democratic network mobilized in the hopes of delivering a potential upset.\n\nPouring in resources to bolster support from the state\u2019s Democratic base and sending in Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu to campaign alongside the former congressman, Democrats are staking their hopes on Espy to continue their momentum in the midterms.\n\nOn Monday, Former Vice President Joe Biden, another potential 2020 contender, endorsed the former agriculture secretary in a video.\n\nThe top Democratic super PAC for Senate Democrats, the Senate Majority PAC, invested $500,000 to flood the states' airwaves. The ad buy began on Nov. 16. A first ad targeted Hyde-Smith on health care, suggesting she is in the pocket of health insurance companies and will increase health care premiums \u2014 without mentioning the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a red state Democrat in the south, Espy\u2019s task is a balancing act: embracing the core of his voters who he can help propel him back into national politics, while also convincing more moderate voters of his political independence.\n\nUsing his moderate appeal to attract white voters, Espy is running as an \"independent\" Democrat.\n\n\"Even though I'm a Democrat, I'm an independent \u2014 a small 'I' \u2014 Democrat, meaning that I'm a Mississippian first,\" Espy told ABC News in an interview last month.\n\nDuring the campaign, Espy showed rising momentum as he outpaced both Republicans by raising $1.17 million in the third quarter. He has raised over $163,000 in new contributions as of Nov. 13, according to his latest FEC filing.\n\nVoters in Mississippi are expected to return to the polls next week, among them will be the state\u2019s African-American population, which stands at 38 percent, the largest of any state in the country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In the Nov. 6 election, black voters made up 33 percent of the electorate, and Espy captured a staggering 91 percent of that demographic, according to exit polls.\n\nThe challenge for Democrats as they compete in uncharted regions of the country, however, is Mississippi\u2019s long history as a ruby red bastion for Republicans. The last time the state elected a Democrat to Congress was 1982 when former Sen. John Stennis secured a final seventh term. The last time the state sent an African-American to the Senate was during the Reconstruction Era when the state voted in former Sens. Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce in the late 1800s.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, President Donald Trump carried the state by nearly 20 percentage points over Hillary Clinton. And although he advanced to the runoff after defeating another Republican in the race, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, Espy only benefited from the special election\u2019s non-partisan jungle primary format that requires a candidate to net a majority of the vote to win outright.\n\nCourtland Wells/The Vicksburg Post via AP\n\nEspy advanced to the runoff after the two Republican contenders split the GOP vote, garnering 40.6 percent of the vote on Nov. 6, only 0.8 percent behind Hyde-Smith. McDaniel netted about 16 percent of the vote.\n\nNow, the Magnolia state is finding itself in the same breath as neighboring Alabama \u2014 a state that sent Democrat Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate last year, after a sexual misconduct scandal crippled Trump-backed Republican Roy Moore\u2019s bid. Jones, a civil rights attorney, became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in 25 years.\n\nEspy hopes that he can replicate Jones\u2019 stunning victory and shrink the GOP\u2019s advantage in the incoming Senate. Similar to the coalition that successfully sent Jones to the Senate in 2017, Espy will have to turn out African-American voters and appeal to moderate white voters to win.\n\n\"We have to get the African-American vote out in higher numbers than it's ever come out before,\" he told ABC News. \"We have to make sure everyone regardless of race comes out. Get the African-American vote out. Get enough of what I call 'purple people.' They may be Republicans, they may be Independents, I don't care.\"\n\nBut some Republicans are intensifying their efforts to secure Hyde-Smith's hold on her seat amid growing concerns over her candidacy.\n\nOn the eve of the special election, Trump is heading back to the state for two rallies to salvage her presumptive lead. His visit to Tupelo and Biloxi, two GOP strongholds in the state, is being buttressed by support from national Republicans, who are spending more than $1 million on ads across the state.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump defended Hyde-Smith and said it was a \"shame\" that she is facing criticism over a comment \"said in jest\" when asked about her candidacy on the White House North Lawn Tuesday.\n\n\"She is a spectacular senator. She came in, did a fantastic job in a short period of time,\" the president told reporters. \"She made a statement which I know that she feels very badly about it, and it was just sort of said in jest. She's a tremendous woman, and and it's a shame that she has to go through this.\"\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee independent expenditure is contributing over $700,000 in ads and might boost their spending, according to a Republican source with knowledge of the ad buy. A first ad began airing on Nov. 15, focusing on Trump's \"drain the swamp\" rallying cry and attacking Espy as a \"high paid lobbyist.\"\n\nA top Republican super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, also began running ads statewide on Nov. 16, with an ad buy reaching just over $1 million for TV and radio through the runoff. There\u2019s also a $130,000 digital component, according to spokesperson Chris Pack.\n\nA new digital ad from Hyde-Smith's campaign, released Friday, touts an alleged connection between Espy and the African despot who refused to give up power in the Ivory Coast and is now on trial for crimes against humanity in International Criminal Court.\n\nThe statement and the ad are based on a Fox News report, released Thursday, that published a U.S. Department of Justice Foreign Agents Registration Act document that questions if Espy lied about receiving payments as part of a lobbying contract with the Ivory Coast's former president.\n\nHyde-Smith reported 17 new contributions totaling $65,700, including $5,000 from Google's PAC, on Tuesday, shortly after the controversy erupted, according to Open Secrets.\n\nGoogle's contribution is the PAC's first to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign, but the company told Open Secrets it was made far before her controversial remark.\n\n\"This contribution was made on November 2nd before Senator Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks became public on November 11th,\" a Google spokesperson told Open Secrets. \"We do not condone these remarks and would not have made such a contribution had we known about them.\"\n\nBut some top Republicans distanced themselves from Hyde-Smith in the wake of her controversial comments and even conceded that the outcome of this race is no longer assuredly in the hands of the GOP.\n\n\"I think we have to be concerned when candidates say stupid things,\" ABC News contributor and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on ABC News\u2019s This Week. \"Candidates matter. And so now this race will be much more watched. I think the Republican will still win but I think they\u2019ll be much more watched because when candidates say things that, you know, aren\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t right, aren\u2019t smart, they get more attention.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thought the seat was legitimately in play, Michael Caputo, a former senior advisor to the Trump campaign, said on CNN, \"I think so. Mike Espy, by the way, appeals very much to white voters. He is a very bright man with a lot of history of strong contributions in Washington.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Kushners buying Manhattan hotel in third such deal this year", "description": "The family real estate company once run by Jared Kushner is buying a hotel on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the third hotel it has purchased this year", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/kushners-buying-manhattan-hotel-deal-year-59326104", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:33:53Z", "content": "The family real estate company once run by Jared Kushner is buying a hotel on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the third hotel it has purchased this year.

He was running a fever and had upper respiratory problems.\n\nOn Sept. 25, he woke up with paralysis on the left side of his face. The next day, as Joey's fever continued, his parents rushed him to the hospital. Joey was unable to walk so Wilcox\u2019s wife carried him into the emergency room. After examining Joey, Wilcox said, doctors told the couple that their son could have a virus and then discharged him.\n\nCourtesy Mikell Sheehan\n\nLess than 48 hours later, Wilcox told ABC News, his son had paralysis from his neck down. They took him to Fairfax Inova Children's Hospital in Virginia. After doctors ordered a CT scan and spinal tap, they uncovered swelling in Joey's spinal cord from the brain stem down.\n\nJoey, who'd lost all bodily control, was in the hospital for 36 days. Doctors continued to aggressively test for viruses but the results came back negative.\n\nIn October, doctors diagnosed Joey with multifocal encephalomyelitis because of the damage in the gray matter of his spinal cord. Upon transfer to Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, however, he was sent for treatment of AFM at the request of a neurologist.\n\nDespite his symptoms mirroring those of the mysterious symptoms, Joey has yet to be officially diagnosed with AFM, his father said.\n\nOver the years, ABC News has reported on hundreds of children left paralyzed by AFM, a disease that appears to spike every two years in the U.S.\n\nCourtesy Jeremy Wilcox\n\nAFM is a condition that has polio-like symptoms such as partial paralysis. The virus mostly affects children and young adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it does not know why the condition is affecting these individuals, but many believe it is caused by viruses.\n\nAs of Monday, according to the CDC, there were 106 confirmed cases of AFM this year, and 167 more under investigation in 29 states. The organization is still trying to find a definitive cause.\n\nDr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters during a telebriefing on Nov. 13 that there had been \"no deaths among AFM patients reported to CDC in 2018.\u201d\n\nThat statement, however, drew harsh criticism from Wilcox and other parents of children with AFM who feel as though the CDC isn\u2019t doing enough to properly report cases and deaths from whatever is causing these polio-like symptoms.\n\nWilcox said he'd reached out to Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's deputy director, who then arranged a meeting between herself, officials from the National Institutes of Health and parents to take place in Washington, D.C. He said 18 parents attended the meeting, including parents who said their two children had died of AFM this year.\n\nCourtesy Jeremy Wilcox\n\nWilcox said he and other parents had come to the meeting to ask that the deputy director make AFM a nationally notifiable disease and reporting of all cases of AFM mandatory.\n\nCurrently each state's health department has its own list of patients reported with AFM but many medical professionals are not immediately reporting suspected cases, Wilcox said.\n\nParents also called for increased transparency, better communication, effective protocols and an update on the potential causes of AFM. They pointed to a most recent CDC report that still uses 2014/2016 data.\n\n\u201cThe challenge facing the CDC and the issue of misdiagnosing children is the complexities of symptoms,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nMany of the parents who met with Schuchat and the NIH are continuing their work in Washington D.C., meeting with other health officials, as well as speaking with their prospective lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe have become parent advocates for AFM and we want to make it easier for others. Parents really want to know, why our children are susceptible to this,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nOn Monday, the CDC announced that it had established an AFM Task Force to aid in the ongoing investigation to define the cause of the illness and improve treatment. Schuchat also informed parents that the task force would develop a comprehensive research agenda and bring on additional neurologists to look at MRIs.\n\n\u201cI appreciated the opportunity to listen to the families and share information about CDC efforts in responding to AFM,\u201d Schuchat told ABC News after the meeting with parents.\n\nWilcox called the task force \"a positive development.\"\n\nCourtesy Jeremy Wilcox\n\n\"I am encouraged to hear additional resources are being assigned at the CDC and experts will be collaborating with the CDC to discuss better ways to diagnose and treat patients,\u201d Wilcox told ABC News on Tuesday.\n\nCurrently, the CDC states there is no effective treatment for children with AFM but Wilcox said that his son is making tremendous progress with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG), a therapy that can help people with weakened immune systems.\n\nAlong with a regimen of steroids and constant therapy, Joey has a long journey ahead until he can potentially reach full mobility.\n\n\"I\u2019ve learned that you have to be your child\u2019s advocate,\" said Wilcox, who now plans to work with other parents to set up a nonprofit to further advocate for families."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Father aims to improve CDC reporting of illnesses with 'polio-like' symptoms among children as AFM cases grow - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Father aims to improve CDC reporting of illnesses with 'polio-like' symptoms among children as AFM cases grow ABC News For the last two months, Jeremy Wilcox has been fighting for a diagnosis of acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, for his son. \"I've seen\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/father-aims-improve-cdc-reporting-illnesses-polio-symptoms/story?id%3D59292594", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:28:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Nielsen's top programs for Nov. 12-18", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

She needs a hip replacement and her legs are swollen. Next to her is a portable commode, and when it\u2019s time to go, nurses and volunteers help her up and hold curtains around her to give her some measure of privacy.\n\n\u201cNever in my life did I think I would end up in a situation like this, but when it\u2019s time to go, you got to go,\u201d Saunders said. Under the circumstances, she is in good spirits, with a rotating cast of people stopping by to chat and take care of her.\n\nMost of the fire victims here are older folks like her. They rest on cots, inflatable beds and recliners in a pop-up community of nearly 200 evacuees displaced by the Camp Fire and an army of volunteers.\n\nThe Camp Fire, the deadliest in state history, took ruthless aim at older people. Paradise, the Northern California town erased by fire, was largely a retirement community, with a quarter of the population 65 and older. The fire\u2019s death toll was 77 at last count, and nearly 1,000 people were still unaccounted for \u2014 most of them seniors. The sheriff\u2019s list of the missing includes many in their 70s and 80s.\n\nBrian Rinker/California Healthline via KHN\n\nLike everyone else in the wildfire\u2019s path, older people fled swiftly, if they escaped at all, often leaving behind medications, wheelchairs, walkers and essential medical equipment.\n\nAltogether, around 50,000 people are thought to have evacuated, now staying in motels, cars, shelters and a makeshift camp at Walmart in Chico. But the elderly refugees often need more support, especially with chronic conditions and infections that incubate and spread in close quarters. Some need dialysis but can\u2019t get it. Others have respiratory illnesses aggravated by smoke. One woman in a Yuba City shelter was recovering from cancer surgery with a stapled wound.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been rough,\u201d said Joy Beeson, 76, an evacuee who landed in the Chico church shelter. \u201cLost a couple of bedmates the other night. They all went to the hospital.\u201d\n\nThey were felled by norovirus \u2014 a nasty stomach illness that causes diarrhea and vomiting. People were throwing up all day. Then, in the middle of night, paramedics came and removed the sickest, according to some evacuees.\n\nLast week, nearly all the shelters from Chico to Yuba City were hit by an outbreak of the stomach illness \u2014 sending dozens to hospitals. Last week, the Butte County Public Health Department said 145 people in the shelters had been sick with the virus. Fearful volunteers and evacuees rarely shake hands anymore; fist bumps and elbow knocks are highly encouraged.\n\n\u201cJust threw up a few times,\u201d said Martha Pichotta, 65, who was staying at the Red Cross shelter in Yuba City, about 50 miles south of Chico. After 24 hours of isolation behind blue curtains, she was released to mingle with other evacuees.\n\nAdding to the physical and emotional stress, especially for seniors, was the hurried escape from longtime homes and the disruption of often predictable lives. There was little time for practical consideration, let alone sentiment \u2014 beloved pets and rooms full of memories were lost.\n\nBeeson, whose shelter mates were taken to the hospital, said her adult son put his hand on her back to steady her, yelling, \u201cRun, mama, run!\u201d The only reason they escaped the fire alive was because a car picked them up and whisked them to freedom.\n\nDavid Jackman, a 72-year-old man, said he shuffled down the road as fast as he could, leaving behind his dog and his walker as the flames overcame his house and propane tanks exploded behind him. A firetruck came to his rescue \u2014 likely saving his life.\n\nSaunders, the 89-year-old Paradise resident, nearly burned to death in a car. One side of it melted.\n\nMost of the older folks in the shelter said they couldn\u2019t be more grateful for all the support and care they\u2019ve received. Even so, life in a shelter is hard.\n\nDenise Parker, a Red Cross volunteer in Yuba City, said they can offer displaced people Pepto-Bismol and lots of Gatorade. But some were so dehydrated they needed to be hospitalized. Parker said they double-bag all waste and isolate those who are sick.\n\nParker recently got a request for an oversize wheelchair but wasn\u2019t sure how to find one, she said. One evacuee needed dialysis, but they didn\u2019t have the resources to drive the hundred or so miles back and forth to get him to a clinic.\n\nBrian Rinker/California Healthline via KHN\n\nA nurse and doctors stop by to write prescriptions, Parker said, but for more complicated conditions the shelter struggles to meet the need. They aren\u2019t a full-fledged medical facility.\n\nRon Cooper, a 78-year-old who evacuated his home in Magalia, 5 miles north of Paradise, was staying at the Yuba City shelter with his wife, Jacque. Days after the fire hit, Jacque was released from the Oroville Hospital, following surgery to remove a cancerous kidney, but couldn\u2019t go home. Her husband said she is doing OK in the shelter, even with a stapled wound in her side, but was concerned that she won\u2019t eat or drink.\n\nDavid Ramey, a 64-year-old with a scraggly beard, lounged on an inflatable bed at the Chico shelter, puffing on a nebulizer to soothe his emphysema. It was acting up because of the soupy smoke hanging in the air. He bought the device soon after getting out of the danger zone.\n\nMany of those who lost nearly everything are in a limbo state, not knowing what they will do next. Some are waiting on assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or for an insurance check. Others are looking for affordable housing in nearby communities. Paradise was attractive not just because of its natural beauty but because housing was reasonably priced for retirees. Several evacuees, like Pichotta, had been living in mobile homes.\n\nBrian Rinker/California Healthline via KHN\n\nAt the Yuba City shelter Saturday, Pichotta sat in a wheelchair puffing on a cigarette with a blanket over her legs. She was talking with her 33-year-old son about what they should do now.\n\nThe short answer: no idea.\n\n\u201cMy mobile home is this high,\u201d she said, placing her hand a few inches above the ground. They didn\u2019t have residential insurance and their only monthly income is a $900 Supplemental Security Income check. While she doesn\u2019t know where she will end up, she knows her life in Paradise is over.\n\n\u201cI never want to go to Paradise again,\u201d she said, and cried.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn the first and only debate in the race, Hyde-Smith sought to address those concerns \u2014 reading an apology from her notes to \"anyone offended by my comments\" \u2014 a vague reference to the uproar over a racially tinged joke about \"public hangings\" that pushed the race into the national spotlight and unexpectedly shifted the tenor of the race in favor of Democratic candidate Mike Espy, with national party leaders, including 2020 potential contenders flocking to Mississippi to campaign for him.\n\n\"For anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize,\" she said. \"There was no ill will, no intent, whatsoever in my statements.\"\n\nBut then she called out Espy for using her comments as a \"a political weapon.\"\n\n\"I also recognize that this comment was twisted, and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" she said. \"A political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That is the type of politics Mississippians are sick and tired of.\"\n\nEspy stood only a few feet from her as he responded, \"Well, no one twisted your comments because your comments were live. You know, it came out of your mouth. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s caused our state harm,\" he continued. \"It\u2019s given our state another black eye that we don\u2019t need. It\u2019s just rejuvenating those stereotypes that we don\u2019t need anymore.\"\n\nRogelio V. Solis/AP, FILE\n\nEspy again admonished her comments in his closing statement, asserting, \"We got a senator here talking about public hangings and talking about voter suppression, ladies and gentleman, I am not going back to yesteryear. We are going to move forward.\"\n\nHours before the debate on Tuesday, photos surfaced on Facebook showing Hyde-Smith donning a Confederate soldier hat, with the caption \"Mississippi history at its best.\" The existence of the photos was first reported by Politico.\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign declined to comment to ABC News on the photos.\n\nThis new controversy comes amid numerous missteps by Hyde-Smith ahead of the special election \u2014 the last open Senate seat of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAlthough she failed to clinch 50 percent of the vote on Nov. 6 to win outright, Hyde-Smith was on a winning trajectory in the upcoming runoff on Nov. 27 against Espy, a former Clinton Cabinet secretary.\n\nThe Republican senator embraced a supporter at a Nov. 2 campaign stop in Tupelo after he praised her and said before a cheering crowd, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nOnly four days later, another video surfaced showing Hyde-Smith seeming to support voter suppression.\n\n\"Then they remind me, that there's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who that maybe we don't want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that's a great idea,\" she said to a group of supporters in Starkville on Nov. 3.\n\nDespite evoking language reminiscent of lynchings that scar Mississippi's history and also appearing to support voter disenfranchisement \u2014 another battle wound for African-Americans in the south \u2014 Hyde-Smith did not apologize for either comment before Tuesday's debate.\n\nInstead, she called the first \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" and the latter \"a joke.\"\n\nHer African-American challenger\u2019s long-shot bid has now edged closer into competitive territory and the national Democratic network mobilized in the hopes of delivering a potential upset.\n\nPouring in resources to bolster support from the state\u2019s Democratic base and sending in Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu to campaign alongside the former congressman, Democrats are staking their hopes on Espy to continue their momentum in the midterms.\n\nOn Monday, Former Vice President Joe Biden, another potential 2020 contender, endorsed the former agriculture secretary in a video.\n\nThe top Democratic super PAC for Senate Democrats, the Senate Majority PAC, invested $500,000 to flood the states' airwaves. The ad buy began on Nov. 16. A first ad targeted Hyde-Smith on health care, suggesting she is in the pocket of health insurance companies and will increase health care premiums \u2014 without mentioning the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a red state Democrat in the south, Espy\u2019s task is a balancing act: embracing the core of his voters who he can help propel him back into national politics, while also convincing more moderate voters of his political independence.\n\nUsing his moderate appeal to attract white voters, Espy is running as an \"independent\" Democrat.\n\n\"Even though I'm a Democrat, I'm an independent \u2014 a small 'I' \u2014 Democrat, meaning that I'm a Mississippian first,\" Espy told ABC News in an interview last month.\n\nDuring the campaign, Espy showed rising momentum as he outpaced both Republicans by raising $1.17 million in the third quarter. He has raised over $163,000 in new contributions as of Nov. 13, according to his latest FEC filing.\n\nVoters in Mississippi are expected to return to the polls next week, among them will be the state\u2019s African-American population, which stands at 38 percent, the largest of any state in the country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In the Nov. 6 election, black voters made up 33 percent of the electorate, and Espy captured a staggering 91 percent of that demographic, according to exit polls.\n\nThe challenge for Democrats as they compete in uncharted regions of the country, however, is Mississippi\u2019s long history as a ruby red bastion for Republicans. The last time the state elected a Democrat to Congress was 1982 when former Sen. John Stennis secured a final seventh term. The last time the state sent an African-American to the Senate was during the Reconstruction Era when the state voted in former Sens. Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce in the late 1800s.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, President Donald Trump carried the state by nearly 20 percentage points over Hillary Clinton. And although he advanced to the runoff after defeating another Republican in the race, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, Espy only benefited from the special election\u2019s non-partisan jungle primary format that requires a candidate to net a majority of the vote to win outright.\n\nCourtland Wells/The Vicksburg Post via AP\n\nEspy advanced to the runoff after the two Republican contenders split the GOP vote, garnering 40.6 percent of the vote on Nov. 6, only 0.8 percent behind Hyde-Smith. McDaniel netted about 16 percent of the vote.\n\nNow, the Magnolia state is finding itself in the same breath as neighboring Alabama \u2014 a state that sent Democrat Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate last year, after a sexual misconduct scandal crippled Trump-backed Republican Roy Moore\u2019s bid. Jones, a civil rights attorney, became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in 25 years.\n\nEspy hopes that he can replicate Jones\u2019 stunning victory and shrink the GOP\u2019s advantage in the incoming Senate. Similar to the coalition that successfully sent Jones to the Senate in 2017, Espy will have to turn out African-American voters and appeal to moderate white voters to win.\n\n\"We have to get the African-American vote out in higher numbers than it's ever come out before,\" he told ABC News. \"We have to make sure everyone regardless of race comes out. Get the African-American vote out. Get enough of what I call 'purple people.' They may be Republicans, they may be Independents, I don't care.\"\n\nBut some Republicans are intensifying their efforts to secure Hyde-Smith's hold on her seat amid growing concerns over her candidacy.\n\nOn the eve of the special election, Trump is heading back to the state for two rallies to salvage her presumptive lead. His visit to Tupelo and Biloxi, two GOP strongholds in the state, is being buttressed by support from national Republicans, who are spending more than $1 million on ads across the state.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump defended Hyde-Smith and said it was a \"shame\" that she is facing criticism over a comment \"said in jest\" when asked about her candidacy on the White House North Lawn Tuesday.\n\n\"She is a spectacular senator. She came in, did a fantastic job in a short period of time,\" the president told reporters. \"She made a statement which I know that she feels very badly about it, and it was just sort of said in jest. She's a tremendous woman, and and it's a shame that she has to go through this.\"\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee independent expenditure is contributing over $700,000 in ads and might boost their spending, according to a Republican source with knowledge of the ad buy. A first ad began airing on Nov. 15, focusing on Trump's \"drain the swamp\" rallying cry and attacking Espy as a \"high paid lobbyist.\"\n\nA top Republican super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, also began running ads statewide on Nov. 16, with an ad buy reaching just over $1 million for TV and radio through the runoff. There\u2019s also a $130,000 digital component, according to spokesperson Chris Pack.\n\nA new digital ad from Hyde-Smith's campaign, released Friday, touts an alleged connection between Espy and the African despot who refused to give up power in the Ivory Coast and is now on trial for crimes against humanity in International Criminal Court.\n\nThe statement and the ad are based on a Fox News report, released Thursday, that published a U.S. Department of Justice Foreign Agents Registration Act document that questions if Espy lied about receiving payments as part of a lobbying contract with the Ivory Coast's former president.\n\nHyde-Smith reported 17 new contributions totaling $65,700, including $5,000 from Google's PAC, on Tuesday, shortly after the controversy erupted, according to Open Secrets.\n\nGoogle's contribution is the PAC's first to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign, but the company told Open Secrets it was made far before her controversial remark.\n\n\"This contribution was made on November 2nd before Senator Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks became public on November 11th,\" a Google spokesperson told Open Secrets. \"We do not condone these remarks and would not have made such a contribution had we known about them.\"\n\nBut some top Republicans distanced themselves from Hyde-Smith in the wake of her controversial comments and even conceded that the outcome of this race is no longer assuredly in the hands of the GOP.\n\n\"I think we have to be concerned when candidates say stupid things,\" ABC News contributor and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said on ABC News\u2019s This Week. \"Candidates matter. And so now this race will be much more watched. I think the Republican will still win but I think they\u2019ll be much more watched because when candidates say things that, you know, aren\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t right, aren\u2019t smart, they get more attention.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thought the seat was legitimately in play, Michael Caputo, a former senior advisor to the Trump campaign, said on CNN, \"I think so. Mike Espy, by the way, appeals very much to white voters. He is a very bright man with a lot of history of strong contributions in Washington.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Facing criticism, Trump says he'll go to war zone", "description": "President Donald Trump says he will soon be visiting U.S. troops deployed in harm's way, amid criticism that he has yet to take such a trip", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/facing-criticism-trump-hell-war-zone-59325238", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_7ff074e733744089824167f9a8d63829_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:14:05Z", "content": "President Donald Trump says he will soon be visiting U.S. troops deployed in harm's way, amid criticism that he has yet to take such a trip since entering office.

But he has yet to embark on what has long been a traditional presidential pilgrimage important to the military: a visit to troops deployed in a war zone.\n\nAs he departed Tuesday for Florida to spend the Thanksgiving holiday at his private club in Palm Beach, Trump said he'd soon correct the oversight.\n\n\"I'm going to a war zone,\" he said in response to a reporter's question about his support for the troops. He did not say when he would be making the trip or where he would be going. An official said a White House team recently returned from beginning to plan for a visit.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday that visiting a war zone is a decision for the president, while adding that there have been times in the past when he has advised against visits to \"certain locations\" to avoid security risks to the president and the troops.\n\n\"There's places that I've been very straightforward I don't want him to go at certain times,\" Mattis said. He declined to elaborate.\n\nThe omission is one of a long list of norm-breaking moves that underscore the president's increasingly fraught relationship with the military, which has celebrated Trump's investments in defense spending but cringed at what some see as efforts to politicize their service.\n\nJust this week, Trump leveled criticism against the storied commander of the 2011 mission that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, retired Adm. William McRaven. \"Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn't it have been nice,\" Trump said.\n\nThe latest controversy followed a pattern of concerns raised by former senior military officers about Trump's grasp of the military's role, and it comes as White House aides and defense officials have raised alarm about what they view as the president's disinterest in briefings about troop deployments overseas.\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump appeared to try to deflect responsibility for the death of a service member, William \"Ryan\" Owens, in a failed operation in Yemen, saying planning for the mission began under his predecessor and was backed by senior military commanders.\n\n\"They explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected,\" he told \"Fox & Friends\" at the time. \"And they lost Ryan.\"\n\nTrump won the White House on a platform of ending U.S. military commitments abroad, but he's been bedeviled by many of the same challenges as his predecessors. More American troops are now deployed in conflict zones than when he took office.\n\nAides have suggested that Trump is wary of traveling to conflict zones where he doesn't fully support the mission. Trump begrudgingly backed a surge of troops in Afghanistan last year and boosted U.S. deployments in Iraq, Syria and Africa to counter the Islamic State and other extremist groups.\n\nTrump said last week in a \"Fox News Sunday\" interview that he was \"very much opposed to the war in Iraq. I think it was a tremendous mistake, should have never happened.\" Trump, in fact, offered lukewarm support for the invasion at the time but began offering public doubts about the mission after the conflict began in March 2003.\n\nAt home, some assert that Trump's decision to send thousands of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was a political stunt.\n\nTrump also drew criticism for his decision not to visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day, following his trip to Europe. He said later he \"should have\" visited the cemetery but was too busy with official business. His public schedule that day listed no events.\n\nIn the \"Fox News Sunday\" interview, Trump was asked why he hadn't visited the troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan in the two years he's served as commander in chief.\n\n\"Well, I think you will see that happen,\" he said. \"There are things that are being planned.\"\n\nHe also touted his support for the men and women in uniform.\n\n\"I don't think anybody's been more with the military than I have, as a president,\" Trump said. \"In terms of funding, in terms of all of the things I've been able to get them, including the vets, I don't think anybody's done more than me.\"\n\nTrump received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, four for education and one for a diagnosis of bone spurs \u2014 though he later told The New York Times he could not remember which foot was affected by the malady or how long it lasted.\n\nTrump told The Associated Press in a recent interview that he doesn't think visiting troops in a war zone is \"overly necessary.\"\n\n\"I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here,\" he added.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Dr. Johanna Kreafle and Dr. Sumir Shah", "title": "New hope for those with peanut allergies", "description": "A new experimental drug may allow allergy sufferers lead more normal lives.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hope-peanut-allergies/story?id=59323836", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY-peanuts-jef-170105_hpMain_6_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:09:09Z", "content": "A new experimental drug may help allergy sufferers lead more normal lives.

The drug, called AR101, is seeking FDA approval, and a new study has shown the results it produces in kids and teens. It doesn\u2019t cure the peanut allergy, but it allows those who suffer from it to have a less severe reaction.\n\nThese allergies are no joke. People with peanut allergies often have to change the way they travel, where they eat and how they live. Exposure -- even in very small amounts -- can lead to skin rashes, trouble breathing or even death.\n\nHistorically, once an allergy developed -- often at a young age -- parents had few options except watching over their child, and doctors would advise lifelong avoidance. For many children this meant showing up to birthday parties with their own treats, and taking a slew of medications.\n\nWhat kind of symptoms and reactions do kids have to foods they\u2019re allergic to?\n\nFor some kids, an allergic reaction to a particular food may just be an uncomfortable tingle in the lips and mouth. For others it\u2019s a medical emergency that is severe and even life-threatening. Food allergy symptoms usually take between a few minutes and two hours to develop after eating the offending food. The most common signs and symptoms include:\n\n- Tingling or itching in the mouth\n\n- Hives or itching of the skin\n\n- Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, and throat or other parts of the body\n\n- Nasal congestion\n\n- Difficulty breathing\n\n- Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting\n\n- Dizziness, lightheadedness\n\nSome children develop anaphylaxis, the severe reaction which can be life-threatening and includes a constriction of airways making it difficult to breathe, a severe drop in blood pressure, rapid pulse, dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness. People with symptoms of anaphylaxis should use their epinephrine auto-injector if they carry one and go immediately to the ER.\n\nThe new study, which used a representative survey of parents of nearly 40,000 U.S. children, found about one in five children who have a food allergy have gone to the ER for food allergy-related symptoms at least once in the previous year. This data is in line with previous research which showed there was nearly a 200 percent increase in food-induced severe allergic reaction ER visits from 2005 to 2014 among 5 to 17-year-olds.\n\nWhat Are the Treatments We Now Have for Severe Allergic Reactions?\n\nFor some people a mild allergic reaction can mean a skin rash and itchiness in the throat. For these people doctors recommend close monitoring of what foods might be causing this, and ingestion of antihistamines like Benadryl and Pepcid.\n\nIf you see someone having a severe allergic reaction it is important to act quickly and immediately call 911. At the scene you can use an epinephrine auto-injector and try to keep the person calm.\n\nIn the hospital, doctors will often treat the person with antihistamines and steroids through an IV, as well as epinephrine injected directly into the muscle of the thigh or arm to treat the reaction and blunt a possible reoccurrence at 4 - 6 hours after the initial exposure.\n\nWhat is AR101?\n\nA Cambridge University group showed in 2014 that by using a processed form of peanut flour they could induce a less severe allergic reaction over time in children. Now a new study called the PALISADES trial has presented a new option that is showing promising results \u2013 with AR101.\n\nIn the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers took people who were highly allergic to peanuts, unable to tolerate even half of a peanut without severe symptoms, and gave them either a placebo powder or AR101.\n\nAR101 is oral immunotherapy medication that is derived from peanuts themselves. The researchers exposed the group to small amounts of peanut-derived powder. The goal was not to cure the allergy, but rather to allow minor or accidental exposures to occur without setting off a life-threatening reaction.\n\nAfter months of ingesting the oral drug, many of the children we able to tolerate the equivalent 2 - 4 peanuts with a minor reaction, or no reaction at all. There were some challenges. Adverse reactions cause by the treatment caused 11 percent of the drug group to drop out and 14 percent of children in the drug group ended up using an epinephrine auto-injector for drug-related reactions. This is not a medication to start at home.\n\nThat being said, as almost one in fifty American children are allergic to peanuts, this new drug is likely to have a high demand. But there are questions that still need to be answered. We do not know the long-term effects of ingesting allergens and we do not know how long the dampened immune reaction will last. Yet, most parents would agree that eating a small pill daily to no longer live in fear is a small price to pay. However, it\u2019s unknown how much the drug would cost.\n\nJohanna Kreafle, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.\n\nSumir Shah, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician in New York City, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "New hope for those with peanut allergies - ABC News", "description": "Earth.com New hope for those with peanut allergies ABC News A new experimental drug may help allergy sufferers lead more normal lives.

Without grooming, fur can tangle, painfully tugging on a cat's skin and even potentially causing infections.\n\nCats groom their fur with the aid of hundreds of sharp, hollow, backward-facing spines carpeting their tongues called papillae, which consist of keratin, the same substance that hair and claws are made of. To find out what role these spines played, mechanical engineers Alexis Noel and David Hu at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta performed microscopic computed tomography scans of the tongues of six species of cats -- the domestic cat, bobcat, cougar, snow leopard, tiger and lion.\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta via AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe scientists found that papillae are shaped like scoops, which help them quickly absorb saliva through capillary action, the same effect that helps draw water up trees. High-speed videos of grooming cats revealed that felines can easily unload this saliva onto fur through licks, with each lick depositing nearly half the saliva on the tongue onto fur.\n\nThe papillae can reach deep into fur to reach the skin. Since cats cannot cool much through sweating -- they possess sweat glands only on their paws -- the saliva linked with grooming may help deliver nearly a quarter of the cooling effect cats need to keep a stable body temperature, the researchers noted.\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta via AFP/Getty Images\n\nThese findings inspired the scientists to create the tongue-inspired grooming (TIGR) brush -- a 3D-printed silicone rubber mimic of a cat tongue. They found it much easier to clean than a normal hairbrush, research they detailed online Nov. 19 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Such brushes could be used for people, or possibly on cats, perhaps to spread cleaning solutions so owners with cat allergies won't suffer the sniffles.\n\nReprinted with permission from Inside Science, an editorially independent news product of the American Institute of Physics, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing, promoting and serving the physical sciences."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "How cat tongues could inspire brushes for humans - ABC News", "description": "ABC News How cat tongues could inspire brushes for humans ABC News This story is from Inside Science.

He was arrested last week and arrived in the U.S. on Saturday, U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said.\n\nProsecutors allege in court documents that Vorotinov took out the life insurance policy in spring 2010 and designated his then-wife, Irina Vorotinov, as the primary beneficiary. The couple divorced later that year.\n\nThe scheme began to unfold in 2011, when police in Moldova were notified about a body at the entrance of the Cojusna village, in central Moldova. Documents with the body included Vorotinov's passport and hotel cards.\n\nProsecutors say Irina Vorotinov traveled to Moldova and identified the body as her ex-husband's. She then returned to the U.S. with a death certificate and cremated remains, and collected more than $2 million on his life insurance policy. Prosecutors say money ultimately was transferred to the couple's son and to accounts in Switzerland and Moldova.\n\nAccording to court documents, the FBI started investigating after an agent in Minnesota got a tip in June 2013 from an unknown person in Moldova who said Vorotinov had staged his own death. Later that year, his son, Alkon Vorotinov, was returning from a trip to Moldova when he was stopped by Customs and Border Protection in Detroit. His computer contained digital photographs of his father that were taken that year, showing he was alive.\n\nThe scheme also included a 2011 funeral service at a Minneapolis cemetery, where the urn was placed in a niche. As part of the investigation, the ashes were removed from the cemetery in 2015, tested and determined not to be Vorotinov's.\n\nIrina Vorotinov, 51, has pleaded guilty to two counts for her role in the plot and is serving a three-year prison sentence.\n\nAlkon Vorotinov, 28, pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to probation. At the time of his sentencing, his attorney said he came to the scheme late and believed his father was dead for more than a year. The Star Tribune reported that after initially telling authorities his father was the victim of a kidnap-for-ransom plot, he agreed to cooperate and said his father had been living in Moldova and Ukraine under another name.\n\nTogether, Irina and Alkon Vorotinov must repay more than $2 million to the insurance company.\n\nA preliminary hearing for Igor Vorotinov is scheduled for next week. His attorney, Hillary Parsons, did not immediately return a Tuesday message seeking comment.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/amyforliti"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "French banker on trial over arms scandals in Greece absconds", "description": "Greek authorities are searching for a French banker who they say escaped from house arrest while on trial in Athens for alleged involvement in corruption linked to major state procurements", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/french-banker-trial-arms-scandals-greece-absconds-59324599", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:50:57Z", "content": "Greek authorities are searching for a French banker who they say escaped from house arrest while on trial in Athens for alleged involvement in corruption linked to major state procurements.

But the technology depends on people coming forward to give a DNA sample via a cheek swab, and so far, there are not nearly as many volunteers as authorities had hoped for.\n\nAs of Tuesday, nearly two weeks after the inferno devastated the town of Paradise and surrounding areas, the number of confirmed dead stood at 81, and the sheriff's list of those unaccounted for had about 700 names.\n\nBut only about 60 people had provided samples to pop-up labs at the Butte County Sheriff's office in Oroville and an old Sears building in Chico, where the Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a disaster relief center, said Annette Mattern, a spokeswoman for ANDE, the Longmont, Colorado, company that is donating the technology.\n\n\"We need hundreds,\" Mattern said. \"We need a big enough sample for us to make a positive ID on these and to also give a better idea of how many losses there actually are.\"\n\nConfusion and conflicting information, the inability of relatives to travel to Northern California and mistrust of the government may be contributing to the low number.\n\nTara Quinones hadn't heard anything from her uncle, David Marbury, for eight days before she drove north from the San Francisco Bay Area to give a sample Friday. A worker used a small tool to scrape her cheek, took three swabs of skin and asked her detailed questions about who she was looking for and their relationship.\n\nThe uncle's landlord confirmed his house burned down with his vehicle still in the garage, but Quinones had no idea if any remains were found. Marbury's name keeps going on and off the ever-changing list of the missing.\n\n\"I did it just to be proactive,\" Quinones said Monday. \"This is the one way I could contribute to helping find my uncle.\"\n\nSome of those who have given DNA came forward, like Quinones, after learning about the identification effort in their desperate search for a loved one, others after the sheriff's office called to say that remains that probably belonged to a family member had been found.\n\nMattern declined to say Tuesday how many victims ANDE's technology has helped identify. Sheriff Kory Honea's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe fire was 75 percent contained Tuesday. Rain in the forecast for Wednesday through Thanksgiving weekend could aid in fighting the fire but could also bring flash floods and complicate efforts to recover remains.\n\nOnce DNA is extracted from the remains, it is placed in a vial that goes into a black machine that looks like a bulky computer printer. It takes just two hours to process the material and get a DNA profile; traditional methods can take days or weeks. If a relative's DNA is already in the system, a match will pop up right away.\n\nMattern said it has been surprisingly easy to get DNA from remains, despite the devastating damage done by the flames.\n\n\"We went in with pretty measured expectations, we didn't know what we were walking into,\" she said. \"We have a tremendous database now of the victims of the fire.\"\n\nRuth Dickover, director of the forensic science graduate program at the University of California-Davis, said that scientists have long been able to extract DNA from bone \u2014 a process that involves pulverizing the bone \u2014 but things can become more complicated if the remains of multiple people are mixed together.\n\n\"What's left may not give you a nice beautiful profile,\" she said.\n\nANDE won a contract in 2009 to do research and development for federal agencies, and the company's technology has been used in pilot programs for several years. Over the summer, it won FBI approval for use in accredited labs. Law enforcement agencies in Utah, New York and Miami have used the technology, as has the military.\n\nThis is the first time ANDE has helped identify victims after a natural disaster. The company has donated seven machines and about a dozen workers to the effort.\n\nSarah Warren drove an hour and a half from Redding on Monday to report her uncle, Devan Ruel, as missing. The sheriff's office gave her a number to call about missing people, and when she called, she was told authorities would contact her if they needed her DNA, she said.\n\nShe said no one told her about the collection desk at the old Sears, so she returned home without providing one.\n\n\"I could have done that so easily, just to be safe,\" she said.\n\nWarren hadn't talked to Ruel in about eight years and said the family did not have an address for him.\n\n\"He was just an off-the-grid type of guy,\" she said. \"If he did perish that way it would be horrific. It deeply, deeply saddens me to even consider that being a possibility.\"\n\nMattern said the sheriff's office is looking for a way to make it easier for families who don't live in Northern California to provide samples. And in hopes of easing fears that the DNA will be misused, the sheriff's office and the company gave assurances it will be deleted once it is no longer needed."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Julia Jacobo and Anne Laurent", "title": "Missing teacher found shot to death on dirt road, Mexican officials say", "description": "Patrick Braxton-Andrew, 34, never returned after taking a walk on Oct. 28, hotel staff in Urique, Mexico, told his parents.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/missing-north-carolina-teacher-found-shot-death-dirt/story?id=59322566", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/missing-teacher-ht-er-181105_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:31:54Z", "content": "A North Carolina teacher who disappeared in Mexico last month has been found shot to death on a dirt road, according to Mexican officials.

People are also being advised to throw out any romaine they have at home.\n\nThe contaminated lettuce is likely still on the market, Gottlieb told The Associated Press in a phone interview.\n\nHe said FDA wanted to issue a warning before people gathered for Thanksgiving meals, where the potential for exposure could increase.\n\n\"We did feel some pressure to draw conclusions as quickly as we could,\" he said.\n\nIn Canada, officials issued similar warnings to the two provinces where people were sickened. They said there was no evidence to suggest people in other parts of the country had been affected.\n\nMost romaine sold this time of year is grown in California, Gottlieb said. The romaine lettuce linked to the E. coli outbreak earlier this year was from Yuma, Arizona. Tainted irrigation water appeared to be the source of that outbreak, which sickened about 200 people and killed five.\n\nThe FDA's blanket warning in the current outbreak is broader and more direct than the ones issued in the earlier outbreak, said Robert Whitaker, chief science officer for the Produce Marketing Association. In the earlier outbreak, the warnings about romaine from Yuma might have been confusing, he said.\n\nWhitaker said the industry group told members they should cooperate with the FDA and stop supplying romaine lettuce, especially since people have been told to stop buying and eating it.\n\nNo deaths have been reported in the current outbreak, but 13 people in the U.S. and six in Canada have been hospitalized. The last reported U.S. illness was on Oct. 31, while and the most recent illness in Canada was early this month.\n\nTracing the source of contaminated lettuce can be difficult because it's often repackaged by middlemen, said Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. That can mean the entire industry becomes implicated in outbreaks, even if not all products are contaminated.\n\n\"One of the problems with produce is that it can be very hard to trace back,\" she said.\n\nShe said washing contaminated lettuce won't ensure that harmful germs are killed.\n\nInfections from E. coli can cause symptoms including severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Most people recover within a week, but some illnesses can last longer and be more severe.\n\nHealth officials have also been reminding people to properly handle and cook their Thanksgiving birds amid a widespread salmonella outbreak linked to raw turkey. Last week, Hormel recalled some packages of Jennie-O ground turkey that regulators were able to tie to an illness.\n\nBut unlike with romaine lettuce, regulators are not warning people to avoid turkey. Salmonella is not prohibited in raw meat and poultry, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which overseas raw meat, said cooking should kill any salmonella.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

So Candice Bergen picked the perfect time to reprise her role as Murphy brown who continues her tradition of taking on real-life hot topics that aren't always political. Take a look. Happy Thanksgiving. Turkey hotline, this is Ken. How can I help you? This is my first time cooking a Turkey and I want to do it justice. It weighs 25 pounds and cost $350. $350. What's it stuffed with? iPhones? Look. It's a heritage bird. It grew up on a farm in Vermont. It ate nothing but organic grains. It speaks three languages. A little tight today, are we? We lax. This is the Turkey hot line, not the suicide hot line. Please welcome back the fabulous Candice Bergen. ?????? Hi. So. This is so cozy. It's kind of comfortable. It's not bad. Whose idea was it to bring back \"Murphy brown\"? Because I remember people had been talking about it. We asked from time to time, would we want to bring it back, and Diane English and I who are friends would talk and we would say, we did it. What's the point? And then now we thought there is a point. If the election had gone differently, we would not have brought it back, but -- Right. It's because of trump that it's back. Is that what you are saying? Yes. Yes, it is. Has he reacted to it at all? Not at all. He has been smart because of course, we would have loved nothing better, but no, he hasn't. He has been quiet. If he is out of office next year, then the show goes off the air? It would be a small price to pay. That's right. So \"The view\" was included in the first episode of this season. Yes. We want to show a clip if that's okay. Yes. You remember why I left FYI? I couldn't take the pressure anymore. Right. You needed a break. Then I wept back to work. And you took that job we told you not to. I thought it would be a piece of cake. I was wrong. So wrong. Two years on \"The view\" nearly killed me. Those women, the gossip, the back stabbing every day. It was like an episode of \"Game of thrones.\" We all chuckled about that. I hope so. Well, the original \"Murphy brown\" was groundbreaking and you handled issues like harassment and being a single mom and women come up to you and thank you for handling those topics. They thank me because I'm the visible part of \"Murphy brown.\" They thank me for dealing with breast cancer because their mothers had breast cancer or because Murphy inspired them to become the television producer, the TV journalist that they had wanted to be, but wouldn't have dared to be otherwise, and they -- they say that it was a wonderful experience to watch the show with their mom, and so it's just that people have been very appreciative and that continues which great. You paved the way for a lot of storylines which is great. You were on \"Snl\" two weeks ago to honor Jonah hill in what they call the five-timer's host club. You're also apart of that. Let's show a clip of this. You get your butt in here, Jonah. Welcome to the five-timer's club, Seth. Oh, no. I'm not Seth rogen. I'm Jonah hill. That's not the same guy? I know you're very familiar with any work, candy. Sure. And something that not everyone may know about you, but you were the first woman to ever host \"Snl.\" I was the third host ever. I did the third show and I was the first woman to host and I mentioned that to drew barrymore as we were backstage waiting for our cue and she said, I was the youngest host. I was 7. She said, and Steven Spielberg and robin Williams were in the audience to support me and I just said, I'm never mentioning the story again. I was so outclassed. Take us back to that moment being the first woman. What was going through your mind at the time? At the time, I was panic-seized. I'm not thinking about being the first woman. I'm just trying to -- Survive. When you are standing on the lip of that stage and you have -- the light goes red and the cue cards and you go -- Lauren said it was, like, the expression that Patty Hurst must have had when the sla rang her door. It's just immense terror the first time you do it. And you have got all that. Chevy. I'm really thrilled about this because you're going to get your first star on the Hollywood walk of fame next year, and I want to put my two cents in because I'm hoping they put you next to your dad. Wells thank you, whoopi. That's what we're hoping too, so I don't know if that will work out. I think -- I think there is no reason why they can't, and congratulations by the way. Thank you very much. Candice's father is the famous ventriloquist who had a famous dummy named Charlie Mccarthy. We grew up with it. Yeah. Yeah. You have to be of a certain age. But, you know, we always have to be of a certain age, don't we? We always do. Listen. Congratulations on the show. We thank you for coming. You have to come back, and we'll hang out some more and we don't mind being part of \"Murphy brown.\" We're proud to include you. It's funny. It's a good show. We can take it. Trust me.

Is this a good move? He is hilarious. Is he? He is a biographer. He writes about Alexander Hamilton. He is a biographer. What was the comment that said Democrats have no sense of humor? Yesterday. Tim Allen. Why didn't they invite Tim? There is a lot of comedians that could do that. They should understand that comedians are on the side of the press basically. We're all about free speech so to call and get rid of the comedians is a stupid, stupid move in my opinion. I wonder why they did it. It seems sort of like a cowardly move to me. Just because it's been a tradition not since it started in 1921, but it's been a tradition since the '80s and I thought, this president can't take it. He is a little too thin-skinned. Do you change the entire tradition because you want him to show up? I couldn't figure out why they did it. Sarah Sanders could go on and do five minutes on why trump is afraid of the rain. That's hilarious. I don't think they made the decision because of president trump though. I still don't think he is going to show up this year. His historian is going to come and talk about the freedom of the press which is a hit at the president in its own way. If anything, it's a hit to the reporter that is go because this is like the oscars for the reporters and media. It's the moment where they feel like celebrities and when you get the media, you wait to see if they will call out the network or the reporters and I don't think it's going to be as fun. People or losing their sense of humor. Comedy is in jeopardy right now. It's, like, the dumbest event and I'm sorry, Michelle wolf came on this very show and she said -- we have a clip. She said she didn't care. Her words. How would you feel if you killed another comedian's job? I mean, I don't care. It's not, like, a great job. I mean, I think everyone that's ever done it has been, like, great. Now I don't have to do it again. The whole time I called it a homework assignment. She became a household name after the event though as have a lot of people. Steen Colbert did it, and I disagreed with her. As much as I don't like the dinner, it's a great platform for a comedian so, you know. It's a fundraiser for young journalists. I hope we don't lose that part of it. No, I don't think we will. It really killed those events, and it was Obama. No comedian could follow him. He is hilarious. Self-deprecating. Reagan was famous for that too. Reagan was funny. I actually -- I don't know. I enjoyed the white house correspondents dinner and I think it's fun. You see your colleagues and I think the comedian was a highlight for many of us and it was a highlight when the president came back after being roasted and then roasted the media. Unfortunately because of the relationship that you see now between this administration and the media, I think it's lost. Last year got so, in my opinion, I didn't think Michelle wolf was funny and I think it got so personal in attacking Sarah Sanders and I couldn't imagine that happening with, like, the Obama white house or people that work for him. I don't see that, but a lot of people did. To me, it wasn't funny at all. What? Were you in the room? I watched the whole thing. We were kind of cracking up in the room. Sorry. It also depends on whether or not you like anybody in the trump administration. It's the lens you view it in. Sarah Sanders should have written with it. She looked all pissy. Mitch Mcconnell got the worst one. She went after the media. It was off the record. I would say the gridiron with comedians and people know how to keep their mouths shut aren't tweeting about it and that's the secret. Like we have talked about it with roasts here at -- what is the -- The friar's club. If you want to make fun of one another, I'm 100% down with that, but maybe you don't want everyone in the world knowing. Not televised. Actually, none of these should be televised. They should never be televised because those roasts are -- you're supposed to get roasted by your friends, people who know you, people who love you and once you put it in the public ear, everybody responds. Everybody has something to say about it. I know a little something about this. These roasts are for the people in the room. Not for everybody. It's different in the room. The dinner with trump is nobody loves him. The comedians don't love him, so you have to love the president to be able to roast the president. People don't like him. I don't think that's true. Some people in the country love him. He is a nasty guy. I think it hurts the press. No sense of humor. Why would you talk about him? A bunch of press in the room saying, we hate trump and he is whatever. This is what is feeding his base. They hate the media. This is about the dinner. This is not about his base. This is about the newspapers. He sees the coverage of it and they see it as an attack. Again, as usual, I'm just trying to explain it. As usual. As usual. Because I'm just saying, like, you want to know what some people in the middle of the country are like, I mean -- He just lost the house. He is going down. Okay. We'll be right back. Wait. Trump has it in the bag. In 2020, he is not going to get re-elected. Show this clip on election night please. Please do. Please do. We'll be right back.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Ivanka Trump sent government emails via a personal account, report says", "description": "\"The View\" co-hosts weigh in on Ivanka Trump reportedly using a personal email account to send government emails.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/theview/video/ivanka-trump-government-emails-personal-account-report-59323295", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/theview/181120_view_seg1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:03:47Z", "content": "Now Playing: Ivanka Trump's personal email account under scrutiny Now Playing: Comey: Clinton's actions with the email server were 'really sloppy' Now Playing: White House correspondents' dinner organizers replace comedian with historian Now Playing: Ivanka T\u2026 [+1283 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Ivanka Trump sent government emails via a personal account, report says\n\nWelcome to \"The view.\" Now we all know what a serious issue the guy in the white house thinks using personal e-mails accounts for professional government business is. Look at this. This is the biggest scandal since watergate. For what she has done, they should lock her up. It's disgraceful. The American people fully understand her corruption and we hope all, all justice will finally be served. So of course, they just blew the joke, but we all knew who he was talking about, but now he is talking about his daughter we think because she used her personal account to send hundreds of e-mails about government business last year. How do you think they are going to spin this? Do you think anybody will be yelling lock her up? This girl was there in 2016. Was she in a convent? She was watching TV just like the rest of us. How dumb can a person be to make the same mistake that he has been about the whole time? People, wake up. Wasn't she unclear about how this gets used? That was going to be my point so maybe there is something and maybe they need to look and see if there are some complicated things. It's what the report says. They have ig nance to the rules and I never worked it in white house, but I worked in the justice department for seven years. It's one of the first things they tell you. It's about the e-mail e-mail. I have a personal and private e-mail. I work for ABC news and I don't think that you combine your personal life with your work life. Right. And you certainly don't do it when you work for the government. I call B.S. On I didn't know better. It's the height of hypocrisy. That's one of the things her father ran on and it was a significant part of his plat platform, but when you do this, that's the kind of nepotism in the white house. Her role is unprecedented and she made $3.9 million from her family's hotel in D.C. In 2017 and that money I think is a violation of emoluments clause. When are people going to talk about that? I don't know when they are going to talk about that. Breaking rules left and right. I thought it was interesting that both women had the same thing about these e-mails and it made me wonder. Is there something that makes you unsure about whether you should be using your personal e-mail to be sending stuff? Based off the accounts in December of 2016 after trump won so there is really no excuse. We want to talk about hypocrisy, we'll be here all day long because the list can go on and on. That's true. He was talking about draining the swamp, dozens have beenited. The e-mails. He has got an e-mail situation. He is in the middle of a constitutional crisis. My dad being the ambassador to Russia, the democracy to our elections, the threats are the Russians and people trying to hack into our systems. I don't think there is a gray area in terms of when you get a formal e-mail in the white house, you use that because they will get into your e-mails. I know ivanka a little bit. I have exchanged e-mails on the white house account and texts and all that. She is as scripted as they come, so the Democrats will use their time, and they have talked about investigating this. The truth of the matter is -- Most of the e-mails were about her kids' scheduling. But -- There is a -- I think it's hypocritical and one of your dad's taglines is lock her up about an e-mail controversy, that you should know the reason for that reason alone. I will say let us not forget Hillary had e-mails deleted by a computer specialist as she had her aides smash her devices with a hammer. Does that make it different if both things are on dollars. I'm trying to explain the Republican side of this. But it provoked the question, does that change the fact that people are using their personal e-mails? Regardless of how they did it, but does it change the fact that they are using personal e-mails? E-mails during an investigation is still different and smashing devices with a hammer to me is still different. Do I think it's hypocritical? 100%. Do I think she should have known better? 100%, but we should be more concerned about, and my father said this. When a car alarm is going off every day, you get desensitized to what's important. We should be fearful of our president using his personal phone. I care much more about that.

But then the number of cases jumped to 239 million.\n\nThe disease is still clearly a danger \u2013 especially to those in African countries and in India, which account for 80 percent of the world\u2019s malaria burden.\n\nTreatment in India shows some encouraging signs but the news in Africa isn\u2019t as hopeful. Half of all Africans in affected areas still do not have access to sleeping nets to keep malarial mosquitoes at bay. Last year 435,000 people died from malaria \u2013 essentially 1 person per minute \u2013 and international efforts still have strides to make before the malaria epidemic can be stopped.\n\nAmpe Rogerio/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat is malaria?\n\nMalaria is a serious blood-borne disease carried by mosquitoes. Five major types of malaria parasites affect humans but the most common is known by doctors as P. falciparum. The disease begins when a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Malaria then enters the bloodstream and infected people may not show any symptoms for up to 10-12 days. As the blood cells become damaged, the symptoms begin.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe symptoms begin about one week after infection but can be delayed for those on preventive medications. These medications, however, do not offer 100 percent protection. At first people exhibit flu-like symptoms \u2013 chills, fevers, body aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There\u2019s a cycle: coldness and shivering, followed by fevers every two days. The symptoms can also progress to include anemia (low red blood cell count) and jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) due to the breakdown of red blood cells. Finally, if the disease isn\u2019t treated quickly, severe symptoms can include organ failure, seizures and death.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nAnybody, though malaria is more common in those living and traveling to endemic areas such as South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Malaria knows no geographic boundaries -- it can even travel from a mother to her fetus before or during delivery.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\n\nIn areas where the disease is common, doctors are often able to make preliminary diagnoses based on physical symptoms alone. In areas such as the United States where the disease is rare, doctors use clues like travel history and common blood tests that can show higher than normal levels of bilirubin \u2013 an indication that red blood cells are breaking down. The final diagnosis is made by looking at blood cells under a microscope or by using a commercially available rapid diagnostic test.\n\nPrevention\n\nPrevention is the best treatment. Before traveling to a country where malaria is rampant, it is important to consult one's doctor, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website or its malaria hotline at 1-855-856-4731. Any travel to tropical or sub-tropical areas (Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Central and South America) should raise a red flag. A doctor will be able to advise the best preventive drug. Some treatments, however, require time before reaching adequate levels in the body so the CDC recommends contacting a health care professional four to six weeks prior to travel. Infants and children should also take anti-malarial medications but their drug choices will be limited.\n\nOther techniques rely on the phrase \u201cfight the bite.\u201d Sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito nets, use insect repellent during the day and wear long-sleeved clothing in the evening or at night.\n\nSia Kambou/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nFor women who are pregnant, the CDC recommends against traveling to areas with high rates of malaria. Malaria increases the risk for serious problems in a pregnancy -- prematurity and miscarriage -- and can also be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy or delivery.\n\nTreatment\n\nMalaria is treated with anti-malarial medications. The exact medications used depends on the type of malaria and how severe the disease is. Many simple cases can be treated just by taking oral medications, such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Those treatments are about 90 percent effective and this type of malaria has the lowest level of resistance to it. If the bug is P. vivax, a separate treatment regimen is used to empty the liver of malarial infection. If the infection is severe \u2013 most commonly from P. falciparum \u2013 intravenous medications and hospital admission may be needed.\n\nAmit Dave/Reuters, FILE\n\nWhat\u2019s in store for the future?\n\nMany developed countries are well on their way to eradication. The U.S., for example, has only 1,500 to 2,000 cases per year -- most of them in travelers. The WHO has been very active in promoting efforts to decrease malaria infections and is continuously monitoring cases to see where the highest risk areas are in the world.\n\nThe WHO is also in the process of rolling out a vaccine for the P. falciparum type of malaria. A vaccine called \u201cRTS,S\u201d is the first that has shown partial protection. A pilot phase in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi has shown encouraging results from a five-year trial: the prevention rate was 39 percent and side effects were minimal for those taking the vaccine for four years.\n\nSumir Shah, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician in New York City and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Malaria progress stalls, new report says - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Malaria progress stalls, new report says ABC News Progress against eradicating malaria seems to have stopped, according to a new report from the World Health Organization.

But it's also kind of been a negative in one way because the guy was such a monosyllabic guy,\" Lundgren said. \"He was a robot.\"\n\nThis month, Lundgren reprises the role of Drago in \"Creed II,\" as much a sequel to the previous film as it is to \"Rocky IV.\" Lundgren remains grateful to Stallone, not only for casting him in the first place, but for bringing him back in a heartier, more substantial role.\n\n\"I got a chance to play a guy who was a real person and who has real problems, especially a father-son relationship. When I see father-son relationships in movies, it always gets me emotional. And I had a chance to be part of that,\" Lundgren said.\n\nBack in \"Rocky IV,\" Drago kills Apollo Creed in the ring, only to lose to Rocky Balboa. But he loses much more than a match.\n\nIn \"Creed II,\" we learn he is living in squalor after the embarrassing loss. He is raising his son Viktor, played by Florian Munteanu, to be a boxer and is seeking revenge on Rocky by getting his son to fight the son of the man he killed.\n\nMunteanu said he felt a bond with Lundgren. \"It's an honor to play his son,\" he said. \"He wanted to create a father-son relationship right from the beginning.\"\n\nLundgren had a unique trajectory that led him to the big screen. He was an engineering student in Melbourne, Australia, when he met actress Grace Jones. While dating, she took him to New York and introduced to him people like Andy Warhol and Michael Jackson. It didn't hurt that he was a karate champion when Stallone discovered him.\n\nSince then, he's had a busy action-movie career, which includes \"The Expendables\" trilogy, portraying He-Man in \"Masters of the Universe,\" and the upcoming \"Aquaman.\" Still, he admits to soul searching when it came to his career path.\n\n\"'Why did I quit MIT? Why didn't I continue with engineering? Why did I become an actor?'

That's kind of what my part in this earth has been, I guess.\"\n\nThis time around, there wasn't a lot of action scenes for Lundgren, and he was fine with that.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nVote counting was scheduled to be finished Tuesday evening.\n\nAfter provisional ballots in Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County were counted Monday night, McAdams opened up a 739-vote lead over Love, who has yet to concede the race.\n\nIn a press conference Monday evening, McAdams declared victory, calling his lead \"insurmountable\" and writing on Twitter that it is \"Time to put election year politics aside, come together to get things done in Congress for Utah families.\"\n\nLove issued a written statement Monday evening that did not include a concession.\n\nSteve Griffin/The Deseret News via AP\n\n\"I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the voters, who along with our family, have been waiting for two weeks to get election results. Thank you for your continued participation in this process,\" Love wrote.\n\nIf McAdams ultimately emerges victorious, his win would increase Democrats' net gain in the House in 2018 to a total of 38 seats, the largest shift in the party's favor since the 1974 election, held in the wake of the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of Republican President Richard Nixon.\n\nMcAdams was also one of 16 Democrats who signed a letter released Monday saying they will oppose Nancy Pelosi's bid to become the next House speaker, lending even greater importance to the race' final result.\n\nLove, the sole African-American woman in the GOP ranks in Congress, is no stranger to close races. She lost her first bid for Congress in 2012 by just 768 votes to Democratic incumbent Jim Matheson, only to win the seat by just over 7,000 votes in 2014.\n\nA Love loss, coupled with the retirement of longtime Miami-area GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, would further thin the Republican Party's diversity in Congress, and would make Washington Congresswoman Jaime Herrera-Butler the only Republican woman of color in the U.S. House when the 116th Congress is sworn in next year, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nUS House of Representatives\n\nIn an interview last week with on CBS, incoming House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy acknowledged that the party could do a better job at honing diversity within its congressional ranks.\n\n\"We have room for improvement. If you look at, in the Democratic primaries where there was an open seat and it was a woman versus a man, a woman won 69 percent of the time. So, of course, they had more women coming forward. We can do better in recruitment, and that's what I'm excited about doing.\"\n\nAccording to data compiled by ABC News, a total of 114 women were elected to the U.S Congress in 2018. Of those 114, 99 are Democrats and 15 are Republicans.\n\nAnother thing Love is accustomed to is criticism from President Donald Trump, who personally lambasted the congresswoman, along with several other unsuccessful GOP candidates this cycle who he claims lost in large part due to their unwillingness to embrace him and his agenda.\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love,\" Trump said at a press conference at the White House the day after the election, \"And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\"\n\nLove has also been unafraid to criticize President Trump and his administration on multiple occasions, most recently his proposal to end birthright citizenship for children whose parents immigrated to the United States.\n\n\"I have always opposed presidential attempts to change immigration law unilaterally,\" Love said in a statement last month, according to the Salt Lake Tribune, \"\u201cThe Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to \u2018establish a uniform rule of naturalization\u2019 and the 14th Amendment makes the conditions of citizenship clear: Individuals born in this country are citizens.\"\n\nBoth Salt Lake and Utah County will complete their canvass of votes on Tuesday afternoon, local officials confirmed to ABC News."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: North Korea detonates DMZ guard posts at southern border", "description": "North Korea blew up 10 of its front-line guard posts in the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas on Tuesday in accordance with agreements made with South Korea earlier this year.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/north-korea-detonates-dmz-guard-posts-southern-border-59321160", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181120_vod_orig_dmz_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:56:59Z", "content": "Now Playing: Everyday life in North Korea Now Playing: US tensions with North Korea on the rise Now Playing: 70th anniversary of North Korea Now Playing: North Korea detonates DMZ guard posts at southern border Now Playing: At least 43 killed in bombing of Af\u2026 [+1121 chars]", "fulltext": "Now Playing: Everyday life in North Korea\n\nNow Playing: US tensions with North Korea on the rise\n\nNow Playing: 70th anniversary of North Korea\n\nNow Playing: US missionary killed by remote tribe off the coast of India\n\nNow Playing: American killed by tribesman knew island was off limits\n\nNow Playing: Meghan Markle's royal visit\n\nNow Playing: American believed to have been killed by isolated tribe in India: Reports\n\nNow Playing: A turkey's press conference, wildfire battle, rebels rest: World in Photos\n\nNow Playing: Police help cat locked out of Prime Minister Theresa May's office\n\nNow Playing: 1st look at new documentary about Meghan Markle's new royal life\n\nNow Playing: Trump's statement of support for Saudi Crown Prince suspected in journalist's death\n\nNow Playing: Woman who fell to her death on cruise did not want to go: Family\n\nNow Playing: Trump defends US-Saudi Arabia bond amid Khashoggi updates\n\nNow Playing: Why Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's royal baby will make history\n\nNow Playing: North Korea detonates DMZ guard posts at southern border\n\nNow Playing: At least 43 killed in bombing of Afghan religious celebration: Officials\n\nNow Playing: Giraffe cub, migrants and a snowy meadow: World in Photos\n\nNow Playing: This is London's newest skyscraper\n\nNow Playing: Family of woman who fell to her death on cruise ship demands answers"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Judge says families 'shattered,' wants Iraqi detainees freed", "description": "A federal judge has ordered the U.S. government to release about 100 Iraqi nationals who are under deportation orders but have been in custody for more than six months", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/judge-families-shattered-iraqi-detainees-freed-59321644", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:52:44Z", "content": "A Detroit federal judge has ordered the U.S. government to release about 100 Iraq i nationals who are under deportation orders but have been in custody for more than six months.

That's a key measure of health for a retailer. Online sales also surged. Target reported a 49 percent increase in online sales, which was better than expected.\n\nBut shares of Target and the parent of TJ Maxx took a hit after reporting that their third-quarter profit results were squeezed by higher e-commerce costs. Kohl's delivered strong third-quarter results, but it issued a cautious annual profit forecast. Best Buy, which has been on a winning streak, couldn't win over investors even as it boosted its annual earnings guidance.\n\n\"There are clearly a bit of two worlds. Everything we're seeing about the consumer is very positive,\" Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly told reporters on a conference call Tuesday. \"Consumer confidence is at an all-time high...unemployment is incredibly low, wages are going up.\"\n\nBut, he cautioned, \"The financial market can be a different picture and we'll see how it evolves.\"\n\nThe National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, is expecting holiday retail sales in November and December \u2014 excluding automobiles, gasoline and restaurants \u2014 to increase as much as 4.8 percent over 2017 for a total of $720.89 billion. The sales growth marks a slowdown from last year's 5.3 percent, which was the largest gain since 2010.\n\nBut the figure is still healthy and is the latest indication that the retail industry is far from an apocalypse that some feared only a year ago and a half ago. The growth forecast, which includes online sales, is slower than the average annual increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years.\n\nAdobe Analytics, which analyzes visits to retail websites, predicts a 15 percent increase in online sales to $124.1 billion in online sales for November and December.\n\nStill, retailers are facing a host of challenges. They're grappling with an even stronger Amazon from a year ago, higher labor costs and surging online sales that are putting more pressure on their profit margins. Retailers are also monitoring the impact on tariffs that have been slapped on a variety of different goods imported from China, although holiday merchandise will likely not be affected because they're already in U.S. warehouses. Any price increases could come starting early 2019.\n\nBut so far, there seems to be no warning signs that the strong economic times will end anytime soon.\n\n\"We continue to see a healthy consumer environment as we enter the fourth quarter,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with reporters. He noted there's no indication that the consumer environment is slowing down.\n\nRetailers have been plowing money into their businesses, remodeling stores while trying to speed up online deliveries.\n\nEarly last year, Target began a three-year plan to invest $7 billion in its stores and online operations. Kohl's has been sprucing up its merchandise and is now allowing shoppers to return goods purchased through Amazon at 100 stores.\n\nBest Buy has shown resilience in the face of increasing online competition by allowing shoppers to test new technology, and offering speedier delivery options. It's also been expanding its tech support services, including a free service in a couple hundred markets where salespeople visit customers at home to make recommendations on TVs, setup and more.\n\nTJX, which operates T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods, has been bolstering its fashion business, resulting in a hefty 7 percent increase in consolidated same-store sales in the quarter compared to a year ago. But higher freight costs took a bite out of profits.\n\nDespite the snag, \"TJX's overall success underlines the fact that even in a strong economy where disposable incomes are rising, consumers still enjoy getting a bargain,\" wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, a retail research firm.\n\nMeanwhile, Gap Inc., which runs the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, reported earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations. But its sales at established stores were flat, weighed by a 7 percent drop at its namesake stores.\n\n\"We are clearly not satisfied with the performance of Gap brand,\" said CEO Art Peck. \"We know this iconic brand is important to customers, and we are committed to taking the bold and necessary steps to ensure that it delivers value to shareholders.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: At least 43 killed in bombing of Afghan religious celebration: Officials", "description": "A large explosion targeting a religious gathering in Afghanistan's capital has killed at least 43 people and injured at least 83 others, the country's health ministry said.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/43-killed-bombing-afghan-religious-celebration-officials-59320364", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181120_abc_afghanbombing_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:26:33Z", "content": "Now Playing: At least 43 killed in bombing of Afghan religious celebration: Officials Now Playing: Giraffe cub, migrants and a snowy meadow: World in Photos Now Playing: This is London's newest skyscraper Now Playing: Family of woman who fell to her death on \u2026 [+1215 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for At least 43 killed in bombing of Afghan religious celebration: Officials\n\n--\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Trump says no new punishment for writer's murder", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign, also known as BDS, has claimed a number of successes in recent years, leading Israel to identify it as a major threat.\n\nIsraeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called on Airbnb to reverse what he called a \"discriminatory decision\" and \"disgraceful surrender\" to the boycott movement, vowing that Israel would retaliate.\n\n\"If you have a policy of discrimination against Israelis you cannot earn money in Israel,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nHe also said the government would encourage hosts in West Bank settlements to sue the company to make it \"pay\" for its decision. Levin added that Israel would impose other restrictions on Airbnb's operations in the country, without elaborating.\n\nAirbnb announced on Monday that it would delist some 200 properties in the coming days and cease its operations in Israeli settlements \"that are at the core of the dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians.\" The company declined to comment on the Israeli threats.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Today over 400,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, in addition to some 200,000 Israelis in east Jerusalem.\n\nMost of the international community considers settlements illegal and an impediment to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Israel sees the territory as disputed and says the fate of the settlements must be resolved in peace negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\nThe boycott movement, which calls for sanctions against settlement products and companies doing business in the West Bank, has made inroads in recent years, helping to tarnish Israel's international image and prompting it to take retaliatory measures.\n\nIsrael has enacted a law banning any foreigner who \"knowingly issues a public call for boycotting Israel\" from entering the country. It has identified activist groups from around the world whose members can be denied entry upon arrival.\n\nBDS supporters say that in urging businesses, artists and universities to sever ties with Israel, they are using nonviolent means to resist unjust policies toward Palestinians. Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize or destroy the Jewish state.\n\nThe Palestinian-led movement claims responsibility for pressuring some large companies to stop or alter operations in Israel or the West Bank, including carbonated drink maker SodaStream, French construction company Veolia and international mobile phone giant Orange.\n\nAirbnb's decision coincided with the publication of a Human Rights Watch report Tuesday investigating tourist rental listings in settlements by Airbnb and Booking.com.\n\nEntitled \"Bed-and-Breakfast on Stolen Land,\" the report says that Israeli settlements' discrimination against Palestinians uniquely violates humanitarian law and Airbnb's nondiscrimination policy. Most Palestinians must obtain a permit to enter the settlements or Israel proper and typically do so as laborers.\n\nOmar Shakir, Human Rights Watch's Israel-Palestine director, said that with its threatened sanctions, Israel was prioritizing its support for settlements over a thriving tourism industry in Israel proper that relies on services like Airbnb. If applied, the sanctions could affect lodging costs for thousands of tourists expected to arrive in Tel Aviv next year for the Eurovision song contest.\n\nShakir said the government's response \"reflects the degree to which the government is willing to go, putting the whole country's interests at stake over its illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch, along with Palestinian officials and other rights groups, have for years pressured Airbnb to pull out of Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nSenior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat called Airbnb's decision an \"initial positive step,\" and urged the company to extend its decision to Israeli listings in east Jerusalem.

But \u2026 [+6971 chars]", "fulltext": "After galloping along for the past two years, the global economy is showing signs of weakening, with the United States, China and Europe all facing the rising threat of a slowdown.\n\nFew economists foresee an outright global recession within the next year. But the synchronized growth that powered most major economies since 2017 appears to be fading. The risks have been magnified by the trade war raging between the United States and China, the strife dividing Britain over an exit from the European Union and the Federal Reserve's continuing interest rate hikes.\n\nIt's all been enough to contribute to a broad retreat in global stock markets. Counting Tuesday's deep losses, U.S. stock indexes, once up around 10 percent for the year, have surrendered all their 2018 gains.\n\nThe Fed is expected next month to raise its key short-term rate for the fourth time this year. The central bank's rate hikes help control inflation. But they also make loans costlier for consumers and businesses. And for countries that borrowed in U.S. dollars, the Fed's hikes make debts harder to bear. Argentina, for one, has slid into recession as its cost of repaying its debt has surged.\n\n\"We can't continue to grow this fast for much longer without risking inflation,\" Adrian Cooper, chief executive of Oxford Economics, said of the still-solid U.S. economy. \"That's ultimately what the Fed is trying to achieve with its steady movement in interest rates. The skill is to do so in ways that don't create a big downturn.\"\n\nThe concerns have grown enough that Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, on Tuesday dismissed the worries roiling the markets.\n\n\"Recession is so far in the distance I can't see it,\" Kudlow told a group of reporters outside the White House. \"Keep the faith. It's a very strong economy.\"\n\nThe collective growth of the world's major economies in the past two years was broadly welcomed after a feeble recovery from the 2008 financial crises. Yet few economists saw accelerated growth as sustainable \u2014 or even desirable \u2014 over several years.\n\nThe concern is that a prolonged global expansion could ignite inflation or speculative investing that would inevitably send vulnerable economies into a downturn. Compounding the challenge, the world's economies are linked more than ever through trade, finance and investment \u2014 to the point that a rupture in one major nation tends to spread across the globe.\n\nOxford Economics predicts that the growth of the global economy, as measured by its gross domestic product, will slip from 3.1 percent this year to 2.8 in 2019. Such a slowdown is enough to crimp corporate profits and business investment, Cooper said. Still, most American and European workers probably wouldn't feel the pain, he said, in part because of a resilient job market and lower oil prices.\n\n\"2019 is still going to look pretty good \u2014 your job is going to be safe, and your wages are going to rise,\" Cooper predicted while adding that he thinks the slowdown will worsen in 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, though, stock markets have endured waves of jittery selling as investors have tried to factor in a slowdown that could depress the growth of company profits.\n\n\"Financial markets have become a little more volatile and anxious of late, worried about slowing global growth, trade tensions, Brexit woes and concerns that the U.S. may not be able to sustain its current cyclical sweet spot,\" said Josh Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.\n\nOver the next two years, most forecasts suggest that U.S. growth, after cresting above 3 percent this year \u2014 its best performance since 2005 \u2014 will weaken. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged in a speech last week that the strong worldwide growth of 2017 is in retreat.\n\n\"You see signs of a gradual slowdown,\" Powell said.\n\nGoldman Sachs foresees annual U.S. growth slowing to 1.75 percent by the end of 2019. The predicted weakening stems, in part, from the front-loaded stimulus of the tax cuts Trump pushed through Congress. The boost from the tax overhaul is expected to wane by 2020.\n\nOne continuing threat for the U.S. economy is Trump's trade war with China. The president has imposed a 10 percent tax on $200 billion of Chinese goods \u2014 a tariff that's set to escalate to 25 percent in 2019. He's also threatened to add tariffs on $250 billion more in Chinese goods.\n\nA prolonged trade crisis would depress the global exchange of goods and, therefore, economic growth. Trump is set to meet with President Xi Jinping at a Group of 20 international meeting in Argentina next week. But prospects for a breakthrough seem to have dimmed.\n\n\"Both countries appear to be far apart on the trade dispute and unwilling to back down at this point,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at the Bank of the West.\n\nSimilarly, political ruptures threaten to slow the pace of Europe's five-year expansion. Britain is struggling to finalize its exit from the European Union, and uncertainty surrounding Prime Minister Theresa May's government has roiled markets.\n\nIn Italy, tensions have flared over a government that wants to increase its borrowing in defiance of rules about deficits among the 19 countries that share the euro currency. Mounting debt could cause Italian interest rates to reach levels that would stifle growth and strain the eurozone.\n\nYet the biggest risk of all might be China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States and the leading engine of global growth for several decades. Its economy was already cooling before Trump raised tariffs in hopes of shrinking the U.S. trade gap with Beijing and protecting U.S. technology.\n\nAmong companies and economists, the question isn't whether Chinese growth will slow further; it's how much. In September, year-over-year economic growth reached a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent. This followed a regulatory clamp-down on bank lending to curb surging debt. Forecasters expect the decline to deepen at least through mid-2019.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party wants slower, more self-sustaining growth driven more by consumer spending and less by trade and investment. But the slump has been sharper than expected. In response, Beijing has cut taxes, eased lending controls and pumped money into building projects.\n\nOctober auto sales fell 13 percent from a year ago, putting vehicle sales in China \u2014 the industry's No. 1 market \u2014 on track to shrink this year for the first time in three decades. Housing sales and bank lending have dropped, and spending on factories and other manufacturing assets has decelerated.\n\n\"Further action\" is needed to \"put a floor beneath economic growth,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.\n\nFinding that floor could prove problematic if the trade war with the Trump administration diminishes the exports that propelled China's economy to manufacturing dominance. Analysts at UBS put the likelihood as high as 20 percent that China could suffer a much sharper slowdown because of the escalating tensions with the United States.\n\n\"In this environment, contagion in global markets could not be avoided,\" UBS analysts wrote.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMcDonald contributed from Beijing.

It's very hard for us to judge what is new because a lot of it is new but it's in the same framework. What we tried to do is salvage or keep what we suspected the audience wanted to see again, but we try to replace lines and do it a little different. But if somebody saw the show, they'd say 'that's mostly a new show!'\n\nAP: What is your process for determining what to cut and add?\n\nMartin: It's really tri...well, I should let Marty talk.\n\nShort: Go ahead, Steve, I'm just doing something else.\n\nMartin: OK. It's trial and error. We work with writers, we work on our own and we put things in, we take things out, and every night after the show we walk off stage and we go, 'What should we do, how should we fix that, should we move that line up to the front?'\n\nAP: Do you allow for spontaneous moments?\n\nShort: You absolutely allow. What a set show gives you is the confidence to go out because you know you're prepared, and you have lots of great material, but then you go out there and you're so loose that other things happen and sometimes they're the most delightful.\n\nMartin: You are fantastic. I'm going to let you speak all the time now because you just nailed that beautifully.\n\nShort: I did. And remember that the difference between my voice and yours is that with one voice you have this kind of groan.\n\nAP: I do always worry that somehow the voices will blend when you go to transcribe.\n\nShort: They won't. One won't even come out.\n\nMartin: Well, let's put it this way, you'll be able to tell which mine is because I speak grammatically.\n\nShort: But, for some odd reason, you'll find yourself dozing off for no reason and you'll realize the connection.\n\nAP: Do you use one another as a test audience?\n\nMartin: Well, I think each other is our first test audience. And then I tend to just try out material on my wife and on my dog and on the band. And finally on the audience, who, of course, has the ultimate say. When I first started out people would say, 'You have a great sense of humor.' And I would say, really, the audience has the great sense of humor.\n\nAP: When did you figure it was OK to roast each other like this?\n\nMartin: Day one.\n\nShort: It's very natural for people in comedy to do it. I think it's very natural for friends, close friends to do it. And we probably started doing it playing scrabble in the trailer while making 'Three Amigos.'\n\nMartin: The first day we met, Marty zinged me. He came to my house to pick up the script to 'Three Amigos' and he saw all of the paintings and he said, 'How did you get this rich? I've seen the work.'\n\nShort: And I was looking for the script for 'Three Amigos' and Steve handed it to me and said, 'Can you give this to Martin Short, please?'\n\nAP: You said the previous tour was not a nostalgia tour. Is that still true and why was that important to specify?\n\nShort: Well, because it wasn't a nostalgia tour. A nostalgia tour would be if I came out as Ed Grimley and we did the 'Wheel of Fortune' sketch and hope that that would get some nostalgia applause. If a singer comes out and sings all old hits, then that is a nostalgia tour and there's nothing wrong with that and that's great and that's what I'd rather see.\n\nMartin: I think a nostalgia tour implies that you'll come out and say, 'You know, ladies and gentlemen, when I first started, I did a little movie called \"The Jerk.'\" And then you stand there and wait for applause.\n\nShort: And I'd love that show.\n\nAP: Will there still be singing and banjo playing in this go-around?\n\nMartin: Absolutely. We describe the show as a lot of comedy and a little bit of music.\n\nAP: It is incredible that singing and the banjo are 'side talents' for you two.\n\nMartin: You know, Marty would never do this, but he could make a serious album and I would listen to it all the time. I find his voice so beautiful. Pitch perfect. Beautiful tone. He sings 'Send in the Clowns' in the show and it's just gorgeous.\n\nShort: Well, thank you. And I of course have all Steve's albums and I one day plan to listen to them.\n\nAP: Was there a moment when you realized this was more than a showbiz friendship?\n\nMartin: Yeah, I would say very early on. We persevered. When you finish doing a movie, mostly everyone drifts away from each other. We just went and had dinners and saw each other.\n\nShort: I think you make that choice. You have to be conscientious and say, you know what? I don't want to lose that person.\n\nMartin: We also ended up vacationing together with our families. Two weeks on an island, you'll know if you like that person or not, you know? I'm talking about our wives.\n\nAP: Is there anything else you want people to know about the show?\n\nMartin: Our goal, and sometimes we achieve it, I think, maybe I'm a little arrogant, but we want it to be one of the best shows the audience ever saw. We want to give the audience their money's worth and really make them laugh and make them really have a good time and leave that theater feeling better than they did when they came in.\n\nShort: Totally agree. And you don't always achieve it, but it's awfully fun to have a goal.\n\nMartin: How could I possibly achieve it with you next to me?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "European zoos to send critically endangered rhinos to Rwanda", "description": "Wildlife parks from three European countries are joining forces to send critically endangered eastern black rhinos back to their natural habitat in Rwanda, where the entire rhino population was wiped out during the genocide in the 1990s", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/european-zoos-send-critically-endangered-rhinos-rwanda-59318323", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:55:45Z", "content": "Wildlife parks in three European countries on Tuesday announced they are joining forces to send critically endangered eastern black rhinos back to their natural habitat in Rwanda, where the entire rhino population was wiped out during the genocide in the 1990\u2026 [+1693 chars]", "fulltext": "Wildlife parks in three European countries on Tuesday announced they are joining forces to send critically endangered eastern black rhinos back to their natural habitat in Rwanda, where the entire rhino population was wiped out during the genocide in the 1990s.\n\nThree female and two male rhinos from the Dvur Kralove zoo in the Czech Republic, Flamingo Land in Britain and Ree Park Safari in Denmark will first meet in the Czech park to get used to each other and get ready for their transport to the Akagera National Park in eastern Rwanda in May or June.\n\nIt will be the biggest single transport of rhinos from Europe to Africa, officials said.\n\nThere are only about 900 of the subspecies remaining in the world, 90 of them in 22 European zoos.\n\n\"Rwanda is a country that suffered a lot in the past but it's a safe place now,\" Dvur Kralove director Premysl Rabas said on Tuesday.\n\nHis zoo has 16 eastern black rhinos, the largest group in Europe.\n\n\"Horrible things took place (in Rwanda) in the 1990s,\" Rabas said. \"And (they) had an impact on the animals.\"\n\nMore than 500,000 people were killed in the genocide by Hutu extremists against the Tutsi minority and Hutu moderates in 1994.\n\nThe conflict also devastated the entire population of lions in Rwanda.

She also told an acquaintance in the parking lot that she was afraid before that person retreated to the hospital to call 911 as well.\n\nWhen Lopez confronted her, the former couple argued about O'Neal calling off the engagement, and Lopez demanded that she return the engagement ring. Then, police said, people inside and around the hospital heard gunfire.\n\nO'Neal fell to the ground. Witness James Gray looked out of the hospital window to see where the gunshots had come from and watched as Lopez \"stood over her and shot her three more times,\" he told reporters.\n\nAs a squad car pulled up, Lopez turned his Glock semi-automatic handgun on police, striking the vehicle multiple times before he ran into the hospital. Officers gave chase.\n\nOnce inside the medical center, he kept firing at officers and at one point turned and fired at Dayna Less, a first-year resident in the hospital's pharmacy, when the doors of the elevator she was on opened.\n\nOfficer Samuel Jimenez was struck in the neck, just above the bulletproof vest he was wearing, and soon died. Jimenez had been delivering his station's mail to the post office when he turned and followed other squad cars racing to the hospital.\n\nThere were indications that Lopez wanted to shoot even more people, including an account from one witness, Jennifer Eldridge, who was hiding in the pharmacy, when she heard the gunfire and the sound of the gunman jiggling the handle of the locked door, an apparent effort to get in.\n\nDuring the exchange of gunfire, Lopez was shot once in the abdomen. It was then that Lopez, who fired a total of more than 30 shots and had reloaded his weapon, put the gun to his head and killed himself, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.\n\nInvestigators said they found nothing to indicate that Lopez had a criminal record. At the time of his death, he was an employee with the Chicago Housing Authority, and officials there said there had been no reports of any problems in his nine months on the job.\n\nBut there were other signs of trouble in recent years.\n\nIn 2014, Lopez was kicked out of the city's firefighting academy after threatening a female cadet. When the fire department learned of the threats, Lopez was told he would be disciplined. But instead of returning to the academy to meet with department officials, Lopez went AWOL and was fired, fire department spokesman Larry Merritt said Tuesday.\n\nRecords from that same year indicate that a girlfriend of Lopez sought an order of protection against him because he was incessantly texting her. When she reported the texts to police, officers told her to change her phone number and seek an order of protection. Records show that she sought the order but not whether she ultimately received one, Guglielmi said.\n\nLopez had a permit to possess a concealed firearm, and it was unclear if officials knew about the 2014 complaint when the permit was granted, said Guglielmi, who said Lopez had legally purchased four guns in the last five years. It was also unclear whether an order of protection, if granted, would have forbidden Lopez from owning weapons.\n\nWhen it was over, the Chicago Police Department was grieving just days before Thanksgiving for the second officer in less than a year to be killed in the line of duty. Cmdr.

Questions these days aren't so much about whether she'll run for the Senate or even president, but whether she ought to keep her job at Facebook.\n\n\"Her brand was being manicured with the same resources and care as the gardens of Tokyo,\" said Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor. \"And unfortunately a hurricane has come through the garden.\"\n\nFacebook has been dealing with hurricanes for the past two years : fake news, elections interference, hate speech, a privacy scandal, the list goes on. The company's response \u2014 namely, Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's \u2014 has been slow at best, misleading and obfuscating at worst, as The New York Times reported last week. That report, and one from The Wall Street Journal , underscored Sandberg's influence at the company, even as Zuckerberg has borne much of the criticism and anger. There have been calls for both to be ousted.\n\nBut because of the way Facebook is set up, firing Zuckerberg would be all but impossible. He controls the majority of the company's voting stock, serves as its chairman and has \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 the support of its board of directors. Essentially, he'd have to fire himself. Firing Sandberg would be the next logical option to hold a high-level executive accountable. Though the chances are slim, the fact that it has even come up shows the extent of Facebook's \u2014 and Sandberg's \u2014 troubles.\n\nZuckerberg indicated Sandberg's job is secure in an interview televised by CNN late Tuesday. \"She has been an important partner for me for 10 years,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I am really proud of the work we have done together and hope we work together for decades more to come.\"\n\nHe also told CNN he intends to remain Facebook's chairman, despite intensifying pressure from some investors who believe he should relinquish that role. \"I am certainly not currently thinking that that that makes sense,\" he said.\n\nAs chief operating officer, Sandberg is in charge of Facebook's business dealings, including the ads that make up the bulk of the company's revenue. She steered Facebook from a rising tech startup into a viable global business expected to reap $55 billion in revenue this year. The company is second only to Google in digital advertising.\n\nBut she's also gotten the blame when things go wrong, including Facebook's failure to spot Russian attempts to influence U.S. elections by buying U.S. political ads \u2014 in rubles. Though Sandberg has denied knowing that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to discredit activists, she created a permissive environment through what the Times called an \"aggressive lobbying campaign\" against critics. Facebook fired the firm, Definers, after the Times report came out.\n\nSandberg, 49, who was hired away from Google in 2008, has been a crucial \"heat shield\" for Zuckerberg, as Galloway put it, as lawmakers and the public crank up criticism of the 34-year-old founder. In September, Facebook sent Sandberg to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, eliciting a warmer response than her boss did three months before.\n\nSandberg, former chief of staff for treasury secretary Larry Summers, appears more comfortable in Washington meeting rooms than Zuckerberg, who can seem robotic. Her profile is high enough that lawmakers don't feel stilted when she shows up. She's written (with help) two books, including 2013's \"Lean In\" about women and leadership. Her second book, \"Plan B,\" is about dealing with loss and grief after her husband died unexpectedly. She was the lone chief operating officer among a who's who of tech CEOs \u2014 including Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 to meet with Donald Trump a month after his election.\n\n\"It's both who she is and how bereft Silicon Valley is of strong, powerful female voices,\" crisis management expert Richard Levick said. \"She has positioned herself as one of those strong voices with 'Lean In.'\"\n\nBut her high profile also makes her more susceptible to criticism.\n\nThe chorus for Sandberg to leave is getting louder. CNBC commentator Jim Cramer predicted Monday that Facebook's stock would rise if Sandberg leaves or gets fired. NYU's Galloway believes both Sandberg and Zuckerberg should be fired for allowing Facebook to turn into an entity that harms democracy around the world.\n\n\"Every day executives are fired for a fraction of infractions these two have committed,\" he said.\n\nBesides elections interference, Zuckerberg and Sandberg have been criticized for their slow response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data-mining firm accessed millions of users' private information without their permission. The pair were silent for days after the news came out. According to the Journal, Zuckerberg told Sandberg this spring that he blamed her and her teams for the \"public fallout\" over Cambridge Analytica. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Sandberg at one point wondered if she should be worried about her job (though that appears to no longer be the case, based on Zuckerberg's public support).\n\nGalloway said it would look bad for Facebook to fire one of the only top female executives in an industry where women \"face inordinately high obstacles to get to leadership positions.\"\n\nBeyond that, Sandberg has also been a positive force on Facebook. She was hired to be the \"adult\" in the room and has filled that role well. She moves comfortably outside tech circles and in public speaking, countering Zuckerberg's shortcomings in that area.\n\nIf anything, Sandberg's departure from Facebook would likely be on her own terms. While Zuckerberg has spent all of his adult life at Facebook, Sandberg had a career before Facebook and even tech, so it is plausible that she would have a life after Facebook, perhaps back in politics.\n\nBut first, she has Facebook's own troubles to deal with. The task seems daunting because its problems might never go away . But Levick believes Sandberg can begin to restore her image by acknowledging her role in causing Facebook's problems instead of blaming external forces beyond her control: \"The kneejerk response 'poor, poor me' is not the solution.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Bill Hutchinson", "title": "Body found near California football stadium identified as missing 49ers fan", "description": "Ian Powers disappeared during a game on Nov. 12.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-found-water-california-football-stadium-identified-missing/story?id=59318068", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/ian-powers-missing-ht-ps-181116_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:01:32Z", "content": "A body found in the water near Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, was identified Tuesday as a San Francisco 49ers fan who went missing during a Nov. 12 Monday Night football game, officials said.

On the Tijuana side, dozens of onlookers gathered with cellphones to take pictures of her arrival through the fence.\n\n\"This is a border wall with row upon row of concertina wire,\" Nielsen said. \"Make no mistake, we are very serious. You will not get into our country illegally.\"\n\nShe said there were as many as 500 criminals and gang member in the groups heading northward, though she refused to answer questions about how they were identified or what crimes they had committed. She added that caravan migrants had assaulted \"border police in multiple countries,\" even using \"incendiary devices,\" though she provided no evidence.\n\nA day earlier, Tijuana officials said they had arrested 34 caravan members for drug possession, public intoxication, disturbing the peace and resisting police, and they would be deported to their home countries\n\nNielsen said there were 6,200 migrants already camped in Tijuana and another 3,000 in Mexicali, a few hours' drive to the east. She said most were young single men who have no legitimate claim to U.S. asylum, adding that wanting to get a job in the U.S. or be reunited with family were not reasons to be allowed in.\n\nLess than an hour before Nielsen's arrival a man tried to swim into the U.S. but was quickly detained by border patrol agents. Five agents were on jet skis offshore along with two border patrol boats, while two drones on the Mexican side hovered just above the wall to get a view of the activity.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has made a point of saying the city is not happy with the migrants who began arriving last week, and he compared the Central American group unfavorably with about 3,000 Haitians who ended up staying after their bid to reach the U.S. failed last year.\n\n\"The Haitians arrived with their papers, with a clear vision,\" Gastelum said in an interview posted on the city's page. They came \"in an orderly way, they never asked us for food or shelter,\" renting apartments and making their own food. He said the Haitians found jobs and \"inserted themselves in the city's economy\" and had not been involved in any disturbances.\n\nBy contrast, Gastelum said, the caravan of Central Americans, \"had arrived all of sudden, with a lot of people \u2014 not all ... but a lot \u2014 were aggressive and cocky.\"\n\nThe Mexican government gave the Haitians temporary transit permits, and after they failed in attempts to enter the United States, many have since applied for Mexican residency. The majority in the Central American caravan have refused Mexico's repeated offers of residency or asylum, and vowed to cross the border.\n\nHaitian Chilo Semaco, 36, said Mexico has been \"more or less\" welcoming to the Haitian immigrants. Since arriving in Tijuana two years ago, Semaco has found work selling aprons to people crossing the border in their cars. \"It's better than being in Haiti,\" he said.\n\nSome local police and residents have expressed concern that portraying the caravan as criminals has tarred its innocent members and exposed them to reprisals.\n\nSome of the largely Honduran migrants were frightened when about 500 people in an affluent district of Tijuana staged angry protests Sunday against the caravan. Dozens of the more radical protesters then marched to an outdoor sports complex near downtown where 2,500 migrants have been staying, sleeping on dirt fields and under bleachers.\n\nWalter Matute said he has been deported from the U.S. twice and fears jumping the border would end his ability to get asylum. But he believes others will now take a chance in light of the court ruling blocking Trump's ban on asylum for illegal border crossers.\n\n\"Yes people are going to cross,\" the 36-year-old Honduran said. \"There are a lot of women and children. A lot are going to be up for it now.\"\n\nSitting on a curb near the sports complex, a Honduran woman affirmed his assessment. The woman, who declined to give her name, said she was getting anxious and was considering crossing illegally to skip the long wait at the Mexican port of entry for asylum seekers.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego, and there was already a waiting list of 3,000 when the new migrants arrived, so most will have to wait months to even be considered for asylum.\n\nGastelum, appealing for greater federal help to cope with what he called an \"avalanche\" of migrants, estimated they would be in Tijuana for at least six months while waiting to file asylum claims.\n\nFor most people in this city of 1.6 million, the arrival of thousands of Central Americans is not very noticeable. Most of the migrants stay within a three-block radius of the sports complex that faces the towering metal walls topped with barbed wire at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut the United States has dramatically increased security at ports of entry in preparation for the caravan, placing cement barriers topped with razor wire that can be quickly moved to block passage if a mass of migrants to try to force their way into the country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Michael Ramirez", "title": "Visit the Disneyland Resort in Early 2019 for $70 per day with Special Limited-Time Ticket Offer", "description": "Just in time for the gift-giving season, take advantage of this Disneyland Resort limited-time ticket offer, along with a special hotel offer.

It will be the first American spacecraft to land since the Curiosity rover in 2012 and the first dedicated to exploring underground.\n\nNASA is going with a tried-and-true method to get this mechanical miner to the surface of the red planet. Engine firings will slow its final descent and the spacecraft will plop down on its rigid legs, mimicking the landings of earlier successful missions.\n\nThat's where old school ends on this $1 billion U.S.-European effort .\n\nOnce flight controllers in California determine the coast is clear at the landing site \u2014 fairly flat and rock free \u2014 InSight's 6-foot (1.8-meter) arm will remove the two main science experiments from the lander's deck and place them directly on the Martian surface.\n\nNo spacecraft has attempted anything like that before.\n\nThe firsts don't stop there.\n\nOne experiment will attempt to penetrate 16 feet (5 meters) into Mars, using a self-hammering nail with heat sensors to gauge the planet's internal temperature. That would shatter the out-of-this-world depth record of 8 feet (2 \u00bd meters) drilled by the Apollo moonwalkers nearly a half-century ago for lunar heat measurements.\n\nThe astronauts also left behind instruments to measure moonquakes. InSight carries the first seismometers to monitor for marsquakes \u2014 if they exist. Yet another experiment will calculate Mars' wobble, providing clues about the planet's core.\n\nIt won't be looking for signs of life, past or present. No life detectors are on board.\n\nThe spacecraft is like a self-sufficient robot, said lead scientist Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n\"It's got its own brain. It's got an arm that can manipulate things around. It can listen with its seismometer. It can feel things with the pressure sensors and the temperature sensors. It pulls its own power out of the sun,\" he said.\n\nBy scoping out the insides of Mars, scientists could learn how our neighbor \u2014 and other rocky worlds, including the Earth and moon \u2014 formed and transformed over billions of years. Mars is much less geologically active than Earth, and so its interior is closer to being in its original state \u2014 a tantalizing time capsule.\n\nInSight stands to \"revolutionize the way we think about the inside of the planet,\" said NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen.\n\nBut first, the 800-pound (360-kilogram) vehicle needs to get safely to the Martian surface. This time, there won't be a ball bouncing down with the spacecraft tucked inside, like there were for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004. And there won't be a sky crane to lower the lander like there was for the six-wheeled Curiosity during its dramatic \"seven minutes of terror.\"\n\n\"That was crazy,\" acknowledged InSight's project manager, Tom Hoffman. But he noted, \"Any time you're trying to land on Mars, it's crazy, frankly. I don't think there's a sane way to do it.\"\n\nNo matter how it's done, getting to Mars and landing there is hard \u2014 and unforgiving.\n\nEarth's success rate at Mars is a mere 40 percent. That includes planetary flybys dating back to the early 1960s, as well as orbiters and landers.\n\nWhile it's had its share of flops, the U.S. has by far the best track record. No one else has managed to land and operate a spacecraft on Mars. Two years ago, a European lander came in so fast, its descent system askew, that it carved out a crater on impact.\n\nThis time, NASA is borrowing a page from the 1976 twin Vikings and the 2008 Phoenix, which also were stationary and three-legged.\n\n\"But you never know what Mars is going to do,\" Hoffman said. \"Just because we've done it before doesn't mean we're not nervous and excited about doing it again.\"\n\nWind gusts could send the spacecraft into a dangerous tumble during descent, or the parachute could get tangled. A dust storm like the one that enveloped Mars this past summer could hamper InSight's ability to generate solar power. A leg could buckle. The arm could jam.\n\nThe tensest time for flight controllers in Pasadena, California: the six minutes from the time the spacecraft hits Mars' atmosphere and touchdown. They'll have jars of peanuts on hand \u2014 a good-luck tradition dating back to 1964's successful Ranger 7 moon mission.\n\nInSight will enter Mars' atmosphere at a supersonic 12,300 mph (19,800 kph), relying on its white nylon parachute and a series of engine firings to slow down enough for a soft upright landing on Mars' Elysium Planitia, a sizable equatorial plain.\n\nHoffman hopes it's \"like a Walmart parking lot in Kansas.\"\n\nThe flatter the better so the lander doesn't tip over, ending the mission, and so the robotic arm can set the science instruments down.\n\nInSight \u2014 short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport \u2014 will rest close to the ground, its top deck barely a yard, or meter, above the surface. Once its twin circular solar panels open, the lander will occupy the space of a large car.\n\nIf NASA gets lucky, a pair of briefcase-size satellites trailing InSight since their joint May liftoff could provide near-live updates during the lander's descent. There's an eight-minute lag in communications between Earth and Mars.\n\nThe experimental CubeSats, dubbed WALL-E and EVE from the 2008 animated movie, will zoom past Mars and remain in perpetual orbit around the sun, their technology demonstration complete.\n\nIf WALL-E and EVE are mute, landing news will come from NASA orbiters at Mars, just not as quickly.\n\nThe first pictures of the landing site should start flowing shortly after touchdown. It will be at least 10 weeks before the science instruments are deployed. Add another several weeks for the heat probe to bury into Mars.\n\nThe mission is designed to last one full Martian year, the equivalent of two Earth years.\n\nWith landing day so close to Thanksgiving, many of the flight controllers will be eating turkey at their desks on the holiday.\n\nHoffman expects his team will wait until Monday to give full and proper thanks.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

He has since been linked to five sexual assaults in the Boston area, three of which resulted in the death of the victims, including Britton.\n\nNone of the victims are believed to have known or had any relationship with Sumpter, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The murder of Jane Britton has raised many questions and piqued the interest of members of the community over the past 50 years,\" Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan told reporters at a press conference Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"Multiple teams of investigators have been assigned to this case looking into tips from the public and ruling out multiple suspects,\" she added. \"As a direct result of their perseverance and utilization of the latest advances in forensic technology by the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab, today I am confident that the mystery of who killed Jane Britton has finally been solved and this case is officially closed.\"\n\nMiddlesex District Attorneys Office\n\nBritton, a 23-year-old graduate student in anthropology at Harvard University, was found dead in her fourth-floor apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the chilly afternoon of Jan. 7, 1969. She had been sexually assaulted and bludgeoned to death, according to Cambridge police records.\n\nBritton, a native of Needham, Massachusetts, went out to dinner with some classmates at a restaurant in Cambridge the night before. She went back to her apartment after dinner to change her clothes before going ice skating with her then-boyfriend, according to prosecutors.\n\nAfter ice skating, the couple went to a nearby pub for a beer and then returned to Britton's apartment around 10:30 p.m. that night. Her boyfriend stayed for about an hour before leaving. Then, Britton went across the hall to visit her neighbors, who had been watching her cat while she was out. She had a glass of sherry with them before going back to her unit, prosecutors said.\n\nThe next day, Britton's boyfriend came to check on her after she didn't show up for an important exam and he couldn't get a hold of her by telephone. When he was unable to get into her apartment, he asked for help from her neighbors who ultimately gained entry and discovered that Britton had been brutally murdered, according to prosecutors.\n\nMiddlesex District Attorneys Office\n\nAn autopsy ruled that Britton had been sexually assaulted and struck in the head by a blunt object multiple times, though the murder weapon was never found. A subsequent toxicology test showed that the alcohol she had consumed the evening before had not yet metabolized and entered her bloodstream, indicating she was killed shortly after returning to her apartment, prosecutors said.\n\nRed ochre powder was found scattered across the walls, ceiling and floor of her apartment, as well as on Britton's body, which sparked speculation that the killer may have performed some sort of ancient burial rite, according to prosecutors.\n\nInvestigators later learned that Britton was a painter and ochre can be used to make oil paint, so the clay earth pigment was likely already in her apartment and may have been dispersed during the struggle, prosecutors said.\n\n\u201c \u201d This case posed many challenges for investigators.\n\nPolice questioned several people at the time and learned that a neighbor had heard someone on the fire escape that connected to Britton's apartment. A second witness told police they saw a tall man running down the street near the building in the early morning hours of Jan. 7, 1969.\n\n\"This case posed many challenges for investigators,\" Ryan said at Tuesday's press conference. \"We followed up on many leads regarding individuals with suspected ties to Jane Britton. Additionally, this case had several 'red herrings' including the presence of red ochre at the crime scene which ultimately were unrelated to the crime. Over time, as people\u2019s memories faded and witnesses died, it became even more difficult to follow up on new investigatory leads.\"\n\nThe case went cold for decades, with investigators unable to identify a suspect -- until now.\n\nMiddlesex District Attorneys Office\n\nThe break in the case came after the Middlesex District Attorney's Office received several requests in 2017 for Britton's file to be released to the public, according to prosecutors. A team of investigators began reviewing the file in order to potentially release some information and, with fresh eyes, sought to determine whether there was any additional investigative work that could be done on the case.\n\nAfter consulting with the Massachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory, investigators ultimately decided to perform additional DNA testing with the most up-to-date technology on the remaining samples.\n\nIn October 2017, the lab was able to obtain for the first time a male-specific DNA profile from the samples on file from the original swabs. In July, investigators were notified that there was a match between the genetic material and Sumpter's, which was in the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) database, according to prosecutors.\n\nWCVB\n\nInvestigators learned that Sumpter had several ties to the area where Britton was killed, prosecutors said. He had lived in Cambridge as a child, had several run-ins with local police as a kid and had a girlfriend who lived there in the late 1960s. Investigators also learned that in 1967, less than two years before Britton's murder, Sumpter was working less than a mile from her apartment, according to prosecutors.\n\nAlthough Sumpter had died years ago, investigators were able to locate and obtain a DNA sample from his biological brother. Further testing confirmed Sumpter as the sole individual responsible for Britton's death, prosecutors said.\n\n\"We now feel confident that the man identified as Michael Sumpter entered Jane's apartment through the window, assaulted her, murdered her in her bed and then fled the apartment,\" Ryan told reporters Tuesday.\n\nMiddlesex District Attorneys Office\n\nIn addition to finding Britton's killer, the district attorney said DNA testing also ruled out other potential persons of interests who had been living under a \"cloud of suspicion\" for years.\n\n\"Today, we are able to provide closure to Jane\u2019s family, friends and those who knew her,\" she said. \"This is the oldest case that the Middlsex District Attorney's Office has been able to bring to a resolution.\"\n\n\u201c \u201d A half century of mystery and speculation has clouded the brutal crime that shattered Jane's promising young life and our family ...

Boyd Britton, vicar of Anglican Church of Our Saviour in Santa Barbara, California, who said finding forgiveness for his sister's murder \"remains a challenge.\"\n\n\"A half century of mystery and speculation has clouded the brutal crime that shattered Jane's promising young life and our family,\" he said in a statement released Tuesday by the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. \"As the surviving Britton, I wish to thank all those -- friends, public officials and press -- who persevered in keeping this investigation active, most especially State Police Sergeant Peter Sennott.

But by the time she was killed six years ago in Homs, Syria, by President Bashar Assad's forces, Marie Colvin had earned it. At 56, she had already long been revered among fellow journalists for her bravery and determination to tell the story, at virtually any cost.\n\nThe New York native who wrote for Britain's Sunday Times was also known for some other things: For her trademark black eye patch, adopted after she lost sight in one eye in a Sri Lanka grenade attack. For her taste in vodka martinis and pearls. For her famous parties. And for being a notoriously prickly person to work with, especially for photographers, whom she cycled through as quickly as the cigarettes she was constantly smoking.\n\nBut Colvin found her professional soul mate, and her final journalistic partner, in Paul Conroy, a freelance photographer and former British soldier who was with her when she died in Homs, and badly wounded himself. Conroy has never stopped telling Colvin's story, and now he's telling it in a searing new documentary, \"Under the Wire,\" an account of their last, tragic assignment.\n\nIn a striking coincidence, \"Under the Wire,\" directed by Chris Martin and based on Conroy's own book, is one of three major projects about Colvin released within a few weeks. They include the feature film \"A Private War,\" offering a take-no-prisoners performance by Rosamund Pike, and a new book, \"In Extremis: The Life and Death of the War Correspondent Marie Colvin,\" by her friend Lindsey Hilsum.\n\nWhat would Colvin think of all the sudden attention? Conroy, who also served as a consultant to \"A Private War,\" chuckles to think of it, saying that outwardly she'd brush it off, but inwardly she'd likely be proud \u2014 and happy that the attention is bringing the plight of the Syrian people back into the spotlight.\n\n\"It's the best lifetime achievement award we could give Marie,\" he said in a recent interview from his home in Devon, England, adding: \"It's very hard to describe your friend as a legend, but you have to with Marie. She was a complete and utter one-off.\"\n\nWhile \"A Private War\" is justifiably drawing Oscar buzz for Pike, \"Under the Wire\" has Colvin herself. Director Martin spent years assembling archive footage, including Conroy's own, and everything else he could find. The result is a stunningly immediate account of the tragedy, including audio from the moment the missiles hit.\n\nIt begins with Colvin and Conroy's decision to sneak into Syria in February 2012. To protests of her friends that it was just too risky, Colvin replied, according to Hilsum: \"It's what we do.\"\n\nThe duo traveled over land from Lebanon into Syria, then made a terrifying journey to Homs through an underground water tunnel. Their destination: the working-class neighborhood of Baba Amr, where starving civilians were being bombarded by constant shelling.\n\nColvin and Conroy documented the suffering, including a Feb. 19 piece on the \"widows' basement,\" a cellar where mostly women and children crowded in misery, sheltering from the bombs. It was, says her editor, Sean Ryan, her very best work.\n\nThe pair left Homs at one point but Colvin insisted they go back; there was more reporting to be done. Back in the tunnel, Conroy says he stopped and told her: \"Marie, I have a bad feeling.\" She told him she was going back, regardless. He joined her. \"I went in with my eyes open,\" he says now.\n\nDespite the unimaginable risks, Martin takes pains to note that Colvin wasn't foolhardy.\n\n\"The cliche is that she was a 'fearless' war reporter,\" the director said in an interview. \"But what I got very clearly from talking to people was that she wasn't fearless. She was frightened all the time. Her achievement was that she overcame it.\"\n\nThe film also makes a point of showing her fiercely competitive nature. When a group of French journalists arrive, just as Colvin's own editor is begging her to leave, Colvin digs in her heels. \"It was her story and she wanted it,\" Martin says simply.\n\nThe most heartbreaking scene \u2014 in both the dramatic film and the documentary, actually \u2014 takes place in a makeshift medical clinic in Baba Amr. A badly wounded baby boy arrives; doctors cannot save him. By terrible coincidence, his own grandmother is working in the clinic and begins to wail as she recognizes the baby.\n\nAfter witnessing the horrifying death, Colvin decides to go for broke. She broadcasts from Homs, describing watching the baby die in interviews on the BBC and CNN. \"She was going to take the story and go for it, whatever the cost,\" Conroy says.\n\nOnly hours later, missiles rained down on the makeshift media center in which Colvin was filing. She and French war photographer Remy Ochlik were killed instantly. Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier were wounded. There is shocking footage here of the wounded journalists, including of Conroy's mangled leg. \"I need a tourniquet!\" he screams.\n\nThe film goes on to document Conroy's harrowing escape from Homs, literally clawing his way out through mud. \"I got out of the tunnel, and four minutes later the government fired rockets,\" he says now. \"The guys who carried me were all killed.\"\n\nBoth Conroy and Martin say they could never have known how relevant their film would be, six years after Homs. That's because they didn't know journalism itself would come under fire.\n\n\"In this day and age, journalism as a profession is under such attack from the whole 'fake news' thing,\" Conroy says. \"So to stand there and say, 'This is someone who lived to bear witness' \u2014 that was Marie. She died living that work.\"\n\nOr, as Colvin herself is shown saying in the film, being a war correspondent was not about which tank was used or which type of weaponry. She didn't care a whit about that stuff.\n\n\"Being a war correspondent is about people, and what they're going through,\" she says.\n\nConroy says he will tell the story of Colvin, and of the Syrian people, until their suffering is over.\n\n\"To this day I carry this weight and responsibility,\" he says. \"I'm not going to stop.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Guy Davies", "title": "London's latest skyscraper is shaped like a giant tulip and is 1,000 feet tall", "description": "The building will have the highest viewing platform in the city.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/introducing-londons-latest-skyscraper-tulip/story?id=59312820", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/the-tulip-london-skyscraper-ht-jef-181120_hpMain_v12x5_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:22:36Z", "content": "London already has a number of strangely named skyscrapers: the Gherkhin, the Cheese Grater and the Walkie Talkie.

The first item on the agenda was to review differences in flight control systems between the MAX and its predecessor 737 model, called the NG or next generation, according to people briefed on plans for the call.\n\nPilots for U.S. airlines have complained that they were not told about a new feature in the MAX that could pitch the nose down sharply if sensors indicate that the plane is about to stall.\n\n\"Boeing has been and continues to engage with our customers. We continue to schedule meetings to share information,\" said Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers. He declined to say why Tuesday's call was canceled but said new meetings would be held early next week.\n\nIndonesian investigators are examining whether a new anti-stall system in the MAX played a role in the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air jet shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. The plane flew erratically before plunging into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore said canceling the call was \"a bad look for the company at a time when it is facing increasing criticism for potential problems with sensors on the plane that could cause the aircraft to erroneously correct itself into a steep dive.\" He said Boeing \"needs to communicate more and better, not less.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Southwest said Boeing did not give a reason for canceling and did not initially reschedule the call. She said the airline would follow any future guidance from Boeing or the Federal Aviation Administration as they continue their investigation.\n\nA spokesman for American said the airline would continue to work with Boeing and the FAA. United declined to comment.\n\nThrough October, Boeing had delivered 241 MAX planes to airlines and taken orders for nearly 4,800.\n\nThe new system can point the nose of the plane down sharply if sensors detect that the plane may be about to enter an aerodynamic stall. Investigators in the Lion Air crash say the plane received faulty readings from so-called angle-of-attack sensors, which track whether the nose is pointed up, down or level, and they are probing whether the bad data caused the nose of the plane to pitch down automatically.\n\nBoeing shares plunged 7.6 percent in morning trading but regained most of the loss over the next couple hours. The stock closed down $3.24, or 1 percent, at $317.70. They have lost 14 percent since Nov. 9 as regulators have focused on the role of the plane's control systems in the crash.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDavid Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "'Ralph' sequel packs a punch with strong female characters", "description": "\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" may star an arcade bad guy with powerful hammer-like fists, but the animated sequel is also packing a punch with strong female characters", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/ralph-sequel-packs-punch-strong-female-characters-59317488", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_d32ae3950868463886010b4f8e38105a_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:17:17Z", "content": "\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" may star an arcade bad guy with powerful hammer-like fists, but the animated sequel is also packing a punch with strong female characters.

Her character is one of the leading ladies, along with new cast members Gal Gadot's Shank and Taraji P. Henson, who plays Yesss.\n\n\"I love it,\" said Silverman, an outspoken comedian known for advocating for women's rights. \"You see how far Disney has allowed itself to grow and change, and be more inclusive and more progressive? You can't keep on existing if you don't change and grow with the times. With me, Taraji and Gal's character, it's nice to see.\"\n\nIn the past, Disney has been criticized for having a lack of self-sufficient female characters who focused more on their physical appearance and being reliant on a man. That pattern began to change over the years in films such as \"Tangled,\" ''Brave\" and \"Frozen.\"\n\nWith the \"Ralph\" sequel, the studio is taking \"girl power\" a step further as directors Phil Johnston and Rich Moore wanted to incorporate more \"strong and complicated\" female characters.\n\n\"This studio is the birthplace of a lot of these stereotypes,\" said John C. Reilly, the voice of the massive, overall-wearing Ralph. \"It's really an amazing and commendable thing that Disney has recognized. ... As a man, it's not really my lane to talk about these issues. But I do think if things are going to change, men and women have to both talk about this stuff and embrace gender equality, and think of women's rights as humans. I was a strong advocate for balance in our story.\"\n\nThe sequel is a follow up to the 2012 Oscar-nominated \"Wreck-it Ralph.\" This time, Ralph and Vanellope's friendship is tested after leaving Litwak's video arcade to travel through a Wi-Fi connection that ultimately delivers them into the fast-paced internet dimension. They venture into an unfamiliar world exploring major brands from Twitter to Amazon, online shopping, the dark web and visits inside Walt Disney Studio's website.\n\nJohnston said the film's imaginary of the internet mimics the look of a New York City or Tokyo. It's where Ralph and Vanellope meet Gadot's Shank, a gritty street-racing star, and Henson's Yesss, who is the head algorithm of the trend-making website BuzzzTube.\n\n\"It's like they're small-town kids who are now in the big city,\" said Moore, who directed the first \"Ralph\" film and the Academy Award-winning \"Zootopia.\" ''This is a movie about change. I'm glad that we took the more challenging road.\"\n\n\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" offers an animated glimpse inside their parent company's website showing several characters from Marvel to \"Star Wars.\" The film also highlights the Disney princesses in a scene where all stereotypes and cliches associated with the animated icons are dealt with head-on.\n\nInitially, the princess scene faced backlash from fans in August after a publicity photo surfaced online showing Princess Tiana with lighter skin and a thinner nose compared to the version in the black character's stand-alone Disney movie, \"The Princess and the Frog.\" The studio ultimately reanimated the character after meeting with actress Anika Noni Rose, who voiced Tiana in the 2009 film, and members of Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy organization.\n\n\"Our goal is to make this film as perfect as possible as we can,\" Johnston said. \"I hope everyone knows we love this character as much as anyone.\"\n\nHenson called Tiana's reanimation a \"brilliant move\" by Disney.\n\n\"If you know about it, you do better,\" said the actor, who is black. \"But Disney has a history of pleasing the people and appealing to the people. They're a standup company. They did the right thing. I'm glad I'm in the film. I'm glad I'm in business with people who are on the right side of history, with no ego.

They won't confirm it to me the whole time,\" Taft said Monday.\n\nWith 79 people killed in the nation's deadliest wildfire in at least a century, there are still nearly 700 names on the list of those unaccounted for. While it's down from nearly 1,000 the day before, it is inexact, progress has been slow, and the many days of uncertainty are adding to the stress.\n\nMore than a dozen people are marked as \"unknowns,\" without first or last names. In some cases, names are listed twice or more times under different spellings. Others are confirmed dead, and their names simply haven't been taken off yet.\n\nSurvivors and relatives of those caught in the fire in Northern California are using social media to get the word out: In some cases, to post that their loved ones were safe; in others, to plead for help.\n\n\"Aunt Dorothy is still missing. There has been confusion going on at the Sheriffs office regarding her whereabouts because she was taken off the list,\" a man wrote on Facebook on Monday.\n\n\"I have an uncle and two cousins that I have not been able to make contact with,\" one woman wrote on Facebook, with their names. \"Any info would be appreciated.\"\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea has said he released the rough and incomplete list in hopes that people would contact authorities to say they are OK. He has called it \"raw data\" compiled from phone calls, emails and other reports.\n\n\"We put the list out. It will fluctuate. It will go up. It will go down because this is in a state of flux,\" Honea said Monday. \"My view on this has been that I would prefer to get the information out and start working to find who is unaccounted for and who is not. I would put progress over perfection.\"\n\nOfficials have also culled reports from the earliest hours of the disaster, when fire knocked out mobile phone communications and thousands fled, some to safe shelter that was hundreds of miles away.\n\nHonea said his office was working with the Red Cross to account for people entering and leaving shelters. Evacuees are also helping authorities narrow the list, sometimes by chance.\n\nRobert James Miles, who lost his Paradise trailer in the blaze, was staying at a shelter in Chico where people posted names of those they hadn't heard from. Miles said he alerted a Red Cross worker Saturday that he recognized eight names on the board as friends he knew were OK.\n\n\"Two of them were in the shelter,\" he said with a chuckle.\n\nOwen and Phyllis Suihkonen understand the chaos. Their family is scattered after they lost their home to the wildfire, as did their two adult children.\n\nPhyllis Suihkonen, 69, says she spotted the names of two friends on the list of unaccounted people, and doesn't know if they are safe. But her daughter has seen names of friends who are OK and called sheriff's officials to let them know.\n\n\"I'm concerned,\" Phyllis said. \"But like I said, there's been other friends' names on the list that have been accounted for and taken off.\"\n\nMeanwhile, those searching for bodies were in a race against the weather, as rain was forecast for Wednesday. The precipitation could help knock out the flames, but it could also hinder the search by washing away fragmentary remains and turning ash into a thick paste.\n\nThe fire, which burned at least 236 square miles (611 square kilometers) and destroyed nearly 12,000 homes, was 70 percent contained on Monday.\n\nAlcatraz Island, San Francisco's cable cars, the Oakland Zoo and other San Francisco Bay Area area attractions were closed Monday because of smoke from the blaze some 140 miles (225 kilometers) away. Several San Francisco museums over the weekend offered free admission to give people something to do indoors.\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said it is \"way too early\" to estimate the damage done by the wildfire.

Prosecutors accused them of working with a Sicily-based shipping company to mix medical and \"contaminated\" waste, like migrants' clothing, with other garbage to save money.\n\nProsecutors ordered the sequester of the Aquarius, which is currently moored in Marseille, France, as well as the seizure of 460,000 euros ($526,000), which prosecutors said was the amount saved by the group by not properly disposing of the material.\n\nDoctors Without Borders called the accusation \"disproportionate\" and another attempt to criminalize migrant rescues. The group, known by its French acronym MSF, said its waste disposal followed all approved \"standard procedures.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, MSF allowed that there may have been lapses, especially among port authorities with whom MSF worked, acknowledging prosecutor video showing latex gloves and what appeared to be a syringe mixed in with regular garbage.\n\n\"We are ready to clarify the facts and respond about the procedures we followed, but we strongly reaffirm the legitimacy and the legality of our humanitarian activities,\" said MSF Italia's director general, Gabriele Eminente.\n\nAt a news conference, MSF officials expressed shock at the prosecutors' claim that migrants' clothing alone could spread infectious disease, saying it showed ignorance about public health and was more an attempt to tarnish MSF's reputation.\n\nThe Aquarius, a 77-meter (252.62-foot) -long former fishery protection vessel, is perhaps best known for having become a pawn in the European battle over migration in June after Italy's new populist government refused to let it dock in an Italian port.\n\nAfter a weeklong standoff at sea that returned the migration debate to the world stage, Spain agreed to let the Aquarius dock with its 630 migrants who, along with tens of thousands of other migrants before them, had set off from Libya aboard smugglers boats.\n\nThe same Sicily prosecutors' office behind the new investigation made headlines in 2017 when it publicly accused rescue groups of aiding illegal migration by being in contact with Libyan-based human traffickers as they plucked migrants from the sea off Libya's coast. To date, the investigation hasn't produced any indictments.\n\nIn the new probe, dubbed \"Operation Borderless,\" prosecutors alleged that between Jan. 1, 2017, and May 2018, MSF and the Sicily-based Mediterranean Shipping Agency knowingly avoided the \"rigid treatment\" required for \"dangerous waste,\" including food containers and medical equipment used on board the ship to treat sick migrants.\n\nProsecutors produced documentation filled out by the suspects that certified that no medical waste or contagious or infections substances were being thrown away. Prosecutors also provided wiretaps of communications between MSF personnel and the shipping agency about how to classify the material.\n\nA statement from prosecutors noted cases of scabies, HIV, tuberculosis and meningitis among newly arrived migrants and said their \"contaminated clothing\" risked spreading infection.\n\nThey accused the suspects of \"organized activity trafficking in illegal waste.\"\n\nAnother aid group that works with MSF aboard the Aquarius, SOS Mediterranee, denounced the ship's sequester as a \"politically driven attack\" and urged French authorities to \"show restraint\" as they weigh the seizure order from Italian prosecutors.\n\nItaly's hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who drove the June crackdown on the Aquarius and other aid groups, praised the Catania prosecutors for the new investigation, which also involved another rescue ship the Vos Prudence.\n\n\"I did the right thing by blocking the NGO ships, for not only stopping the traffic of clandestine migrants but also, apparently, the traffic in toxic waste,\" he tweeted with the hashtag #portsclosed."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Soo Youn", "title": "Dow falls nearly 500 points, dragged down by Target and tech shares", "description": "The Dow was dragged down by disappointing Target news and a tech slump.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/dow-falls-500-points-dragged-target-tech-shares/story?id=59316659", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/nyse-down-gty-ps-181120_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:11:56Z", "content": "The Dow Jones plunged nearly 500 points in early trade on Tuesday, dragged down by disappointing Target news and a continuing slump in tech companies.

While Hollywood has portrayed it as a hive of swashbuckling agents, in reality it's an organization sometimes tangled in red tape and clashing geopolitical interests. Nazis took it over in the 1930s, and authoritarian governments have long tried to use it to hunt down fugitive dissenters.\n\nBut the latest storm of criticism comes at an exceptional time \u2014 just as Russia is trying to expand its global clout and as some powerful countries are questioning whether they need multilateral organizations like Interpol at all.\n\nInterpol's general assembly is choosing the agency's new president at a meeting in Dubai where the front-runner is Alexander Prokopchuk, a general in Russia's Interior Ministry who is currently an Interpol vice president. Interpol's interim president, South Korea's Kim Jong Yang, is also seeking the post.\n\nTwo prominent Kremlin critics warned Tuesday that electing a high-placed Russian would undermine the international law enforcement agency and politicize police cooperation across borders.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky told reporters in London that Putin has tried to use Interpol to hunt down critics such as themselves. Having a Russian lead the agency could intensify such efforts to silence dissent, they said.\n\nActivists argue that the organization needs to increase recent efforts at muscular reform, and this won't happen if Prokopchuk becomes president, because of his ties to Putin.\n\n\"It was his government that organized a terrorist attack in the U.K. using chemical weapons in Salisbury. It was his government that shot down MH17, killing 298 innocent individuals. It was his government that cheated and hacked in elections in the United States and Europe,\" Browder said of Putin. \"To put his representative in charge of the most important international crime-fighting organization is like putting the mafia in charge.\"\n\nTo Moscow, the complaints are all part of a Western-led campaign to weaken a resurgent Russia.\n\nRussia denies accusations of foreign interference and announced new charges against Browder this week in a long-running legal battle against him. Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Irina Volk accused critics Tuesday of running a \"campaign to discredit\" Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\n\nBrowder has pressed for sanctions against Russian officials charged with human rights abuses after his former lawyer died in custody. Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, spent a decade in prison after exhibiting political ambitions. Both said their places in the public eye would make them poor targets for abuse, adding that they were motivated to speak out because many other campaigners who are less well-known would be silenced if governments are allowed to export repression.\n\nThe White House came out Tuesday against the election of Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying that \"the Russian government abuses Interpol's processes to harass its political opponents.\" He said the U.S. \"strongly endorses\" Kim.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added: \"We encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world's most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that.\"\n\nInterpol's general assembly is made up of its 192 member states, each of which has an equal vote.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is best known for issuing \"red notices\" that identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world's \"most-wanted\" list.\n\nCritics argue that countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists.\n\nThe watchdog group Fair Trials International detailed in a report last month the strides Interpol has made in reducing political abuse of red notices. The group's chief, Jago Russell, said a Russian official as Interpol president could stall or reverse those reforms.\n\n\"We're at a pivotal moment for Interpol,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\n\"Either countries back away from it and find other ways to cooperate, or Interpol fixes its system so that it can be trusted. ... Already there are noises about pulling out of Interpol\" and creating a separate agency just for democratic countries, he said.\n\nThe U.S. seems committed to Interpol for now, but has pulled out of UNESCO and international accords under President Donald Trump. Britain is pulling out of the European Union and has expressed concern about management of international bodies funded by taxpayers.\n\nInterpol itself won't comment on the upcoming vote. The Interpol presidency is more of an oversight position, compared with the hands-on leadership role of the secretary-general.\n\nInterpol's charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality, and two years ago it introduced measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice's compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out.\n\nBut the possibility of a Putin loyalist in such a prominent role has prompted concern among those critical of the Russian president's leadership. Four U.S. senators, including Marco Rubio, have urged the Trump administration to oppose the Prokopchuk candidacy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who on Monday stated that Russia was \"rooting for the Russian candidate,\" said that amounted to meddling in the vote.\n\nFair Trials International warned that a Russian president of Interpol could try to limit the money spent on staff needed to vet red notices, for example, or get rid of a recent measure to protect refugees from unfair arrest.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Interpol's votes are causing controversy.\n\nHuman rights groups raised the alarm two years ago when Interpol's general assembly approved Meng Hongwei, a longtime senior Chinese security official, as president. Amnesty International criticized \"China's longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad.\"\n\nMeng is now under arrest in China as part of a possible domestic political purge \u2014 hence Wednesday's emergency vote to replace him.\n\nInterpol's general assembly also votes on membership, like they did on Tuesday when they rejected admitting Kosovo . Interpol members voted last year to admit Palestine as a member, creating an uproar in Israel.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCharlton reported from Paris.

Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have said they are concerned about Whitaker's past criticism of the Mueller probe, which is looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties to Trump's campaign.\n\nAfter Whitaker's appointment, Schumer called for Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation and said he would seek to tie a measure protecting Mueller to must-pass legislation if he refuses to do so.\n\nWhitaker's past public statements have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump's family finances. In a talk radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nOn Monday, three other Senate Democrats \u2014 Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island \u2014 filed a lawsuit arguing that Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.

Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\" said the spokesman, Peter Mirijanian.\n\nMirijanian stressed that no classified information was transmitted in the messages, that no emails were deleted and that the emails have since been \"retained\" in conformity with records laws.\n\n\"When concerns were raised in the press 14 months ago, Ms. Trump reviewed and verified her email use with White House Counsel and explained the issue to congressional leaders,\" he said.\n\nThe discovery was prompted by public records requests from the liberal watchdog group American Oversight. The group's executive director, Austin Evers, said in a statement that \"The president's family is not above the law,\" and he called on Congress to investigate.\n\n\"For more than two years, President Trump and senior leaders in Congress have made it very clear that they view the use of personal email servers for government business to be a serious offense that demands investigation and even prosecution, and we expect the same standard will be applied in this case,\" he said.\n\nThe emails the group uncovered include correspondence between Ivanka Trump and Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "'Dancing With the Stars' season 27 champ Bobby Bones on his win: 'We did it one day at a time' - ABC News", "description": "ABC News 'Dancing With the Stars' season 27 champ Bobby Bones on his win: 'We did it one day at a time' ABC News Radio personality Bobby Bones is crediting good, old fashioned hard work for winning the season 27 finale of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" Interested \u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/dancing-stars-season-27-champ-bobby-bones-win/story?id%3D59312838", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:01:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "John Santucci", "title": "Trump submits written responses to special counsel", "description": "President Donald Trump has submitted his answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller, the president\u2019s attorneys told ABC News.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-submits-written-responses-special-counsel-robert/story?id=59315316", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-split-gty-jc-181120_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:58:42Z", "content": "President Donald Trump has submitted his answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller, the presidents attorneys told ABC News.

The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry. The President responded in writing,\u201d Jay Sekulow, Counsel to the President told ABC News in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe special counsel's office did not comment.\n\n\"I write the answers. My lawyers don't write answers,\" Trump said last week when asked by reporters about the special counsel\u2019s questions. \"I was asked a series of questions, I answered them very easily.\"\n\nThe questions submitted to Mueller were broken up into five parts and focused on potential Russian collusion during the 2016 elections, sources close to the president told ABC News.\n\nA few of the questions focused on Trump's longtime political ally, Roger Stone, though those questions did not dominate.\n\nTrump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, told Axios that he and fellow team lawyers Jay Sekulow and Jane Raskin took handwritten notes before the material was typed up and were with the president in the Oval Office and the private dining room adjoining the Oval during the sessions.\n\nGiuliani said Mueller asked whether Trump knew at the time about his son, Don Trump Jr., meeting with Russians during a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.\n\nThe special counsel also reportedly asked about Russian hacks that occured after Trump's July 27, 2016, press conference in Florida, when the then-candidate said: \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,\" according to Axios.\n\nIn returning his written answers to Mueller, the president capped a months-long negotiation with the special counsel over the subject and quantity of questions relevant to the Mueller\u2019s mandated investigation of Russian meddling during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"It has been our position from the outset that much of what has been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry. This remains our position today. The President has nonetheless provided unprecedented cooperation. The Special Counsel has been provided with more than 30 witnesses, 1.4 million pages of material, and now the President's written responses to questions. It is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion,\u201d Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s attorney told ABC News in a statement.\n\nABC News previously reported that the president spent several days last week huddling with his legal team to prepare his answers, which focus largely on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump told reporters last week that he was concerned investigators might be using the questions to try to catch him perjuring himself.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nDespite repeatedly expressing a willingness to sit down for an in-person interview with special counsel prosecutors, Trump told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d over the weekend that he has \u201cprobably\u201d ruled it out, though he reserved the right to change his mind.\n\nOver the course of his 18-month long probe, Mueller and his team of prosecutors have secured indictments against 32 individuals and three Russian businesses on charges ranging from computer hacking to financial crimes.\n\nThose indictments have led to six guilty pleas and three people sentenced to prison. A former campaign aide and three former Trump campaign officials \u2013 including his onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2013 are among those who have pleaded guilty."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Tech stocks sink again, erasing market's gains for the year; Dow Jones Industrial Average drops 500 points", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The move by KKR and Bain Capital announced T\u2026 [+2568 chars]", "fulltext": "Two private equity owners of the iconic Toys R Us toy chain have set up a $20 million hardship fund for the thousands of former workers left jobless and without severance after the chain was liquidated in June.\n\nKKR and Bain Capital announced Tuesday the creation of the fund aimed at helping the 30,000 workers affected by the store closures, a move that followed efforts by worker-backed groups. The fund wasn't legally required, and the groups call it an \"unprecedented\" step toward helping families caught up in the store closures and bankruptcies that have roiled the fast-changing retail industry.\n\nWorkers are pushing to get an additional $55 million they believe they're owed and are looking to other firms that had a stake in Toys R Us and that they believed played a role in the chain's demise.\n\n\"This is an amazing first step, but the goal is to keep the pressure on,\" said Ann Marie Reinhart, 59, of Durham, North Carolina, who worked at Toys R Us for 29 years, most recently as a store supervisor. She said she hasn't been able to find work that pays health insurance since she was laid off early this past summer.\n\nWhile the iconic toy retailer was liquidating its hundreds of stores in June, workers were informed they would not get severance. They began protesting outside the New York offices of the retailer's former owners KKR, Bain and Vornado Realty Trust, firms that loaded the company with debt, helping push it into bankruptcy in the fall of 2017.\n\nThen, they showed up at more than a dozen pension meetings around the country over the last few months, exerting pressure on them to push the equity owners they invest in to do right by workers and act more responsibly.\n\nSince late summer, Toys R Us workers have been pressuring pension funds to in turn push a group of hedge firms that owned the retailer's secured debt in a bid to get the remaining money they say is owed to them. These so-called secured creditors, including Solus Alternative Asset Management and Angelo Gordon, were the ones that ultimately pushed for the liquidation as they looked to get returns for their investors.\n\nThe groups that organized the Toys R Us workers \u2014 Organization United for Respect, along with Private Equity Stakeholder Project and the Center for Popular Democracy \u2014 say that the hardship fund is being structured to allow the other firms to contribute, paving the way for Solus, Vornado and others to contribute.\n\nKKR and Bain said the fund was established in response to the \"extraordinary set of circumstances\" that led to Toys R Us being shuttered.\n\n\"The confluence of the disruption in retail, the push by the company's secured creditors to liquidate the company's U.S. operations, and the fact that we have never experienced something like this in the history of either firm, led us to try and find a way to provide some financial relief for former employees,\" the two firms said in a joint statement.\n\nThe fund is administered by independent third party administrators, Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros, experts in designing and administering unique compensation programs such as the 9/11 fund and the BP oil spill fund. They'll serve as independent administrators of the fund, responsible for the independent management and distribution of all proceeds.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Simone Miranda", "title": "Create a Disney Parks-Inspired Thanksgiving Centerpiece", "description": "Resident crafter, Brittany Ungvarsky, has provided a step-by-step guide on how to create some fun Mason jar Thanksgiving table dressings.", "url": "https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2018/11/create-a-disney-parks-inspired-thanksgiving-centerpiece/", "urlToImage": "https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/17_PR_000000_BLOG_Thanksgiving-Centerpiece-DIY_COVER_v1_bu.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:01:37Z", "content": "By submitting this form, you are granting Disney Parks Blog permission to email you.

She is also looking to flesh out a political declaration about the future relationship with the EU.\n\nMay's deal has been met with widespread opposition within the British parliament, raising the prospect that it might be voted down. If that happens, Britain could end up leaving the EU without a deal, though many lawmakers are pushing for another Brexit referendum.\n\nMay is hoping that independent assessments from the likes of the Bank of England will help her deal through the parliamentary vote, expected in December, especially if the bank says that a no-deal outcome could to lead to recession.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party, which is against the deal, hopes that a defeat for May could lead to a general election. And if it doesn't, it could reportedly back calls for another referendum to reconsider Brexit altogether.\n\nPart of the deal involves Britain following EU rules after Brexit day on March 29, until the end of 2020.

And online sales soared 49 percent. In the previous quarter, Target racked up the strongest same-store sales growth in 13 years.\n\nThe battle for customers has become rooted in convenience and to that end, Target leapt in front of rival Walmart with free, two-day delivery for any delivery. Amazon followed by dropping its $25 minimum for free delivery.\n\nEarly last year, Target began an aggressive three-year plan to invest $7 billion in its stores and online operations. The company has been remodeling its stores and building brands from scratch like trendy electronics under the Heyday brand and men's clothing brand called Goodfellow. But with increasing pressure from online behemoth Amazon and shoppers' demanding more convenience, a large part of those investments are going toward transforming its stores into shipping hubs to cut shipping costs and speed deliveries. It's expanded a variety of services that allow people to pick up goods curbside or get next-day delivery for some purchases.\n\nBehind the scenes, it's been remaking the backroom operations of 1,400 of the 1,800 stores that ship online orders to customers. Target says that overhaul was been key in its ability to offer two-day free shipping this holiday.\n\nTarget exclusively told The AP that it's redesigned the pack stations, while workers' tasks are now divided into clear roles: pickers, those who prep orders, packers and sorters. Target workers have also received new tools like new carts that have compartments to make it easier to organize the orders. They're also armed with new apps on their phones that help them navigate the store to find the online orders more quickly or tell them exactly how much tape to put across that box of Tide so it doesn't open during shipping.\n\nRoughly about 130 stores have undergone a major backroom overhauls, complete with conveyor belts and LED lighting similar to the store's selling floor. The changes shave seconds off each task, adding up to minutes saved that will bring shipping costs down.\n\nThe new measures underscore how Target is doubling down on becoming more efficient. Two-thirds of Target's online volume is now going through the stores with more than half of the orders being shipped to homes. The remainder is from order pickup or curbside pickup services. When Target ships an online order from a store, it ships two days faster on average compared to shipping from a fulfillment center. In fact, 90 percent of Target's two-day online deliveries are being handled at stores. Revamped backrooms are doing three times more volume than the rest of the chain. That's helped Target become 25 percent more efficient in shipping online orders than just last year, according to the company.\n\n\"We're trying to get speed for the guests and the faster we can get in the backroom, the faster we can make that promise,\" said John Mulligan, chief operating officer, during a phone interview with The Associated Press. He says the ultimate goal: a 24 hour turnaround between when an item is sold and then replaced on the shelf.\n\nTarget says all the new enhancements in its online operations will enable the company to fulfill twice as many orders for the holiday shopping season as it did last year.\n\nMulligan said that it deployed engineers and analytics to analyze each step of the process figuring out where the bottlenecks were and how to eliminate them.\n\nDuring a tour of the backroom at Target's Edison, N.J. store, workers assume specific tasks in assembly line operations in a space that's the size of about 12 parking lots.\n\nWorkers now use new carts that have 19 compartments that can keep everyone's order separate. Previously, workers put everyone's order in two baskets in cart.\n\nAll this is designed to make the job \"simple and repeatable as possible,\" Mulligan said.\n\nStill, the latest results show that Target has more work to do to keep costs down.\n\nThe company reported income of $622 million, or $1.17 per share. Per-share earnings without one-time benefits and pretax gains were $1.09, 2 cents short of expectations, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nRevenue for the Minneapolis retailer was $17.82 billion, just edging out Wall Street expectations.\n\nTarget expects full-year earnings in the range of $5.30 to $5.50 per share\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPortions of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

Add The Note as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Note news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThey are now on the record: 14 men and two women who really, really don't want Nancy Pelosi to become speaker of the House again.\n\nThe letter from current and future House members vowing to not back her will not be enough to block her path to the speakership. Though more who share their sentiments didn't sign on, the anti-Pelosi squad is still without a candidate of its own.\n\nBut if this is a distraction, it's one unlikely to fade even with the swearing-in of the new Congress. The Democratic Party remains locked in internal battles that are ideological as well as attitudinal -- and, as laid bare in current arguments over who should be speaker, often generational.\n\n\"We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise,\" the anti-Pelosi letter-signers wrote, in language vague enough to satisfy any number of agendas.\n\nFor her part, Pelosi seemed to be signaling an exit strategy when she told the Los Angeles Times last month that she saw herself as a \"transitional figure.\" Notably, though, she's already walking that back.\n\n\"I think every leader is a transitional figure,\" she told Robert Draper of The New York Times magazine.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nBreaking down the math, Democrats have won 232 seats so far -- and in the two races still rated outstanding, according to ABC News projections, the Democratic candidate is up in one and down in the other.\n\nUsing 232 as the base, Leader Nancy Pelosi could afford to lose 14 incoming Democrats and still get to the magic 218 number she needs to win a majority and the speaker's gavel.\n\nYes, 15 newly elected Democrats signed onto a letter -- 16 people total, but one in a race not yet projected by ABC News -- saying they're committed to voting for new leadership. The signatories were essentially pleading for any other Democrat to run.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Pelosi is anywhere near sunk.\n\nShould no one else emerge to challenge her, and all those signatories simply vote \"present\" or not vote at all, she would be OK. The group would have to reach about 30 -- closer to the total margin Democrats will have over Republicans -- to change the entire calculus.\n\nFor the time being, until there is an actual challenger, the story remains: What are Democrats on the fence asking for? Committee assignments? New bills? Legislative action guarantees?\n\nThe progressive caucus, for example, has been asking for equal representation on powerful committees and there's a tug of war over who will be the next chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, too.\n\nThrough that lens, the speakership fight could still change the agenda come January.\n\nThe TIP with John Verhovek\n\nIf there's anyone who understands close races, it's Utah congresswoman Mia Love.\n\nLove, who lost her first congressional bid in 2012 by just 768 votes, only to win two years later by slightly more than 7,000 votes, has been locked in a tight race for re-election with Democrat Ben McAdams in one of two U.S. House races still not projected by ABC News.\n\nRick Bowmer/AP\n\nLate Monday night, just hours after Love had taken her first lead of the race, McAdams, aided by post-Election Day votes in Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County, opened up a 739-vote lead.\n\nIf Democrats are able to defeat Love, one of just three Republican women of color currently serving in the House -- and one of a select group of GOP candidates personally lambasted by President Donald Trump in his post-election news conference -- it would increase the party's net gain this cycle to 38 seats.\n\nAnd while one seat won't shift the balance of power in the House, this race could factor into Nancy Pelosi's bid to be the next speaker. McAdams was one of the 16 Democrats who signed that letter committing to vote against her.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.

Parliament's Treasury Select Committee had asked for the findings to be published \"in good time before any Parliamentary votes.\"\n\nHowever, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the bank won't publish an assessment of Britain staying in the EU.\n\nThe assessment draws on a regular Financial Stability Report and stress tests into the country's banks. The stability report and the stress tests are being brought forward to Nov. 28 from Dec. 5.\n\nThere is growing speculation that Parliament will vote, most likely in mid-December, against May's withdrawal agreement given widespread opposition.

However, there's speculation that the transition could be extended and that would provide businesses more time to adapt to new relations with the EU.\n\nMay's deal with the EU on how Britain leaves the EU has been met with widespread opposition within the British parliament, raising the prospect that it might be voted down.

Supreme Court judges say they do not have jurisdiction to hear the case because there has not yet been a final ruling.\n\nThe Luxembourg-based European court has a hearing set for Nov. 27.\n\nA group of anti-Brexit politicians is seeking a ruling that Britain can halt the two-year countdown to Brexit that it triggered in March 2017.\n\nThe British government says it has no intention of reversing Brexit.

In a recent interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace, Trump said he didn't know Whitaker had criticized the Russia probe, but added he wouldn't stop the acting attorney from limiting its scope.\n\nABC News White House Correspondent Karen Travers tells us: \"If this [investigation] were to continue going on and on and growing, [Whitaker] thinks there should be limitations put on it.

Hotel industry representatives, economists, analysts and public officials from more than 20 countries and 30 cities attended.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nAirbnb responded by hiring an LED truck that played a video ad and which was parked on the same city block as the conference hotel.\n\nThe ad, which played on a loop, featured ordinary looking people holding up placards that said: \"The big hotel industry made $77 billion last year. While taking over $5 billion in tax subsidies. So ... we subsidize the big hotels record profits. But we can't earn extra money on Airbnb?\" It ended with the statement: Paid for by Airbnb.\n\nThere were also a couple dozen pro-Airbnb protestors who said they were hosts outside the hotel. Their signs echoed the language in the video ad word for word. Some of the hotel-industry executives stepped outside to be photographed with the protestors.\n\n\"Big hotels writing short-term rental policy is like big tobacco writing health policy -- it's just a bad idea and is ultimately bad for regular people,\" a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nLast week, Airbnb announced it had booked more than $1 billion in revenue in its third quarter as the company is well on its way to being one of the most-watched initial public offerings next year.\n\nHowever, the Silicon Valley-based company is tussling with many of the municipalities in which it operates over increased regulations. It has filed several lawsuits to avoid handing over data about who uses the platform to governments. Opposition to short-term rentals, as the practice is called, has created a network of strange bedfellows, including city officials, hotel owners and operators, and rent-control advocates in cities disrupted by these companies.\n\nCritics said that because private home rentals are unregulated, the areas in which these companies operate are robbed of taxes, are more vulnerable to crime and public disturbances, and could house nefarious behavior ranging from noise complaints to drug activity and prostitution or human trafficking.\n\nEarlier this year, New York City comptroller Scott Stringer released a report that said Airbnb was responsible for nearly 10 percent of rent increases throughout New York City between 2009 and 2016. Tenants in Murray Hill, Gramercy, Stuyvesant Town, Williamsburg and Greenpoint paid monthly increases of more than $100 due to Airbnb listings in that time period, according to the report.\n\n\"Their business model had a direct impact on our affordability housing crisis,\" Stringer told attendees. \"Right after we issued our report, the company put the propaganda machine to work. They started on personal attacks. Airbnb spent like $1 million on TV ads blasting me and my office ... in New York City, we do the right thing and stand up to bullies.\"\n\nAt the time, the company issued a statement that said: \"Our message to Comptroller Stringer and his hotel industry allies is loud and clear: Rather than attacking the nearly 50,000 middle-class families who rely on Airbnb, it's time to work with us to help New Yorkers stay in their homes. We look forward to continually making this point over the next few weeks.\"\n\nNew York City, Airbnb's second-biggest market with about 50,000 listings, is a constant battleground for parties fighting encroachment. Next February, a new law requiring platforms to hand over information about every short-term rental in the city is scheduled to go into effect. Airbnb and other sites had sued the city in federal court in Manhattan to prevent the law from taking effect.\n\nIn the meantime, New York has cracked down on violations -- last month The Atelier, a 46-story luxury apartment building in Manhattan, received 27 notices of violations for illegal hotel operations in a raid, first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn addition to the LED display truck, the organized protestors and the statement, Airbnb's head of Northeast policy Josh Meltzer wrote an op-ed titled \"Time for a Truce: A Path Forward for Airbnb, The Hotel Industry & Home Sharing in New York.\"\n\n\"We are ready for a hard, honest discussion. Eager, in fact. Because our hosts -- real New York families -- are depending on us to have that discussion, to bring some resolution and security to their own lives and financial future. We want a solution,\" Meltzer wrote. \"We are at our seats at the table, hand extended. And we hope the big hotel industry will join us.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Germany: Man kills ex-girlfriend, her new partner, baby", "description": "German authorities say a 38-year-old man is believed to have stabbed dead his ex-girlfriend, her new partner and a three-week old baby before killing himself", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/germany-man-kills-girlfriend-partner-baby-59310591", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:58:41Z", "content": "German authorities say a 38-year-old man is believed to have stabbed to death his ex-girlfriend, her new partner and a three-week old baby before killing himself.

They are unheard of in most other areas, including where the school is located in the southern Guangxi region, a popular tourist destination known for spectacular scenery, not violence or terrorism.\n\nThat's why the planned checks worry some.\n\n\"Xinjiang has emerged as China's surveillance laboratory,\" said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic politics and national identity at La Trobe University in Australia. \"It is unsurprising that some of the methods first pioneered in China's west are now being rolled out in other regions.\"\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the government has in recent years tried to tighten controls over what the public sees and says online and stepped up political oversight of universities. Sometimes, these measures have run into a new generation of Chinese accustomed to greater freedoms, sparking public outcry and occasionally government retreat.\n\nThe leaked notice in Guilin warned that hostile domestic groups and foreign powers are \"wantonly spreading illicit and illegal videos\" through the internet. It said the search for violent, terrorist, reactionary and obscene content, which was to be conducted this month, was necessary to resist and combat extremist recordings that it called mentally harmful.\n\nThe order triggered a public uproar last week.\n\nPosts on China's Twitter-like Weibo site with hashtags on schools checking electronic devices were viewed nearly 80 million times. Users voiced privacy concerns, comparing the measure to computer chips inserted in brains and the George Orwell novel \"1984.\"\n\nThen came critical editorials in state-run publications saying the notice could violate Chinese constitutional protection of the right to communicate freely and have those communications remain confidential.\n\n\"If colleges and universities check the phones, computers, and hard disks of teachers and students, they're suspected of infringing on communication freedom and privacy,\" said an editorial in the Beijing Youth Daily. \"Those responsible at the school should be held accountable, as they had a great negative impact on the school's image.\"\n\nAdministrators told another state-owned publication, \"The Paper,\" that the search had not yet been carried out, and that they were considering reducing its scope. University and local education ministry officials referred questions to a media office, which did not answer repeated phone calls.\n\nWeibo, while not a government body, ran into hot water in April when it said it would censor content related to gay issues on its microblog. The company backpedaled under intense criticism, including from state-run publications.\n\nIt's unclear what prompted the Guilin university's planned search. It could have been a trial run to see how the public would react or an overzealous local administrator, said Christopher Colley, a National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates assistant professor who has lectured at Chinese universities.\n\nEither way, he said, the backlash shows that though online censorship is common in China, physical searches of phones and laptops is an extreme measure that many will not accept.\n\n\"Most people in China are willing to tolerate Big Brother as long as it contributes to social stability, but for many, this is going too far,\" Colley said.\n\nSchools in Xinjiang have been conducting similar searches since the region's highest court in early 2014 issued a notice forbidding audio and video recordings promoting terrorism, religious extremism and ethnic division.\n\nTeachers and administrators at Xinjiang Normal University's College of Physics and Electronics searched electronic devices in every dormitory on campus on Nov. 9, 2014. A post about the search on the school's website says, \"Through investigating violent and terroristic videos, religious extremism on campus has been weakened.\"\n\nIn 2017, China University of Petroleum's branch in Karamay, a city in oil country in Xinjiang's north, ordered various school departments to assign inspectors to search the computers of all teachers on campus.\n\nXinjiang is home to a large Uighur population, a Muslim ethnic group that has long harbored simmering resentment against rule from Beijing. A series of riots and attacks blamed on separatist Uighurs has prompted a sweeping crackdown on Muslims in the region.\n\nChina has rolled out one of the world's most aggressive surveillance and policing programs both in Xinjiang and neighboring Tibet.\n\nUighurs are regularly singled out and stopped at checkpoints to have their smartphones scanned for religious content. As The Associated Press reported in May, they risk being detained and sent to internment camps if police find songs or videos they deem suspicious or apps that are commonly used to contact people outside China, such as WhatsApp.\n\n\"Xinjiang today appears to be the leading-edge of a highly intrusive and coercive surveillance society that the (Communist Party) is intent on constructing across China,\" Leibold said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Israel police: Interior minister should be charged for fraud - ABC News", "description": "Israel police: Interior minister should be charged for fraud ABC News Israeli police are recommending charges be brought against the country's interior minister in a major corruption case.

The Houthis announced Monday they would halt rocket attacks against Saudi Arabia and UAE, with violence in Yemen's main port Hodeida dying down as well.\n\nBut peace talks cannot come soon enough for Yemen, where it's estimated at least 10,000 civilians have been killed, starvation and diseases like cholera are widespread, and 14 million sit on the brink of famine.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the conflict in Yemen, a country larger than California and home to more than 28 million people:\n\nHow did it start?\n\nPolitics in Yemen are complicated, and the history runs deep. The Houthis draw their roots from an old Shia movement that formed in the 1990s to push back on Ali Abdullah Saleh, the first president of a unified Yemen who ruled from 1990 until he was forced to resign in 2012.\n\nAbdullrhman Huwais/AP\n\nSaleh was driven out by the same forces that fueled the Arab Spring across the Middle East -- national uprisings over discontent with the state of politics and the lack of economic opportunities. In Saleh's place, his vice president Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi took over in 2012, backed by the Saudis -- Yemen's richer and more powerful neighbor to the north.\n\nMohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo get back into power, Saleh allied with the Houthis in 2014, and as massive protests pushed Hadi out of the country in 2015, their coalition, known as Ansar Allah, captured Yemen's capital Sanaa, the major port Hodeida, and more territory in the country's northwest. Fearful of the Houthis' ties to Iran, Saudi Arabia saw their march to power as a threat and went to war against them.\n\nWho's involved?\n\nThe Saudis brought together a coalition including UAE, Bahrain and other traditional allies and began a military campaign in March 2015, with Defense Minister Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman promising an easy, early victory. Their military support has been the muscle behind Hadi and his internationally recognized government against the strong coalition Ansar Allah, although Saleh broke away from the coalition and was killed days later in an assassination.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nAccording to U.N. reports, Iran has provided weapons to the Houthis in violation of a U.N. arms embargo. But some analysts say it's not as close a proxy relationship as Iran has with other groups, like Shia militias in Iraq or Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nAfter nearly four years, the Saudi coalition's air and naval blockade has choked off rebel-controlled territory -- and created a humanitarian disaster. With fighting largely stalemated for months now, Ansar Allah is still in control of major population centers like Sanaa and Hodeida, but the Yemeni government controls a majority of the country's territory.\n\nHani Mohammed/AP\n\nBoth the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition have been credibly accused by the U.N. of war crimes. In particular, the Saudis have been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilians and targeting civilian infrastructure to starve off their opposition -- bombings that have garnered international outrage.\n\nWhat is America's role?\n\nIn Western countries, that outrage stems from the U.S. and U.K.'s military support for the Saudis and Emiratis.\n\nWhen Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman began his campaign, the Obama administration supported him and the Royal Saudi Air Force, as the U.S. has for decades. Since then, the Pentagon has provided midair refueling for Saudi warplanes, assisted with intelligence and reconnaissance, conducted training to improve Saudi targeting, and sold them weapons and munitions.\n\nThat's in part because perhaps the strongest branch of al Qaeda resides in Yemen -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP. They have some of the strongest technical knowledge on how to produce stealthy bombs and sneak them onto commercial planes, presenting a threat to the U.S. and Americans. For years, the U.S. has conducted drone strikes against the group with the backing of the Saudi and Yemeni governments -- a campaign potentially threatened by the Houthis' rise to power.\n\nHani Mohammed/AP\n\nThe Trump administration has also highlighted Iran's support for the Houthis as a sign of Iran's \"malign\" activity in the region, saying their support for Saudi Arabia is about pushing back against its regional rival across the Middle East. When asked in a recent interview why Americans should care about Yemen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited AQAP and Iran, saying the terror group \"continues there to plot terror attacks on the United States of America\" and Iran \"continues to provide missiles and artillery that threatens Western interests.\"\n\nBut in recent months, calls for the U.S. to end that support for the Saudi coalition have yielded some results. A bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress have pushed the Trump administration to end any assistance, leading to an end to midair refueling earlier this month.\n\nWhat's the toll?\n\nThe death toll in Yemen is in dispute, in part because it has become so difficult to report. Despite the ongoing carnage, for years the number that has been widely cited is 10,000 people killed after it was first mentioned by the U.N. in 2016. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights' office reported in April that 6,300 civilians had been confirmed killed, meaning the victims' name, age, and address were verified.\n\nHani Mohammed/AP\n\nBut analysts say those numbers are conservative, to say the least.\n\nIn fact, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a research group that studies violence, nearly six times that amount have been killed in fighting since 2016, not the entirety of the war and excluding those killed by disease or starvation. The group Save the Children estimated last year that 130 children die every day from hunger and disease, with 50,000 children expected to die in 2017 alone.\n\nWhile Yemen has been historically poorer than its neighbors, the war has exacerbated the situation and created a humanitarian crisis. The Yemeni economy has collapsed, leading to sky-high prices, little to no income for the majority of Yemenis, and few able to afford food or other basic necessities. While the warring sides siege cities or blockade ports, the world aid delivered to the country is often blocked from finding its way to those in need. Amid the starvation and violence, health care facilities have also been destroyed.\n\nAll of that could now put up to 14 million Yemenis on the brink of a famine, the U.N. warned in October.

Add Interest\n\nA dead whale that washed ashore in eastern Indonesia had a large lump of plastic waste in its stomach, including drinking cups and flip-flops, a park official said Tuesday, causing concern among environmentalists and government officials in one of the world's largest plastic polluting countries.\n\nRescuers from Wakatobi National Park found the rotting carcass of the 9.5-meter (31-foot) sperm whale late Monday near the park in Southeast Sulawesi province after receiving a report from environmentalists that villagers had surrounded the dead whale and were beginning to butcher the rotting carcass, park chief Heri Santoso said.\n\nSantoso said researchers from wildlife conservation group WWF and the park's conservation academy found about 5.9 kilograms (13 pounds) of plastic waste in the animal's stomach containing 115 plastic cups, four plastic bottles, 25 plastic bags, 2 flip-flops, a nylon sack and more than 1,000 other assorted pieces of plastic.\n\n\"Although we have not been able to deduce the cause of death, the facts that we see are truly awful,\" said Dwi Suprapti, a marine species conservation coordinator at WWF Indonesia.\n\nShe said it was not possible to determine if the plastic had caused the whale's death because of the animal's advanced state of decay.\n\nIndonesia, an archipelago of 260 million people, is the world's second-largest plastic polluter after China, according to a study published in the journal Science in January. It produces 3.2 million tons of mismanaged plastic waste a year, of which 1.29 million tons ends up in the ocean, the study said.\n\nLuhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia's coordinating minister of maritime affairs, said the whale's discovery should raise public awareness about the need to reduce plastic use, and had spurred the government to take tougher measures to protect the ocean.\n\n\"I'm so sad to hear this,\" said Pandjaitan, who recently has campaigned for less use of plastic. \"It is possible that many other marine animals are also contaminated with plastic waste and this is very dangerous for our lives.\"\n\nHe said the government is making efforts to reduce the use of plastic, including urging shops not to provide plastic bags for customers and teaching about the problem in schools nationwide to meet a government target of reducing plastic use by 70 percent by 2025.\n\n\"This big ambition can be achieved if people learn to understand that plastic waste is a common enemy,\" he told The Associated Press."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Amazon HQ expansion means tough fight for talent", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

They also fret about hanging on to their employees.\n\nSome of the industries that have defined New York City and the Washington, D.C., area will face increased competition for talent when Amazon sets up shop in their territory, with plans to hire 50,000 new workers amid the tightest job market in decades.\n\nThe expansion comes at time of fierce demand for computer programmers, mobile app developers, data scientists and cybersecurity experts. Salaries keep rising as companies from banks to retailers seek new technology professionals to expand their online presence and automate operations. Particularly in demand are software developers, with many switching jobs each year. Even some banks have eased up on their dress codes to project a hipper image.\n\n\"It's a very competitive market in New York,\" said William Lynch, president of the New York-based fitness tech company Peloton. \"It really requires you to be smart about how you are reaching the new hiring pipeline.\"\n\nTech employment in the U.S. has grown by an average of 200,000 new jobs each year since 2010, a trend that is expected to continue for at least the next decade, according to an industry report from Computing Technology Industry Association, or CompTIA, which analyzes data from the Labor Department and other sources. The figure includes all people employed by tech companies, as well as tech professionals in other industries.\n\nIn New York, big banks are among the biggest employers of computer technology professionals. J.P. Morgan Chase employs 50,000 people in technology and hired its first artificial intelligence research chief in May. Goldman Sachs has said one-quarter of its employees work in engineering-related roles. Amazon's traditional retail rivals are striving to expand their online business and develop new technologies to improve operational efficiency.\n\nBut young professionals are flocking to tech companies, lured by the idea of changing the way people do everything from buying homes to exercising.\n\n\"In the past, the traditional career path has been to go into financial services, investment banking and consulting. What we see now is a surge of interest in tech companies,\" said Dan Wang, a professor of Business and Sociology at Columbia University.\n\nAmazon will begin recruiting in a few months for its two new headquarters in New York's Long Island City and the Washington suburb of Arlington, seeking talent to support an empire that has expanded to include cloud computing services, advertising and, video streaming and TV production. The company expects to hire about 25,000 people over several years for each location. The average salary will be about $150,000 a year.\n\nAmazon's move is only the most dramatic example of technology companies expanding their presence in the East Coast. Instagram opened a new office in New York over the summer and plans to hire hundreds of engineers. Google is reportedly looking to add 12,000 more employees in New York City.\n\nAmazon, now 24 years old, will have to contend with New York's thriving startup scene, where companies flush with venture capital offer young people big roles and the chance to upend new industries.\n\nThat's the kind of pitch prospective employees hear from Peloton, which announced plans Monday to move into bigger headquarters in midtown Manhattan in 2020. The fitness tech company, which received $550 million in new investment in August, will be hiring thousands of people across locations in the next years, especially in technology, marketing and sales, said Lynch, the company president. It currently has nearly 100 positions open in New York City.\n\n\"We are aware of Amazon and it's amazing for New York City. But Google has been here. We've been recruiting against Google for a long time,\" Lynch said.\n\nThe scramble for talent goes beyond tech workers. Technology companies employ more than 3.7 million people in supporting roles like marketing and financing, according to CompTIA.\n\nThat panorama is top of mind for people like Dimple Bansal, a business graduate student at Columbia University who is focusing her studies on technology strategy. Last spring, she took an internship at Airbnb and over the summer she interned at Google.\n\n\"Tech is a growing landscape. I think it's exciting to bridge the divide between pure technology skills, and to bring the business mindset to these companies that are touching so many lives,\" said Bansal, 27.\n\nFinancial institutions have stepped up their recruiting strategies, trying to present their companies as innovation hubs for products from mobile apps to AI solutions for fraud reduction.\n\nJ.P. Morgan announced plans earlier this year to open a financial technology campus in California's Bay Area. Goldman holds online coding challenges as part of its recruitment efforts and launched an in-house incubator to allow employees to develop ideas.\n\nWang, the Columbia professor, said startup fashion brands could benefit from partnerships if Amazon leverages its New York location to venture into the luxury market. But Wang said that could mean a competition for workers from rivals like Walmart-owned Jet.com, which currently has job openings for dozens of engineers in its New Jersey headquarters, across the Hudson River from New York.\n\n\"If I were working at Jet.com, I would be very tempted by Amazon,\" Wang said.\n\nAs technology firms spread out, young professionals can be choosy about where they live, another incentive for companies like Amazon to set up shop in in trendy urban centers.\n\nBased on an analysis of the revisions in job listings made on its online professional network, LinkedIn calculated 13 percent of the workers specializing in software leave their employers for another job each year.\n\nMathew Calkins, a 25-year-old machine learning engineer who works in Washington, D.C., for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, is moving to New York to work at Google later this year. He saw New York City as a thriving technical hub with more diversity than many of its West Coast counterparts.\n\n\"I didn't want to move to San Francisco and have everyone I hang out with be other engineers making six figures,\" Calkins said.\n\nCalkins said recruiters who reach out to him nearly every day on LinkedIn rarely focus on \"what's important to me and a growing number of folks in the tech market\" \u2014 the chance to make an impact. Instead, employers tout compensation and perks.\n\n\"They all sound the same,\" Calkins said.\n\nEven if they can retain their employees, some of the smaller companies might struggle attract new talent needed to expand, said Carrie Duarte, a Partner and Workforce of the Future Leader at PwC. Their best bet is to tout the chance to be a big fish in a small pond, she said.\n\nKestrel Linder, CEO of the Washington, D.C., startup GiveCampus, said has learned that he can lure prospective employees to his online educational fundraiser by offering comparable salaries and more autonomy.\n\n\"Working at a startup while it is still growing is a perishable opportunity,\" Linder said. \"The giant companies aren't going anywhere.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Technology Writers Barbara Ortutay and Michael Liedtke contributed to this story."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Thailand sentences 3 to prison over smuggling of rhino horns", "description": "A Thai court has sentenced three people to prison over the smuggling of nearly two dozen rhinoceros horns worth $1.5 million from Ethiopia", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thailand-sentences-prison-smuggling-rhino-horns-59310301", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_94ab5a7d818a494195c0e4d09b42bc3e_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T08:10:28Z", "content": "A Thai court on Tuesday sentenced three people to prison over the smuggling of nearly two dozen rhinoceros horns from Ethiopia worth $1.5 million.

Even Harbaugh realizes Jackson can't run the ball at that pace in the future.\n\n\"Yeah, you don't want your quarterback getting hit that much,\" Harbaugh said Monday. \"It's not going to last that way. So, that's pretty self-evident.\"\n\nPlenty of running quarterbacks have been successful, though taking hits exposes them to more injuries. Michael Vick is the all-time leading rusher among quarterbacks but he missed a bunch of games during his career.

Clemens (16 TDs, 21 INTs, 68.9), Johnson (5 TDs, 10 INTs, 57.7), Yates (10 TDs, 11 INTs, 70.7) and Manuel (20 TDs, 16 INTs, 77.1) are much less impressive. But there's an unsigned quarterback \u2014 Kaepernick \u2014 with 72 TDs, 30 INTs and 88.9 rating. He's also 4-2 in the playoffs. Like the rest of the NFL, the Redskins weren't interested.\n\nRUNNING IT UP: Saints coach Sean Payton defended his decision to go for a fourth-and-7 leading by 31 points early in the fourth quarter. Drew Brees threw a 37-yard TD pass to Alvin Kamara with 13:15 left in a 45-7 win over Philadelphia. Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, who began his career with the Saints and was beat on the play, wasn't pleased. He raised both of his middle fingers at Payton. But Jenkins spoke to Payton after the game and told a reporter: \"I'm a competitor. I love Sean to death. I know what type of guy and coach he is. That was more so personal between me and him.\"\n\nUNAGGRESSIVE DOUG: Eagles coach Doug Pederson's unconventional style was lauded during the team's run to a Super Bowl victory last season, but he's played it safe more often this year. On the opening possession in Philadelphia's lopsided loss at New Orleans, the Eagles faced a fourth down and less than a yard at the Saints 24. Pederson elected to punt even though his offense needed to try and score and keep Brees and Co. off the field as long as possible.\n\n\"That's one I look at that maybe you do something different right,\" Pederson said in hindsight.\n\nNO CHALLENGE: Broncos coach Vance Joseph decided not to challenge a 2-point conversion to save a timeout and it nearly cost him until Brandon McManus kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired to beat the Chargers. Joseph chose not to toss the red flag after Case Keenum came up short on a 2-point draw following Phillip Lindsay's touchdown run that put Denver ahead 20-19 with 12 minutes left.

They later withdrew weapons and troops from 11 of their guard posts and decided to completely dismantle 10 of them by the end of November.\n\nSeoul's Defense Ministry said it confirmed the dismantling of 10 North Korean guard posts on Tuesday. It said North Korean soldiers had used hammers to tear down parts of the guard posts ahead of Tuesday's near-simultaneous demolitions. A ministry statement said North Korea had informed the South of its plans in advance.\n\nThe ministry released photos showing parts of structures on what it said was the North Korean side of the central portion of the border, an explosion with black smoke at the site, and debris scattered around the area with no trace left of the structure.\n\nSouth Korea began dismantling 10 of its guard posts with dynamite and excavators last week. Ministry officials said Tuesday that they haven't completed the dismantling work yet.\n\nThe Korean border, the world's most heavily armed with an estimated 2 million land mines, has been the site of deadly fighting and bloodshed. Called the Demilitarized Zone, it was originally created as a buffer at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nSouth Korea had about 60 posts inside the DMZ guarded by layers of barbed wire and manned by troops with machine guns. North Korea was estimated to have 160 such front-line posts. Once the dismantling is done, the two Koreas are to jointly verify their work by the end of December. They haven't decided when they will dismantle the rest of the guard posts.\n\nUnder the September agreements, the Koreas have also taken steps to disarm the shared border village of Panmunjom, halted live-fire drills along the border and have been removing mines at a front-line area to conduct their first joint searches for Korean War dead.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have improved since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to South Korea and the United States early this year with a vague promise to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

In limiting asylum, Trump used the same powers he used to impose a travel ban \u2014 the third try was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nAlfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA joint statement by Homeland Security and the Justice Department said the Supreme Court had already shown the president had the legal right to restrict asylum.\n\n\"Our asylum system is broken, and it is being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year,\" the departments said. \"We look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch's legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border.\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, speaking at a San Diego news conference, called the ruling \"dangerous\" and expressed confidence it would be overturned on appeal.\n\nTrump on Tuesday criticized the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which would likely receive any appeal of Tigar's order and has already ruled against the administration in several immigration cases. Trump called the circuit a \"disgrace\" and its judges \"very unfair.\"\n\nWhether asylum seekers would try now to enter between official ports of entry was unclear. One immigrant waiting at the official border crossing vowed to stay in line regardless of the ruling.\n\n\"I've always taken the correct path, and I'm not going to do something illegal now,\" said Byron Torrez, 28, of Nicaragua.\n\nTorrez said he fled Nicaragua after someone threw acid at him during a government protest. He said he did not travel with any of the caravans.\n\n\"I think it is good that the court did this because a lot of people cross illegally, not to break the law, but because they believe you have to get to the U.S. first before requesting asylum,\" he said.\n\nThe regulations were put in place in part to stop what the government says are loopholes that allow thousands of people to avoid deportation. DHS estimates around 70,000 people a year claim asylum after crossing illegally. But illegal crossings overall are well below historical highs from previous decades.\n\nTigar's ruling notes that federal law says someone may seek asylum if they have arrived in the United States, \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival.\"\n\n\"Individuals are entitled to asylum if they cross between ports of entry,\" said Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which sued the government alongside the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It couldn't be clearer.\"\n\nAround 3,000 people from the first of the caravans have arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Monday that it closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the San Ysidro crossing to install movable, wire-topped barriers after reports that some migrants were planning to rush through the lanes \u2014 but none did.\n\nAs of Monday, DHS said it had referred 107 people to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 people who had sought asylum between official crossings since Trump's order went into effect. Officials didn't say whether those people's cases were still progressing through other, more difficult avenues left to them after the proclamation.\n\nAdministration officials said the asylum law changes were meant to funnel migrants through official border crossings for speedy rulings instead of having them try to evade such crossings on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border.\n\nBut many border crossings such as San Ysidro already have extensive wait times. People are often forced to wait in shelters or outdoor camps on the Mexican side, sometimes for weeks.\n\nACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said that some people seeking asylum cross between official ports because \"they're in real danger,\" either in their countries of origin or in Mexico.\n\n\"We don't condone people entering between ports of entry, but Congress has made the decision that if they do, they still need to be allowed to apply for asylum,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. military has deployed 5,800 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. Another 2,100 National Guard troops have also been deployed since April as part of a separate mission.\n\nThey are not allowed to detain illegal crossers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press journalists Julie Watson in Tijuana, Mexico, and Jill Colvin and Colleen Long in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "4 rebels, 1 army commando killed in Kashmir, sparking clash", "description": "Officials say four rebels and an Indian army commando have been killed fighting in disputed Kashmir, triggering anti-India protests and clashes in the restive region", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/rebels-army-commando-killed-kashmir-sparking-clash-59309542", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T06:35:24Z", "content": "Officials say four rebels and an Indian army commando have been killed fighting in disputed Kashmir, triggering anti-India protests and clashes in the restive region.

Yet, like other desperate young men in Gaza who feel they have nothing left to lose, he has kept returning to the protests.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been on the front line of confrontations between Palestinians and Israel for generations. But the territory has been brought to its knees over the last decade by three punishing wars with Israel and an air, sea and land blockade.\n\nThe 11-year blockade, imposed by Israel and Egypt, is aimed at weakening Hamas, the militant group that seized power in Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. But its impact is felt by all. Raw sewage flows directly onto once-scenic Mediterranean beaches, tap water is undrinkable, and electricity is available just a few hours a day. Over half the Gaza Strip's 2 million people are unemployed, and most residents cannot leave.\n\nWhile most Gazans see the protests as the inevitable reaction to Israel's siege, Israel views them as coordinated attacks and says it must defend itself.\n\n\"We don't see them as protests,\" said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. \"We are confronting attacks, violent attacks along our security fence.\"\n\nSince they began on March 30, Israeli troops have killed more than 170 people and shot nearly 6,000 others. Thousands more have been wounded by tear gas or rubber-coated bullets. On the Israeli side, one soldier was killed by a sniper and six others wounded.\n\nEvery Friday, there are more.\n\nWhen Fayoumi arrived at one of five protest sites along the border just after 2:30 p.m., the area was largely empty. A few days earlier, he swore he would keep participating despite his wounds. But why?\n\n\"Because I want to die,\" he said.\n\nYes, he hopes the blockade gets lifted so he can leave Gaza to get a new, prosthetic leg. But if that doesn't happen, \"what's the point of living?\"\n\nBy 5 p.m., at least 13,000 people are gathered along the border, throwing rocks and burning tires. Ambulance sirens begin to howl soon after, signaling the start of the day's violence. At a medical triage tent about a kilometer (half a mile) from the frontier, they bring the wounded: a 22-year-old shot in the left leg, an 18-year-old struck by shrapnel, a 31-year-old shot in the chest.\n\n\"Every Friday we wait for the injuries, and every Friday it's always the same,\" says one of the staff, Dr. Khalil Siam. \"They always come.\"\n\nA few dozen meters (yards) away, five men in checkered, black and white headscarves are performing a traditional folk dance with their arms crossed for a captivated crowd under a massive tent. Behind them, in the distance, the border fence looks like a war zone; the sky is completely black, burning tires are shooting flames into the air, and gunfire is ringing out every few minutes.\n\nAt the border, all hell is breaking loose. Protesters are swarming the 12-foot-high fence. One man is hanging from the top, shaking it back and forth. The noise is constant, like a waterfall. Men are blowing whistles. Others are screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nMost are throwing rocks over the fence, thrusting their fists in the air, taking selfies, waving Palestinian flags. Every time a gunshot rings out, they duck like a school of fish darting in unison. Sometimes a man falls, and within seconds he is surrounded by medics in orange uniforms, who bandage him on the spot and rush him on a stretcher to the ambulances waiting in the rear.\n\nAfter the sun sets, the crowds dissipate rapidly as two black drones circle overhead. A pair of nearby explosions sends shards of concrete and debris hurling into the air. The Israeli army will say that aircraft and a tank struck two Hamas watchtowers after a soldier was wounded by a pipe bomb.\n\nThe last casualty arrives at the medical tent at 7:24 p.m. Siam says his team treated 25 people, mostly for gunshot wounds. Half were shot in the leg.\n\nAlmost every Friday protest is followed by at least one funeral on Saturday. This week, there are three, including one for an 11-year-old boy.\n\nOn Sunday, Fayoumi is sitting on the small bed in his small room, showing off pictures of himself at Friday's protest.\n\nHe is proud that he went. Proud that he stood up for the Palestinian cause. But when asked if having a job would have changed anything, his answer is clear: \"I would never have gone.\"\n\nAfter his injury, Fayoumi received a payment of $200 from Hamas. It was spent long ago, he says, on medical bills.\n\nNow he has nothing. No work. No hope. And little else to lose.\n\nNext Friday, he says, he will return to the protests again.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Police storm Papua New Guinea Parliament for APEC summit pay", "description": "A lawmaker says disgruntled police and prison guards stormed Papua New Guinea's Parliament in a pay dispute that stemmed from the APEC summit attended by Pence, Abe, Xi", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/police-storm-papua-guinea-parliament-apec-summit-pay-59309026", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_b2800c463f1e42949f5bb838f54da096_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T06:29:35Z", "content": "Disgruntled police and prison guards stormed Papua New Guinea's Parliament on Tuesday in a pay dispute that stemmed from an international summit hosted by the South Pacific island nation over the weekend, a lawmaker said.

Over the next few hours, Fayoumi knows the crowds will swell into the thousands. They'll burn so many tires, the sky will turn black. They'll attack the fence with stones and firebombs, Israeli gunfire will ring out, and Palestinian ambulance sirens will wail non-stop.\n\nBy the time it is over, at least 80 Palestinians will be wounded and three will be dead.\n\nAt sunset, Fayoumi and the others will abruptly turn around and walk home, while the Israelis will emerge from their positions and march the other way.\n\nIn a week, like clockwork, they will be back, poised for the deadly ritual to start all over again.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been the front line of confrontations between Palestinians and Israel for generations.

But its impact is felt by all. Raw sewage flows directly onto once-scenic Mediterranean beaches, tap water is undrinkable, and electricity is available just a few hours a day. Over half the Gaza Strip's 2 million people are unemployed, and most residents cannot leave what has become, in essence, a mass prison, even for medical reasons.\n\nThe blockade and growing anger over the harsh living conditions have put enormous pressure on Hamas, which is trying to redirect it toward Israel with relentless protests, said Mkhaimar Abusada, an associate professor of political science at Gaza's al-Azhar University.\n\n\"But it's a very slippery slope,\" Abusada said. \"Because they're not going to stop until the siege is lifted \u2014 or there is another war.\"\n\nThat almost happened this month, when an Israeli raid into Gaza left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli military officer dead. The raid prompted Hamas and other armed groups to fire hundreds of rockets and mortar shells into Israel, triggering a devastating wave of Israeli airstrikes in return \u2014 the heaviest fighting here since a 2014 war.\n\nBoth parties pulled back from the brink with a truce, and Hamas kept last Friday's protests restrained \u2014 though not enough to keep 40 Palestinians from being wounded.\n\nWhile most Gazans see the protests as the inevitable reaction to Israel's siege, Israel has a different view altogether.\n\n\"We don't see them as protests ... we're not seeing somebody exercising their democratic right to gather and voice their opinion,\" said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. \"We are confronting attacks, violent attacks along our security fence from an entity, Gaza, that is controlled by a terrorist organization, Hamas.\"\n\nSince they began March 30, Israeli troops \u2014 using live ammunition against Palestinians mostly armed with rocks \u2014 have killed more than 170 people and shot nearly 6,000 others, among them scores of children. Thousands more have been wounded during the protests by tear gas or rubber-coated bullets. On the Israeli side, one soldier has been killed by a sniper and six others wounded.\n\nEvery Friday, there are more.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIt is 2:30 p.m. in Malaka, one of five protest sites along the border, and several boys are practicing for a fight.\n\nThey are flinging large rocks onto a barren field with homemade slingshots. One of them, 17-year-old Ahmed al-Burdaini, shows off a bucket filled with fragments of steel rebar he says he spent the week collecting from the rubble of homes destroyed in past Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"We want to use it against them,\" he says proudly.\n\nAnother boy points across the frontier and writes in a reporter's notebook: \"This Is Our Land.\" It is a reference to another demand of the protests, that Palestinians be allowed to return to lands lost during the 1948 war that created the Jewish state \u2014 a demand Israel rejects outright.\n\nThe perimeter fence itself is a few hundred meters (yards) away. Israeli soldiers on the other side peer out from bunkers built atop pyramid-shaped berms along the fence.\n\nThe protest site is still largely empty, but people are trickling in. Among them is the amputee, Fayoumi, who says he was throwing rocks near the fence and was shot as he rushed to help a wounded friend. A few days earlier, speaking at a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, he swore he would keep participating in the protests despite his wounds. But why risk it?\n\n\"Because I want to die,\" he said.\n\nHe would prefer for the blockade to be lifted so he could leave Gaza to get a new, prosthetic leg. But if that doesn't happen, \"what's the point of living?\"\n\nThe sun is bearing down intensely when a couple dozen Palestinians roll a few tires toward the fence and set them on fire. The first gunshots ring out at 3:14 p.m., in the standard Israeli response to the start of the protests. An armored Israeli jeep at the edge of the fence fires a volley of tear gas canisters that leave white arcs trailing across the sky as they fall. The protesters are unfazed.\n\nAmong the growing crowds is an incongruous sight: five street vendors pushing dilapidated food carts hawking seeds, nuts, and frozen slushies. One is affixed with a cheap wooden speaker blaring traditional Bedouin music. It gives the protest the atmosphere of a country fair.\n\nVendor Adam Badwan, 17, has a simple explanation for coming: \"Business is good here, much better than in town.\"\n\nPlainclothes Hamas security agents appear. A local television crew arrives with flak jackets and helmets. A single ambulance pulls up.\n\nAfter Friday noon prayers, around 4 p.m., Hamas dispatches huge buses to many mosques to bring supporters to the border. But many more come on their own \u2014 on foot, in cars, motorcycles, bikes and wheelchairs. Within one hour, at least 13,000 people are gathered along the border.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDr. Khalil Siam is standing inside a medical triage tent about a kilometer (half a mile) from the border when the ambulance sirens begin to howl just after 5 p.m.\n\nThe first one to arrive drops off a 22-year-old man who was shot in the left leg. The second brings an 18-year-old, blood streaming from his bandaged face, who was struck by shrapnel.\n\nWhen the third comes shortly after, bearing a 31-year-old shot in the chest, there is shouting and panic \u2014 and no doubt the most dangerous phase of the protests has begun. The bullet has punctured the man's lung, and he is lowered gently onto a gurney as eight doctors and nurses gather round.\n\nOne of the doctors inserts a clear tube into the man's chest, and within seconds, blood and liquid is draining into a blue plastic bowl on the floor.\n\n\"Keep breathing! Keep breathing!\"\n\n\"Every Friday we wait for the injuries, and every Friday it's always the same,\" says Siam. \"They always come.\"\n\nOutside, a convoy of vehicles passes. Young men are standing on them, thrusting fists in the air, their faces hidden with scarves and white Guy Fawkes masks. It is the \"Burning Tire Unit\" \u2014 and soon it will fill a vast section of the frontier with a wall of fire and billowing sheets of smoke.\n\nA few dozen meters (yards) away, five men in checkered, black and white headscarves are performing a traditional folk dance with their arms crossed for a captivated crowd under a massive tent. Behind them, in the distance, the border fence looks like a war zone; the sky is completely black, burning tires are shooting flames into the air, and gunfire is ringing out every few minutes.\n\nBut nobody is looking toward the border, and few notice the steady stream of ambulances that are crisscrossing the adjacent road, non-stop. Here, vendors are selling corn on the cob and peanuts, and fathers are balancing children on their shoulders.\n\nIn the sky behind the stage, four kites flutter in the wind, several with flaming, incendiary trails; such kites have burned thousands of acres of Israeli farmland and set vehicles alight.\n\nColorful balloons also float overhead; Israel says they have found them on the other side of the fence, tied to small, homemade bombs.\n\nIt is 5:45 p.m. now, and the air is growing cooler. The dancers are soon replaced by a poet, then a play featuring two actors dressed as Israeli guards who shove a Palestinian prisoner to the ground. At one point, the prisoner tells the guard: \"Resistance is not terrorism.\"\n\nThe crowd applauds.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBy 6 p.m., at the border, all hell is breaking loose.\n\nHundreds of hard-core protesters are swarming the 12-foot-high fence. The wall of smoke has allowed some, armed with wire cutters, to clip through the rolls of barbed wire. One man is hanging from the top of the fence, shaking it back and forth with the weight of his body. Another is hanging from the other side, and yet another is trying to melt the fence with a flaming tire.\n\nThe noise here is constant, like a waterfall. Men are blowing whistles. Others are screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\n\"Allahu akbar!\" \u2014 God is greatest!\n\nMost are throwing rocks over the fence, thrusting their fists in the air, taking selfies, making the V sign for Victory. There are women too, wearing black and waving Palestinian flags. There is a man with a speaker on his back, playing Palestinian music to encourage them. Some boys pick up smoking tear gas canisters and smack them back over the fence with tennis rackets.\n\nEvery time a gunshot rings out, the crowds duck, like a school of fish darting in unison. Sometimes a man falls, and within seconds he is surrounded by medics in orange uniforms, who bandage him on the spot and rush him on a stretcher to the ambulances waiting in the rear.\n\nFurther back stands a vast sea of spectators. One, an older man named Khalil Ayesh, is sitting inside a light blue Subaru with his family, as if he has come to a drive-in movie. He was in the same spot last week, watching intently as an Israeli drone crisscrossed the sky like a black spider, dropping tear gas on the crowds from above.\n\n\"I bring them every week,\" Ayesh said of the three children in the back seat \u2014 his son and daughter, and his daughter's neighbor, \"so they can understand what this struggle is about.\"\n\nAfter the sun sets, the crowds dissipate rapidly as two black drones circle overhead. At 6:52 p.m., a huge blast a kilometer from the frontier sends shards of concrete and debris hurling into the air. Eight minutes later, it happens again. Later, in a statement, the Israeli army will say that aircraft and a tank struck two Hamas watchtowers after one of their soldiers was wounded by a pipe bomb.\n\nIt is time to go.\n\nAt the medical tent, it is now pitch dark, and the last casualty arrives at 7:24 p.m. It is a man, bleeding from the head, who has been hit by a tear gas canister.\n\nSiam says his team treated 25 people on this Friday, mostly for gunshot wounds. Half were shot in the leg, the others in the chest, stomach, back, pelvis. One doctor had to take leave when his nephew arrived, shot in the head.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlmost every Friday protest in Gaza is followed by at least one funeral on Saturday. This week, there are three.\n\nOne, for an 11-year-old boy named Shady Abdel-al, is remarkable because it is quiet. Funeral processions here typically are accompanied by young men doing something they usually avoid at the border: firing Kalashnikov rifles into the sky.\n\nThough the Health Ministry initially reported Abdel-al was shot by Israeli fire, the Israeli army claimed he was accidentally struck by a rock thrown by protesters. Two Gaza rights groups say he died after being hit \"with a solid object.\"\n\nDuring his funeral, Gaza's political complexity is laid bare. His body has been wrapped in a yellow flag with a grenade and automatic rifle on it; it belongs to Fatah, the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and a bitter rival to Hamas.\n\nAbdel-al's mother, Isma, says she told the boy not to go, but he boarded a bus to the border organized by Hamas, whose supporters were teaching him the Quran.\n\nAs the boy's body is carried through the neighborhood, it is surrounded by a sea of yellow flags. But when it reaches the mosque, there is another huge group of teenagers waiting with the green flag of Hamas. Hassan Walli, a Fatah official, is with the family as the distraught father stands over his son, kissing him on the forehead.\n\n\"We will never break the siege this way,\" Walli says, shaking his head. \"The only way we can do it is with Palestinian unity.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIt is Sunday in Gaza, and Atalla Fayoumi is sitting on the small bed in his small room, showing off pictures of himself at Friday's protest.\n\nHe is proud that he went. Proud that he stood up for the Palestinian cause. But when asked if having a job would have changed anything, his answer is clear: \"I would never have gone.\"\n\nAfter his injury, Fayoumi received a payment of US$200 from Hamas. It was spent long ago, he says, on medical bills.\n\nNow he has nothing. No work. No hope. And little else to lose.\n\nNext Friday, he says, he will return to the protests again.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Asian stocks slide after Wall Street losses, Nissan arrest", "description": "Asian stocks slide after tech losses dragged down Wall Street and Nissan's chairman was arrested on charges of financial misconduct", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-stocks-slide-wall-street-losses-nissan-arrest-59308655", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_adbed39cdbe74fe89f9f7bdeb0139993_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:47:46Z", "content": "Asian stocks slid Tuesday after tech losses dragged down Wall Street and Nissan's chairman was arrested on charges of financial misconduct.

While saying no doubts are expressed in the report, the official acknowledged that the words \"probably\" and \"likely\" are used when attributing the death to the crown prince. The source noted that CIA analysis reports rarely include explicit conclusions.\n\nAmong the evidence cited in the report, the official said, is the relationship between members of the kill team and the crown prince, and the hierarchy of the Saudi system. The official said the report is based on communication intercepts -- including prior phone calls between the kill team and aides for the crown prince -- and on the ground reporting and analysis.

Meanwhile, only 4 of 31 wild birds in a forest in the western town of Maricao survived, along with 75 out of 134 wild parrots living in the Rio Abajo forest in the central mountains of Puerto Rico, scientists said.\n\nAnd while several dozen new parrots have been born in captivity and in the wild since Maria, the species is still in danger, according to scientists.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Gustavo Olivieri, parrot recovery program coordinator for Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources.\n\nFederal and local scientists will meet next month to debate how best to revive a species that numbered more than 1 million in the 1800s but dwindled to 13 birds during the 1970s after decades of forest clearing.\n\nThe U.S. and Puerto Rican governments launched a program in 1972 that eventually led to the creation of three breeding centers. Just weeks before Maria hit, scientists reported 56 wild birds at El Yunque, the highest since the program was launched.\n\nBut the population decline is now especially worrisome because the parrots that vanished from El Yunque were some of the last remaining wild ones, said Marisel Lopez, who oversees the parrot recovery program at El Yunque for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\n\"It was devastating. After so many years of having worked on this project...,\" she stopped talking and sighed.\n\nThe Puerto Rican Amazon is Puerto Rico's only remaining native parrot and is one of roughly 30 species of Amazon parrots found in the Americas. The red-foreheaded birds grow to nearly a foot in length, are known for their secrecy and usually mate for life, reproducing once a year.\n\nMore than 460 birds remain captive at the breeding centers in El Yunque and Rio Abajo forests, but scientists have not released any of them since Hurricane Maria. A third breeding center in a forest in the western rural town of Maricao has not operated since the storm. Scientists are now trying to determine the best way to prepare the parrots for release since there are such few birds in the wild they can interact with, and whether Puerto Rico's damaged forests can sustain them.\n\nOne proposal scientists will consider is whether to capture some of the remaining wild parrots in the Rio Abajo forest and place them in the same cage as birds that will be released to the wild, so they can learn to emulate their social behavior to ensure their survival, said Jafet Velez, a wildlife biologist with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\nScientists are tentatively planning to release 20 birds next year in Rio Abajo.\n\nAnother proposal is to release more parrots in Maricao, which was not as heavily damaged by Maria.\n\n\"Our priority now is not reproduction...it's to start releasing them,\" Lopez said, adding that breeding centers can hold only so many parrots.\n\nBut first, scientists need to make sure the forests can offer food and safe shelter.\n\nJessica Ilse, a forest biologist at el Yunque for the U.S. Forest Service, said scientists are collecting data about the amount of fruit falling from trees and the number of leaves shed. She said the canopy still has not grown back since Maria and warned that invasive species have taken root since more sunlight now shines through. Ilse said that many of the large trees where parrots used to nest are now gone and noted that it took 14 months for El Yunque's canopy to close after Hurricane Hugo hit Puerto Rico in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.\n\nScientists also are now collecting new data on the number of predators at El Yunque, including el guaraguao, a red-tailed hawk that hunts Puerto Rico parrots. Without a canopy and proper camouflage, wild parrots have become an easy target.\n\nIlse said local and federal scientists plan to help the forest recover through planting. By the end of November, they expect to have a map detailing the most damaged areas in El Yunque and a list of tree species they can plant that are more resistant to hurricanes.\n\n\"People keep asking us, 'How long is it going to take?'\" Ilse said.\n\nBut scientists don't know, she added.\n\n\"The damage is more extensive than (hurricanes) Hugo and Georges...It's been a complete change to the ecosystem.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "'Dancing With the Stars' finale recap: Bobby Bones takes 1st - ABC News", "description": "ABC News 'Dancing With the Stars' finale recap: Bobby Bones takes 1st ABC News Bobby Bones, the radio host and comedian who remained, in his own words, \"clueless\" about dancing throughout the entire competition, was named \"Dancing With the Stars\" season 27 ch\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/dancing-stars-finale-recap-bobby-bones-takes-1st/story?id%3D59307790", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:15:37Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Snoop Dogg gets star on Hollywood Walk of Fame", "description": "Rapper Snoop Dogg was joined by Dr. Dre, Quincy Jones and Jimmy Kimmel as he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/video/snoop-dogg-star-hollywood-walk-fame-59307929", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/181119_vod_social_snoop_dogg_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:15:23Z", "content": "Now Playing: Snoop Dogg weighs in on Kanye West's controversial comments Now Playing: Snoop Dogg gets star on Hollywood Walk of Fame Now Playing: 'GMA' Hot List: Mariah Carey asks Michael Strahan to join her on tour Now Playing: Garth Brooks gets emotional wh\u2026 [+1228 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Snoop Dogg gets star on Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nOkay.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Ghosn's arrest casts doubt on Renault-Nissan alliance future", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

He also defended the sharply anti-American foreign policy of the socialist governments of late President Hugo Chavez and current President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"His experience and honesty were a school for all of us,\" Maduro said on , calling Rodriguez, \"a tireless fighter\" who was \"indispensable to the revolution.\"\n\nBorn in 1937 in Venezuela's central state of Lara, Rodriguez joined guerrilla fighters as a young man inspired by the Fidel Castro-led revolution in Cuba. He earned a reputation as an expert in explosives and was given the nickname of 'Comandante Fausto.'\n\nThe revolutionary fervor in Venezuela, however, never captured mass appeal, and in the 1970s most rebel groups surrendered.\n\nAfter former Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera forged a peace pact with the rebels, Rodriguez and others were granted amnesty for crimes that included kidnappings, bomb attacks and bank robberies.\n\nIn the 1980s, Rodriguez joined the Causa R party. He eventually became a central figure in Fatherland for All \u2014 another political party that supported then-presidential candidate Chavez.\n\nLater elected to Venezuela's congress, Rodriguez made a reputation for himself as a negotiator and consensus seeker, although he was always a staunch opponent of opening up the oil sector to private investment in the 1990s.\n\nRodriguez, a lawyer who did postgraduate studies in economics, was an influence to Chavez and was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines at the beginning of Chavez's first term in 1999.

To break the strike, 18,000 employees were fired under Rodriguez's management \u2014 nearly half of the oil firm's payroll.\n\nIn the years that followed, PDVSA recuperated and became the world's fifth largest oil producer, producing more than 3 million barrels per day. But financial losses after the strike were steep, and the company never recovered its engineering talent. Production is now at its lowest point in decades.\n\nRodriguez served as president of PDVSA until November 2004, when Chavez made him foreign ambassador to Cuba.\n\nHe used the position to defend Venezuela's anti-American foreign policy amid two decades of socialist rule."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "WATCH: World News 11/19/18: Deadly Shooting At Hospital In Chicago", "description": "World News Tonight with David Muir full episode recap: Passengers share terrifying tales of plunging 84 stories in elevator; Trio accused of scamming GoFundMe donors out of nearly $400k", "url": "https://abc.go.com/shows/world-news-tonight/episode-guide/2018-11/19-111918-deadly-shooing-hospital-chicago", "urlToImage": "https://cdn1.edgedatg.com/aws/v2/abcnews/WorldNews/video/9231/4195dfbdc03adeb0a4fb0725c4686287/579x325-Q100_4195dfbdc03adeb0a4fb0725c4686287.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T03:59:03Z", "content": "Sign Out Are you sure you want to sign out?

The administration of Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, had brought the territorial disputes with China to international arbitration and won, but China has ignored the outcome.\n\nDuterte has refused to immediately demand Chinese compliance with the ruling, which invalidated China's sweeping claims to the waters, where Beijing has transformed a string of disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases.\n\nDuterte's rapprochement has fostered a new era of warmer relations with the Asian economic powerhouse, from which he has sought trade and investment, infrastructure financing and weapons to fight insurgents. While Western governments have sharply criticized Duterte's brutal crackdown on illegal drugs, China has not. Both Xi and Duterte have often been in the crosshairs of human rights groups.\n\nXi said he and Duterte \"agreed to elevate our relationship into one of comprehensive, strategic cooperation,\" adding, \"it sends a strong message to the world that our two countries are partners in seeking common development.\"\n\nXi's visit to the Philippines is the first by a Chinese president in 13 years.\n\nMore than 300 protesters with placards reading \"Hands off our land and seas\" rallied in front of the Chinese Consulate in Manila. Another group of protesters later burned mock Chinese flags near the presidential palace, where Xi and Duterte met.\n\nDuterte said Philippine participation in Beijing's \"Belt and Road Initiative\" was discussed and Xi invited the Philippine leader to attend the infrastructure loan program's second international forum in China next year.\n\nThe ambitious program has been criticized by the United States as enticing poor nations into debt bondage and has warned it could compromise their independence. Xi has denied that Chinese loans could lead to a \"debt trap.\"\n\nAside from their trade disputes, China and the United States have wrestled over Beijing's assertive claims to the South China Sea. Chinese officials have asked Washington to back off from what they say is a purely Asian dispute, but the U.S. has vowed to maintain a presence in the waters, where it has no claims but has pledged to promote freedom of navigation and overflight.\n\n\"We will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows and our national interests demand; harassment will only strengthen our resolve.

She did not immediately report the attack but stopped seeing and communicating with the man, the lawsuit said.\n\nOn May 10, 2016, Pirtle showed up to McKissack Middle School, where Blake was assigned as a school resource officer, to talk to her about what happened, the civil complaint stated. Blake \"surreptitiously\" recorded the conversation, which included Pirtle allegedly admitting to choking her, as well as him referring to himself as \"a killer\" and \"The Hulk,\" according to the court document. Blake then reported the attack to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, but did not disclose that she was raped until May 23, 2016.\n\nGoogle\n\nThe next day, Pirtle was charged with aggravated domestic assault and decommissioned, a press release by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville showed. A temporary order of protection was also issued against Pirtle that day, and he was later charged with rape, online criminal court records showed.\n\nPirtle is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nTrouble for Blake began after she reported the attack, she told ABC News. The lawsuit names the Metropolitan Government of Nashville-Davidson County and Cmdr. Janet Marlene Pardue in her role as Blake's supervisor, as defendents.\n\nFirst, Blake's shift was changed from the morning to evening shift, and when Blake submitted a hardship request asking to be assigned to a different detail \"due to the trauma she had experienced\" as well as due to her childcare responsibilities, Pardue moved her shift back to mornings but required to her to work a weekend day as well, the lawsuit stated.\n\nGoogle\n\nIn addition, when Blake asked to move her start time to an hour later so she could take her kids to school, Pardue agreed, but said she would have to use her vacation time for that hour, Blake said, adding that she used up several vacation days as a result.\n\nIt was then that Blake had an inkling she was being retaliated against, because she was aware that similar requests made to Pardue had been granted without issue, Blake said. The retaliation became \"continuous\" after that point, she said.\n\nOn June 8, 2016, Pirtle violated the order of protection by texting Blake, and Blake reported the violation to the department, documents stated. That same day, Davidson County\u2019s Jean Crowe Advocacy Center sent an \"Outstanding Officer\" commendation on behalf of Blake to Pardue in recognition of \"Blake's excellent work on a particular domestic violence case,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nPardue then decommissioned Blake on June 15, 2016, the court document stated. Blake's police powers were stripped, and she was required to turn in her badge, gun and radio, she said. She returned to work later that summer after completing a psyche evaluation, she added.\n\nThen, in October 2017, Pardue initiated two disciplinary investigations into Blake for her handling of situations at McKissack Middle School, one of which she had already been exonerated for, and the other, a \"truthfulness allegation\" against Blake's claim that she'd taken her utility belt off before entering her car, had been proven false by surveillance video from the middle school, according to the civil complaint.\n\nBlake, who has been working with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department since 2005, had \"received only a handful of minor disciplinary infractions\" from the police department up until 2014, and between 2010 and 2013, her performance reviews averaged a 3 on a 4-point scale, with \"3\" ranking as \"Commendable,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nOn Oct. 17, 2017, Pardue informed Blake that she would be \"indefinitely restricted from any secondary employment privileges,\" without giving a reason or providing a process to contest it, according to the civil complaint.\n\nPardue also indicated to Pirtle's defense attorney in December 2017 that she would be \"willing to testify on behalf of Pirtle by alleging that Officer Blake is a dishonest person,\" according to the complaint.\n\nMetro Nashville Police Department\n\nIn January of this year, Pirtle pleaded guilty to aggravated assault, but the rape charge against him was dropped, criminal records showed. He was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to stay away from Blake.\n\nThe plea bargain prosecutors offered Pirtle kept his name off the sex offender registry and will allow him to expunge his record if he completes three years of probation successfully, according to Blake's lawsuit.\n\nAfter Pirtle was convicted, Blake then became concerned that Pardue would \"use any excuse to provoke a conflict, make false allegations against her, or even physically harm her,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nBlake was temporary assigned to the North Precinct after expressing her concerns to human resources. On Jan. 29, when she and her attorney showed up to the West Precinct for a settlement hearing on the two disciplinary investigations from October, she appeared unarmed and out of uniform \"in order to minimize the chances of escalating the conflict with Pardue,\" the complaint stated. A lieutenant who asked Blake why she was out of uniform then advised her to write a supplement to human resources detailing her concerns.\n\nWhen Blake also appeared in civilian clothes for a Feb. 12 meeting, Pardue questioned why she was out of uniform and unarmed, according to the complaint.\n\nBlake responded, \"I have explained in detail why I\u2019m not comfortable being armed at this point around you particularly,\" which another lieutenant who was present constituted as a \"threat\" to Pardue, the complaint stated.\n\nThat lieutenant advised Pardue to \"review the recording\" of her interaction with Blake, and after doing so, Pardue referred the \"threat\" to MNPD Deputy Chief Brian Johnson, according to the lawsuit.\n\nLater that day, Johnson reviewed the recording and \"immediately decommissioned\" Blake, the lawsuit said. Pardue filed an incident report the next day, characterizing the alleged threat as \"assault by intimidation,\" the court document stated. Blake returned to work again on April 13 after undergoing another psyche evaluation, she said.\n\nAfter that, a barrage of complaints were filed against Blake.\n\nOne for a March 26 Facebook post she made stating that a community oversight board would help relations between the police and the public, and another for a 2012 video in which \"Blake had done a video testimonial for the website of a magician, which she did not have permission for from the police chief, violating MNPD policy,\" the lawsuit alleged.\n\nAnother complaint stated that Blake violated MNPD's \"secondary employment\" policy in 2013, about five years earlier, by hosting a \"Princess House\" party without the department's authorization, and another was filed for \"assault\" for the comment she made to Pardue on Feb. 12, according to the complaint.\n\nBlake has been given 41 suspensions since first reporting the attack in 2017, she said. If an officer receives 30 or more suspension days in a calendar year, he or she will be terminated, under MNPD policy, the lawsuit stated.\n\nBlake may have been retaliated against for not adhering to the \"blue code,\" a \"cultural ethos\" that \"asserts that police officers must identify as police officers first, must always take up for other officers, and must never report on other officers' misconduct,\" according to the civil complaint.\n\nCourtesy Officer Monica Blake\n\nBut, Pardue's discrimination toward Blake allegedly began long before she reported the attack, the lawsuit alleged. Pardue began \"making life difficult\" for Blake the moment she assumed command of the West Precinct in 2012, the complaint stated.\n\nThe lawsuit also accused Pardue of \"typically\" favoring male officers over female officers, giving one example of Pardue \"accommodating the work-related requests of male officers more frequently and easily than similar requests by female officers.\" The lawsuit also accused Pardue as being \"personally hostile to African-Americans who raise the issue of racism in America, especially if they raise it in the context of the criminal justice system.\"\n\nThe \"retaliation\" by Pardue has caused Blake \"to suffer emotional harm as well as lost income,\" the complaint alleged. Blake is still on patrol as a school resource officer, but now is assigned to a high school in the North Precinct, she said.\n\nBlake told ABC News she filed the lawsuit after exhausting \"every possible way to try and resolve the conflict.\"\n\n\"But, because of the culture of the police department, at every turn, either the complaints fell on deaf ears, or inadequate investigations would occur, or they would not include me in the investigation at all,\" she said.\n\nBlake said she also hoped the lawsuit would \"hold the people who have done wrong accountable for their actions,\" adding that she hoped to change the culture within the police department.\n\n\"We can't call ourselves the guardians of Nashville and not stand up in every situation,\" she said.\n\nThe lawsuit requested a jury trial, nominal damages, compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be determined by the jury, attorneys fees, court costs and a restraining order against the department \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department directed ABC News to the Metropolitan Nashville Department of Law, which will be defending the police department in the lawsuit.

The father who killed his pregnant wife and two young daughters was sentenced today. Chris watt had already pleaded guilty to killing his wife and daughters. You'll remember when they disappeared he made that emotional appeal for them to return home, and authorities say he had already killed them. In court today, prosecutors revealing grim new details of the crime, and both families spoke. The family of the pregnant woman and his own parents spoke, too. What they said about their own son. ABC's kayna Whitworth was in the courtroom in greeley, Colorado. Reporter: For the Colorado man who pled guilty to murdering his entire family, judgment day. Chris Watts first facing his agonized in-laws. This is the heartless one, the evil monster. I trusted you to take care of them, not kill them. And then, you take them out like trash. You disgust me. He was the one for me. And he is amazing. Reporter: Their daughter, shann Anne, who once gushed about her husband, brutally killed, along with their two granddaughters an unborn grandson. My daddy is a hero. Reporter: Watts' mother-in-law blasting him for the ultimate betrayal. Your children adored you and they also trusted you. Your daughter Bella Marie sang a song proudly, daddy, you're my hero. Reporter: As police searched for Watts' missing family, he went on TV, begging for their return. Shanann, Bella, celest, if you're out there, just come back. Reporter: Today, Watts' parents saying their son needs to atone for what he's done. I'd like to begin by recognizing the absolute horror of this crime. Reporter: Struggling to recognize this heinous crime with the love they have for their son. We have loved you from the beginning and we still love you now. Reporter: Watts wiping away tears. Prosecutors today revealing gut-wrenching details about how the Colorado father strangled his wife and smothered 3-year-old Celeste and 4-year-old Bella, who they say fought back. Imagine the horror in Bella's mind as he father took her last breaths away. Reporter: The girls then violently stuffed into oil storage tanks. Shaann buried in a shallow grave. Watts wanted a fresh start with a new woman. If he was this happy and wanted a new start, get a divorce. You don't annihilate your family and throw them away like garbage. Reporter: Prosecutors say while shanann was trying to save their marriage, wapts was testing his girlfriend, and the morning after the murder, he looked into selling his home and even unenrolled his daughters from school. Today, when asked if he wanted to speak -- No, sir. Reporter: His attorney saying only this -- He is devastated. He is sincerely sorry. Reporter: And with that, the judge handed down five life sentences without parol. This is perhaps the most inhumane and vicious crime that I have handled out of the thousands of cases that I have seen. And kayna Whitworth is live with us in Colorado. And kayna, the parents of the pregnant wife that was killed, they did not want the death penalty? Reporter: David, that's true. They don't believe in it. But it was a horrific day in court as they learned about their granddaughters' final moments. They now know that Bella was found in an oil-soaked pajama top, pink with hearts and butterflies on it. And Celeste wearing a pink and black top. It was so hard to hear, David. This is an impossible story all the way around.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cActing Attorney General Whitaker\u2019s designation neither alters the Special Counsel\u2019s authority to represent the United States nor raises any jurisdictional issue,\u201d Mueller\u2019s team wrote in a brief filed Monday. \u201cThe Special Counsel continues to exercise the same authority, and the jurisdiction of the district court and this Court is intact.\u201d\n\nThe filing came as part of an ongoing legal battle between Mueller\u2019s team and Andrew Miller, a former associate of political provocateur Roger Stone. Miller has refused to comply with a subpoena demanding his testimony before a federal grand jury, and a lower-level court judge found him in contempt of court. Miller and his lawyers are now urging the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., to reject the contempt finding, insisting Mueller\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump appointed Whitaker to take control of the Justice Department \u2013 and the Mueller probe -- the federal appeals court asked both sides to weigh in on whether the appointment alters the case.\n\nOver the past year, Whitaker has repeatedly criticized Mueller\u2019s investigation, at one point even suggesting how a new attorney general could choke off funding to Mueller\u2019s office. A Justice Department spokeswoman recently said Whitaker \u201cis fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures at the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nMiller\u2019s team argued to the court the designation of Whitaker as Acting Attorney General \u201chas no effect on this case.\u201d\n\nIn their own brief filed Monday, Miller\u2019s attorneys agreed with Mueller that Whitaker\u2019s new role had no impact on the arguments in the case.\n\n\u201cThe short answer is that the designation of Matthew G. Whitaker as Acting Attorney General by the President following the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not affect Appellant\u2019s argument that Special Counsel Mueller was required to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate under the Appointments Clause as a principal officer,\u201d Miller\u2019s lawyer, Paul Kamenar, wrote.\n\nKamenar added that the designation had no effect on Miller\u2019s alternative argument that Mueller was required to be appointed as an inferior officer under the Excepting Clause by the then \u201cHead of the Department\u201d -- in this case, Sessions -- and not by Rosenstein.\n\nMiller\u2019s appeal is steered by the National Legal and Policy Center, a well-funded conservative legal group with a deep history of mounting legal challenges against left-leaning organizations and Democratic politicians.\n\nKamenar\u2019s challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe is based on a claim that Mueller\u2019s appointment was not handled properly. He argues Mueller has been effectively operating as a \u201cU.S. Attorney at large,\u201d and as such, should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate \u2013 neither of which occurred.\n\nEarlier this month, a panel of three D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judges presiding over the case heard opening arguments in the matter just 24 hours after President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe latest court filings come in response to a request from the federal judges for additional briefs to address President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker to replace Sessions, and what impact the change had on either party\u2019s arguments. Miller, 34, has told ABC News he paints houses for a living now but served as an aide to Stone until 2013.\n\nStone, who was a longtime informal political adviser to Trump, once described Miller as his \u201cwingman\u201d because he helped manage Stone\u2019s schedule, travel and media appearances, and also provided \u201csome I.T. work.\u201d Miller identifies himself as a libertarian and has said he did not support Trump\u2019s candidacy, but he did accompany Stone to the 2016 Republican National Convention.\n\nMore than a dozen individuals associated with Stone have met with the special counsel since last summer and many of those have appeared before the grand jury impaneled by Mueller\u2019s team. The witnesses have told ABC News they were asked about Stone\u2019s dealings during the 2016 election and what if any contact he may have had with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through an intermediary - an allegation Stone denies.\n\nIn response to the special counsel's brief, Kamenar told ABC News in a statement on Monday, \u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s brief simply argued that the appointment of Whitaker has no bearing on the way the Court should resolve our challenge to Mueller\u2019s authority. In that regard, we both agree. But if we\u2019re right and Mueller is unconstitutionally appointed as an inferior officer, Whitaker would need to appoint him anew to make Mueller legal for any future actions he might take.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: How to get the most bang for your buck on Black Friday", "description": "Deal aggregators like BlackFriday.com show consumers the best deals, where to find them and when the deals go live.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/bang-buck-black-friday-59302625", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/181119_wn_jarvis1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:28:53Z", "content": "Now Playing: Your Money: Best holiday shopping deals Now Playing: Black Friday shopping deals are heating up Now Playing: How to get the most bang for your buck on Black Friday Now Playing: Woman in GoFundMe scam says she's the victim Now Playing: Major retai\u2026 [+1177 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for How to get the most bang for your buck on Black Friday\n\nfor up to 12 hours with just one pill.

This could mean only one thing\u2014it\u2019s time to celebrate the most magical time of the year at the Disneyland Resort. The entire family will enjoy the festive decorations, amazing food and holiday cheer that can be found at Disneyland park and Disney California Adventure park. And if this is your little one\u2019s first trip to the Disneyland Resort during this most holiday season, they are in for a special experience!\n\nTo help little ones make the most of the merry magic that awaits them, members of the Disney Parks Moms Panel are here to share some of their favorite tips for enjoying the Disneyland Resort with your preschooler.\n\nFor Disney Parks Moms Panelist Linda, she loves nothing more than making magical memories with her family during the merriest of seasons. And one of her first tips? Taking a trip to see Santa Claus at the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail area in Disney California Adventure park.\n\n\u201cIf your preschooler has been good all year long, then definitely stop in to meet Santa so he/she can relay their holiday wish list to the jolly old man himself. He is available to meet guests until Christmas Eve, and then Santa Goofy will take over greeting guests through the end of the holidays on January 8.\u201d There is nothing like seeing the magic of your preschooler meeting Santa for the first time!\n\n\u201cAnother perfectly merry thing to do with your preschooler is watch \u201cA Christmas Fantasy\u201d parade as it marches down Main Street, U.S.A. in Disneyland park,\u201d she recommends. \u201cTo make the day even more special and to secure your viewing spot ahead of time, book a Plaza Inn Dining Package!\u201d The magic continues later on Main Street, U.S.A., as falling \u201csnow\u201d transforms the well-known street to a winter wonderland. For many little ones, this might be their very first glimpse at snow!\n\nFellow panelist Jennifer L., and mom of a preschooler, loves this magical season too and especially enjoys watching \u201cBelieve \u2026 in Holiday Magic\u201d fireworks spectacular with her little one. She also never misses a chance for her son to enjoy \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d Holiday.\n\n\u201cOne of the most iconic symbols of the season at the Disneyland Resort is the fa\u00e7ade of \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d Holiday with its thousands of dazzling lights. Little ones (and grown-ups!) will be amazed by this impressive light-up display,\u201d Jennifer exclaims. \u201cInside you can see the classic attraction completely transformed with familiar music and adorable presentations of the holidays celebrated throughout the world. Since this is one of the most popular holiday offerings, I recommend grabbing a Disney FASTPASS so you can spend more time enjoying the festivities throughout the parks rather than waiting in line.\u201d\n\nOur panelists also remind Guest to take time to enjoy the splendor of the holiday d\u00e9cor that can be found throughout the resort, including the twinkling lights of Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Winter Castle. And let\u2019s not forget the festive feasting that only takes place this time of year\u2026 even little ones love tasty treats! \u201cMany of the festive goodies this year are almost too cute to eat!\u201d explains Jennifer. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to try the adorable Santa Hat Macaron and Holiday Brownie topped with chocolate presents and a gingerbread Christmas tree at Jolly Holiday Bakery Cafe.\u201d\n\nFor more information about traveling to Disneyland Resort with your preschooler, or planning your next Disney vacation, visit DisneyParksMomsPanel.com for a personalized answer from one of our knowledgeable panelists."}]
