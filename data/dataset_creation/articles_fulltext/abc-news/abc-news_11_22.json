Add Interest\n\nNew York City reached a low of 19 degrees -- tying the city's second coldest Thanksgiving on record.\n\nIn Watertown, New York, temperatures reached a brutal minus 6 degrees.\n\nIf you're braving the outside for a post-meal football game, here is what you need to know:\n\nChris OMeara/AP\n\nHow to stay safe outside\n\nThose with prolonged exposure or those not dressed appropriately for the weather are in danger of frostbite and hypothermia, National Weather Service meteorologist Jay Engle told ABC News in January.\n\nFrostbite results in the loss of feeling and color in affected areas -- usually the nose, ears, cheeks, fingers, toes or chin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Frostbite could potentially cause permanent damage and, in severe cases, can lead to amputation, the CDC said.\n\nDon Emmert/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSomeone suffering from frostbite can be unaware of it because tissues that become frozen are numb, the CDC said. These are all signs of frostbite: numbness, white or grayish-yellow skin, or skin that feels unusually firm or waxy.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rub your hands -- if you have frost-nip or frostbite, rubbing actually causes tissue damage,\" Dr. Randall Wexler, professor of family medicine at Ohio State University, told ABC News in January.\n\nIf you think you are developing frostbite, \u201ckeep the area covered if you can ... because if you have frostbite on your hand and you pull off your glove, you may cause tissue damage,\" Wexler said.\n\nHe added, \"That\u2019s also when you want to start trying to raise your core body temperature -- get rid of wet clothes, put on clothes that are warm and dry.\"\n\nThere's also hypothermia -- or abnormally low body temperature -- which can impact the brain, \"making the victim unable to think clearly or move well,\" the CDC said. \"This makes hypothermia especially dangerous, because a person may not know that it\u2019s happening and won\u2019t be able to do anything about it.\"\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nWarning signs for adults are shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech and drowsiness. Warning signs for infants are bright red or cold skin and very low energy, the CDC said.\n\nEngle recommends to \u201cdress in three or more layers. One big thick winter coat tends not to do the trick. You have to have a thick sweater underneath and then a lighter jacket on top of that and then your winter coat.\"\n\n\"People really should keep their heads covered because that\u2019s where majority of heat gets lost,\" Engle added.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nWexler said moving can generate heat. But try to avoid sweating.\n\n\"If you are overheated and start to sweat, that lowers your body temperature and makes you more susceptible to cold injury,\" he said. \"You want to be able to adjust your layers, zip and unzip.\"\n\nWexler also recommended staying hydrated because \"dehydration can help promote cold injury.\u201d\n\nL. Todd Spencer/The Virginian-Pilot via AP\n\nThe young and elderly should be especially careful in the cold.\n\n\u201cTheir ability to maintain core body temperature is harder than mid-age and younger adults,\" he said. \"Kids, especially babies, lose a disproportionate amount of heat from their head -- that\u2019s why you want to have a hat on their head when you\u2019re out there. Older people are more at risk simply because it is more difficult to regulate our core body temperature as we get older.\"\n\nIt's also more difficult to maintain your core temperature if you are diabetic or taking decongestant antihistamines or certain blood pressure medications, Wexler said.\n\nBilgin S. Sasmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHow to keep your car safe\n\nWhen the temperature dips, getting behind the wheel can prove to be a challenge. Problems include dead car batteries, iced-over windshields, broken car locks and driving with no traction.\n\nAudra Fordin, founder of Woman Auto Know and the owner of Great Bear Auto Repair in Queens, New York, provided these tips:\n\n1. Before you hit the road, check under the hood.\n\n\"If it's really cold outside, you want to make sure that your battery is going to be good in the freezing cold weather,\" Fordin said. \"If you see any snow or blue stuff that's growing off your battery, that's an indication you want to go to the shop to have your battery checked.\"\n\nBilgin S. Sasmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n2. Iced out windshields? Turn to your wallet for help.\n\n\"If you get to your car and can't see, pull out a credit card, and you can just wipe that frost away,\" Fordin said.\n\n3. Fighting a stubborn car lock? Get sanitizing.\n\n\"If your lock is frozen put the sanitizer on the key, and then put the key into the lock,\" Fordin said.\n\n4. If your car can't gain traction, let your floor mat give an assist.\n\n\"Grab your floor mat, you're going to put it underneath the wheel,\" Fordin said. \"That will give you enough traction to pull your car out and hit the road.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Venezuela seeks to extradite former official indicted by US", "description": "Venezuela is seeking the extradition of a former national treasurer days after U.S. prosecutors say he pleaded guilty to accepting over $1 billion in bribes", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/venezuela-seeks-extradite-official-indicted-us-59366876", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:33:46Z", "content": "Venezuelan is seeking the extradition of a former national treasurer days after U.S. prosecutors say he pleaded guilty to accepting over $1 billion in bribes in a far-reaching corruption probe, officials announced Thursday.

A court in the southern city of Krasnodar sentenced Husky on charges of hooliganism.\n\nThe 25-year-old rapper, known for his songs mocking authorities and police brutality, was due to perform in Krasnodar when local prosecutors warned the venue that his act had elements of what they termed \"extremism.\"\n\nRussian authorities have in recent years used the vaguely worded law on extremism to go after Kremlin critics and dissenters.\n\nWednesday's gig was moved to another club, where the power was shut off and Husky's fans poured outside. Videos posted online showed the rapper, whose real name is Dmitry Kuznetsov, reading his verses on top of a car with the fans chanting in unison.\n\nPolice officers let him finish the song and then detained him, but had trouble driving away as crowds of fans blocked the police vehicle, demanding his release. Police eventually persuaded them to disperse.\n\nLocal police also said that the owner of the car on which Husky performed filed a complaint for property damage, a charge that may carry a longer prison term. It wasn't immediately clear if authorities were going to press those charges.\n\nThe rapper told the court that he was forced to perform on the street because his concert had been canceled without explanation. He said he was willing to pay compensation for any damage to the vehicle.\n\n\"I acted in such a way because I faced a situation when I felt an obligation to talk to the people who had bought tickets,\" he told the court.\n\nHusky's black-and-white videos mock a political regime that expects tacit compliance from its citizens.

But it has not shown the same tolerance so far toward the Central Americans, who have met official complaints and anti-caravan protests even though most of the people in this city are migrants or the offspring of migrants.\n\nThat's raising questions about how the newest group will integrate if it doesn't don't get into the U.S. or return home.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has made a point of saying the city is not happy with the caravan migrants who began arriving last week, and he compared the Central American group unfavorably with the roughly 3,000 Haitians who ended up staying after their bid to reach the U.S. failed.\n\n\"The Haitians arrived with their papers, with a clear vision,\" Gastelum said in an interview posted on the city's page. They came \"in an orderly way, they never asked us for food or shelter,\" renting apartments and making their own food. He said the Haitians found jobs and \"inserted themselves in the city's economy\" and had not been involved in any disturbances.\n\nBy contrast, Gastelum said, the caravan of Central Americans \"had arrived all of sudden, with a lot of people \u2014 not all ... but a lot \u2014 were aggressive and cocky.\"\n\nVictor Clark-Alfaro, a professor of Latin American studies at San Diego State University who lives in Tijuana, attributes the backlash to the way the caravan arrived \u2014 suddenly with thousands pouring in. Others point to social media and the hostile rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said it harbored criminals and gang members and was planning an \"invasion.\"\n\nMany also say the actions of a few are tarnishing the image of the roughly 4,000 migrants who are camped in Tijuana. In the past week, city officials have arrested three dozen caravan members for drug possession, public intoxication, disturbing the peace and resisting police, and said they would be deported to their home countries.\n\nIt's also only been months since an earlier caravan of Central Americans arrived, and some of them are still in the city waiting to get asylum in the U.S. That has added to fears here that it could be the start of a never-ending deluge.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego, and there was already a waiting list of 3,000 when the new migrants arrived, so most will have to wait months to even be considered for asylum.\n\nTijuana has a long history as a kind of Ellis Island for U.S.-bound migrants. It receives up to 80,000 a year from across Mexico, Latin America and more recently as far away as India and Africa. The city has large pockets of Chinese and Korean immigrants.\n\nCentral Americans have been coming to the city since the civil wars of the 80s in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.\n\nMany in the newly arrived caravan, however, are destitute people who left their homelands at the spur of the moment and have been utterly dependent on handouts along their journey.\n\nMany of the Haitians, meanwhile, arrived with at least some resources after working in Brazil, though despite what the mayor said, they also stayed at shelters after taking an accidental route to Tijuana from their impoverished Caribbean homeland. The last group of Haitians moved out of the Padre Chava shelter in April.\n\nBrazil and its neighbors took in the Haitians after that country's 2010 earthquake. As construction jobs for the 2016 Summer Olympics ended and Brazil's economy slumped, they crossed 10 countries by plane, boat, bus and on foot to San Diego, where U.S. authorities initially let them in on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThen President Barack Obama shifted course in 2016 and started deporting Haitian arrivals. Many decided to stay in Mexico after the government gave them temporary transit permits and have since applied for Mexican residency. The majority in the Central American caravan so far have refused Mexico's repeated offers of residency or asylum and vowed to cross the border.\n\nMany of the Haitians also have college degrees and have been recruited to work for factories that export to the U.S. Some can be found waiting tables and worshipping at congregations that have even added services in Creole.\n\nThey opened beauty parlors, shops and restaurants, like Kriskapab Baborijinal, a bright blue-and-red cafe that is busy serving Mexicans and Haitians daily dishes of coconut rice, mashed plantains and goat stew.\n\nIn the window is a sign for the Association of the Defense of Haitian Migrants. Philocles Julda, 44, is one of 11 Haitian immigrants who started the group a year ago to give the community a place to help itself with everything from Spanish lessons to paying medical bills.\n\nJulda said he too wanted to get to the U.S. when he first arrived to Tijuana and still wishes he was earning dollars, but said he has been able to make a life here. He works at a factory.\n\n\"I feel for the migrants who are arriving from other countries just like we did,\" he said. \"But you do adapt.\"\n\nAnd work is plentiful in Tijuana, whose economy has been growing and whose factories have thousands of openings.\n\n\"We have been looking for workers for quite a while,\" said Alejandrina Yanez, who works in human resources at a factory that makes warehouse storage racks for Costco, Home Depot and other international companies.\n\nYanez went to the Padre Chava shelter Wednesday to see if any migrants were interested in jobs that pay about $100 a week.\n\nOmin Velasquez, 26, of Tocoa, Honduras, was intrigued. Velasquez came with the caravan but decided not to continue on to the U.S. after seeing the border wall topped with newly-installed rows of razor wire.\n\nHe said it took him some days to decide, but he now feels that there are enough opportunities in Tijuana and support from locals that it's not worth the risk of crossing into the U.S. He has started his paperwork to get a Mexican visa to stay.\n\n\"There is so much work here,\" he said. \"I no longer feel the need to go to the U.S.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Timmy Truong", "title": "Celebrities pitch in to help Camp Fire evacuees and first responders", "description": "Celebs are pitching in to help their California neighbors.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/celebrities-donate-time-funds-camp-fire-evacuees-responders/story?id=59362105", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/arnold-schwartzenegger-california-wildfire-ap-jc-181122_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:08:14Z", "content": "Celebrities are showing support for residents and first responders affected by the Camp Fire in Northern California this Thanksgiving holiday.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nBetraying no trust in an independent judiciary, President Donald Trump is using a federal appeals court in San Francisco as a punching bag for his frustrations about not getting his way on border security. He's spreading misinformation in the process and appearing to misunderstand how appeals work.\n\nTrump drew an unusual rebuke from the Supreme Court's chief justice, John Roberts, earlier in the week after the president assailed the judge who rejected his migrant asylum policy as an \"Obama judge.\" Roberts rejected the insinuation that judges are beholden to the presidents who nominate them.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump was still venting on .\n\nTRUMP: \"Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster. It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, & is used to get an almost guaranteed result.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is wrong in suggesting that rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed by the Supreme Court more frequently than those of any other federal appeals court. And his description in an earlier tweet of the \"shocking\" number of overturned cases in the 9th Circuit belies the nature of the appeals system.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court hears a case, it is more likely to overturn it than not. It does so about two-thirds of the time.\n\nIn the last term, the Supreme Court overturned 100 percent of the decisions of the 1st Circuit in Boston, the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia and the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati. For the 9th Circuit, 86 percent were overturned.\n\nOver the past five years, the Supreme Court overturned a greater percentage of rulings from the 3rd Circuit (92.3 percent), the 6th Circuit (85.1 percent) and the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit (81.8 percent) than from the 9th (77.4 percent), according to The Associated Press' analysis of statistics from the legal website Scotusblog.\n\nThe 9th is by far the largest of the 13 federal courts of appeals, covering Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. That means that in raw numbers, more cases are heard and reversed from the 9th year in and year out. But that does not make it the most frequently overturned.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar, who'd been nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama, temporarily barred the Trump administration from refusing asylum to immigrants who cross the southern border illegally. Any appeal is likely to go to the 9th Circuit.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRUMP: \"It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \"independent judiciary,\" but if it is why ... are so are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking.\" \u2014 tweets Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: It's not unusual for those challenging a president's policies to sue in courts they consider likely to back their claims, and it's true that the 9th Circuit is a liberal-leaning court. Conservative groups tended to bring challenges to Obama-era policies in Texas, part of the conservative-leaning 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.\n\nBut \"judge shopping,\" as Trump put it when railing against court decisions on immigration last year, is not that straightforward.\n\nAt the time, Trump was upset about a federal district judge who blocked his order to penalize cities that don't cooperate with U.S. immigration officials. It was the third time in two months that a federal judge had knocked down a Trump order dealing with immigration.\n\nBut the two local governments that sued to block Trump's order, San Francisco and Santa Clara County, are in California and therefore routinely file in the court in their neighborhood. And they don't get to choose a judge; that's assigned through a system that resembles a lottery.\n\nThe 9th Circuit has 16 judges appointed by Democratic presidents, seven by Republicans and six vacancies. Trump has nominated candidates for five of the openings.\n\nHe is likely to tilt the ideological balance of that court, as well as others.\n\nBut he can't count on them being \"Trump judges.\"\n\nIt was Roberts, a nominee of Republican George W. Bush, who was the decisive Supreme Court vote preserving Obama's health care overhaul.\n\nAnd it was U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly who granted a temporary restraining order restoring access to the White House for CNN reporter Jim Acosta after the White House had pulled his credential. Kelly was put on the bench by Trump.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Israeli sues Airbnb over West Bank settlement listing ban", "description": "An Israeli settler is suing Airbnb over its ban on West Bank settlements listings, heeding the call of Israeli officials to challenge the decision", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-sues-airbnb-west-bank-settlement-listing-ban-59365768", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:05:45Z", "content": "An Israel i settler is suing Airbnb over its ban on West Bank settlement listings, heeding the call of Israeli officials to challenge the decision.

Prosecutors say Liu's wealth has nothing to do with their consideration of the case. A look at where things stand:\n\nTHE ALLEGATION\n\nLiu, the founder of Beijing-based e-commerce site JD.com, was arrested Aug. 31 on suspicion of felony rape after a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota said she felt pressured to drink with him and that he attacked her.\n\nLiu is enrolled as a student with the university's doctor of business administration China program, which is geared toward high-level executives in China. He was in Minneapolis for a weeklong residency.\n\nOn the night of the alleged attack, Liu and other executives went to Origami, a Japanese restaurant in Minneapolis. The alleged victim was there as a volunteer and, her attorney Wil Florin has said, she felt coerced to drink as the powerful men toasted her.\n\n\"This young woman needed one of these wealthy CEOs to act like a father, rather than ignore what was clearly happening to her at Origami,\" Florin told The Associated Press.\n\nText messages reviewed by the Star Tribune and portions of the woman's interviews with police show the woman claims Liu dragged her into a vehicle and made advances, despite her protests. The woman texted a friend: \"I begged him to stop but he didn't listen.\" She said he raped her at her apartment. Liu was arrested, released the next day and returned to China, which has no extradition agreement with the U.S.\n\nThrough his attorneys, Liu has maintained his innocence. They said he is cooperating with the investigation.\n\n\"We believe his innocence will be apparent once a determination has been made and all evidence is disclosed to the public,\" attorney Jill Brisbois said in a statement to the AP.\n\nLiu, known in Chinese as Liu Qiangdong, is worth $7.5 billion. He continues to lead JD.com.\n\n'AS LONG AS IT TAKES'\n\nThe Hennepin County Attorney's Office got the case from police on Sept. 20. They say they have no deadline for a charging decision.\n\n\"Every case is different and reviewing a case takes as long as it takes,\" the office said in an email to the AP. \"We have had other cases that have taken significantly longer and some that took significantly less time. Mr. Liu's status as a wealthy businessman is irrelevant in the consideration of the case.\"\n\nAbby Honold, a rape survivor and activist in Minnesota, said she thinks authorities are treating Liu differently because of his status. \"It does not seem to me that Mr. Liu is receiving the same treatment that most criminal defendants get,\" she said, adding that she appreciates that prosecutors are being thorough.\n\nMarsh Halberg, a defense attorney who is not connected to the case, said it's possible prosecutors are waiting for laboratory results, though those could have been expedited. He also said it's possible prosecutors and defense attorneys are talking. And, he said, prosecutors will occasionally go back to police and ask them to re-interview witnesses or collect more evidence.\n\nIf Liu isn't charged, Halberg said, people are going to wonder if he got preferential treatment. \"On the other side, if they are going to charge this guy, he's got the resources to put up a hell of a defense,\" so prosecutors need to make sure they have a strong case.\n\nLOCAL PRESSURE?\n\nProsecutors may feel added pressure following a series of stories in the Star Tribune in the past year that documented widespread failings in the way police conduct sexual assault investigations. The newspaper analyzed more than 1,300 sexual assault cases from 2015 to 2016 and found that only one in four was ever referred to a prosecutor for charges. Less than 10 percent of all sexual assault reports ended in a conviction, the newspaper found.\n\nProsecutors say they cannot charge someone with a crime unless they can prove one occurred. But this summer, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman called the series \"a good wake-up call.\" Freeman, who just won re-election, is seeking funding to hire more prosecutors to handle rape cases.\n\nIn addition, his office reviewed 40 cases from 2018 that resulted in no charges because there was not enough evidence to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. Office spokesman Chuck Laszewski said the review is finished and found that the original decisions not to bring charges in those cases were correct.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Kansas Medicaid expansion in doubt despite governor support", "description": "The election of Democrat Laura Kelly as governor does not ensure that Kansas will expand Medicaid to cover to cover thousands of uninsured adults", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/kansas-medicaid-expansion-doubt-governor-support-59365331", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_1acef836f3fb489c923fb425903bc910_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T17:28:18Z", "content": "Democratic and moderate Republicans lawmakers worked together last year to try to make Kansas the latest state to expand Medicaid, only to see their bipartisan effort rewarded with a veto from former conservative GOP Gov.

Sam Brownback.\n\nThe election this month of a governor who supports Medicaid expansion seemed to remove the biggest hurdle for those hoping to bring health coverage to thousands of the state's poor. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn the same election that put Democrat Laura Kelly in the governor's office, Kansas voters also elected a more conservative Legislature. Any bill seeking to expand Medicaid will have a tougher time getting to the governor's desk.\n\n\"I'm still looking at every possible way that we can stop that,\" said state Rep. Dan Hawkins, a conservative Republican from Wichita who is chairman of the House's health committee.\n\nRepublicans retained their large majorities in both chambers and will appoint the leaders of the committees, who can help them bottle up or kill legislation they don't like. In this month's election, conservatives gained at least half a dozen seats in the House and might replace the chamber's majority leader, a moderate, with someone who leans further to the right. Hawkins is vying for the post.\n\nIn the Senate, the health committee chairwoman is a moderate Republican who was instrumental in pushing Medicaid expansion last year but is leaving her position after being elected state insurance commissioner. Her replacement is likely to be more conservative.\n\nWith conservatives in control of the majority party, Kelly will likely have to make concessions on Medicaid expansion to get enough support to pass the Legislature. One could be a work requirement for recipients, something other Republican-leaning states have imposed.\n\nFor her part, Kelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka, has promised to have a working group create a bipartisan plan.\n\n\"I'm not exactly sure what it will look like yet,\" she told The Associated Press recently. \"I'm a fiscal realist, and I need to make sure whatever we present is doable.\"\n\nMedicaid provides health coverage for lower-income and disabled Americans, including 377,000 in Kansas, and is funded jointly by states and the federal government.\n\nThirty-five states have expanded Medicaid under the health care law signed by former President Barack Obama. Voters in Idaho, Utah and neighboring Nebraska approved expansions earlier this month.\n\nIn a 36th state, Maine, voters approved an expansion in 2017, only to see their Republican governor stymie it. But the newly elected Democratic governor promised to move ahead.\n\nIn Kansas, Brownback and departing Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer were the biggest reasons for the state not expanding the program. Both cited the cost of providing coverage to as many as 150,000 more people.\n\nA much-disputed study for Brownback's administration in 2015 suggested the state's costs could reach more than $100 million a year. Some projections after that were lower: In 2018, Colyer's budget office estimated a net cost of $22 million for the fiscal year beginning in July 2019.\n\nThe federal government paid the full cost of covering the expansion group until 2017 and will continue paying 90 percent starting in 2020.\n\nVoters in Oregon, which approved the expansion early, approved taxes on hospitals, health insurers and managed care companies to pay for the program. In Montana, voters this month rejected a ballot measure that would have raised tobacco taxes to extend the state's Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"We don't want to take on something that we know is absolutely unaffordable and will require a tax increase,\" said Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a conservative Wichita Republican.\n\nBut supporters point to the closing of a small nonprofit hospital in southeast Kansas \u2014 after a closing in another town in the region in 2015 \u2014 as a cost of not expanding Medicaid. Kelly said providing health coverage to more Kansas residents is \"a moral obligation.\"\n\nAdvocates also contend that expanding Medicaid in Kansas would reduce expenses associated with uncovered medical care, reduce the costs of some state programs, make it easier for some people to hold jobs and promote employment in health care.\n\nThe Kansas Hospital Association projects a net gain for the state.\n\n\"No, it's not going to be easy, but it is easier from the standpoint that we have a governor who is going to push for it,\" said Kansas Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, and Andrew Selsky in Salem, Oregon, contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "UK group Bellingcat names Russian suspect in Montenegro plot", "description": "Investigative group Bellingcat and Russian website 'The Insider' claim they have identified a second Russian GRU military intelligence officer involved in a 2016 coup attempt in Montenegro", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uk-group-bellingcat-names-russian-suspect-montenegro-plot-59365498", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T17:25:30Z", "content": "Investigative group Bellingcat and Russia n website 'The Insider' claim they have identified a second Russian GRU military intelligence officer involved in a 2016 coup attempt in Montenegro.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a Thanksgiving Day call to troops deployed overseas to pat himself on the back and air grievances about the courts, trade and migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump's call, made from his opulent private Mar-a-Lago club, struck an unusually political tone as he spoke with members of all five branches of the military to wish them happy holidays.\n\n\"It's a disgrace,\" Trump said of judges who have blocked his attempts to overhaul U.S. immigration law, as he linked his efforts to secure the border with military missions overseas.\n\nTrump later threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico for an undisclosed period of time if his administration determines Mexico has lost \"control\" on its side.\n\nThe call was a uniquely Trump blend of boasting, peppered questions and off-the-cuff observations as his comments veered from venting about slights to praising troops \u2014 \"You really are our heroes,\" he said \u2014 as club waiters worked to set Thanksgiving dinner tables on the outdoor terrace behind him. And it was yet another show of how Trump has dramatically transformed the presidency, erasing the traditional divisions between domestic policy and military matters and efforts to keep the troops clear of politics.\n\n\"You probably see over the news what's happening on our southern border,\" Trump told one Air Force brigadier general stationed at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, adding: \"I don't have to even ask you. I know what you want to do, you want to make sure that you know who we're letting in.\"\n\nLater, Trump asked a U.S. Coast Guard commander about trade, which he noted was \"a very big subject\" for him personally.\n\n\"We've been taken advantage of for many, many years by bad trade deals,\" Trump told the commander, who sheepishly replied that, \"We don't see any issues in terms of trade right now.\"\n\nAnd throughout, Trump was sure to congratulate himself, telling the officers that the country is doing exceptionally well on his watch.\n\n\"I hope that you'll take solace in knowing that all of the American families you hold so close to your heart are all doing well,\" he said. \"The nation's doing well economically, better than anybody in the world.\" He later told reporters \"nobody's done more for the military than me.\"\n\nIndeed, asked what he was thankful for this Thanksgiving, Trump cited his \"great family,\" as well as himself.\n\n\"I made a tremendous difference in this country,\" he said.\n\nBut Trump continued to warn about the situation on the southern border as he took questions from reporters, pointing to the caravans of Central American migrants that have been making their way toward the U.S. and warning that, \"If we find that it gets to a level where we lose control or people are going to start getting hurt, we're going to close entry into the country for a period of time until we get it under control.\"\n\nHe said he had the authority to do so by executive order and claimed he'd already used it earlier this week. \"Two days ago, we closed the border. We actually just closed it, said nobody's coming in because it was just out of control.\"\n\nBy no means did he seal the border with Mexico. Officials did shut down one port of entry, San Ysidro, in California, for several hours early Monday morning to bolster security because of concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members. They closed northbound lanes into the U.S. and reopened most of them before the morning rush.\n\nTrump's border threat came days after a federal judge put the administration's attempts to overhaul asylum rules on hold. Courts have also blocked several versions of the president's travel ban as well as his attempt to end a program that allows young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to live and work in the country.\n\nTrump probably could close the entire southern border by order, at least temporarily, invoking national security powers. But doing so could cause extraordinary damage to bilateral relations as well as to cross-border commerce between the U.S. and Mexico, its third largest trading partner. It would not necessarily stop migrants from coming either; Trump would have to contend with the same asylum laws already vexing his efforts to harden the border.\n\nAmong other subjects the president touched on in his question-and-answer session with the press:\n\n\u2014Trump disputed reports the CIA has concluded that Saudi Arabia's crown prince was responsible for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing. \"The CIA points it both ways,\" said Trump. \"Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.\"\n\n\u2014Asked who should be held responsible for killing, Trump responded that, \"Maybe the world should be held accountable 'cause the world is a vicious place.\"\n\n\u2014Trump said he'd be interviewing candidates for potential openings in his administration \u2014 but wouldn't say for what positions.\n\n\"I'm very happy with my Cabinet and the people working for me and for us. ... They're absolute stars.\" But, he said, \"there's always a lot of change. I'll probably be changing a couple.\"\n\n\u2014Trump would not discount the possibility of a partial government shutdown over lawmakers' refusal to allocate billions of dollars for his promised border wall. \"Could there be a shutdown? There certainly could, and it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part,\" Trump said\n\n\u2014Trump said he'd spoken with his daughter Ivanka following news she'd sent hundreds of emails from a private address while serving as a senior White House adviser. Trump said she was \"very innocent\" and that situation was very different from the one he's said his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton should be in jail for.\n\n\u2014He defended his acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, calling him \"a highly respected person\" whom the press had treated nastily.\n\n\u2014He complained about the military's use of new electromagnetic catapult technology instead of steam in the new Navy aircraft carriers, telling a Navy officer that, \"unfortunately, you have to be Albert Einstein to really work it properly.\" The officer rebuffed him. \"You sort of have to be Albert Einstein to run the nuclear power plants that we have here as well. But we're doing that very well,\" he said, advising the president to \"go electromagnetic.\"\n\nTrump later traveled to a nearby Coast Guard station, where he delivered a lunch of plastic-wrapped sandwiches, fruit and chips before spending some time at one of his golf courses.\n\nHe and his family capped the day with several hundred dues-paying members and their guests at a Thanksgiving feast in Mar-a-Lago's opulent ballroom that included the usual fixings, along with chilled seafood, Chilean sea bass and braised short ribs.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Bus drives off mountain highway in Nepal, killing 16 people", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Interest\n\nSenate Republicans are working to soon fill the nation's longest judicial vacancy with a North Carolina lawyer whose nomination has raised objections from black lawmakers and civil rights groups concerned about his work defending state laws found to have discriminated against African-Americans.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has helped push 84 of President Donald Trump's nominees over the finish line and is itching for more. With just a few more weeks to go before Congress adjourns for the year, he has teed up a vote on the nomination of Thomas Farr, 64, to serve as a district court judge in North Carolina.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Farr's confirmation with a party-line vote back in January, meaning McConnell has waited about 10 months and until after the midterm elections to hold a vote on the floor.\n\nSenators tend to save their biggest fights in the judicial arena for Supreme Court and appeals court nominees, but Farr's nomination has proved an exception.\n\n\"It's hard to believe President Trump nominated him, and it's even harder to believe the Senate Republicans are considering it again,\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York in one of about 20 tweets he has sent out in recent days concerning Farr.\n\nFarr has the backing of home-state Sens. Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, both Republicans. They have noted that Farr was also nominated to the same position by former President George W. Bush and has a \"well qualified\" rating from the American Bar Association. They have protested the implication that Farr is racially insensitive or biased.\n\n\"I think absolutely destroying a good man's reputation is inappropriate,\" Tillis said before the committee advanced Farr's nomination.\n\nIn introducing Farr last year, Burr said the judiciary needs good people and he \"fills every piece of the word good.\"\n\nBut Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., described Farr as \"probably the worst of the litter\" when it comes to Trump's judicial nominees.\n\n\"Could this administration have picked an individual who is more hostile to the rights of minorities than this man? It is hard to imagine,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in the same committee hearing.\n\nGOP leaders in charge of the North Carolina Legislature hired Farr and others at his firm to defend congressional and legislative boundaries that the Legislature approved in 2011. A federal court eventually struck some boundaries down as racial gerrymanders and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision.\n\nFarr also helped defend a 2013 law that required photo identification to vote, reduced the number of early voting days and eliminated same-day registration during that period.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans said that requiring voter ID would increase the integrity of elections. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state provided no evidence of the kind of in-person voter fraud the ID mandate would address. The Richmond, Virginia-based court said the law targeted black voters \"with almost surgical precision.\"\n\nFarr told lawmakers that, as an advocate, he vehemently disagreed with the argument that the North Carolina Legislature sought to curtail the voting rights of people of color or any other voter. But, said, \"I am obligated to follow the decision by the 4th Circuit and pledge that I will do so.\"\n\nThe history of the particular judicial opening Farr would fill has also contributed to the acrimony.\n\nPresident Barack Obama nominated two African-American women to serve on the court, but neither was granted a hearing and their nominations stalled. If confirmed, they would have been the first blacks to serve in that particular district, which is about 27 percent black.\n\nFarr also served as a lawyer for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in 1990. The Justice Department alleged that about 120,000 postcards sent overwhelmingly to black voters before that election was intended to intimidate them from voting.\n\nFarr said he was not consulted about the postcards and did not have any role in drafting or sending them. He said that after he had been asked to review the card, \"I was appalled to read the incorrect language printed on the card and to then discover it had been sent to African Americans.\"\n\nThe explanation has failed to win over the NAACP.\n\n\"The courts are supposed to be where we can find and seek justice. But Farr's lifetime crusade is to disenfranchise African Americans and deprive them of their rights,\" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau. \"He belongs nowhere near a bench of justice.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers called on the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, to schedule Farr for another round of testimony about his role in the Helms' campaign, but Grassley declined.\n\nWith a 51-49 majority, Republicans will have little margin for error in confirming Farr.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has already pledged to oppose all judicial nominees until he gets a vote on legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Tensions soar between Kosovo and Serbia over trade tax", "description": "Serbia's president has blasted the European Union and the West for allegedly failing to prevent Kosovo from triggering a trade war as tensions soar between the wartime foes", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/tensions-soar-kosovo-serbia-trade-tax-59363566", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_56691d09b4de4aca8f590405822bcfdb_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:28:38Z", "content": "Serbia's president has criticized the European Union and the West for allegedly failing to prevent Kosovo from triggering a trade war as tensions soar between the wartime foes.

CubeSats always share rockets; they're too small and inexpensive to warrant their own launch. This Mars Cube One project, or MarCO, built and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, cost $18.5 million.\n\nFLIGHT FORMATION\n\nNASA kept the CubeSats about 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) away from InSight during the 300 million-mile (483 million-kilometer) journey to Mars to prevent any collisions or close calls. The mini satellites were just as far from each other for the same reason. The elbow room in this \"very loose formation,\" as chief engineer Andy Klesh describes it, has varied during the mission and is narrowing as the spacecraft draws ever closer to Mars.\n\nBEST BEHAVIOR\n\nFor the record, EVE has behaved better than WALL-E during the 6 1/2-month voyage to Mars. Each CubeSat has the same type of cold gas propulsion that's used in fire extinguishers to spray foam. In the film, WALL-E uses a fire extinguisher to propel through space. In reality, WALL-E has been leaking fuel almost since liftoff. Flight controllers have worked around the problem. Meanwhile, \"EVE seems to follow her namesake and has been flying beautifully throughout the mission,\" said Klesh.\n\nDRY RUN\n\nIn June, WALL-E and EVE aced a series of radio-relay tests using signals from a big dish antenna near Palo Alto, California. Klesh said that gives engineers confidence in the CubeSats' ability to do the same with InSight's signals on landing day. Last month, the pair sent back photos of Mars from 8 million miles (13 million kilometers) out. Mars was merely a bright pinpoint, but the team said it marked a proud CubeSat first.\n\nALL EARS\n\nIt takes eight minutes and seven seconds for a radio signal to get from Mars to Earth, one way. It should take less than a minute on top of that to get word from InSight, if the mini satellites cooperate. That means NASA could know InSight's fate close to real time. If WALL-E and EVE are mum, confirmation would come directly from the lander or, hours later, from spacecraft circling Mars.\n\nFUTURE GOAL\n\nAs NASA explores new worlds, it would be handy to have listening outposts to beam back descent and landing updates. Spacecraft already in orbit around Mars serve that purpose whenever NASA sends a lander. But where there are no satellites \u2014 think asteroids or dwarf planets on the fringes of our solar system \u2014 CubeSats could step in, with little overhead and low cost.\n\nBEYOND MARS\n\nWhether or not they provide any insight on InSight, WALL-E and EVE will zoom past Mars and remain in an elliptical orbit around the sun. Engineers expect them to keep working for a couple weeks beyond Mars depending on how long the fuel and electronics last.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the Mars landing: https://apnews.com/MarsLanding\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

But on Thursday they confirmed Ghosn is not getting VIP treatment and is subject to the same Spartan conditions faced by any other detainee in Japan. A look at what is known about Ghosn's situation:\n\nQ: WHERE IS GHOSN?\n\nA: Prosecutors say Ghosn is detained at the Tokyo Detention House, a 12-story building in downtown Tokyo's Katsushika district. About 3,000 people, mostly pre-trial suspects, defendants and some death row inmates, are held there. It is one of Japan's eight detention centers. The facility's gallows were used in July to hang cult leader Shoko Asahara, the mastermind of a Tokyo subway gassing and other crimes.\n\nQ: WHAT IS LIFE LIKE IN DETENTION?\n\nA: Officials say Ghosn has met with officials from the French Embassy and a lawyer. Under Japan's criminal justice procedures, his counsel is not allowed to attend questioning by prosecutors. Tokyo deputy prosecutor Shin Kukimoto said Ghosn is being treated just like any other detainee, with about eight hours of sleep and three simple meals a day.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE INTERROGATIONS LIKE IN JAPAN?\n\nA: Kukimoto said Ghosn is being questioned for several hours a day in a room with prosecutors and a translator. He gave no further details and would not say if Ghosn has acknowledged the allegations. Japanese investigators once were notorious for lengthy, tough interrogations of suspects denied contact with their lawyers. Conditions have improved in recent years with increased awareness of human rights standards.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST GHOSN AND POSSIBLE PENALTIES?\n\nA: Ghosn, who was arrested with Nissan representative director Greg Kelly, is suspected of violating financial reporting laws which carry a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison or a fine up to 10 million yen ($89,000) if he is convicted.\n\nQ: WHAT'S NEXT?\n\nA: Wednesday's court approval of 10-day detention allows prosecutors to keep Ghosn through Nov. 30. They could extend that by another 10 days before having to decide whether to indict him, though they could add new allegations and win more time \u2014 20 days per charge.

Add Brexit as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Brexit news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May faced wide-ranging criticism from skeptical lawmakers Thursday as she sought to portray a draft agreement on a post-Brexit relationship with the European Union as a \"good deal for our country.\"\n\nAddressing the House of Commons after the publication of a 26-page draft political declaration with the EU on post-Brexit relations, May said the agreement will ensure a \"smooth and orderly\" British departure from the European Union. Britain officially leaves the 28-nation EU \u2014 the first country to ever do so \u2014 on March 29.\n\n\"The draft text that we have agreed with the (European) Commission is a good deal for our country and for our partners in the EU,\" May said.\n\nMay is due to travel to Brussels on Saturday for further Brexit meetings, including with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a day before a summit of the EU's 27 other leaders at which both the political declaration on post-Brexit relations as well as the divorce agreement, which alone has legal status, are expected to be formally signed off.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement needs to be sealed soon to leave enough time for the European Parliament and the U.K. Parliament to endorse it.\n\nMay told lawmakers that the outlines for the future help protect jobs, end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the U.K., give British fishermen more control and avoid the return of a hard border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nShe also said the agreement paves the way for a free trade agreement with the bloc as well as allowing Britain to forge new trade deals around the world.\n\nBut her rosy predictions met with resistance on many fronts in Parliament, which is expected to vote on the Brexit plan next month.\n\nAt the moment, it looks precarious for the prime minister given the number of lawmakers who have expressed discontent with the proposals, notably the 585-page legal treaty that deals with the terms of Britain's departure, including what the country owes the EU.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's main opposition Labour Party, poured scorn on the agreement on future relations, describing it a \"26 pages of waffle\" that represented a failure of the Conservative Party and May during two years of negotiations.\n\nCorbyn said the agreement \"represents the worst of all worlds\" and that Britain will have \"no say\" over EU rules that will continue to apply in Britain.\n\n\"This is the blindfold Brexit we all feared,\" he said. \"A leap into the dark.\"\n\nMay is likely to need some Labour lawmakers to back her plan if she has realistic hopes of winning approval, given that her Conservative Party does not enjoy a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nMay also faced criticism from hard-line Conservative Party Brexiteers, notably Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, and from others who pressed May to back a second referendum on the whole Brexit proposition.\n\nIf May fails to get a majority in Parliament, it's unclear what would then happen. Some lawmakers argue that the country would end up crashing out of the EU on Brexit day with no deal, a scenario that could see tariffs slapped on exports and restrictions imposed on workers. Others hope Parliament could back a second referendum in the hope the public would call the whole thing off.\n\nThe political declaration was agreed upon at a technical level by negotiators and endorsed Thursday by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is overseeing Brexit negotiations.\n\n\"This declaration establishes the parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defense and wider areas of cooperation,\" according to the document.\n\nIt also talks about the close ties that have been cemented after 45 years of Britain's membership of the EU and notes that the \"parties envisage having a trading relationship on goods that is as close as possible, with a view to facilitating the ease of legitimate trade.\"\n\nIn a speech in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel underlined that \"Britain should remain a partner, remain a friend\" but she underscored the difficulties that may arise in any attempt to keep services seamless.\n\n\"We have to say honestly that, in the services sector, we don't have a great deal of experience with international free trade agreements,\" she said.\n\n\"But we want to see that as a future relationship.\"\n\nOne stumbling block relates to Gibraltar, the tiny territory at the tip of the Iberian Peninsula that was ceded to Britain in 1713 but is still claimed by Spain.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier this week that his government \"cannot accept\" Gibraltar's future being determined by negotiations at the EU level.\n\nMay said Thursday that she has spoken with Sanchez and that she is \"confident\" there will be a resolution on Sunday \"that delivers for the whole U.K. family, including Gibraltar.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCook reported from Brussels.

The Saturday after Thanksgiving also ranks in the top 10.\n\n\"The biggest pain point on Black Friday is standing in line,\" says Jason Goldberg, senior vice president of commerce and content practice at consulting group SapientRazorfish.\n\nJ.C. Penney, which has been offering mobile checkout for years, says it sent an additional 6,000 mobile devices to stores this year so workers can check shoppers out quicker, like when lines get long on Black Friday. Other stores are testing it for the first time: Kohl's says iPad-wielding workers will roam 160 of its more than 1,100 stores.\n\nMacy's, which announced its program in May, says customers need to use its mobile app to scan price tags and pay. After that, they have to go to a mobile checkout express line and show the app to a worker, who then removes security tags from clothing.\n\nTarget's mobile checkout program, which is being rolled out to all its 1,800 stores, is similar to Walmart's. Target says that at its electronics area, where there are usually two cash registers, four workers will be sent with handheld devices to help ring up customers buying TVs, video games and other devices.\n\n\"This is about servicing the guest however they want and as quickly as they want,\" says John Mulligan, Target's chief operating officer."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "A holiday miracle?

Add Germany as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Germany news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nA former nurse accused of killing 100 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany addressed the families of his victims on Thursday and expressed regret.\n\n\"If there was a way to help you, I would do it, believe me,\" said Niels Hoegel, who is on trial at a regional court in the northwestern city of Oldenburg.\n\nThe 41-year-old said he was now convinced he owed an answer to the families of each victim, German news agency dpa reported.\n\nHoegel had earlier told the court he initially wasn't moved by the killings, which occurred over a decade ago.\n\n\"Now I sit here fully convinced that I want to give every relative an answer,\" Hoegel said. \"I am really sorry.\"\n\nThe murder charges stem from Hoegel's time at a hospital in Oldenburg between 1999 and 2002 and at another hospital in nearby Delmenhorst from 2003 to 2005. The alleged victims were aged between 34 and 96.\n\nHoegel was convicted in 2015 of two murders and two attempted murders. He said then that he intentionally brought about cardiac crises in some 90 patients in Delmenhorst because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. He later told investigators that he also killed patients in Oldenburg.\n\nAuthorities subsequently investigated hundreds of deaths, exhuming bodies of former patients.\n\nThe Oldenburg state court is conducting the trial at a courtroom set up in a conference center, a venue chosen to accommodate the large public interest in the proceedings and the many co-plaintiffs.\n\nHoegel told the court last month that he had a \"protected\" childhood, free of violence. He said his grandmother and his father, who were both nurses, had been his role models for going into the profession.\n\nAn additional conviction could affect Hoegel's possibility of parole, but there are no consecutive sentences in Germany. In general, people serving life sentences are considered for parole after 15 years.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to last until May.\n\nPolice have said that, if local health officials hadn't hesitated in alerting authorities, Hoegel could have been stopped earlier.\n\nAuthorities are pursuing criminal cases against former staff at the two medical facilities."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: Germany's Merkel pushes for orderly Brexit deal", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel is pledging to do everything to reach an agreement with Britain securing its orderly exit from the European Union", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-eu-chief-brexit-text-future-ties-agreed-59359885", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_fcb9d6b4967942a28bca0d9a50d472e8_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:10:28Z", "content": "The Latest on Britain's talks to leave the European Union (all times local): 11:05 a.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is pledging to do everything to reach an agreement with Britain securing its orderly exit from the European Union.

Anger against politicians' apparent indifference, worsening public services and distress over down-spiraling finances and gloomy predictions are building up.\n\nLast Friday, heavy rains caused Beirut's sewage system to burst, turning the city's famous Mediterranean coastal avenue into a river of filthy, foul-smelling black water that engulfed motorists along the otherwise scenic route. On the same day, the military had closed a main artery for drills ahead of the Independence Day parade, paralyzing traffic for hours. Flights from Beirut's international airport were missed and a woman reportedly went into labor on the road. The army later apologized.\n\nOn Thursday, Lebanese President Michel Aoun and the country's top officials watched an hour-long military parade along Beirut's waterfront as helicopters hovered overhead. The city center was closed off for the duration of the spectacle.\n\nAs soon as the parade ended, dozens of protesters took to the streets to voice their impatience with the political stalemate. Some denounced corruption, while others ranted about electricity shortages, fraying infrastructure or increasing pollution levels. Many wore T-shirts with the inscription: \"Our independence from you exploitation.\"\n\nDespite a population of over 4.5 million that is among the most educated in the region, Lebanon still has a primitive infrastructure, widespread electricity and water cuts and a longstanding waste crisis that over the past few years saw trash piling in the streets for weeks at a time.\n\n\"There is no independence (to celebrate) because corruption is eating us up,\" said Mohammed al-Rayyes, a shop owner in Beirut's Hamra district. \"The coming days are going to be very difficult.\"\n\nThe tiny Arab country has coped with multiple political and security crises over the past decades and also suffered from the seven-year civil war in neighboring Syria, a conflict that has occasionally spilled over the border and brought more than 1 million refugees into Lebanon, putting even more pressure on its dysfunctional infrastructure.\n\nA soaring debt of $84 billion and unemployment believed to be around 36 percent are compounding concerns that the country will finally cave in.\n\n\"It is a shame because so much time is being wasted,\" Ferid Belhaj, the World Bank's vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, said during a meeting with a group of journalists last week.\n\nFor years, he said, Lebanese officials have been promising to work on solving the electricity crisis, which costs the country about $2 billion a year and has been the main factor in accumulating Lebanon's debt.\n\nOf immediate concern is the future of $11 billion in loans and grants pledged by international donors at a meeting in Paris in April, which Lebanon risks losing if no Cabinet is in place soon to unlock the funds and approve reforms that were set as conditions by the donors and which have been delayed for years. In April, Hariri pledged to reduce the budget deficit by 5 percent over the next five years.\n\nThe crisis has prompted some Lebanese to change their deposits from the local currency, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollars since 1997, to U.S. dollars for fear the Lebanese pound might collapse. Riad Salameh, the Central Bank governor, has been repeatedly reassuring the markets, saying the local currency is stable.\n\nMohamad Shukeir, head of the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, told the local MTV station that 2,200 businesses closed doors so far this year.\n\nAftershocks of rising tension between the United States and Iran are also felt in Beirut, with Tehran ally Hezbollah being blamed by opponents for preventing Western-backed Hariri from forming a national unity government.\n\nHezbollah has demanded that six Sunni lawmakers allied with the Shiite group and opposed to Hariri be included in his Cabinet \u2014 something that Hariri, the country's top Sunni Muslim leader, categorically rejects.\n\nDespite the dangers, political bickering is not likely to end soon and the debt is mounting.\n\n\"The level of debt that we have in Lebanon requires us to act very quickly,\" said economist Kamel Wazne. \"Any delay will expose us to financial collapse.\"\n\nBelhaj of the World Bank said that reforms would act as a buffer to the crisis. But in their absence, \"the crisis can be very nasty.\"\n\n\"If we don't go about these reforms fast, the Lebanon that we know will fizzle away,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press reporter Fadi Tawil in Beirut contributed to this story."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Google tightens political ad rules ahead of Europe elections", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

But after emerging from her meeting with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, she said authorities pledged to \"return him home to me.\"\n\n\"He has assured me that he and his team are doing everything in their power to get Matt free and return him home to me,\" she said. \"This is not a fight I can win alone and I thank the Foreign Office and the British public for now standing up for one of their citizens.\"\n\nTejada has become her husband's primary advocate, turning up the pressure on the government to act. She told the BBC earlier in the day that the government had failed to robustly intervene on Hedges' behalf during the early stages of his imprisonment, when he was held in solitary confinement under inhumane conditions.\n\n\"I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and his welfare,\" Tejada said. \"They were stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance.\"\n\nThe verdict, announced Wednesday after a five-minute hearing, caught the British government off guard. Hunt issued a statement saying he had discussed the case with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed during a visit to the country last week and the verdict \"runs contrary to earlier assurances.\"\n\nHunt said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the verdict, which \"is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nTensions over Hedges' treatment have quickly escalated into a crisis, in part because ties between Britain and the seven emirates of the UAE are considered close and date back 200 years.\n\nThe UAE is strategically located on the east coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and the British military trains with UAE troops. The emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai are home to large numbers of British nationals who work in areas ranging from finance to sports, and thousands of tourists visit the country each year, attracted by sunny beaches, luxury hotels and theme parks.\n\nTies also include lucrative defense contracts. U.K. companies have a backlog of orders with the UAE worth more than $261 million over the coming decade, according to data from IHS Markit. More importantly, the UAE plans to award another $20 billion of arms contracts over the coming decade \u2014 a significant source of potential revenue for Britain, which is set to leave the European Union next year and is seeking to expand trade elsewhere.\n\nHedges traveled to the UAE to conduct interviews as part of his research into civil-military relations after the Arab Spring. There was \"nothing clandestine or covert\" in anything he was doing, according to Clive Jones, his Ph.D. supervisor.\n\nThe Muslim nation prides itself on being tolerant of foreigners. But British nationals often run afoul of local customs and laws, which prohibit public intoxication, kissing in public and cursing. Most of the time, the violators are deported.\n\nThe UAE's vast surveillance network has been used to go after critics, journalists and activists conducting research in sensitive areas. Human rights organizations have been barred from the country after researching the conditions of migrant laborers who do the back-breaking construction work behind the glittering high-rise towers and sprawling shopping malls.\n\nAndreas Krieg, a military and security expert at King's College London, said the UAE sees any information that isn't state-controlled a threat to the regime.\n\nThe Hedges sentence was meant to send a message to journalists, rights advocates and academics to take the government line or face the consequences, Krieg said.\n\n\"They see civil society as a threat to security,\" he said, adding that the idea runs contrary to the well-oiled publicity machine that sells the UAE as an attractive investment and tourist attraction. \"This is going to be a stain for years and years unless they release him.\"\n\nTejada said it had been a horrible time for her husband. As she read a prepared statement outside the Foreign Office, she recalled his shock as the verdict was read.\n\n\"Seeing him shaking in court after being handed a life sentence and then being made to leave was beyond heartbreaking,\" she said. \"We didn't even get to say goodbye.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Daniel Manzo and Melissa Griffin", "title": "Arctic blast producing coldest Thanksgiving in decades", "description": "Today will be the coldest Thanksgiving in 22 years.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/arctic-blast-producing-coldest-thanksgiving-decades/story?id=59359884", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/winter-weather-coming-02-ap-jc-181119_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:51:43Z", "content": "Today will be the coldest Thanksgiving in decades for most of the Northeast, the result of an Arctic blast of air that's pushing temperatures 15 to 25 degrees colder than a year ago.

They described how Lee summoned each of them to his apartment at night and raped them by telling them they were improving their chances to go to heaven. Their names were not disclosed and faces obscured.\n\n\"(He) said he was a holy and righteous man and would choose me to go to the new Jerusalem,\" said one victim.\n\nAnother victim told the network that Lee demanded she take contraceptives before coming to his house.

It said its own internal investigation, prompted by a whistleblower, found serious misconduct including under-reporting of his income and misuse of company assets.\n\nIt was a stunning downfall for one of the biggest figures in the auto industry, a man who helped drive turnarounds at both France's Renault SA and at Nissan and then managed an alliance between them that sold 10.6 million cars last year, besting its rivals.\n\nNissan said in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock Exchange that its investigation uncovered misuse of company investment funds and expense money for personal gain.\n\nThis week, Renault voted to keep Ghosn as its chief executive but appointed Thierry Bollore, its chief operating officer, as its interim chief.\n\nAnother Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, was arrested in Japan on suspicion of collaborating in the wrongdoing and also will be dismissed as a representative director, Nissan said. Their replacements will be decided later, it said.\n\nGhosn, 64, is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to Tokyo prosecutors.\n\nNissan's board consists of nine members, including Ghosn and Greg Kelly. The seven other board members voted at the meeting, including two members from Nissan and two from Renault.\n\nGhosn and Kelly will remain on Nissan's board for now as that decision will be up to shareholders. No date has been set yet for a shareholders meeting.\n\nGhosn is also chairman at Mitsubishi Motors Corp., a smaller Japanese automaker that's partnering with the Renault-Nissan alliance and plans to hold a board meeting next week.\n\nGhosn has been held since his arrest Monday at a Tokyo detention center, under the same Spartan conditions as other detainees, Tokyo deputy prosecutor Shin Kukimoto told reporters Thursday. He gave few details about the case.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither has been charged so far.\n\nThe maximum penalty upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nA French citizen born in Brazil, Ghosn became something of a corporate superstar in Japan as he led Nissan's revival from near bankruptcy after Renault sent him to help in 1999.\n\nGhosn served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two automakers simultaneously. In 2016, he also became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan, maker of the Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models, in the U.S. in 1988. He became a board member in 2012. His background is in human resources and alliance management.\n\nAnalysts say the future of Nissan's alliance with Renault may be at stake, though Nissan's statement Thursday said the company's leadership was determined to minimize the impact from Ghosn's case on the partnership. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, and Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault.\n\n\"The longstanding alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,\" the Nissan statement in English said, stressing the alliance rather than the misdeeds.\n\nThe economy ministers of Japan and France met in Paris on Thursday to discuss the issue and released a statement saying both sides are committed to supporting the alliance.\n\nNissan said its board will study setting up a third-party committee to beef up governance in management and compensation at Nissan.\n\nCEO Hiroto Saikawa, in a lengthy news conference on Monday, said too much power had been concentrated in Ghosn, with too little credit given to the many others working for the company's success.\n\nJanet Lewis, managing director and head of industrial research, Asia, at Macquarie Capital Securities in Tokyo, said in an interview that an adjustment was needed to give Nissan more say in the alliance with Renault.\n\nThe partnership remains crucial for both companies, she said, since apart from financial ties the companies share technology and parts.\n\nThe automakers need to be more like roommates than a married couple, \"So they have to find a way to share their house and share all of their expertise because it's very necessary in terms of new automotive technology, new platform development,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"They need to figure out how they can continue this and still live happily together in the same house.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Dolce&Gabbana goods pulled in China over alleged insults", "description": "Dolce & Gabbana goods have disappeared from Chinese e-commerce sites as the fallout grew over insulting remarks about China on Instagram that the company blamed on hackers", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dolcegabbana-goods-pulled-china-alleged-insults-59359733", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_eda45a4369b04a05b97d8b233209b296_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:05:20Z", "content": "Dolce&amp;Gabbana goods have disappeared from Chinese e-commerce sites as the fallout grows over remarks insulting China that appeared in the company's Instagram private messages but that it blamed on hackers.

Both companies didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nA duty-free shop at the Haikou Meilan airport on China's Hainan island posted a photo of empty shelves on its social media account, saying that it had pulled all Dolce&Gabbana products. It wrote in another post that \"Even if our power is small, we have to show our stance. We are proud of being Chinese.\"\n\nThe moves by retailers came one day after several screenshots were circulated online showing co-founder Stefano Gabbana referring to China with crude terms and emoji as he defended promotional videos that had sparked controversy earlier.\n\nThe comments were made in a private message exchange with another Instagram user. Separately, the Dolce&Gabbana account used offensive language in another exchange.\n\nThe Italian luxury fashion house apologized and said both accounts had been hacked. \"We have nothing but respect for China and the people of China,\" it wrote.\n\nThe apology was too late to save a major extravaganza in Shanghai that Dolce&Gabbana had billed as one of its biggest shows ever outside of Italy.\n\nMajor Chinese celebrities threatened to boycott the event, which had been scheduled for Wednesday night, and the company finally called it off. Actress Zhang Ziyi, who starred in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" said that the Italian brand had \"disgraced itself.\"\n\nAn analyst said the bad publicity will have a lasting effect.\n\n\"It's the kiss of death for Dolce&Gabbana,\" said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \"I expect them to have a real tough time over the next six to 12 months.\"\n\nThe three promotional videos that led to the Instagram fiasco showed a Chinese woman using chopsticks to eat pizza and other Italian food. Many in China called them racist and full of outdated stereotypes. The videos were previously deleted from the company's account on Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter.\n\nRein said it's a big mistake when westerners come up with creative content but don't understand how the campaigns will be received by Chinese consumers.\n\nHe noted a trend of rising nationalism in China. \"So if you, as a western brand, do anything that looks like you are mocking or making fun of Chinese culture, that's a big no-no,\" he said.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper wrote on Weibo late Wednesday: \"China has always been friendly to foreign businesses.

Add Interest\n\nA top U.N. scientist on Thursday shrugged off an online quip from U.S. President Donald Trump that questioned global warming, saying a U.S. government report will show the \"fundamental impacts of climate change on the U.S. continent.\"\n\nOfficials at the World Meteorological Organization also said environmentally minded efforts by the state of California, in parts of the financial sector, among grassroots activists and others will have more of an impact to help the fight against climate change than \"political disturbance\" and \"discourse\" will impede it.\n\nThe science, they said, will have the last word.\n\nSome of that science comes Friday in a new U.S. federal climate change assessment report, from agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy.\n\n\"It's very interesting what you will see tomorrow,\" said Pavel Kabat, WMO's chief scientist. \"That is a major report coming supported by all agencies ... under the administration of President Trump ranging from NOAA to NASA, from NASA to DOE, showing the fundamental impacts of climate change on the U.S. continent.\"\n\nKabat was speaking at a news conference to present WMO's latest greenhouse gas bulletin, which said levels in the atmosphere climbed to a record last year. In a statement, WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas warned \"the window of opportunity\" to act against climate change has nearly closed.\n\nWMO says globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached 405.5 parts per million in 2017, up slightly from the previous year and from 400.1 in 2015. Concentrations of other heat-trapping gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, also rose.\n\nThe findings come ahead of next month's meeting of world leaders in Katowice, Poland, for the annual global climate summit where they hope to find ways to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord that aims to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, which lies about 2,000 kilometers northeast of Australia, is one of those countries already suffering severe effects of climate change.\n\nIts foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said his government is exploring the possibility of suing fossil fuel companies responsible for most man-made greenhouse gas emissions over the damage they have caused.\n\n\"By hiding what they knew and misrepresenting the dangers of unabated fossil fuel use, the fossil fuel industry and supportive governments protected their high-emissions profits and obstructed the changes needed to prevent or at least minimize the impacts of climate change,\" he told a 'virtual' summit of nations that are vulnerable to climate change.\n\nWMO's Taalas said the last time Earth had such high levels of carbon dioxide concentration was 3-5 million years ago.\n\nWithout cuts in greenhouse gases, Taalas said, \"climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth.\"\n\nThat came just hours after Trump, who once called global warming a \"hoax\" and has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, floated a new question about climate change on : \"Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?\"\n\nDespite that, Kabat cited a \"global transformation\" underway in thinking about global warming, saying \"the point of no return has been passed.\" He said efforts by some industries, in civil society and by local officials could \"overtake\" governmental agreements or statements on the issue.\n\n\"I think on the longer timescale we are not that much worried about the current political disturbance,\" he said.\n\n\"Despite the statements of President Trump, there is still a very concrete and specific movement by the agencies under the administration to actually make the case of action against climate change,\" Kabat said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrank Jordans contributed from Berlin."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Soo Youn", "title": "10 cybersecurity tips to remember for shopping Black Friday through Cyber Monday", "description": "We talked to cybersecurity experts from Google, IBM and Facebook.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/10-cybersecurity-tips-remember-shopping-black-friday-cyber/story?id=59340287", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/black-friday-online-er-181121_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:08:37Z", "content": "Thanksgiving Weekend -- some might call it the Super Bowl of shopping -- is here, and it's set to hit record numbers, according to analysts.

In October, the retail group predicted that shoppers will spend an average of $1,007.24 this year, up 4.1 percent from the $967.13 survey respondents said they'd spend last year.\n\nWhile this is good news for retailers, it's also ample hunting ground for hackers and cybercriminals looking to score consumer information. Experts warn that while traditional techniques like phishing are still popular with cyber thieves, new methods using ads and offers on social media platforms are also gaining traction.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nABC News asked security experts from IBM, Google and Facebook for online shopping advice. Here are 10 tips for safer shopping.\n\n1. Install ad and tracker blockers\n\n\"Ads have become one of the most frequently abused mechanisms through which hackers have tried to download malware onto your computer over the past few years. My top recommendations are 'UBlock Origin,' 'Privacy Badger' and 'Ghostery.'\" -- Jim McCoy, Creator of the Vektor home cybersecurity device and former tech lead of security tools and operations at Facebook\n\n2. Use a private browser window\n\n\"Most browsers have a button or menu item that lets you open a new window that keeps no cookies or other identifying information -- either during the browsing session or after you close the window. Some stores will actually charge longtime users more than they do for people who they can't identify. The other advantage is that what you are browsing for or purchasing is not tagged with an ad re-targeting cookie, and so on a shared computer some else is unlikely to see re-targeting ads for the gifts you have been considering or have even purchased!\" -- McCoy\n\n3. Do a search on internet-connected devices\n\n\"When purchasing an internet-connected device -- e.g. wireless security cameras, 'smart devices' or connected toys -- do a quick check of Consumer Reports or a Google search for \"[item name] security problems.\" It can save a lot of future headaches. This applies to nearly all manufacturers -- some of the worst security problems have come from mainstream brands and not just from cheap clones and low-end devices.\" -- McCoy\n\n4. Think: Do you really need an internet-connected device?\n\n\"When considering an internet-connected purchase, I would think hard about whether the device really needs to be connected to the internet. If in doubt, find a version that does not try to connect to some external service. Many of these internet-connected features add little long-term value to the item, but potentially open a home up to hackers. No one wants to be remembered as the person who gave a gift that led to identity theft for the recipient.\" -- McCoy\n\n5. Beware of phishing schemes\n\n\"Be cautious with unsolicited emails. Every year, IBM X-Force sees a massive uptick in phishing campaigns that disguise themselves as anything from package tracking emails to coupon codes to early-bird sales, but they are actually distributing various forms of malware. Don't click links to copy codes, instead copy it and use it directly on the retailer's website, -- even if it's a retail brand you trust. If you must click a link in your email, before doing so, hover over the URL and make sure it's taking you to the actual website.\" -- Caleb Barlow, vice president of threat intelligence at IBM Security\n\n6. Use a unique password for each online store\n\n\"Never reuse the same password on different websites, especially retailers. Instead, create a unique passphrase for each website you shop on. For example, something like \"longpassword123.\" Same goes for loyalty cards -- create a unique password for these accounts also.\" -- Barlow\n\n7. Choose credit over debit\n\n\"Credit cards offer consumers more protections if a card is compromised. More importantly, it won't impact your checking account during the holiday season if there's an issue. -- Barlow\n\n8. Strictly manage your credit cards\n\n\"The holiday season is a peak time for online fraud. Keep a close watch on your credit card statements. A hacker who stole your card information in the summer is likely to try to use it during the Christmas shopping season when people are making a large number of online purchases, many of which are outside their normal purchasing behavior, and it is easy for fraudsters to slip something into your bill that you don't notice amid all of the other online purchases.\" -- McCoy\n\n9. Protect your phone\n\n\"Add a screen lock or pin code to your smartphone, and don't leave it unattended in a taxi, plane, train or going from store to store.\" -- Mark Risher, director of Google account security\n\n10. Try Google's security checkup if you use it to browse\n\n\"Take our security checkup. This is Google-specific, but it really is the single best piece of security advice we have on our end. It's a one-stop shop for Google account security where we'll tell you if there are any issues to address -- and then help you take care of them. Besides just following the instructions, add a phone number to your account so we can reach you if you're ever locked out.\" -- Risher"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Black Friday tech deals: Some of our favorite early steals - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Black Friday tech deals: Some of our favorite early steals ABC News The biggest shopping days of the year are here, and there are already plenty of great tech deals to be had!

Add Interest\n\nThe young woman is panting, panicked, her thin arm pointing at four men in police uniforms who had let themselves into her hotel room near midnight.\n\n\"You cannot treat me like this,\" she shouts, her voice high and reeling. \"You cannot barge in like this late at night, OK? I didn't do anything illegal.\"\n\nThe men, one carrying a pair of thin white plastic restraints, tell her they are doing a \"routine inspection,\" according to a video of the Nov. 11 incident seen by The Associated Press.\n\nOnly there was nothing routine about this. Their target was Zhou Chen, an environmental reporter for Caixin, one of China's most respected business media groups. She was on a reporting trip to Quanzhou, a city in southeastern China's Fujian province, to investigate a petrochemical leak that sickened more than 50 people.\n\nJournalists in China are regularly tailed and harassed by local authorities, but few Chinese reporters publicly discuss the details. Zhou broke the silence about her harassment in an article published this week, prompting an outcry on social media and a rare apology from the police.\n\nReporters Without Borders ranks China 176 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom Index and says more than 50 journalists and bloggers are detained \"in conditions that pose a threat to their lives.\" China's ruling Communist Party is eager to suppress information that might contribute to social instability, while local officials often try to interfere with reporting on sensitive topics.\n\nOn Nov. 4, around 7 tons of the petroleum derivative C9 leaked into the sea off Quanzhou. Dozens of residents fell sick, and scores of fish died. Local residents complained that officials mishandled the cleanup and tried to cover up the extent of the damage.\n\nZhou went to investigate. On Nov. 11, after a long day of reporting, she was in bed, in her pajamas, looking at her phone when she heard a keycard unlocking the door of her hotel room. It was 11:30 p.m.\n\n\"You barged in like this when I'm not even properly dressed,\" Zhou shouts in the video. \"Could you please leave immediately?\"\n\nThe men demanded her ID. They did a cursory search of the room, flipping the curtains back and forth, and warned her to watch out for her safety.\n\nZhou's account of her terrifying night was published Monday in Caixin Weekly, part of the Caixin Media group. The police search capped a day of bullying, according to her article. She wrote that she had been blocked from taking photos by people wearing body cameras and tailed as a mother and daughter took her to see dead fish floating in their family fish farm.\n\nAccording to Zhou, the police didn't show her any documents authorizing their late-night search, as required by Chinese law. Hotels in China must register their guests' information with the police, and a hotel receptionist later told Zhou that the police had asked for her room card specifically.\n\n\"I finally have seen firsthand how lawless and unscrupulous the abuse of official power can be,\" she wrote. After the men left her room, she wrote that she sat for some time \"in a frightened daze.\"\n\nBoth Caixin and Zhou declined to comment.\n\nOther journalists rushed to support Zhou. Liang Yingfei, also a reporter at Caixin, wrote in a Tuesday blog post that she too had faced interference in the past. \"Reporters being 'accompanied' as they work seems to have become the new normal,\" she wrote.\n\nA commentator for CCTV state television, Lei Mu, jumped in, writing that \"the public has the right to know the truth\" about the chemical leak in Fujian. \"Damage to the credibility of the party and government organs caused by abuse of public power sometimes is far more profound than that caused by an accident.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Quanzhou police issued an apology and said one district police officer had been suspended.\n\n\"We have verified that the situation reflected by Comrade Zhou Chen is basically true,\" said the statement, which was published on a local Communist Party-run website. \"We sincerely apologize for this!\"\n\nOn social media, questions still swirled about who had authorized the search and whether the officer who was suspended was taking a fall for just following orders.\n\nThe Quanzhou police could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Kinetz on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/ekinetz"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "French troops deployed amid protests on Reunion island", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Joshi, an anthropology professor at Delhi University who has studied the islands. \"He invited that aggression.\"\n\nJoshi noted that the visit not only risked Chau's life, but also the lives of islanders who have little resistance to many diseases.\n\n\"They are not immune to anything. A simple thing like flu can kill them,\" he said.\n\nOn his first day Chau interacted with some tribesmen - who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants - until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. The 26-year-old self-styled adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to the fishermen's boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day, Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn't known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau's body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nPathak said seven people have been arrested for helping Chau, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau's and a local tourist guide.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can't be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said.\n\nHe also said the police were examining whether Chau had tried earlier to visit the isolated island.\n\nPathak said Chau and his accomplices planned well for last week's visit by \"camouflaging the visit as fishing.\"\n\nAlso, Chau appeared to be full of confidence as he wrote in his notes, \"God sheltered him from coastguard and Navy,\" he said.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \"beloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\" The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\"He ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\" the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed on another island while he prepared to travel to North Sentinel. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman islands in 2015 and 2016.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the island chain, where they broke the news to Chau's friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday. Another trip was planned Thursday.\n\nIndia has a hands-off approach to the island's people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nIndia recently changed some of its rules on visiting isolated regions in the Andamans. While special permits are required, scholars say visits are now theoretically allowed in some parts of the Andamans where they used to be entirely forbidden, including North Sentinel. Chau had no permit, police said.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Christianity with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\"He didn't go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\" Staver said.\n\nStaver said Chau's last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School.

She was chosen by Abiy to lead the election board after the two met during his recent visit to the United States, where in a series of enthusiastic meetings he encouraged people frustrated by previous administrations to come home. Lawmakers approved the pick on Thursday.\n\n\"Conducting a democratic election comes first, then winning comes next,\" Abiy told lawmakers. \"Conducting free and fair elections is the cornerstone for a democratic system.

Academics have attributed their absence since then to painful memories of the country's long right-wing dictatorship and the prominence of the conservative Popular Party across all the political space from center to right. Only more recently has the PP ceded ground to the Citizens party, a new center-right group that surged in popularity as an opposition to regionalist parties in Catalonia and other areas.\n\nBut some saw that barrier falling when Vox garnered a 1.4-percent share of votes in official polls last month, setting the four-year-old party on track to enter the lower house of parliament in general elections due before 2020.\n\n\"Even one seat would be enough to use it as a platform for our message to reach all Spaniards,\" Vox President Santiago Abascal told The Associated Press, outlining a plan to use a regional Andalusian election in 10 days' time and the European Parliament ballot in May next year as stepping stones.\n\n\"There is no such thing as the glass ceiling that many place upon us by saying we are on the fringes or political extremists,\" the 42-year-old Abascal added defiantly. \"We just defend what many families are discussing at the table but has become politically incorrect in the political arena.\"\n\nThe scion of a family targeted by the separatist militant group ETA in his native Basque region, Abascal refuses to waste time fending off criticism that he is a fascist, racist, fear-monger or far-right populist, all of which he dismisses as attempts to stigmatize his movement.\n\nVox politicians are frequently ridiculed by mainstream media for their defense of everything Spanish, from bullfighting to the monarchy, and nostalgia for historical events \u2014 such as the 15th-century ousting of Muslims from the Kingdom of Castile and the colonization of the American continent.\n\nSpeaking in Murcia to a packed auditorium of some 1,500 sympathizers, Abascal went one step further, urging \"rich Arabic countries\" to take in Muslim migrants \"who think like them and want to impose Islamic law.\"\n\n\"We will stand against them coming here to tell us that in our schools we can't eat ham,\" Abascal said, eliciting wide applause from the audience. Outside, police dispersed protesters waving rainbow flags and signs supporting gender equality.\n\nSpain's foreign population, which started growing at the turn of the century, now makes up 10 percent of the 46.7 million residents, with Moroccan, Romanian and British nationals topping the list.\n\nMuch like other populist leaders, Abascal proposes a weaker European Union where migration is controlled \"according to national economic interests and cultural proximity,\" which draws him to rule out \"Muslims who don't blend well with Europe's Judeo-Christian values.\"\n\n\"All the liberal-minded leftists already do it in their mansions. They first look through the peephole before opening the door,\" he said. \"We want to do the same in what is Spanish people's private property: our country.\"\n\nA 100-issue party manifesto begins by stating that the northeastern Catalonia region should lose its self-government after last year's attempt to split from Spain and that separatist parties should be outlawed. Vox also advocates changing laws on domestic violence and restricting abortion.\n\nBut their two flagship issues, a stronger hand on migration and the defense of Spain's unity, could also be Vox's main obstacle as it tries to grab a foothold, said Carmen Gonzalez, a researcher with the Elcano Royal Institute, an official think tank.\n\n\"These are policy proposals that other mainstream parties are already ready to execute,\" says Gonzalez, adding that polls show corruption, inequality and the future of pensions worry Spaniards more than migration does. \"Statistically speaking, the real source of votes in Spain is in the center.\"\n\nReporting about Vox has picked up in the media, however, and the party's propagandists have been skilled enough to magnify that attention using social media and messaging apps to stir debate and reach new constituents.\n\nIn a widely shared video last week, Abascal and a well-known bullfighter rode horses, accompanied an epic soundtrack. Some party leaders also earned fame two years ago by swimming back to Spain to escape arrest in the disputed British overseas territory of Gibraltar after raising a Spanish flag.\n\nOne of those, Vox's secretary general Javier Ortega, acted as a prosecuting lawyer in the judicial probe against the Catalans who organized an illegal independence referendum in October 2017.\n\nThat presence in the public sphere has helped earn Vox more than 16,000 paying members. Last week's rally sold out in Murcia, where Abascal's previous visit drew only enough people to fill the outdoor space of a coffee house.\n\nThe party says it has received separate invitations from the Europe of Nations and Freedom, the smallest group in the European Parliament, and the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, linked to the Republican Party in the United States.\n\nBut the party is finding it difficult to connect with other European peers because some of them have expressed sympathy for Catalan separatists, a no-go zone for Vox.\n\nNotes have been compared with Steve Bannon, but Abascal also doesn't plan for now to join the wide coalition of Euroskeptic movements led by the former White House adviser \u2014 even though U.S. President Donald J. Trump inspired the \"Make Spain great again\" slogan used by Vox in early campaigning.\n\n\"Our references are not international, because the issues that we fight for are national,\" said Abascal, who also is not concerned about voter mood changes over parties like his.\n\n\"Movements like ours,\" he said, \"are going to become permanent in Western societies.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Polish nun who rescued Jews during Holocaust dies at 110", "description": "Officials in Poland say a 110-year-old woman believed to be the world's oldest nun and a rescuer of Jews during the Holocaust, has died", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/polish-nun-rescued-jews-holocaust-dies-110-59358947", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T08:22:43Z", "content": "Officials in Poland say that a 110-year-old woman believed to be the world's oldest nun and a rescuer of Jews during the Holocaust, has died.

Lifeless, I couldn't move my head, arms, legs. Every time my legs would hit rocks I tried to kick up to have air, then swept in again. Reporter: What was supposed to be an idyllic destination bachelor party ahead of Beltran's upcoming wedding turned into a complete nightmare. The raft literally folded. It folded. In half? Just pulled us down from the suction of the water. Reporter: A trip to Costa Rica, including a much-anticipated rafting excursion, turned deadly after their rafts capsized, killing four friends. The groom's brother, Sergio Lorenzo. Jorge castle. Andreas Dennis, who they call Andy. I lost four brothers. All these guys -- You love them? Yeah. Reporter: Costa Rica lures tourists to its beautiful shores with promises of adventures like zip lining and river rafting. It's a place over 1 million U.S. Tourists visit annually, making up the majority of all visitors to Costa Rica. Was this a freak accident? Or was this something that could have been prevented? It absolutely could have been prevented. I mean, they could have told us, hey, there's flood warnings. Should never have been on this river. We literally didn't know better. Reporter: Their families are demanding answers and action, pleading with Costa rican authorities why the group was allowed to raft in such unsafe conditions. If they would have told us there's an alert, it would have been simple, there's an alert, let's go back. Reporter: On October 18th, when the men boarded their flight to Costa Rica, they say danger was the last thing on their minds. Multiple times during the trip, several of us was like, this is probably one of the best trips. It's been a little bit of a stressful year, so this was a big relief for me, especially spending with my friends. Reporter: It was the time of their lives. They were together on an adrenaline-fueled, fun-packed adventure. We had such a good time on the atv tour as a group. We all stopped and sat down, took off our helmets, everybody was like, wow what a rush. Reporter: Everything would change on that fateful last day of the trip. The group, excited as ever, arrive for a rafting excursion, guided by a local company on the popular Naranjo river. Bright and sunny, we didn't think there was rain. No sign. Reporter: That morning Costa rican authorities reported weather advisories and alerts, warnings the group says were never told to them by their tour guides. When you go on vacation, you don't really think that something's going to happen to you. You let your guard down. Yeah. You never think of anything like this happening. Neither did we. Reporter: They waited on shore several minutes. The tour guides delayed the launch of the rafts due to water levels. Suiting up. Raining. Kind of getting our stuff together, they told us we were going to have to wait. I guess the river was too high or something. To wait it out because it might have dropped or could drop within a couple of minutes. That's exactly what we did. We waited it out. They came back, they said, hey, we're ready to go. We said, okay, perfect. From your takeoff point you can't see. There's a section you see it was flat, but two minutes in, it's a big bank, past that bank also when we saw ultimately what we were going to go through. How many minutes were you inside the rafts before it took that turn and you all got into the water? Probably about three minutes, four minutes. Describe what happened next. Three, four minutes in? When I went in, it was just -- survival. Just try to get air in. You get sucked in. For me, every time my legs would hit rocks, I would try to kick up to grab air, you get swept in. Just survival. Reporter: The current was so strong it not only carried them downstream, it pulled them under. It was just trying to grab ahold of a rock or anything that was near us. All I remember is that once my brother was sitting behind me. When we hit the water, we went under together. And he was hanging on to my life vest. And I was kind of hanging on to him. And within the midst of everything, we slid from each other. Reporter: The men describe being swallowed up and spit out by the intense currents, blinded by the water. All of them say the river's currents were strong enough to rip their clothes and shoes off and leave them breathless. When I got to shore and I knew what I had gone through, I was very worried. A slim chance that all of us are going to be okay. Reporter: As they attempt to gather what little strength they have, the search begins to try and find each other. I was with Andy for most of the time. And most of my energy was helping Andy while I was in the water. He was on the raft while I was holding on to the raft. The raft flipped again. I never saw him again. I saw the authorities hold his chain in a bag. They wanted to keep it as evidence. And I literally got up and I -- I grabbed it from him. And I said, this is going to his soon to be -- to his fiancee. And I said, no -- they said, no, this is evidence. That's when I got full confirmation. When I saw his chain. Reporter: In all, five men lost their lives that day, including one of the rafting guides. Questions remain as to whether the rafting company was even accredited. The Costa rican health ministry responsible for issuing licenses to rafting companies tells ABC they can't comment because it's an open investigation. For some members of the group, including Marco Caso, the most devastating part was yet to come. Contacting the parents of those who were lost. First of all, the worst day of my life. The hardest thing I've ever done in my life was calling both of my families. Reporter: Janet Dennis lost the man she raised as a son, Andreas, Andy. She sit the families are far from having any answers as to what went wrong. To this day I don't have any answers. Little bits and pieces that you hear from the other boys. The injustice of no kind of safety measures. Reporter: While still grieving, the parents and survivors are adamant that new guidelines and rafting warnings be put in place for what has been a largely self-regulated industry. I want for the other mothers to know what really is going on there. The risk that they take when they do this kind of tourism. We want to get help from the U.S. Aid department to help us the best possible way. Reporter: Just today the state department confirms a section on adventure tourism was added to their website in response to this incident, providing tips for any tourists considering a visit to Costa Rica. Just a month after the tragedy, the trauma is still very real. Raise of hands. All who have had trouble sleeping? Raise of hands if you've had flashbacks of being under the water or trying to pull somebody from the water? Reporter: While fighting to erase the nightmare in their minds they go between sorrow and joy as they remember the four who didn't survive. We all lost a brother, a son, a friend, a cousin, a father. So it's -- it's something you don't see every day. Reporter: Sergio, the oldest of the group and the brother of the groom. He was just very humble. Very, very quiet, very to himself. You never heard him complain. Ernesto, a driven entrepreneur with big deeps. He made those dreams happen, he was something else. Reporter: Andy, described at everyone's best friend, was going to propose to his girlfriend after the trip. He had already planned to do it when we got back. It just didn't happen.

Police said the plot had been thwarted with the arrests.\n\nNine convicted extremists and Australians suspected to fighting with extremists overseas have had their Australian citizenships revoked since the government changed citizenship laws in 2015. The changes only apply to dual nationals so that losing Australian citizenship does not render a suspect stateless.\n\nThe proposed changes would further loosen the rules concerning the circumstances in which citizenship can be revoked. The amendments would do away with a requirement that a dual national convicted of a terrorism offense would need to be sentenced to at least six years in prison. The conviction itself would be enough to lose Australian citizenship.\n\nThe threshold for the government determining that an Australian was a dual national or entitled to citizenship of another country would also be lowered.\n\nMorrison said there would be \"no need to go around looking for paperwork\" to prove a second nationality.\n\nAustralia also plans to introduce a version of Britain's Temporary Exclusion Orders that were introduced in 2015 and can prevent British fighters from returning home from war zones for up to two years.\n\nUnder the Australian regime, Australian fighters who return home would have to comply with conditions such as reporting to police, curfews and restrictions on what technologies they can use.\n\nMorrison accepted that the Temporary Exclusion Orders legislation might not be passed into law until next year.\n\nMorrison's new drive against extremists has angered some Muslim community leaders.\n\nHe accused senior Muslim leaders on Wednesday of \"continuing down a path of denial\" after they refused an invitation to a meeting scheduled for Thursday to discuss the extremist threat.\n\nSome Australian Muslims were critical when Morrison said after the Somali-born Australian's rampage that \"radical, violent, extremist Islam\" posed the greatest threat to Australia's national security.\n\nThey felt the wider Muslim community had been blamed when Morrison said Islamic leaders \"must be proactive, they must be alert and they must call this out.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "WATCH: 11/21/18: Millions in Northeast bracing for record cold this Thanksgiving", "description": "World News Tonight with David Muir full episode recap: Trump fires back after rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts; Pilots reflect on rescuing people and dogs during California wildfires", "url": "https://abc.go.com/shows/world-news-tonight/episode-guide/2018-11/21-11-21-18-millions-in-northeast-bracing-for-record-cold-this-thanksgiving", "urlToImage": "https://cdn1.edgedatg.com/aws/v2/abcnews/WorldNews/video/9233/8a2a79ec0c34e8e7a949f2a33f45eed1/579x325-Q100_8a2a79ec0c34e8e7a949f2a33f45eed1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T05:37:06Z", "content": "Sign Out Are you sure you want to sign out?

Beside him, tango singer Alberto Castillo smiles, though he lacks arms.\n\nThe Argentine musical icons are in a hospital of a sort, where the 2,200 statues and monuments that dot Buenos Aires' parks and plazas are brought when they have suffered vandalism or decay.\n\nCity officials say about 20 pieces arrive each month \u2014 often dismembered, broken, sprayed with paint or stolen, either as collector's items or for scrap metal. Statues are sometimes damaged by angry protesters or toppled by people just for fun.\n\nAt the workshop, more than a dozen restorers repair stone and marble, clean away graffiti and mold missing appendages.\n\n\"We'd like to have less of this and focus only on preservation of outdoor works, restorations that would be due to age, and not to damage done intentionally,\" said Jorge Grimaz, who coordinates operations at the city's Monuments and Artworks shop.\n\nThe abundance of statuary and monuments, many acquired in France at the beginning of the 20th century, helps set the Argentine capital and set it apart from other Latin American cities. Pollution and the humidity of the Argentine capital located on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, affects the sculptures. But vandalism is by far their worst enemy.\n\nThe attacks on sculptures have increased as frustration simmers over Argentina's economic crisis.\n\nA copy of Auguste Rodin's \"The Thinker,\" located in the square in front of the Argentine Congress, has suffered the wrath of demonstrators who gather there to protest against politicians. The statue, cast in bronze from the original mold and signed by the French sculptor, was recently elevated on a pedestal to keep it away from the spray paint after a fence failed to safeguard it.\n\n\"We've had a lot of protests lately and the vandalism is on the rise,\" Grimaz said.\n\nEven a statue of Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi has been vandalized \u2014 twice. Last year, the bronze statue was first cut in half at the waist and later chopped off just above the ankles. A tennis racket was torn from the hands of a sculpture of Argentine tennis great Gabriela Sabatini in 2014.\n\nOther Argentine heroes and historical figures have suffered a similar fate.\n\nRevolutionary leader Martin Guemes was robbed of his bronze saber, so restorers at the workshop recently poured polyester resin into a rubber mold inside a plaster box to craft a replacement.\n\nThe shelves behind them held dozens of heads, hands and other appendages awaiting attachment to damaged monuments. The head of Chile's Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda was covered on a stand near the head of former Argentine President Juan Peron.\n\nA monument to South American independence leader Simon Bolivar has been sprayed so many times with graffiti that restorers have to clean it every 15 days.\n\nThe bronze pieces in a reproduction of \"The She-Wolf\" sculpture depicting the mythical founding of Rome, with Romulus and Remus, were stolen and have been replaced by polyester resin that has no resale value.\n\nThe marble horns of two deer in a marble statue of the goddess Diana were broken off by straining dogs that had been leashed to them.\n\nOnly one figure seems to be sacred and off limits to everyone: Mother Teresa. A sculpture of the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Calcutta stands at Lezama park in Buenos Aires.\n\n\"They've never touched it,\" said Grimaz. \"More than 10 years ago have passed and there's not a single work of art in that park that has not been at least stained with graffiti.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Nissan board to decide on dismissing Ghosn as chairman", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Japan as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Japan news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nNissan Motor Co. fired Carlos Ghosn as chairman Thursday, curtailing the powerful executive's nearly two-decade reign at the Japanese automaker after his arrest for alleged financial improprieties.\n\nIn an hourslong meeting, the company's board of directors voted unanimously to dismiss Ghosn as chairman and as a representative director, Nissan said in a statement. It said its own internal investigation, prompted by a whistleblower, found serious misconduct including under-reporting of his income and misuse of company assets.\n\nIt was a stunning downfall for one of the biggest figures in the auto industry. Ghosn had helped drive turnarounds at both France's Renault SA and at Nissan and then managed an alliance between them that sold 10.6 million cars last year, besting its rivals.\n\nRenault is still reeling from Ghosn's Monday arrest, and its share price has yet to recover. Its acting chief, Deputy CEO Thierry Bollore, spoke publicly Thursday night for the first time since Ghosn was sidelined, and sought to soothe markets, car buyers and his employees by promising continuity.\n\nIn a video released by Renault, Bollore said the carmaker still plans to release several new models next year. Acknowledging the \"particular situation\" the company is in, he pledged his \"full commitment\" to Renault's 180,000 workers and its partners and customers. Renault's board decided not to fire Ghosn, instead installing temporary leadership.\n\nThe French government, which owns 15 percent of Renault, is also worried. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday that France has yet to receive information from Japan about what Ghosn is accused of and insisted on \"respect for the presumption of innocence.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Associated Press, Le Maire said \"this turbulence shouldn't weaken\" the Renault-Nissan alliance or its hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nNissan said in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock Exchange that its investigation uncovered misuse of company investment funds and expense money for personal gain.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing an anonymous source close to Nissan's investigation, reported that Ghosn used company funds to buy personal residences and enrich his sister.\n\nAnother Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, was arrested in Japan on suspicion of collaborating in the wrongdoing and also will be dismissed as a representative director, Nissan said. Their replacements will be decided later, it said.\n\nGhosn, 64, is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to Tokyo prosecutors.\n\nNissan's board consists of nine members, including Ghosn and Greg Kelly. The seven other board members voted at the meeting, including two members from Nissan and two from Renault.\n\nGhosn and Kelly will remain on Nissan's board for now as that decision will be up to shareholders. No date has been set yet for a shareholders meeting.\n\nGhosn is also chairman at Mitsubishi Motors Corp., a smaller Japanese automaker that's partnering with the Renault-Nissan alliance and plans to hold a board meeting next week.\n\nHe has been held since his arrest Monday at a Tokyo detention center, under the same Spartan conditions as other detainees, Tokyo deputy prosecutor Shin Kukimoto told reporters Thursday. He gave few details about the case.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither has been charged so far.\n\nThe maximum penalty upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nA French citizen born in Brazil, Ghosn became something of a corporate superstar in Japan as he led Nissan's revival from near bankruptcy after Renault sent him to help in 1999.\n\nGhosn served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two automakers simultaneously. In 2016, he also became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan, maker of the Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models, in the U.S. in 1988. He became a board member in 2012. His background is in human resources and alliance management.\n\nAnalysts say the future of Nissan's alliance with Renault may be at stake, though Nissan's statement Thursday said the company's leadership was determined to minimize the impact from Ghosn's case on the partnership. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, and Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault.\n\nThe economy ministers of Japan and France met in Paris on Thursday to discuss the issue and released a statement saying both sides are committed to supporting the alliance.\n\nNissan said its board will study setting up a third-party committee to beef up governance in management and compensation at Nissan.\n\nJanet Lewis, managing director and head of industrial research, Asia, at Macquarie Capital Securities in Tokyo, said in an interview that an adjustment was needed to give Nissan more say in the alliance with Renault.\n\nThe partnership remains crucial for both companies, she said, since apart from financial ties the companies share technology and parts. The automakers need to be more like roommates than a married couple, she said.\n\n\"So they have to find a way to share their house and share all of their expertise because it's very necessary in terms of new automotive technology, new platform development,\" Lewis said. \"They need to figure out how they can continue this and still live happily together in the same house.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Dolce&Gabbana accused of insulting China; blames hackers", "description": "Dolce&Gabbana has apologized for insulting remarks about China it allegedly made in exchanges on Instagram but denied that it was responsible", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dolcegabbana-accused-insulting-china-blames-hackers-59356706", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_8e22e8d2c04c41fda1e0997a5b436e2f_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T04:19:29Z", "content": "The Italian luxury fashion house Dolce&amp;Gabbana apologized Wednesday for insulting remarks about China it allegedly made in exchanges on Instagram but claimed its accounts had been hacked.

I'm sorry for what happened.\"\n\nThe three promotional videos, which have been deleted from the company's Weibo account, feature a Chinese woman using chopsticks to eat pizza and other Italian food. Many Chinese social media users called the videos racist and full of outdated stereotypes.\n\nIn a statement from Milan headquarters, designers Gabbana and Domenico Dolce said, \"What happened today was very unfortunate not only for us, but also for all the people who worked day and night to bring this event to life.\"\n\nThe Shanghai extravaganza was to include 300 models previewing a new collection on a rotating stage, including super model Eva Herzigova and Isabella Fontana during a brand DNA section, and a lineup of millennial stars and influencers for a second section dedicated to the future. The final part of the show was to be dedicated to Asia, with Asian models and a front row of Asian stars among the 1,000 invited guests, including actor Darren Wang, actor Jing Kang Liang, singer Stan Young and actress Bing Bing Lee, along with Wang and Zhang.\n\nAsia, and China in particular, is key to European luxury brands' success. A recent study by Bain consultancy said one-third of all high-end purchases are made by Chinese consumers, shopping both at home and abroad.

They found that imagining a threatening scenario might provide similar benefits to exposure therapy for someone who has been through a traumatic event.\n\nThe researchers hope to use this knowledge to improve treatments for people with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.\n\nThe \u201cunlearning\u201d is key in this research. In a dangerous situation, the natural \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response sends hearts pounding and adrenaline coursing. But some people continue to have the same stress response to smaller events, even when the threat has long passed. It\u2019s tough to unlearn this.\n\nWhat is a Stress Disorder?\n\nA stress disorder is a constellation of symptoms that a person experiences after a traumatic event. These experiences can be anything from fighting in a war to being in a car crash, and the responses can range from an acute stress disorder to its more severe counterpart, PTSD.\n\nAcute stress disorder often occurs soon after a traumatic event. It can cause a person to feel \u201cnumb\u201d to what\u2019s around them, to have frequent thoughts about the trauma, to actively avoid things that remind them of the stress and to have constant feelings of nervousness. When these feelings persist beyond one month, they are defined as PTSD. Both disorders can significantly affect quality of life.\n\nHow are stress disorders treated?\n\nPsychologists use a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and prolonged exposure therapy (PET).\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is talk therapy. It helps you learn ways of thinking that focus on positive aspects of yourself and what is around you. Exposure therapy involves repeatedly putting someone into a situation that causes them fear and anxiety, as the brain teaches itself that no harm occurs.\n\nExposure therapy can eventually help a person feel more comfortable in a situation. For example, if someone fell down a floor stairs and developed an acute stress reaction, exposure therapy might mean repeatedly walking up and down flights of stairs.\n\nSometimes, however, exposing a patient to the scenario that elicits the stress response can be difficult or even unethical, such as being in a warzone. The new study sought to prove that imagining a scenario can be just as effective as re-experiencing it.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nWhy is this study important?\n\nWhile this technique has been used by psychologists for some time now, this is the first study to confirm the results through brain imaging.\n\nThe fearful situation creates \u201ca threat signature\u201d in the brain, Daniela Schiller, PhD, professor of neuroscience and psychiatry and senior author of the paper, told ABC News. Essentially, it\u2019s a neurological pattern that reoccurs whenever a person feels threatened.\n\nFor the study, the researchers exposed 68 adults to small but uncomfortable electric shocks that alway came with a specific sound. Then they split the participants into three separate groups: one that would imagine the specific sound (imagined re-exposure), one that would actually hear the sound (actual re-exposure) and one that would think of their own peaceful sounds, like birds chirping or falling rain (the control group).\n\nThe researchers took brain scans as the participants thought about their sounds. They found that imagined thoughts and real-life exposure were equally effective in reducing the brain\u2019s threat-related responses because they made use of the same brain pathways.\n\nThe new findings bridge a gap between what psychologists do in the office and what researchers do in the lab \u2014 they are a confirmation that the brain patterns we use when we imagine things have a direct effect on how we act in the future.\n\nThough further research is necessary, Schiller told ABC News that the findings open the door to new avenues for treating stress-related disorders. That \u201cthreat signature\u201d will be a new target for measuring the effectiveness of different therapies, she said, allowing psychologists to individualize therapy and maximize effectiveness.\n\nDr. Sumir Shah is an emergency medicine physician in New York City and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Morgan Winsor", "title": "California wildfires death toll reaches 86, with more than 500 still unaccounted for", "description": "Hundreds of people remain missing in the wake of a pair of deadly wildfires that have been burning across both ends of California.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/relentless-california-wildfires-leave-86-dead-500-unaccounted/story?id=59262994", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/california-northern-fire8-ap-ml-181117_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T02:18:42Z", "content": "Hundreds of people remain missing in the wake of a pair of deadly wildfires that have been burning across both ends of California.

President trump now doubling down on his attack. Here's ABC's senior white house correspondent Cecilia Vega. Reporter: Tonight, an extraordinary rebuke of the president from the supreme court's chief justice. It came after president trump lashed out at an obama-appointed judge from the 9th circuit court of appeals, who temporarily blocked his plan to crack down on asylum seekers. Well, you go to the 9th circuit and it's a disgrace, and I'm going to put in a major complaint, because you cannot win, if you're us, a case in the 9th circuit. This was an Obama judge. And I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen like this anymore. Reporter: That triggered a rare reprimand from chief justice John Roberts. He wrote, \"We do not have Obama judges or trump judges, bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" And on this Thanksgiving eve, he added, \"That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\" Late today, president trump fired right back, tweeting, \"Sorry chief justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \"Obama judges,\" and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. These rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\" President trump says he'll appeal his eye sigh lum plan, all the way to the supreme court. As for those 5,800 troops deployed to the border this Thanksgiving, the president told ABC's Karen Travers -- Don't worry about the Thanksgiving. These are tough people. They know what they're doing and they're great and they've done a great job. You're so worried about the Thanksgiving holiday for them. They are so proud to be representing our country on the border.

A former finance minister says the country is on the brink of an \"economic anarchy.\"\n\nWelcome to Sri Lanka, where the political crisis is getting worse by the week.\n\nThe trouble started when President Maithripala Sirisena, fed up with disagreements with his prime minister over money, an alleged conspiracy plot and unresolved issues of wartime crimes against civilians, fired Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet and replaced them with a government headed by a popular former strongman, Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nBut lawmakers balked and twice passed a no-confidence motion. Sirisena, however, refuses to accept that his choice of prime minister has been defeated.\n\nJehan Perera, head of the local analyst group National Peace Council, said that the government appointed by the president can't be called legal because Sirisena had not sought a parliamentary vote when he dismissed Wickremesinghe.\n\n\"It can be called illegitimate because provisions for a confidence vote in Parliament are being blocked by the president's own party through their riotous behavior,\" Perera said, referring to a brawl last week that was followed by another pandemonium in the chamber when Rajapaksa loyalists refused to let the speaker conduct proceedings.\n\nWickremesinghe says his dismissal is invalid because he still holds a majority in the 225-member Parliament. The dismissal is also disputed because of a latest constitutional change, which lawyers say has taken away presidential powers to dismiss the prime minister.\n\nDespite all the drama and two rival prime ministers, life hasn't collapsed \u2014 thanks to the efficient bureaucracy that keeps the wheels of administration turning.\n\nEven though there is no Cabinet recognized by Parliament, and despite warnings by Wickremesinghe supporters that state officials should not take orders from an \"illegal government\" of Rajapaksa, bureaucrats continue to work with the president who is the chief executive and the ministers appointed by him, officials said on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nHowever, decisions regarding new projects or purchases involving large sums of money are on hold.\n\nThe absence of a recognized government has delayed the budget for 2019. Mangala Samaraweera, who was finance minister in Wickremesinghe's Cabinet, said that there will be no legal way of spending money in the coming year without a parliament-approved budget.\n\nSri Lanka's Constitution says that control over public finances lies with Parliament and no funds can be released without a warrant signed by the finance minister and approved by the legislature. That means all government payments starting from January can be deemed illegal, Samaraweera says.\n\nSri Lanka is on the brink of an \"economic anarchy and chaos as never experienced before.\"\n\n\"The cavalier and irresponsible actions of the president ... based on personal animosities and precipitating a series of illegal acts, places at risk Sri Lanka's ability to meet its immediate debt obligations,\" he said.\n\nSri Lanka has to repay $1 billion of its foreign loans in early January, which is also in the prerogative of Parliament to approve.\n\nWickremesinghe's lawmakers have presented a motion to the speaker seeking to block funding to the prime minister's office, which if passed, would curtail Rajapaksa's functions.\n\n\"As far as the people are concerned, they are witnessing the normal functioning of the country,\" insisted government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella.\n\nHowever, he conceded that Sri Lanka will have issues on accessing government money if the stalemate is not resolved by the end of the year. Sirisena called snap elections for Jan. 5, but the opposition challenged the decision, and the dispute is in court."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Millions in Northeast bracing for record cold this Thanksgiving", "description": "Temperatures will take a plunge with wind chills falling below zero in some areas and the West is facing three days of rain.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/millions-northeast-bracing-record-cold-thanksgiving-59353297", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/181121_wnt_zee_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T01:05:52Z", "content": "Now Playing: Turbulent weather pattern expected to bring severe weather Now Playing: Winter weather turns deadly Now Playing: Millions in Northeast bracing for record cold this Thanksgiving Now Playing: Trump's Thanksgiving Now Playing: Fatal crash on New Yor\u2026 [+1201 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Millions in Northeast bracing for record cold this Thanksgiving\n\nAnd this Thanksgiving, people are bracing for an arctic blast and record cold in the northeast.

Because the pair didn\u2019t have a rescue team, they would be forced to land their multi-ton helicopter on that peak.\n\nDavid Nordquist/Los Angeles Fire Department via AP\n\nWhen he and Smith reached the area, Nordquist said he saw lots of smoke as well as some people and dogs on a mountain peak. Nordquist said the blaze was moving in the direction of the peak where the people were located -- and the entire area was engulfed in smoke.\n\n\"We saw that they were inside of a paved area that was fenced in. ... We first tried to land in the area but it just didn't, it wasn't working for us so we took the next best thing and landed outside of it,\" Nordquist said.\n\nAfter Nordquist landed the helicopter, Smith jumped out.\n\n\"Given the rate of [fire] spread that we saw -- and the best judgment call that I could make -- we probably had another five minutes to get the people out before it burned over the top,\" Smith told ABC News on Wednesday. \"There was really nowhere to run, nowhere to go for these people.\"\n\nWhen Smith reached a woman and her dog, he said she appeared a bit confused and in shock, seeing a pilot and helicopter landing near them.\n\n\"I don't think they realized how close the fire was to be honest with you. ...

Your ride's leaving and we gotta go right now,'\" he said. For a few seconds, the mastiff refused to budge. They had to shove him aboard.\n\nThe two pilots said Wednesday that they'd heard reports that the fire had burned over the mountain peak almost 10 minutes after they'd left.\n\nThe two never got the names of their passengers; they simple dropped them off and headed back to fight the fire.\n\n\"God bless that we were in the right place at the right time,\" Smith said.\n\nBrian Humphrey, a spokesman for the LAFD, said neither the people nor the dogs were hurt, according to The Associated Press."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Colombia tries quashing tensions at migrant camp with soccer", "description": "Colombian officials are hoping to help ease tensions at a Venezuelan migrant camp with a game both new arrivals and their hosts share a passion for: soccer", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/colombia-quashing-tensions-migrant-camp-soccer-59348700", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_9b93d9c9d14b4b6fa83fb58421b5ad48_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T00:41:05Z", "content": "Colombian officials are hoping to quash tensions at a Venezuelan migrant camp with a game both the new arrivals and their hosts share a passion for: soccer.

But after several hundred homeless migrants set up an informal encampment in a park outside a bus terminal in Bogota, officials decided that offering tents and services was a better alternative.\n\nSome neighbors disagreed.

His earlier films (\"The Lobster,\" ''The Killing of a Sacred Deer,\" ''Dogtooth\") were intentionally performed in a flat, emotionless manner that seldom rose above an awkward monotone.\n\nBut the brisker \"The Favourite\" is, to a degree, a departure for Lanthimos who this time is working from a script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara instead of his usual collaborator, Efthimis Filippou. \"The Favourite\" is no less vicious or pitiless than their previous films, nor does Lanthimos (surprise, surprise) find the customs of early 1700s English royals any less grotesque than the contemporary norms he's so savagely satirized before.\n\nYet \"The Favourite,\" a kind of \"All About Eve\" translated into a triangular power struggle in Queen Anne's court, is indeed a riot, albeit a frigid and disquieting one. And it's not just because Lanthimos favors anachronism over historical accuracy. (Both modern-day slang and dance moves make cameos.) It's the pleasure of seeing three of the finest actresses weave between one another in ever more absurd acts of seduction and betrayal.\n\nIn a rickety and crowded carriage, we arrive in Queen Anne's court with Abigail (Stone), a distant relative of the queen who, having been lost by her father in a game of cards, has slipped out of the nobility. She's desperate to restore her standing with a position in the royal household, and after initially being sent to scrub floors, the Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah Churchill (Weisz), takes her on a chambermaid.\n\nOur glimpses of Abigail's so-called \"diminished circumstances\" (including more than one face-first pushes into the mud) are vivid enough to earn our sympathies and warrant her increasingly cold-blooded tactics for elevation. In one of many such transactional exchanges, Abigail allows a more high-born man into her chamber at night and asks if he's there to rape her or seduce her. \"I'm a gentleman,\" he defensively protests. \"Rape then,\" she matter-of-factly replies.\n\nThrough cunning, blackmail and flattery, Abigail soon has the ear of Queen Anne (Colman), not to mention her bed, a newfound status at odds with the queen's previous confidante and lover, Sarah. Weisz's duchess is using her position with the queen to extend the war with France, and her methods of manipulation are far more aggressively controlling. But they are also more straightforward than Abigail's hollow appeasements. In one scene, Sarah deters Anne from a meeting with the prime minister by holding up a mirror to her make-up-caked face: \"You look like a badger.\" As Abigail emerges as a rival, Sarah, icy and formidable, doesn't shy away from the fight. \"I have a thing for the weak,\" she says.\n\nThrough wide-angled and fish-eye lenses Lanthimos tracks the three-sided drama, pulling it toward its most primal expressions. These characters may live in lavish opulence but beneath their powdered faces they are primitive and power hungry. So Lanthimos lingers on a surreal slow-motion duck race down a palace hall and the agony of Anne's gout, scored with an eerie single piano note and a scratchy violin.\n\nMuch of \"The Favourite\" is caustically clever but it's Colman who elevates it to something magnificent. Her Anne is a glorious and sad ruin of a queen, a woman wrecked by time and heartache. (She keeps 18 bunnies, one for each child that didn't live.) Her interest in keeping up with her royal duties has comically disintegrated. In her flowing gowns, she's like a puddle. Weepy and lonely, she's torn between her suitors.\n\nWith its spurts of violence, splashes of blood and cynical sexual encounters, \"The Favourite\" is, oddly enough, about love. In their opposite ways, Sarah and Abigail offer a melancholy dichotomy: Love is either flattery and false, or honest and abusive.\n\nIn other words, the only true love is telling someone they look like a badger.\n\n\"The Favourite,\" a Fox Searchlight release, is rated R for strong sexual content, nudity and language. Running time: 120 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMPAA Definition of PG: Restricted.
