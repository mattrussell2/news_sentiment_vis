The state's voters legalized the use of recreational marijuana by adults 21 and older in 2016, but it's taken more than two years for state legislators and regulators to reach the point where the first stores can finally open.\n\nThe target date for retail sales had been July 1.\n\nThe \"commence operations\" notice from regulators requires the stores to wait three days before opening so they can coordinate with local officials and law enforcement. The openings are expected to draw big crowds, based on the experiences of other legal U.S. states and Canada when they first launched recreational sales.\n\nThe Northampton store, operated by New England Treatment Access, said it would open for recreational sales at 8 a.m. on Tuesday. Cultivate Holdings, which operates the Leicester store, said its doors would open at 10 a.m. the same day.\n\n\"This signal to open retail marijuana establishments marks a major milestone for voters who approved legal, adult-use cannabis in our state,\" said Steven Hoffman, chairman of the cannabis panel, in a statement. \"To get here, licensees underwent thorough background checks, passed multiple inspections and had their products tested, all to ensure public health and safety as this new industry gets up and running.\"\n\nLegal marijuana advocates, who had complained about the slow pace of regulatory approvals in the state, cheered the news Friday.\n\n\"We can rightfully squawk about state delays and problematic local opposition, but the fact remains that we're the first state east of the Mississippi to offer legal, tested cannabis to adult consumers in safe retail settings,\" said Jim Borghesani, a spokesman for the group that led the ballot question to legalize recreational pot.\n\nBorghesani called it a \"historic distinction\" for Massachusetts.\n\nRecreational marijuana is currently sold in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, California and Nevada. Maine voters also approved a legalization question in 2016, but stores in that state are not expected to open until next year at the earliest.\n\nThe first Massachusetts stores are in the central and western part of the state, but there are currently no stores approved to open in the greater Boston area. That means that, for now, more than half of the state's population will not have easy access to recreational marijuana.\n\nMany cities and towns in Massachusetts have resisted cannabis businesses, with some imposing outright bans and others making it difficult through zoning restrictions or other conditions.\n\nThe stores opening next week currently operate as medical marijuana dispensaries and have pledged to continue serving their registered patients.\n\nNew England Treatment Access \"looks forward to providing legal marijuana to our customers, but we want our patients to know that we will never waver from our commitment to them and their needs,\" said Norton Albaraez, a spokesman for the company.\n\nThe store has a separate area for medical marijuana patients, and they will not have to wait in the same lines with recreational customers to enter the facility.\n\nThe company has already had ongoing discussions with local officials about traffic, parking and other public safety issues and is confident of a smooth opening, Albaraez added."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Retired Justice Alan Page: The White House 'is the people's house'", "description": "Former Minnesota Viking and state Justice Alan Page receives Medal of Freedom.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/retired-justice-alan-page-white-house-peoples-house-59253693", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181116_tbr_page_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:33:42Z", "content": "Now Playing: Trump awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth and more Now Playing: Ellen DeGeneres Receives Presidential Medal of Freedom Now Playing: Retired Justice Alan Page: The White House 'is the people's house' Now Playing: S\u2026 [+1186 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Retired Justice Alan Page: The White House 'is the people's house'\n\nYou've been honored by the president today not just for your success on the Plainfield your of course.

Colombia is grappling with a mass influx of Venezuelans fleeing the economic collapse in their neighboring homeland, and it's under pressure from the U.S. to reverse a boom in coca growing that has put output of the main ingredient for cocaine at record levels.\n\nDuque has seen his approval ratings slump, which could further undermine his ability to push his political and economic agenda. A recent poll said only 27 percent of Colombians approve of Duque's administration, down from 52 percent in August.\n\n\"So far he hasn't been able to keep anybody happy,\" said Sergio Guzman, a political risk consultant in Bogota. \"I think he must be realizing that governing this country is very difficult.\"\n\nThe administration has been most recently targeted by a wave of student protests that have disrupted life in Colombia's main cities and led to sporadic clashes with police. Student unions are demanding the government spend at least $1.5 billion on public universities that have seen enrollment quadruple over the past two decades.\n\nDuque has so far promised only a third of that amount, saying the government has no more resources available.\n\nTo raise more funds for education and social programs, Duque has proposed a 19 percent value added tax on staple goods such as eggs and milk. That is part of a broader tax measure that also would raise taxes on large inheritances and decrease the income tax for small businesses in a bid to generate more formal jobs.\n\nThe president's own party, the Democratic Center, has opposed the bill, saying taxing food staples could hurt the middle class. It leaves him without enough congressional support to pass the measure.\n\n\"We have to strengthen our work in congress,\" Duque said Friday during an interview with Colombia's BLU radio. He also called on politicians to avoid populist tactics and to engage in a \"reasonable\" discussion of the tax bill.\n\nDuque's administration has also been off to a rocky start in the countryside, where violence is on the rise in some areas that were formerly controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which has demobilized under a peace accord to end five decades of civil conflict.\n\nAccording to a report published Friday by the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank, 36 human rights leaders were killed in Colombia during the past three months, twice as many as in the same period last year. The number of people displaced by armed conflict increased by 20 percent, it said.\n\nMuch of the violence is happening in areas that are now under the influence of the National Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that hasn't made peace with Colombia's government.\n\nPeace talks with the group have been suspended under the Duque administration, which has said it will negotiate with the rebels only if they stop conducting kidnappings and staging attacks on the military.\n\nJuan Carlos Garzon, a conflict analyst at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, said Duque will have a hard time resuming the negotiations. His party is demanding tougher conditions for talks, including the withdrawal of amnesty for rebels who have been involved in drug trafficking.\n\n\"Duque was elected by people who were critical of the previous peace process with the FARC,\" Garzon said. \"But now that he is in power he has also realized that he must defend and pursue a peace process that is widely backed by the international community.\"\n\nDuque has acknowledged that many of his political proposals have been controversial. But on Friday he urged Colombians to be patient.\n\n\"I want the country to know that I will work each day to win the peoples' hearts,\" he told Blu Radio. \"And I want to prove that we are capable of transforming our realities.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Abrams would have made history as the state's first African-American chief executive", "description": "Abrams would have made history as the state's first African-American chief executive", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/abrams-made-history-states-african-american-chief-executive-59255067", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181116_wabc_staceyabrams_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:04:21Z", "content": "Now Playing: Who is Stacey Abrams?

Attorneys in that case, which was brought by a man fighting a subpoena from special counsel Robert Mueller, are scheduled to have briefs filed to the court by Monday.\n\nTom Williams/Roll Call via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in the pending appeal \u2026 may directly impact the validity of Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s prosecution and conviction,\u201d his lawyers argue. \u201cIf the appeal is successful, then the Special Counsel lacked constitutional authority to prosecute Mr. Papadopoulos in the first instance.\u201d\n\nGiven that the appeals case has already been argued and is awaiting a ruling, the Papadopoulos filing argues, \u201ca modest stay of his incarceration pending the outcome of that appeal should be granted.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old energy scholar, who in 2016 attempted his foray into electoral politics with the Trump campaign, was one of the first to be swept into Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. In 2017, he admitted to lying to federal investigators and agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation. In September, Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in prison \u2013 with the government arguing that he had not delivered the level of cooperation they had anticipated.\n\nPapadopoulos was contrite at sentencing, telling a judge he felt remorse for lying to federal agents. In recent weeks, though, he has been making increasingly strident public comments in social media and in television appearances challenging the case against him. In late October, he appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d and said he was \u201cactually even considering withdrawing my agreement I have come to with the government.\u201d\n\nThe case Papadopoulos is now looking to was brought by Andrew Miller, a former associate of Trump confidant and political provocateur Roger Stone, who has refused a demand from prosecutors to appear before a grand jury. Miller is objecting, his lawyers said, in order to mount a broad legal challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe.\n\nMiller\u2019s attorney, Paul Kamenar, told ABC News in August that he believes Miller\u2019s constitutional battle could head all the way to the Supreme Court. He has argued that Mueller was not a constitutionally valid special counsel because he should be considered a \u201cprincipal officer of the United States,\u201d and therefore should have been appointed by the president. The Department of Justice has taken the position that he is an \u201cinferior\u201d officer who could be appointed by a deputy, in this case, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nTo date, Miller\u2019s argument has not carried the day. Attorneys for Miller tried unsuccessfully two times in July to quash a subpoena requiring Miller to testify before the special counsel's grand jury, arguing that Mueller lacked the constitutional authority to issue it.\n\nOn Friday, Miller\u2019s lawyer expressed surprise that Papadopoulos had sought to tie his fate to the Miller appeal.\n\n\"The motion makes a compelling case relying on the arguments of our briefing that a short stay of sentence is warranted. However, the judge has broad discretion in sentencing matters,\" Kamenar said.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nA judge has asked the special counsel to file its response to the Papadopoulos request by Wednesday."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "NYPD ousts sex crimes chief who led Weinstein investigation", "description": "The police commander who led the effort to arrest Harvey Weinstein has been removed as the chief of New York City's special victims division", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nypd-ousts-sex-crimes-chief-led-weinstein-investigation-59252210", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_e177adf70cce4c3592f549a4c92e3d3e_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:10:14Z", "content": "The police commander who led the effort to arrest Harvey Weinstein has been removed as the chief of New York City's special victims division, part of a shake-up that was months in the making after a city watchdog found the unit was stretched too thin to prope\u2026 [+4332 chars]", "fulltext": "The police commander who led the effort to arrest Harvey Weinstein has been removed as the chief of New York City's special victims division, part of a shake-up that was months in the making after a city watchdog found the unit was stretched too thin to properly investigate sexual assault cases.\n\nDeputy Chief Michael Osgood, whose final weeks were marred by allegations that a top detective had compromised the Weinstein case, will take on a leadership role in Staten Island. Deputy Chief Judith Harrison takes over the special victims division, the police department announced Friday.\n\n\"If we can get better, we will get better,\" Harrison said.\n\nPolice Commissioner James O'Neill signaled changes were coming back in April when he pledged a \"top-to-bottom scrub\" of the unit after a report by the city's Department of Investigation showed that the sex crimes caseload had ballooned by 65 percent since 2009, but staffing levels were nearly unchanged.\n\nDepartment memos included in the report showed that Osgood had been asking for more staff for at least four years. He had also requested additional training for detectives and recommended starting a cold case squad.\n\nThe police department review was just wrapping up last month when evidence surfaced that Det. Nicholas DiGaudio, whom Osgood worked closely with on the Weinstein case, had coached a witness and told one of the movie producer's accusers to delete material from her cellphone. Weinstein's lawyers said last week that they want to question Osgood in court about DiGaudio's conduct.\n\nDiGaudio's alleged coaching led prosecutors to drop one of Weinstein's charges. Afterward, police said he was no longer involved in the case. His union has said he \"was simply trying to get to the truth\" and wasn't trying to influence the investigation.\n\nWeinstein denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nChief of Detectives Dermot Shea, who led the police review of the special victims division, thanked Osgood for his \"dedication and tremendous contributions\" in his eight years in charge of the unit.\n\nThe head of Osgood's union said he was \"not just the expert, but the innovative creator of modern day investigative techniques and policing of sex crimes offenses.\"\n\nRoy Richter, the president of the Captains Endowment Association, said Harrison is a talented commander and that he is \"confident she will meet this challenge as she has excelled with others in the past.\"\n\nHarrison, a 21-year member of the NYPD, has been a precinct commander in Queens and led patrol units in the neighborhoods near LaGuardia Airport. She was promoted in July to deputy chief and was assigned to the detective bureau, which oversees the special victims division.\n\nAs she takes over, the division is being streamlined into two squads \u2014 one focusing on crimes against adults and the other on child abuse. The hate crimes unit, which had been a part of the special victims division, is being moved to the special investigations division, which includes the computer crimes and major case squads.\n\nThe Department of Investigation report, issued in late March, found there were just 67 special victims detectives for a caseload of 5,661 suspected attacks last year, leaving the bulk of assault cases to precinct-level detectives who had less training and experience dealing with victims. As a result, police prioritized stranger rapes while sexual assaults committed by acquaintances received less attention.\n\nSince then, the NYPD has transferred about three dozen investigators into the special victims division, freed up about a dozen more to handle cases and, as of July, is requiring that unit detectives investigate all felony sex crimes.\n\nThe added staffing has dropped the average caseload from 76.5 per detective at the end of 2017 to 63.7, and it's projected to fall further next year even if reports of sexual assaults continue to trend upward, the department said.\n\nThe department, criticized in the report for re-traumatizing victims and jeopardizing prosecutions, accelerated a program to train all special-victims investigators in interview techniques that are meant to be more compassionate and understanding than typical questioning. It's also heeding a recommendation in the report to repair police facilities to make victims more comfortable.\n\n\"We are deeply committed to doing everything and anything necessary to ensure survivors feel the safety and support needed to come forward, bravely share their experiences, and help the NYPD bring to justice those who have committed these horrific crimes,\" Shea said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: A mother's decision to donate son's face: How doctors approach, support families", "description": "Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, a renowned reconstructive surgeon at NYU Langone Health who performs face transplant surgeries, shares how 3-D printing of the donor's face is used to help the family cope.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/mothers-decision-donate-sons-face-doctors-approach-support-59253776", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/181116_2020_face_donation_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:06:34Z", "content": "Now Playing: The emotional moment face transplant recipient thanks his donor's mom Now Playing: A mother's decision to donate son's face: How doctors approach, support families Now Playing: Michelle Obama reflects on what she wants her legacy to be: Part 6 No\u2026 [+1409 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for A mother's decision to donate son's face: How doctors approach, support families\n\nIt's just such a loss.

Over the case correct when we look at individuals that have actually been an open casket most of them there's some change in their. Physical elements of their face. The 3-D mask is far superior.

Join us here in the briefing here at ABC news on Devin Dwyer great to have Catherine folders with us White House correspondent term Palmieri. I'm oddities to get to the president making some headlines this morning announcing for the first time that he has now officially answered. Questions from special counsel Robert Mueller that is a very significant development of course the president. Has kept if you're Bob Mahler sort of waiting for several months is this team is negotiated the terms of those are questions we understand though that he has answered a number of them in writing. Here's what he had to say just a little while ago when asked why what his answer said Nicholas. As I write answers. I was asked a series of questions have been answered the very easily. Worth so much. I'm sure they're tricked up because you know they like to get people he's beautiful weather sunny it was a rainy. Instead it may have been a good day it was ready therefore he told a lie he perjured himself. OK so again have to always be careful what you answer questions with people that probably have bad intentions to questions were very. Routinely antibodies. That it. I haven't submitted and you know we just I just finished. All right so cattle haulers you've been tracking this very closely the president has not submitted the answers. But he's taken a very big step today after quote equipment dating for months in this could be a sign that we're headed toward some sort of resolution potentially. They yeah and I think we have to watch when exactly he. Will submit those letters he set a pretty carefully said he was finished answering the questions but. On the netting more than himself far reporting is three days out of this week Monday Tuesday and Wednesday he had sessions with his attorneys carefully. Going over these questions as lawyers are helping him write the answers. To these questions so. The question now is winning we don't know about the questions so but we know that there's five different pockets of these questions they center around alleged Russian meddling during the 2016 campaign and there's about. Two dozen of them and police are reporting is as we saw he was tweeting the other morning just lashing out completely and dollars investigation haven't seen an an awhile there seems to be some questions. A handful of them that he's frustrated wet so be interesting to see if he really house finished answering those of you left some of them blank. How formerly Diddy answer that we still don't know can't. So big step terror but we're not out of the woods yet and a potential subpoena fight here. Rain it depends on when he. Cans over advancers is that enough for Moe Larry do they go into more negotiations does he need more questioning. Just because the answers it doesn't mean the process is over although it does in making them soon we'll see a report from Robert Mueller. Which would then I just hope in the floodgates for investigations from the house. So they're mirror under a lot of pressure right now but the one thing we know about president harvest he does not. Light to seem like he needs help from anybody and I think that's right you heard him say aren't the questions I want to decide any thinks that there trick question. And you grant close contact with Rudy Giuliani the president's. His chief lawyer in this matter what's your sense on his willingness at this stage. To sit down with Bob Mueller face to face they've agreed to answer some of these questions are writing still sort of seems to be an open question have they ruled it out that the president will. Absolutely not speak under oath. Little birdie Giuliani from the beginning has advised against this this is something that he says he is advising against the president. From the beginning has had he's happy to sit down with smaller although he's wavered back and forth on that it's obviously a risky scenario to put the president especially when he veers so often meaning in just press interviews. And it if this is a not. That they're hoping that answering these questions sufficiently will be enough to move on from this phase of the investigation. Right now the attic that's exactly where and the president we ask him. Have you will let out a sit down them. He he says he hasn't happened then of course goes into the fact there's nothing for him to hide there's a collision upsets and why should be up to sit down and his whole thing is perjury keeping that he will be perjured because he'll be tricked or trapped in many experts we've talked to say there is no outs after the president in this but we shall see if this does come to a subpoena fight and if those. Written answers are turned over they could happen as soon as this afternoon thank you all for that. I'm meanwhile the administration is moving forward speaking of rules writing some new rules I'm two different fronts. Both with respect two the department of education and also. To the press corps want packed both of those but wanted to bring in and clarity our agency's reporter for a little more on what's going on over at the Education Department that's he'd Abbas the education secretary. Making some waves this morning rewriting federal regulations. Over a sexual harassment and sexual assault investigations on college campuses. And at many schools so and joins us now and I give us the have mine out of the Education Department on what they are requiring now. Hi DeVon what they've they put out this morning hired these guidelines. For colleges that have to respond to sexual abuse solved. These are any college's that take title nine money. They're going to have to responded sexually known cases than a certain way and Betsy to Abbas has put up those guidelines this morning. And those guidelines is a very controversial element they have changed the requirement for wind colleges under federal law must investigate. He's harassment claims and assault claims on college campuses and in the sense and they've really raised the bar here. And that's right what that one of the big things that they've done is to narrow the definition of sexual assault. So it have to be so pervasive that. Person who is alleging sexual assault. They don't have access to education or an activity. And that's a much higher bar and then the Obama administration had. The other thing that they want to do is to ensure that somebody who is accused of sexual assault. Has the opportunity to cross examine their accuser they would do this not directly but they would do it through a lawyer or an advisor. That's that's going to be a big. Chains and it was much broader under the Obama administration any conduct that was deemed. Unwanted of the sexual nature. What's required under federal law to be investigated so schools. Now. Being being allowed to sort of much more selective in that terror one turned you on this because the president has. He made this whole idea presumed innocent until proven guilty due process we've seen it. With so many figures for Kavanagh being one of them of late this seems to be continuation of that of that a promotion on college campuses. The sword swinging pendulum back in in defense of the accused. Exactly this is a very trump he and that decision it's. In line with his administration and and his idea about her back hurt protecting the accused because the president himself identifies as someone who has been wrongly accused and he is only he's never hesitant to point that out send Abbas who has been consistent in following his direction is is really. Aligned with what the president want it's interesting to see. That missed the first step is in the schools that that they would I change harassment laws there are obviously there are other. Arenas to be changing harassment want especially when during the Obama administration. So many student. Member of the woman who carry the mattress around Columbia because she didn't think her rape case was being taken seriously enough. It was an entire movement that there reversing what this new lock in can happen. They had the time of the need to movement as well wouldn't when these issues are so much in the public consciousness when interacting and and you can also tracking the fallout. From this decision today among wild women's rights groups sexual assault. Advocates what are you hearing from them and is there any recourse she managed to challenge this new policy. I think they're certainly you're gonna see a big push these regulations go they don't go into effect right away. They're going to be put on the federal register and a clock starts taking it sixty days for the nation to. Provide their comments about the device in and she gets to decide whether or not she makes these rules final. I think that even if you don't see the public respond which they certainly well I think you're gonna see congress respond I think there's several house Democrats are gonna have subpoena thing and they're gonna have control of congress. And we know you'll track got all the way and clarity thank you so much much more of ends reporting. ID abcnews.com. And on the ABC news app a big story on college campuses right now. Well speaking of rewriting regulations in changing rules the White House also. Faced with. Legal decision today in federal court here in Washington regarding press access in the rules. Which govern who gets to go into White House grounds this is the case involving CNN correspondent Jim Acosta who's pass was revoked after contentious press conference last week when this morning. A federal judge to decide that a Costa needed to get his past back he is on the job right now. And let's bring in our chief legal correspondent Terry Moran who has helped us break down what this means for press freedoms in covering this administration Terry. The White House trumpeting this as a win for the First Amendment but as you know the judge didn't quite go that far. As I did judge explicitly said that he would not base his ruling on the First Amendment CNN was arguing that. By stripping Jim Acosta of his White House credentials. Kostis first amendment rights were being violated and White House was saying well he did that was not for First Amendment viewpoint. Is not because he was asking tough questions is because he put his hands on an intern and that press conference they said. The judge appointed by president trump judge Timothy Kelly. Said let's not get to the First Amendment issue because what's really the problem here is no way the White House went about doing this. It's up Fifth Amendment case you've got a right to due process of law if the government wants to take something. That is given to you take away is security clearance to quit dairy subsidy or a position in the civil service in the military. And any government. Official can't just stripped you of that. By whim or prejudice against say we don't like a costly because his middle name is a B Leo whatever we're gonna take aways white house press credentials. They have to show you do in the process of law that say here are the standards by which once granted a press white house press pass you can keep it. We will put you on notice that you have to abide by those standards and if you don't abide by them then would then we're gonna you're gonna lose it. And that is that's an important. Way of protecting press freedom without reaching the First Amendment however response White House says OK now we're gonna write the rules and the first person Nevada violates them. Will kick out so we may be back in court on this matter at some point you can. Your question Terry did you think covering the White House he covered White House is before. When you see the decorum in the White House right now between the president and the Pratt's what do you think what's your impression. Well look every that the great question. That is a great questions or because. Every president complaints. About press coverage and there are times in every administration when he gets nasty. When it gets really uncomfortable I first got to the White House right after the Clinton impeachment. And I'm there was bad blood between the clintons and and the press. It does seem that from the get go in the trump administration partly because he's such a rule breaker himself easily or break precious thing. There has been a section of the press which fights with the more than covers with him and he loves a good fight a fight right back. He wins those fights he's president he's elected. There's a not so I think it's. It's hard edged right now. It's been hard edged before and where in such a divisive time. With the president who is completely unafraid to cross lines that other presidents wouldn't have. That it does put press freedom in the relations between reporters in the White House in in some in some apparel. Had never seen a reporter though in a press conference with the president. Had his micro front taken from him like that. Not that confrontational and no I do remember I don't remember but I've seen the clips of all White House reporter some forty some years ago Dan rather standing. Asking. President Nixon a question and Nixon saying. Yeah he was that question is like and so president nexus and are you running for something and rather shot back no sir are you. And a really cannot I'm Bradley tone. Which was the controversy of that era I've never seen that kind of physical altercation though and I guess that's where we are. All right Terry before that you're going to want to get your response to the president on this that you alluded to it earlier the president. Is drafting some new regulations the judge mentioned they didn't have an established process by which to limit. Reporter strip Gemma Constance press batches of the president and disable what he's gonna do him response to today's ruling. We want. Total fleet of fashion expert report more importantly than anybody would believe. But you have to act with respect to the White House what I see the waves about what people get treated it. Press conferences it's terrible so what do setting up a certain standards which is what the court is requesting. And always go to the press always First Amendment. About that's the way it is and we always have the option of just leave it. It's a Terry the next step in this battle. If you will between the press corps and this president. Could very well be testing when the president or the press decide to test those new rules for it. Read that they're creation of those rules is going to be problematic is this madam to pump the doors rules of decorum in the White House you know. Dress code busy you know can is there some language that's out of bounds who decides that. But what they will try to do is come up with a series of rules that that relates to a respectful. Behavior in the White House that doesn't. I they can't be manipulated to say. It's really because we don't like the way this person is asking the kinds of questions this person is asking the view point from which those questions com. Because that's of you do have a First Amendment problem there. On the other hand I think the whole situation. Whether it was the way Costa decided. Two to go about his business that day or and the way the White House said the response just shows that. So much of of our government. I has carried on. In almost unspoken. Mutually respectful ways that once you shine a light thinking where's the bright line here between you know aloud and disallowed. You kind of destroyed it's it's like you die it's dissecting a frog you got a killer Ted to look at. And that's sort of what's happening here for decades presidents and reporters often very contentious Lee have managed to live together in probe. Professional sense and do their jobs. But did these two. People here these two institutions are now at loggerheads and by defining the court to going to be asked to define where the lines are.

Add Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAs thousands of migrants in a caravan of Central American asylum-seekers converge on the doorstep of the United States, what they won't find are armed American soldiers standing guard.\n\nInstead they will see cranes installing towering panels of metal bars and troops wrapping concertina wire around barriers while military helicopters fly overhead, carrying border patrol agents to and from locations along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThat's because U.S. military troops are prohibited from carrying out law enforcement duties.\n\nWhat's more, the bulk of the troops are in Texas \u2014 hundreds of miles away from the caravan that started arriving this week in Tijuana on Mexico's border with California after walking and hitching rides for the past month.\n\nStill, for many migrants the barriers and barbed wire were an imposing show of force.\n\nAngel Ulloa stood on Tijuana's beach where a wall of metal bars more than 20 feet high cut across the sand and plunged into the Pacific. He watched as crews on the U.S. side placed coils of barbed wire on top.\n\nA border patrol agent wearing camouflage and armed with an assault rifle \u2014 part of a tactical unit deployed when there is a heightened threat \u2014 walked in the sand below where the men worked. A small border patrol boat hovered offshore.\n\n\"It's too much security to confront humble people who just want to work,\" said Ulloa, a 23-year-old electrician from Choloma, Honduras, who joined the caravan to try to make his first trip to the U.S.\n\nNow, he and his two friends were rethinking their plans. They tried to apply for a job at a Wal-Mart in Tijuana but were told they need a Mexican work permit. So they were considering seeking asylum in Mexico but were unsure of giving up their dream of earning dollars.\n\n\"We're still checking things out,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, people walking through one of the world's busiest border crossings into Mexico passed by a pair of Marines on a 20-foot lift installing razor wire above a turnstile.\n\nNearby Army Sgt. Eric Zeigler stood guard with another soldier. Both were military police officers assigned to protecting the Marines as they work.\n\nThe 24-year-old soldier from Pittsburgh spent nine months in Afghanistan. \"\"It's very different over there, obviously. It's a lot more dangerous,\" Zeigler said.\n\nHe said he was surprised when got his deployment orders sending him to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"But I'm happy to go where I'm needed\" he added as a man walked by carrying shopping bags headed to Tijuana.\n\nThe U.S. military has deployed 5,800 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSo far, more are not expected, despite President Donald Trump's initial assessment that 10,000 to 15,000 were needed to secure the border against what he has called an \"invasion\" of migrants. Most in the caravan of several thousand are families, including hundreds of children.\n\nAnother 2,100 National Guard troops are have also been deployed since April as part of a separate mission. Like the military troops, they are not allowed to detain illegal crossers. Instead, they have been monitoring cameras and helping to erect barriers.\n\nOf the 5,800 soldiers and Marines, more than 2,800 are in Texas, while about 1,500 are in Arizona and another 1,300 are in California. All U.S. military branches, except the Coast Guard, are barred from performing law enforcement duties.\n\nThat means there will be no visible show of armed troops, said Army Maj. Scott McCullough, adding that the mission is to provide support to Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\"Soldiers putting up wire on the border and barriers at the ports of entry will be the most visible,\" he said.\n\nMarines and soldiers share the same duties in California and Arizona. These include erecting tents, setting up showers and arranging meals for troops working on the border, and assigning military police to protect them.\n\nThere are no tents or camps being set up to house migrants, McCullough said. Medics are on hand to treat troops and border patrol agents \u2014 not migrants \u2014 for cuts, bruises and any other problems.\n\nCombat engineers \u2014 whose duties on the battlefield include setting up tactical obstacles to prevent the enemy from moving freely \u2014 are using their expertise to string wire on border walls and erect temporary fencing, McCullough said.\n\nConstruction engineers have been assigned to weld together barriers and move shipping containers to act as walls.\n\nIn Laredo, Texas, about 100 soldiers have been installing three layers of razor wire along the Rio Grande, working on the banks during the day and on the bridges at night to minimize the disruption to cross-border traffic.\n\nThe current mission is scheduled to end Dec. 15 for now. It's unclear how much it will cost and military leaders have refused to provide an estimate.\n\nCritics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat. Since the Nov. 6 elections, Trump has said little about the matter and no border threat has materialized.\n\nSome border communities fear the barricades will scare off Mexican shoppers. The city council in Nogales, Arizona, slashed a proposed bonus for all employees in half over concerns about how the military's presence would affect its sales tax revenue after the military closed off two lanes at its border crossing.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis defended the deployment during a visit to the Texas border this week, asserting that in some ways it provides good training for war.\n\nSuyapa Reyes, 35, said she was puzzled as to why she would be seen as a threat. Reyes, her mother, 12-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son left Honduras with the caravan on Oct. 13, fleeing violence and poverty in her hometown of Olanchito de Oro.\n\nShe does not want to return after coming such a long way but if she cannot get asylum and the border looks too dangerous to cross, she said she'll have no other choice.\n\n\"I'm not going to risk my life or safety nor that of my children,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Astrid Galvan in Phoenix contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story corrects the spelling of Army Sgt. Eric Zeigler's last name. It is Zeigler, not Ziegler."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Benjamin Siegel", "title": "Nancy Pelosi, potential challenger have 'candid' discussion on speaker's race", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi met Friday morning with a prominent House Democrat considering challenging her for the speaker\u2019s gavel.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-pelosi-huddles-potential-rival-house-speaker-race/story?id=59246477", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/nancy-pelosi-ap-jef-181116_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:37:24Z", "content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi met Friday with a prominent House Democrat considering challenging her for the speakers gavel, as she continued to confer with incoming Democrats and court votes for speaker.

Elijah Cummings, D-Md., told reporters Friday that she would make a decision on whether to run against Pelosi after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"The meeting went very well,\" she said. \"We had a very open and candid discussion.\"\n\n\"What she asked me was, basically, \u2018How could we get to a point where I could be supportive?\u2019\u201d Fudge added.\n\n\"We talked about some succession planning. We talked about some other things. I think that the biggest issue that we discussed was the feeling in the caucus of people who are feeling left out and left behind.\"\n\nWhile she\u2019s favored to become House speaker next Congress, and win the closed-door vote for speaker in the Democratic caucus on Nov. 28, Pelosi has faced determined opposition from a band of current and incoming House Democrats who want new leadership.\n\nSeventeen of those Democrats have signed on to a letter pledging to vote for new leadership on the House floor in January, enough to block Pelosi from winning the 218 votes needed to clinch the gavel.\n\nWith three House races yet to be called by ABC News, Democrats are projected to hold 231 seats in the House next year, which would allow Pelosi to lose as many as 13 votes and still become speaker.\n\nHer critics argue that Pelosi, 78, who served as speaker from 2007-2011, has crowded out the party\u2019s rising stars and given few opportunities for Democrats to advance in the House.\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Newscom\n\n\u201cI was there when she grabbed the gavel with all the children around her [in 2007], it's one of the great moments of my career that I\u2019ll always remember,\u201d Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, a Pelosi critic who unsuccessfully ran against her for Democratic leader in 2016, told reporters Friday. \u201cBut we also have a responsibility to Democrats across the country who asked for change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an election of the establishment Democrats circling the wagons, versus the change that the Democratic people voted for across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nFor her part, Pelosi and her aides say that she has fostered and encouraged younger members, by creating additional leadership positions in the caucus and committees, and provided some member with issue portfolios to manage.\n\n\u201cMy experience with Nancy Pelosi, is part of her mission actually is to lift younger members,\u201d Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., a Pelosi ally, told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how many hours she spends, in the course of her regular business as leader, check in with the caucuses.\u201d\n\nSchakowsky and other Pelosi supporters have accused her critics of sexism by working to sideline Pelosi without explicitly saying the same about her top lieutenants: Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, who is 79, and Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, who is 78. Both men are running to keep the second and third-ranked posts in the majority.\n\n\u201cThey say about men when they age, they become more experienced, and women, expired,\u201d Schakowsky said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an element of sexism, an ageism that\u2019s applied to women and not to men.\u201d\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nPelosi stopped short of calling her critics sexist Thursday in her weekly news conference but defiantly proclaimed that she had enough support to become speaker.\n\n\u201cI have overwhelming support in my caucus to be Speaker of the House, and certainly we have many, many people in our caucus who could serve in this capacity. I happen to think that, at this point, I'm the best person for that,\u201d she said, while inviting others to challenge her.\n\nFudge, a former CBC chair and mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, who has served in Congress since 2008, said in an interview with HuffPost that Pelosi \u201chas been a very good leader\u201d but believes \u201cit\u2019s time for a new one.\u201d\n\nShe also told the website that she believes Pelosi hasn\u2019t been as strong enough of an advocate for African-Americans in Congress.\n\nFudge\u2019s potential bid has split members of the Congressional Black Caucus, some of whom had privately encouraged Clyburn and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a rising star who is running for a lower level leadership position, to move up the ranks of Democratic leadership.\n\nBut many prominent members of the group, including Jeffries, Rep. Elijah Cummings from Maryland, the future chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights icon, and Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the future chair of the House Financial Services Committee, have backed the California Democrat, who continues to meet with freshmen and undecided Democrats ahead of the caucus vote.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office has also promoted a raft of endorsements from major labor unions, pro-choice groups, and other outside organizations active in Democratic politics.\n\nShe\u2019s also met with key constituencies in the House Democratic caucus, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a co-chair of the Progressive Caucus who told reporters she plans to support Pelosi, and a group of Democrats in the Problem Solvers Caucus who have pledged to withhold their support in exchange for procedural rule changes to reform the way the House is run.\n\nOn Friday, Pelosi continued to meet with incoming House Democrats, and plans to meet with the entire new class of freshmen Democrats"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Nancy Pelosi huddles with potential rival in House speaker race - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Nancy Pelosi huddles with potential rival in House speaker race ABC News House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi met Friday with a prominent House Democrat considering challenging her for the speaker's gavel, as she continued to confer with incoming Democ\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-pelosi-huddles-potential-rival-house-speaker-race/story?id%3D59246477", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:37:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Nvidia, Nordstrom fall; PG&E, Sprint rise", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The fossils belong both to the owners of the property where they were found and two brothers who kept two-thirds of the mineral rights to the land once owned by their father, a three-judge panel said in a split decision.\n\nEric Edward Nord, an attorney for the property owners, said the case is complex in dealing with who owns what's on top of land vs. the minerals that make it up and addresses a unique question of mineral rights law related to dinosaur fossils that no court in the country has taken up before.\n\nHis clients own part of a ranch in the Hell Creek Formation of eastern Montana that's rich with prehistoric fossils, including the Dueling Dinosaurs whose value had been appraised at $7 million to $9 million.\n\nLige and Mary Ann Murray bought it from George Severson, who also transferred part of his interest in the ranch to his sons, Jerry and Robert Severson. In 2005, the brothers sold their surface rights to the Murrays, but retained the mineral rights, court documents said.\n\nAt the time, neither side suspected valuable dinosaur fossils were buried on the ranch, court records said. A few months later, amateur paleontologist Clayton Phipps discovered the carnivore and herbivore apparently locked in battle. Imprints of the dinosaurs' skin were also in the sediment.\n\nA dispute arose in 2008 when the Seversons learned about the fossils \u2014 a 22-foot-long (7-meter-long) theropod and a 28-foot-long (9-meter-long) ceratopsian.\n\nThe Murrays sought a court order saying they owned the Dueling Dinosaurs, while the Seversons asked a judge to find that fossils are part of the property's mineral estate and that they were entitled to partial ownership.\n\nIt had wider implications because the ranch is in an area that has numerous prehistoric creatures preserved in layers of clay and sandstone. Paleontologists have unearthed thousands of specimens now housed in museums and used for research.\n\nBut fossils discovered on private land can be privately owned, frustrating paleontologists who say valuable scientific information is being lost.\n\nDuring the court case, the Dueling Dinosaurs were put up for auction in New York in November 2013. Bidding topped out at $5.5 million, less than the reserve price of $6 million.\n\nA nearly complete Tyrannosaurus rex found on the property was sold to a Dutch museum for several million dollars in 2014, with the proceeds being held in escrow pending the outcome of the court case.\n\nOther fossils found on the ranch also have been sold, including a triceratops skull that brought in more than $200,000, court records said.\n\nThe 9th Circuit decision on Nov. 6 overturned a federal judge's 2016 opinion that fossils were not included in the ordinary definition of \"mineral\" because not all fossils with the same mineral composition are considered valuable.\n\n\"The composition of minerals found in the fossils does not make them valuable or worthless,\" U.S. District Judge Susan Watters of Billings wrote. \"Instead, the value turns on characteristics other than mineral composition, such as the completeness of the specimen, the species of dinosaur and how well it is preserved.\"\n\nThe Seversons had appealed, arguing previous court cases determined that naturally occurring materials that have some special value meet the definition of minerals.\n\nAttorneys for the Murrays asked the 9th Circuit this week for an extension of a Nov. 21 deadline to petition the judges to reconsider or for a hearing before an 11-judge panel."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Trump awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth and more", "description": "President Donald Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award - the nation's highest civilian honor - to seven Americans in a ceremony at the White House.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/trump-awards-presidential-medal-freedom-elvis-presley-babe-59252906", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181116_vod_orig_medalfreedomMIX_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:28:08Z", "content": "Now Playing: Trump awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth and more Now Playing: Camel spotted on the side of the highway Now Playing: Weather conditions improving but critical fire conditions still exist in California Now Playing\u2026 [+1259 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Trump awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth and more\n\nLonnie and I are thrilled to welcome you to the White House.

The agency says it has to be able to tie a specific product to illnesses before it can prompt a recall. It notes salmonella is not considered an adulterant in raw poultry unless products can be clearly linked to illnesses.\n\nWith Thanksgiving approaching, the agency is reminding people that they should always properly handle and cook their turkeys to kill any possible salmonella.

Most Republicans haven't forgiven Assange for his publication of U.S. military and intelligence secrets. Much of the American media establishment holds him in contempt as well.\n\nBut academics, civil rights lawyers and journalism groups worry that an attempt to put Assange behind bars could damage constitutional free speech protections, with repercussions for newsrooms covering national security across the United States.\n\n\"This isn't about Julian Assange, this is about the First Amendment and press freedom,\" said Elizabeth Goitein, who co-directs the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center in New York. \"You can't support First Amendment freedoms and still support the government chipping away at those freedoms of people you don't like.\"\n\nU.S. officials clearly have been itching to get their hands on the 47-year-old ex-hacker for some time; he has been a thorn in Washington's side for almost a decade. And Assange's longtime claim that prosecutors secretly were preparing charges against was vindicated late Thursday when his name accidentally surfaced in an apparently unrelated legal filing.\n\nA person familiar with the situation confirmed that charges against Assange have in fact been filed under seal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the charges have not been publicly announced.\n\n\"A very black day for journalism,\" is how WikiLeaks' recently appointed editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, described the development during a brief interview in Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and a host of other groups have also voiced their disquiet.\n\nThe nature of the charges isn't clear. Until recently, most discussions of prosecuting WikiLeaks involved the Espionage Act, a century-old law that was used to imprison former Army private Chelsea Manning, arguably WikiLeaks' most important source.\n\nBut the act has been used so far to prosecute sources who had sworn an oath or signed a non-disclosure agreement \u2014 not publishers.\n\nThe Justice Department \"has drawn a line between the people who actually steal or leak information and people who publish it,\" Goitein said. \"To extend that line to include people who have never in any way signed away their First Amendment rights is incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nFew discussions of Assange are complete without hand-wringing over whether he qualifies as a journalist. Assange insists that he is, and Hrafnsson called WikiLeaks \"a legitimate journalistic organization.\" Others, such as former FBI Director James Comey, have argued the opposite, calling it a publisher of \"intelligence porn\" and \"a conduit for the Russian intelligence services.\"\n\nGoitein says such distinctions are irrelevant when it comes to free speech rights.\n\n\"The First Amendment doesn't use the word 'journalism' and it doesn't apply only to journalists. The First Amendment protects anyone who publishes information, regardless of whether they carry the mantle of journalism,\" she said.\n\nBastiaan Vanacker, program director for the Center for Digital Ethics and Policy at Loyola University Chicago, said it was the difficulty of separating WikiLeaks from more traditional media outlets that convinced the Justice Department to shy away from pursuing Assange more aggressively during Barack Obama's presidency.\n\n\"I think the Obama administration had it exactly right,\" Vanacker said. \"It's just too difficult to make that distinction.\"\n\nHe cautioned that the leak of the sealed charges didn't necessarily mean the Trump administration was taking a tougher line.\n\n\"It's very well possible that there are new facts that came to light that perhaps would give a stronger case for prosecution,\" Vanacker said.\n\nIn particular, he wondered if the government was pursuing Assange in connection with his publication of CIA surveillance software beginning in March 2017, something Vanacker speculated WikiLeaks might have tried to leverage in a bid to secure favorable treatment from President Donald Trump.\n\nA similar possibility occurred to independent journalist Marcy Wheeler, who noted that Assange tried to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration shortly before the CIA files started leaking.\n\nAn extortion-related prosecution would still be bad news for Assange, of course, but as far as journalism in general, \"that would not be as dire,\" Vanacker said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nRaphael Satter can be: http://raphaelsatter.com"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Matthew Mosk and Allison Pecorin", "title": "The DC docket shows dozens of sealed criminal indictments.

Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSealed criminal court files are assigned a case number, but do not indicate the identity of the parties or the nature of the charges, so it is impossible for the public to discern what those sealed cases contain.\n\nBut several legal experts told ABC News the number of sealed cases awaiting action right now is unusual. Fourteen were added to the docket since late August alone, a review by ABC News has found, just as the midterm elections were drawing near and longstanding Justice Department policy precluded prosecutors from taking any public action that could appear to be aimed at influencing political outcomes.\n\nAnd the inadvertent discovery on Thursday night of what appear to be secret charges pending against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has drawn fresh attention to the mystery. Legal experts told ABC News that the sealed cases could be tied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possibly part of a quiet effort to protect his investigation from any premature effort to shut it down.\n\n\u201cI assume that Mueller knew that once the election was over, there could be an existential threat to his investigation,\u201d said Matthew Miller, a former senior Justice official under former Attorney General Eric Holder. \u201cHe knew the best thing to do was act before that.\u201d\n\nZach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nA spokesperson for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment on the investigation or the uptick in sealed indictments.\n\nSealed indictments are often used in cases where a defendant is overseas and U.S. prosecutors don\u2019t want to tip off their target before they have a chance to make an arrest. But they can also be used to pressure someone to flip on a more important target, according to Kendall Coffey, who served as U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida in the mid-1990s, \u201cespecially if there was someone who presented the hope of providing proactive assistance \u2013 undertaking conversations, especially recorded conversations with other suspects in the investigation.\u201d\n\nMueller has used a sealed indictment before. The case against unpaid Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos remained a secret for three months before charges of lying to investigators were eventually made public in October 2017. Only then, after Mueller's team secured a cooperation agreement, did the public learn the one-time foreign policy advisor would be the first from Trump\u2019s campaign to plead guilty in the probe.\n\nBrett Kappel, a veteran political law expert said he calculated that 16 percent of all the criminal cases filed thus far in 2018 remained under seal, a number he considered \u201cunusually high.\u201d And those were kept under seal much longer than usual, he said.\n\n\u201cThey normally only remain sealed until the person who has been indicted has been apprehended,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other major reason why a case is initially sealed is that publicly revealing the name of the accused would impede an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nCoffey said he did not know if the stack of secret charging papers had any ties to Mueller. But if they did, he said, they would have enabled the special counsel\u2019s team to keep cases moving ahead of the midterms.\n\n\u201cIf indeed Mueller had prepared cases for prosecution but did not want the announcement to impact on pending elections then a sealed indictment might have been the preferred method,\u201d Coffey said.\n\nAnd there was good reason, Miller said, for Mueller to lock in charges before the midterms.\n\nYuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nMueller can only indict someone with the approval of the Attorney General, and once the indictments have been approved and filed, any effort to withdraw charges would involve a judge.\n\nAt the time, those approvals fell to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia matter. But President Trump had sent strong signals he planned to replace Sessions after the elections with someone who might be more willing to curtail the probe into Russian election interference and possible collusion.\n\nThe day after the elections, Trump appointed acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has previously denounced the Mueller probe. A Justice Department spokeswoman said this week that Whitaker \u201cis fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures at the Department of Justice, including consulting with senior ethics officials on his oversight responsibilities and matters that may warrant recusal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prevent a new AG from blocking new indictments,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut if you were ready to move on cases, you could return a bunch of indictments under seal. If the stumbling block is approval from Mueller\u2019s supervisors, you get that approval while you still have a supervisor who approves of your work.\u201d\n\nABC News' Ali Dukakis and Soorin Kim contributed to this report.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This report has been updated to correct that there have been nearly three dozen, not more than three dozen, sealed criminal indictments added to federal court docket in 2018."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "There are dozens of sealed criminal indictments on the DC docket.

Viktor Drago is at the bottom, hauling cement in Ukraine and burning for family redemption. \"My son will break your boy,\" Ivan Drago threatens Rocky, who sort of agrees. \"When a fighter's got nothing to lose he's dangerous,\" he warns Creed. \"Listen, that kid was raised in hate. You weren't.\" Dolph Lungren returns as the elder Drago and there's even an appearance by Brigitte Nielsen, who plays Drago's wife in 1985 and was a real-life wife of Stallone. (Talk about keeping it in the family.)\n\nCaple matches Coogler's moody, gritty vision of a brutal sport conducted by mostly honorable men trying to outwit each other. There's plenty of gore, slo-mos of smashed heads and \"Rocky\" trademarks \u2014 the glorious montages with uplifting music as fighters prepare for their shot in the ring. (Prepare to look away if you are fans of massive truck tires \u2014 many get horrible beat downs.)\n\nStallone got his mitts on the script \u2014 after having had a role penning all the \"Rocky\" films but sitting out writing \"Creed\" \u2014 and teams up with Cheo Hodari Coker, creator of the Netflix superhero hit \"Luke Cage.\" Onscreen, Stallone returns with his dark fedora and small bouncing ball, shuffling about and mumbling, allowing his sad eyes to do the bulk of his acting. It's in the small moments between crusty Stallone and cocky Jordan where the film finds its sweet spot. \"What are you fightin' for?\" the elder man asks the younger.\n\nJordan proves again that he's a film force to be reckoned with, capable of searing and savage intensity and yet also goofy softness. This time, his swagger is tested and he must overcome intense pain and anguish. Watching him get up off the canvas again and again will make even the most uncharitable viewer cheer. As Adonis, he wants to carve his own legacy away from his father's: \"This is our chance to rewrite history. Our history,\" Creed tells Rocky.\n\nThompson and Rashad both temper the piles of testosterone onscreen as women who steer and guide the young Adonis. Thompson's character is battling progressive hearing loss and that is handled intelligently by the writers. There's even a scene when Adonis is punched so hard that he falls in silence and looks over at her, both connected for a moment in enveloping quiet.\n\nThe filmmakers, meanwhile, are creating their own family legacy. Both \"Creed\" films share the same composer (Ludwig Goransson) art director (Jesse Rosenthal), special effects coordinator (Patrick White), costumer (Rita Squitiere) and location manager (Patricia Taggart.) The films even have the same barber for Jordan (Kenny Duncan). And Coogler didn't go far \u2014 he's an executive producer.\n\nBut while a \"Creed III\" is almost guaranteed, there may be dangers ahead if the filmmakers choose to keep reopening old wounds or plundering story lines from the past. And the creep toward more cinematic bombast needs to be watched vigilantly (remember how nuts the last few \"Rocky\" films got?) Having said that, this spin-off franchise is clearly in very good hands \u2014 ones that are heavily wrapped, protected by a glove and aiming for your gut.\n\n\"Creed II,\" a Warner Bros. Pictures release, is rated PG-13 for \"sports action violence, language and a scene of sensuality.\" Running time: 128 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents Strongly Cautioned.

Add Interest\n\nThere was cake at little Brithani Lizeth's third birthday party, and also tears.\n\nThough her grandmother and aunt tried to make their simple cinder block home festive, the little girl could not be consoled. She missed her parents.\n\nOrbelina Orellana and Elmer Alberto Cardona were hundreds of miles and two countries away in a small town in southern Mexico, making their way toward the United States with thousands of others in a desperate caravan, leaving their loved ones behind.\n\nDespite the distance, Orellana was able to get a picture and audio recording from her daughter's birthday party in Honduras via WhatsApp and hear the little girl sob: \"I love you, Mommy,\" words that left the mother crushed.\n\n\"I didn't even want to get up,\" she said of the bittersweet moment.\n\nLike thousands of others, Orellana and her husband have relied on social media, text messages and brief cellphone calls to connect with worried loved ones back home as they traverse a country that can often be deadly for migrants.\n\nThe birthday recording gave her comfort and courage to continue the difficult journey of nearly 3,000 miles (nearly 5,000 kilometers) by foot, bus and hitchhiking as they head toward the Mexican border city of Tijuana.\n\nAt the frontier with San Diego, many in the caravan hope to ask for asylum in the United States, though it could take weeks or months as they take their places at the end of a line of thousands of others in the slow-moving application process.\n\nYears ago the migration trail north could be something of a black box. People might set out and not be heard from again until months later after reaching the U.S. and phoning from a relative's house, or suddenly showing up back home after being caught at the border and deported.\n\nTechnology has changed that.\n\nNot everyone in the caravan has a smartphone, and for those who do, coverage can be spotty in the Mexican countryside. At times it's hard to find a hotspot or a charge. But for those who do, they're precious cargo. Many share them with fellow migrants who eagerly log in to and other apps to send or receive a quick message.\n\nSome NGOs also facilitated free calls home for migrants, with the Red Cross organizing more than 4,000 of them.\n\nOrellana, 26, and Cardona, 27, have tried to call Brithani and her two siblings each evening when the caravan stops for the night, usually to sleep outdoors in public squares.\n\n\"I tell her I will always love her ... and she tells me not to miss her, that she is going to send for me,\" said Janeisy Nicolle, the couple's 5-year-old middle daughter.\n\nOften, in these brief conversations, neither side tells the whole truth for fear of causing worry.\n\nOrellana and Cardona, for example, didn't get into the fact that he had been stranded for a while on a desert highway in a dangerous part of Mexico, where migrants often fall prey to robbery, extortion, kidnapping and murder. Their loved ones didn't mention that some days they were low on rice and beans because the family's small pineapple farm wasn't producing anything to sell.\n\n\"Life is hard here,\" said Orellana's 29-year-old sister Deysi, now responsible for raising Brithani, Janeisy and their 9-year-old brother, Kenner Alberto. \"But it's hard up there too.\"\n\nMany in the caravan are traveling in family units; among them are at least 300 children below age 5, according to a count conducted when they paused for several days to rest in Mexico City. Many more children have been left with relatives so as not to expose them to the dangers of the trip.\n\nOrellana and Cardona are convinced they made the right choice in leaving their children behind and hope to reunite with their little ones if they make it to the United States and find work.\n\nViolent political protests in Honduras last year closed many of the stores where they used to buy small electronics goods to sell on the street. Ultimately they were spending almost everything they made on transportation, with little left for food.\n\nSo they borrowed money from the only people who lend to the poor in Honduras \u2014 gang members, who charge exorbitant interest. When they were unable to repay the $250, their debt suddenly became $700. Then the death threats started to come.\n\n\"If there is no way to pay it, they look for other ways,\" Orellana said. \"That's why I was afraid.\"\n\nOn top of it all, their small wooden home collapsed.\n\n\"They suffered a lot,\" said Orellana's mother, 69-year-old Evangelina Murillo.\n\nMurillo, who has cancer, lives with her daughter and son-in-law, two sons and now her three grandchildren in the two-room home donated by a local church in the rural outskirts of San Pedro Sula. It's a dangerous place: Another son was killed by a thief who was trying to steal his pig.\n\nThat kind of violence and poverty are the reasons cited again and again by migrants who joined the caravan.\n\nOrellana and Cardona had tried four years ago to emigrate from Honduras, only to be deported from Mexico. When they heard about the caravan on the TV news in October, they figured they didn't have anything to lose.\n\nThe hardest part was when Brithani held onto her mother and begged to come with them, crying, \"Don't leave me, mommy, don't leave me!\"\n\n\"I couldn't take her, the risk was too great,\" Orellana said, clutching at two Virgin of Guadalupe medals hanging around her neck, one of them engraved with the initials of her three kids.\n\nThe daily phone calls from Mexico stopped for a while when the couple's cellphone was stolen, until they started traveling with someone else who had one. During that time the only news their anxious family back home received was from the TV \u2014 scenes of tear gas and border clashes between migrants and Mexican police, and unfounded rumors that a child had died in those disturbances at a bridge between Guatemala and Mexico.\n\n\"When we see those images, we worry and I just ask God to take care of them for me,\" Murillo said.\n\nThinking about their children is the only thing that helped the couple when life got tough with the caravan. Like when they lost their IDs on the border bridge amid the clashes. Or clambering aboard foul-smelling garbage trucks to travel more quickly and keep up with the rest of the group. And the days of slogging dozens of miles (kilometers) underneath a baking sun, and falling sick when colder temperatures set in.\n\n\"Whenever I felt like returning, I told myself, 'Damn, I'd be going home to the same misery as always,'\" Orellana said. \"If I've come this far, I have to face whatever comes to provide a better life for my children.\"\n\nNearing Tijuana, the couple said they were still undecided whether they would try to cross into the United States or ask for refuge in Mexico.\n\nAnd on Sunday their thoughts will again be back home, this time with Janeisy: It's her sixth birthday."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: This day in history: Nov. 26, 2017", "description": "Al Franken speaks out for the first time since sexual misconduct allegations.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/day-history-nov-26-2017-59250519", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181126_abc_archives_tdih_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:56:48Z", "content": "Now Playing: CNN's Jim Acosta speaks out after his White House press pass is reinstated Now Playing: Judge sides with reporter, reinstates White House press credential Now Playing: Trump says he's finished answering Mueller's questions, but hasn't submitted t\u2026 [+1146 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for This day in history: Nov. 26, 2017\n\nSenator Al Franken speaking with reporters for the first time since those allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced.

He added that the company is in talks with Ford about possible cooperation in making light commercial vehicles.\n\nEstablished automakers as well as several U.S. startups are rolling out electric models to compete with Tesla , currently the market leader. Auto companies need electrics to meet new environmental standards in many countries.\n\nIn Europe, manufacturers need to sell more battery-powered cars to meet tougher EU limits on carbon dioxide emissions that come into force 2021 and aim to fight global warming. Automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW risk penalties of thousands of euros per vehicle if they can't meet requirements for lower average emissions.\n\nAuthorities in China, where Volkswagen gets much of its profit, have also mandated a bigger share of electrics and hybrids.\n\nYet right now, such vehicles remain a niche market due to higher price and lack of places to charge. Battery-only vehicles were only 0.6 percent of the market in the European Union last year. They are running from 1 to 2 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales so far this year.\n\nMajor new models unveiled in recent weeks from Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and Volksagen's Audi brand have been expensive SUVs; Audi's e-tron starts at a German price of 80,000 euros. The starting price for Tesla's Model X is around $80,700 while the Model S starts around $74,500.\n\nVW's upcoming I.D. compact could take mass-market buyers from Tesla's Model 3, a mass-market car with a base price of $35,000 before tax credits. In reality, though, you can't order one yet for less than $46,000.\n\nPoetsch said the I.D. compact would be about the cost of a Golf diesel today, which is priced at 23,875 euros in Germany, according to Volkswagen's website, and goes up as options are added. The next model up the scale starts at 30,625 euros.\n\nGeneral Motors, Nissan and Mitsubishi already are selling mass-market electric vehicles, but they're still more costly than cars with gasoline engines, and they haven't sold in great numbers.\n\nHigher cost is one reason consumers are not yet buying purely electric vehicles in large numbers. The lack of charging points is another, leaving many owners of electric vehicles to use them mainly in cities or for shorter trips. Volkswagen and other automakers are working together on building a freeway network of fast-charging stations to enable longer trips with battery powered cars.\n\nChinese automakers as well as U.S. startup companies also are getting into the electric car market. Rivian, a Detroit-area company, plans to unveil a high-end electric pickup and SUV later this month, to go on sale in late 2020. Lucid Motors, a Newark, California, startup whose leadership includes six former Tesla executives, plans to deliver its first cars in 2020 as well.\n\nThe shift to electric cars is a big one for a company the size of Volkswagen, which has over 600,000 employees and makes about 10 million vehicles a year.\n\nIt is converting three of its German plants from internal combustion to battery car production as it pivots away from diesel vehicles in the wake of its emissions scandal.

It's about four women whose late husbands owe gangsters a fortune, so one of them comes up with a payment plan. Look, you just have to look. Look at the clip. Harry left me the plans for his next job. It's worth $5 million. I take $2 million, give it to the men and we split the rest. You want us to -- Pull off the job, yeah. A million a piece. A million? Maybe you have a secret plan for a special skill that can make you that kind of money, but if you don't, there's an address in the pads of money that I just gave you. Meet me there tomorrow at 11:15. What if we say no? She'll give them our names. Please welcome three extraordinary actresses, Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth debicki. ??? Hey y'all. What's up. So, let's get to this movie because I want to know what was it about this that made you say yes. I know it's got a brilliant director, and we'll talk about him too. But what was it for you that you read it and said, oh, yeah? Well, first of all, it was the director, but I have to say it was him calling me up after I gave him this huge monologue about my five different wig changes I was going to make as a character. And he said we're not going to do that. We're going to wear your natural hair because that woman exists. I see her walking in the airports all the time. With her Irish husband. She just hasn't been introduced to the American cinema. So we're going to introduce her. And so it was that and it was the love scene. Hm-mm. I just thought it was a great opportunity for me, just me in general as an actress, but especially just being a black actress, just being sexualized in some way. And it's not like -- And having them not cut it out. Yeah, exactly. And, yeah, I don't want to ruin the movie but it's just part of who she is. And I thought, she's a woman, you know. She's not just a device. She's a woman. And then she's still bad-ass. She's still very feminine. She's still all those things, so that was it. It was a no-brainer. Baby, what about you, Michelle Rodriguez? It was a tough one, you know. Linda is a mother of two children, married to, you know, an unreliable man. That's something that I saw growing up in Jersey City a lot. I didn't know whether or not I wanted to portray that to millions of people because I was always the one who did the escapism movies, you know. I'm the one trying to empower it, you know. So for me it was really scary to look at this character, but when I met Steve, here's this man who's like that one, you know, part of that 1% who has the ability to green light a feature film in Hollywood. And here's a man who decides that he wants to see this feature film through the perspective of women. And that opened my heart so much that there's no way I could have said no to him. Love that. And what about you, baby? Well, I mean, Alice, the character I play, has this beautiful journey in the movie and when we first meet her, she's very repressed and she's suffering from really horrible domestic abuse and she's very repressed by her mother. She's somebody who has so internalized this sort of sense of worthlessness. And then she goes on this incredible journey where she discovers that she's worth something and that she has a voice and that she can be independent and she meets these women who tell her that she's strong and she's worthy. I mean, I just thought it was a really amazing thing to be able to portray on the screen. And it was such an amazing movie. I have to tell you, I saw it twice. I saw it twice, yes, I did, and I saw things the second time that I hadn't seen the first time, and you all are so fantastic. Viola, what was interesting to me is Chicago is almost another character in the film. What was it like for you filming it there in Chicago, in that city? Well, I don't think it would have worked on a sound stage in Beverly hills or Hollywood, you know, because I mean, July 4th there were 200 shootings in Chicago, 22 murders. It's the mixture of races and class and at the same time art museums and history. It's alive. It's vibrant. I thought it was a great backdrop where there's sort of normalization of criminality is born. Steve Mcqueen is always say the famous line in Chicago is, \"I got a guy.\" You know, I got a guy. Everybody seemed to have a guy in this film. It's a thing in New York too. Chicago is a symbol I think for every major city and democracy. Everywhere. So now, you've done this film. What do you want women in particular but people in general to take from it? The beauty of it for me was discovering for myself that soft power is stronger than this. It's a lot easier to stand up and say I'm willing to die for this and run in towards the guns and the blazing. I've done that most of my life just to survive, and even in Hollywood those are the kinds of feature films that I chose to do to find my Independence. It's a lot harder to stick it through, you know, and raise those kids on your own and live that route of unconditional love. It's a lot harder to do that. It's harder to be good. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's femininity. And there's power in that. This movie is real women. You're going to see real women. They're not going to be running into a closet and getting a cape and a golden lasso. These are women who literally are realistically taking ownership of their lives, grieving the loss of their husbands, and just, you know, it's almost like the heist is a metaphor for taking ownership. It's like how can we get our lives back. Let's just do something bold and brave and something that people would not expect us to do. And also what's so beautiful is it's such a conversation about sisterhood because these women meet each other and they perceive difference before they perceive any similarity because they are so different from each other, just like we are. When we made this movie, art mirrored life mirrored art in this beautiful way because we learned so much from each other and we bonded so much. There's so much love, but that's what these women find out between themselves. And on a lighter note, Elizabeth, I heard that there were dance parties during the filming of the show? Who started the whole dance party thing? Man, everybody is so uptight with all of this, you know, economic subtra fuj and corruption and abuse, you know, we needed to liven it up on set, you know what I mean? So you started it? Yeah. No, but when we say we danced, we really danced. A lot. In robes. The first dance party was after the clip you just showed. We were in our sauna robes and it was about 3:00 A.M. And Michelle put it on and we were just delirious. What was the song that came on? It was a lot of Michael Jackson. I love my motown. Yes, baby, yes, baby. You know what, it's never long enough with you. I don't see you often enough and I'm thrilled to meet you. Thank you. Please, all three, whatever you're up to, come back. Come back. And see the movie. Our thanks to Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth debicki. \"Widows\" opens in theaters today and if you don't go see it, you will be doing yourself a disservice because not only is it a great popcorn movie but it's all women.

The judge said Acosta's credentials must be reactivated to allow him access to the White House complex for press briefings and other events.\n\nAcosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, was back in the afternoon. The White House said it would be developing new rules for orderly press conferences.\n\nThe White House revoked Acosta's credentials last week after he and Trump tangled verbally during a press conference following the midterm elections. CNN sued and asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order forcing the White House to give back Acosta's credentials. The judge agreed.\n\nCNN alleged that Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the White House revoked his \"hard pass.\"\n\nWhile the judge didn't rule on the underlying case, he ordered Acosta's pass returned for now in part because he said CNN was likely to prevail on its Fifth Amendment claim \u2014 that Acosta hadn't received sufficient notice or explanation before his credentials were revoked or been given sufficient opportunity to respond before they were.\n\nThe judge said the government could not say who initially decided to revoke Acosta's hard pass and how that decision was reached.\n\n\"In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter's hard pass,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the decision, Trump said, \"If they don't listen to the rules and regulations, we will end up back in court and we will win.\"\n\nHe later added: \"We want total freedom of the press. It's very important to me, more important to me than anybody would believe. But you have to act with respect when you're in the White House, and when I see the way some of my people get treated at press conferences, it's terrible. So we're setting up a certain standard, which is what the court is requesting.\"\n\nThe White House had spelled out its reasons for revoking Acosta's credentials in a tweet from Sanders and in a statement after CNN filed its lawsuit. But the judge said those \"belated efforts were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process.\"\n\nBut the judge also emphasized the \"very limited nature\" of his ruling Friday. He noted he had not determined that the First Amendment was violated.\n\nThe judge told attorneys to file additional court papers in the case by Monday.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, more than 50 members of the White House press corps greeted Acosta as he strode through the northwest gate of the presidential compound. He said he was grateful for the judge's ruling, that it was a test and the media passed the test.\n\n\"This is just any other day at the White House for me and I would like to get back to work,\" he said.\n\nTrump has made his dislike of CNN clear since before he took office and continuing into his presidency. He has described the network as \"fake news\" both on Twitter and in public comments.\n\nAt last week's press conference, Trump was taking questions from reporters and called on Acosta, who asked about Trump's statements about a caravan of migrants making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. After a terse exchange, Trump told Acosta, \"That's enough,\" several times while calling on another reporter.\n\nAcosta attempted to ask another question about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and initially declined to give up a handheld microphone to a White House intern. Trump responded to Acosta by saying he wasn't concerned about the investigation, calling it a \"hoax,\" and then criticized Acosta, calling him a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nHours later, the White House pulled Acosta's credentials.\n\nThe White House's explanations for why it seized Acosta's credentials have shifted over the past week.\n\nSanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone.\n\nBut that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta's account that he was just trying to keep the microphone and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders accused Acosta in a written statement of being unprofessional by trying to dominate the questioning at the news conference."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "'Instant Family' uses laughter to shine a light on adoption", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Yet, by some estimates, it ends as many as 1 in 5 pregnancies before the 20-week mark.\n\nThe former first lady\u2019s disclosure that she and former President Barack Obama suffered from fertility issues, including losing a pregnancy, has sparked conversations about miscarriage, a common but also commonly misunderstood loss.\n\nPsychologists say that ignorance can contribute to the emotional and psychological toll of losing a pregnancy, isolating women and their partners and leaving loved ones uncertain of how to comfort them.\n\nNearly five years later, Becky Shaw of Woodbridge, Va., still remembers texting her friend after her miscarriage, just asking if she was around to talk. Within a couple of minutes, her friend called. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what she was saying, but she made me laugh,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nThe trauma began early in her first pregnancy. Shaw, now 35, had experienced some bleeding when she and her husband showed up for her checkup on Christmas Eve in 2013. The nurse performing the ultrasound was wearing a Santa hat.\n\n\u201cYou can tell when something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cShe\u2019s just staring at the screen. And then she was finally like, Can you hold your breath?\u201d\n\nThe nurse struggled to find the baby\u2019s heartbeat, which she said was dangerously low and could stop. For weeks, Shaw felt \u201clike a time bomb.\u201d She miscarried in early January.\n\nShaw said it is important for a woman like Obama to speak out about her miscarriage. \u201cIt just makes people feel less alone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy miscarriage wrecked me, and I had the most supportive friends and the best doctors.\u201d\n\nMany grief counselors are praising Obama for illuminating \u2014 and normalizing \u2014 miscarriage, helping families cope with their own loss.\n\nLorenzo Bevilaqua/ABC\n\n\u201cWhat a gift,\u201d said Helen L. Coons, a clinical health psychologist specializing in women\u2019s behavioral health at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\nMiscarriage, or the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks, is so common that Americans often stay quiet about their pregnancies until after the first trimester, when the majority of miscarriages occur. Improvements in early pregnancy detection and the use of fertility treatments have also increased the likelihood that couples learn they have miscarried, whereas they once might not have even known they were pregnant.\n\nThe risks are greater for black women, who are more likely to experience pregnancy loss than white women. (Black infants are also much more likely to die during their first year of life, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)\n\nFor such a common occurrence, though, much about miscarriage is widely misunderstood. A 2015 survey found that many people do not understand its causes, with more than a fifth of respondents saying they believed lifestyle choices (such as smoking or drinking alcohol) are the most common cause. In reality, most miscarriages are caused by genetic problems.\n\nOther factors that respondents wrongly identified as potential causes included lifting heavy objects (believed by 64 percent); having had a sexually transmitted disease (41 percent); and even getting into an argument (21 percent).\n\nIt is uncommon to find out the cause of one\u2019s miscarriage, and women frequently blame themselves. The survey also found that 47 percent of those who had experienced a miscarriage reported feeling guilty; 41 percent reported feeling alone.\n\nSome women are also left with worries that they are infertile, a fear that can stoke identity issues for those who see themselves as destined for parenthood.\n\nPsychologists say it is important as well to acknowledge the grief of the partner or spouse, who may process the emotions differently but also has experienced his or her own loss.\n\nIsolation can exacerbate those feelings, including some women\u2019s belief that \u201ctheir body let them down,\u201d said Coons of the University of Colorado.\n\nNancy Molitor, a clinical psychologist and professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, said she asked herself the same question as many women when she suffered her own miscarriage, a trauma that nearly killed her: What did I do wrong?\n\nToday, women are more likely to talk to friends and other loved ones about their miscarriages, Molitor said, helping them realize how common the events are and removing some of the stigma. But even in 1996, when she miscarried, \u201cnobody talked about it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe counsels women, some in their 80s or 90s, who bring up their miscarriages decades later. \u201cThere\u2019s a wistfulness about the fact that they never talked about that,\u201d Molitor said, adding, \u201cYou were told, move on, honey. Move on, dear. It wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d\n\nCouples who miscarry also find themselves grappling with a grief that comes with no set rules or rituals. Stefania Patrizio of Philadelphia and her husband waited until she was 12 weeks along to tell their family and friends she was pregnant. She was showing by the time she miscarried at around 20 weeks.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people who didn\u2019t know how to handle it, because it\u2019s a different type of grief, it\u2019s a different type of \u2014 I guess I\u2019ll say death, because it\u2019s not someone you knew,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a grief of a dream.\u201d\n\nConceiving her daughter \u2014 who was born a year after her miscarriage, almost to the day \u2014 did not ease her fears. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I didn\u2019t want to get excited,\u201d said Patrizio, now 34. \u201cEven just the click click click of the [ultrasound] machine would give me so much anxiety.\u201d\n\nPsychologists emphasize the importance for women recovering from a miscarriage to build a support network.\n\nCoons recommends that pregnant women reach out to at least one or two people close to them to discuss any fears they may have. That could mean disclosing an early pregnancy to a couple of friends before revealing it publicly, so they not only can talk about their anxieties but also have loved ones ready to help should something go wrong.\n\nAline Zoldbrod, a Boston-based psychologist who runs SexSmart.com and has written about infertility, said those who have miscarried may find comfort from a therapist or support group, both of which can soothe the guilt and \u201cinherent sense of defectiveness\u201d women often feel.\n\nZoldbrod recommends loved ones avoid using lines like \u201cyou\u2019ll have another one\u201d to comfort those who have lost a pregnancy, which can come across as delegitimizing their loss. She said it can be enough to simply tell them, \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of established ceremonies, many have found peace in their own rituals or remembrances. After losing their pregnancy, Patrizio and her husband camped out together on a pullout sofa they dubbed \u201cour island\u201d \u2014 eating, sleeping, visiting with friends and crying.\n\nThey also traveled to Scotland, where they spent time hiking. One day, finding themselves alone by a lake, they held their own ceremony, reading a poem before throwing a few keepsakes from the pregnancy into the water.\n\nShaw said after finding out their baby was a girl, she and her husband named her: Cecelia.\n\nShe keeps a journal about her feelings for Cecelia, and sometimes, around the anniversary of her miscarriage, Shaw pulls out a box of cards, sonogram images and a onesie she bought on a whim while shopping with a friend, shortly after learning she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say you move on,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just your new normal.\u201d\n\nKHN\u2019s coverage of these topics is supported by The David and Lucile Packard Foundation and Heising-Simons Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Add Interest\n\nA gun-rights activist accused of being a Russian agent is negotiating a \"potential resolution\" to her criminal case, federal prosecutors and her lawyers said Friday.\n\nLawyers for Maria Butina and prosecutors in Washington made the disclosure in a joint court filing , the first acknowledgement that the 30-year-old is potentially working on a plea deal or some other conclusion to her case. It is a reversal in tone for Butina's lawyers, who have undertaken an aggressive defense from charges they have called \"overblown.\"\n\nIn fact, Butina's team, which denies she is a Russian agent, tried this week to have the case thrown out.\n\nThe case was brought by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and is unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference. But it has been part of a larger push by the Justice Department to aggressively enforce U.S. laws governing foreign agents, including those accused of working for Russia, who seek to operate in the American political system.\n\nButina was arrested over the summer and later indicted on charges of conspiracy and acting as an unregistered foreign agent.\n\nProsecutors say she used her status as a student as a cover to infiltrate the National Rifle Association and other American political organizations associated with the Republican Party during the 2016 campaign and after President Donald Trump's election.\n\nCourt papers say she relayed information she gathered in the U.S. back to a Russian official, who was sanctioned this year by the Treasury Department, and she also sought to establish back channels between American politicians and the Kremlin.\n\nHer lawyer, Robert Driscoll, has said she was just a student interested in networking with influential people in American politics and wanted to see better U.S.-Russia relations. The Russian government has advocated for her release and said the charges are \"preposterous.\"\n\nIn the latest filing, both sides asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to push back a scheduled early December hearing by two weeks to allow \"negotiations regarding a potential resolution of this matter\" to continue.\n\nChutkan granted the request Friday.

Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday he had \"very easily\" answered written questions from special counsel Robert Mueller, though he speculated that the questions had been \"tricked up\" to try to catch him in a lie. He said he hadn't submitted his answers to investigators yet.\n\n\"You have to always be careful when you answer questions with people that probably have bad intentions,\" Trump told reporters in his latest swipe at the probe into 2016 election interference and possible ties between Moscow and the president's campaign.\n\nThe president did not say when he would turn over the answers to Mueller, but his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, indicated it could happen next week. The special counsel has signaled a willingness to accept written answers on matters related to collusion with Russia. But Giuliani has said repeatedly the president would not answer Mueller's questions on possible obstruction of justice.\n\nDuring months of back-and-forth negotiations with the special counsel office, Trump's lawyers have repeatedly counseled the president against sitting down for an in-person interview.\n\nTrump's written response, though not yet delivered, signals a new phase in the Mueller probe, the year-and-a-half-long investigation that has produced guilty pleas and convictions from several top Trump aides even as the special counsel and the White House have engaged in lengthy negotiations about how \u2014 or if \u2014 the president would testify.\n\nThough he spent hours with his attorneys, Trump insisted: \"My lawyers don't write answers, I write answers.\"\n\nThe president's remarks were fresh evidence of his return to the ominous rhythms of the Russia probe after spending heady weeks enjoying adulation-soaked campaign rallies before the midterm elections.\n\nDespite Trump's insistence Friday that he's \"very happy\" with how things are going, his frustrations with the ongoing probe have been evident everywhere from his overheated Twitter feed this week to his private grousing that the special counsel may target his family. Adding to his grim outlook has been the barrage of criticism he's getting over his choice for acting attorney general and late-arriving election results that have largely been tipping toward House Democrats.\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess,\" Trump tweeted Thursday as part of a series of morning posts. The investigators don't care \"how many lives they can ruin,\" he wrote.\n\nA day later, he tried to put a rosier shine on the situation, telling reporters: \"I'm sure it will be just fine.\"\n\nThe president continued to maintain his innocence while launching new broadsides at the probe. He denied being \"agitated\" despite his outbursts the day before.\n\nAfter a relative lull in the run-up to the midterms, the Russia probe has returned to the forefront of Washington conversation and cable news chyrons. There has been widespread media coverage of two Trump allies \u2014 Roger Stone and Jerome Corsi \u2014 who say they expect to be charged.\n\nThe president has expressed concerns behind closed doors that Mueller is closing in on his inner circle, including potentially his eldest son.\n\nFor months, Trump has told confidants he fears that Donald Trump Jr., perhaps inadvertently, broke the law by being untruthful with investigators in the aftermath of a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, according to one Republican close to the White House.\n\nTrump has also complained about efforts in the Senate by his longtime foe, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, to introduce legislation to protect the special counsel, according to the officials and Republicans.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has told confidants in recent days that he is deeply frustrated by widespread criticism of his choice of Matthew Whitaker for acting attorney general, according to four officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke on condition of anonymity. Whitaker has been a vocal opponent of the special counsel probe.\n\nOne argument against Whitaker was that he has not been confirmed by Senate. Trump, in turn, contended that the criticism was unfair since Mueller also was not confirmed for his post. The special counsel position does not require confirmation, and the former FBI director was confirmed for that previous job.\n\nThe president also took note of news coverage of his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, arriving in Washington this week, potentially to meet with Mueller's investigators. Cohen has pleaded guilty to a series of crimes and has said under oath that Trump ordered him to make hush-money payments to cover up an affair. He has undertaken an unlikely public relations tour as he looks to make a deal to reduce his prison sentence.\n\nThe renewed focus on the looming threat from Mueller comes as Trump settles back into the day-to-day routines of governing after the whirlwind campaign in which he spent weeks in front of adoring rally crowds while whipping up his base with harsh rhetoric about migrants moving through Mexico.\n\nHe faced criticism from both sides of the aisle for his weekend trip to Paris, during which he scuttled a visit to a World War I ceremony due to bad weather and further strained ties with traditional Western allies.\n\nOn other topics:\n\n\u2014 Despite his insistence that Americans no longer have to fear North Korea's nuclear program, news of Pyongyang's persistent weapons program made headlines this week.\n\n\u2014 And the White House is hurriedly stepping up efforts to prepare for a series of investigations certain to be launched by Democrats once they take control of the House in January.\n\nEven as Trump mused in the West Wing about making staffing changes, he pushed back against media coverage of his recent setbacks.\n\n\"The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good,\" Trump tweeted. \"We are the envy of the world.

A Russian investigation attributed the failure to a sensor that was damaged during the rocket's final assembly.\n\nThe accident was the first aborted crew launch for the Russian space program since 1983, when two Soviet cosmonauts jettisoned after a launch pad explosion and also had a safe landing. The Russian Soyuz spacecraft is currently the only vehicle that can ferry crews to the space station.\n\nSince the October mishap, two Soyuz rockets were launched successfully from Plesetsk in northwestern Russia, while a third lifted off from French Guiana carrying satellites into orbit. They were of a different subtype than the rocket that failed in October, but the one that lifted off Friday was the same version.\n\nThe Progress ship is set to dock at the space station Sunday, delivering almost three tons of food, fuel, water and other supplies to the crew \u2014 NASA's Serena Aunon-Chancellor, Russian Sergei Prokopyev and German Alexander Gerst.\n\nIn a separate supply mission, Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket with Cygnus cargo spacecraft is scheduled to lift off Saturday and dock at the station Monday.\n\nThe current crew is scheduled to return to Earth next month after the arrival of their replacements. American astronaut Anne McClain, Canadian David Saint-Jacques and Russian Oleg Kononenko are set to go up on Dec. 3.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at the Star City space training center outside Moscow, McClain voiced confidence in the Soyuz despite October's aborted launch.\n\n\"We trust our rocket. We're ready to fly,\" she said. \"I think what we learned from the inside in October was how safe this rocket was. A lot of people called it an accident or an incident, or maybe want to use it as an example of not being safe.

Elliott's business partner, Tirrell Whittley, recalls the moment as \"deflating.\"\n\n\"It was disappointing. ... You try to figure out what is it that happened,\" Whittley said.\n\nBut as determined as Elliott and Whittley were to get the documentary to the world, they decided not to fight Franklin.\n\n\"It would just be the wrong and the wrong spirit,\" Whittley said, adding later: \"In talking to Alan, it was really around patience and saying, 'You know what? God may not have meant it right now. And that's OK. Let's just be patient. When God says it's the right time it will be the right time, not just for us but for her, for her family, for her legacy.'\"\n\nThat time has arrived, three months after Franklin's death from pancreatic cancer, with the blessing of her family. And while there are parts of \"Amazing Grace\" that are rough, from a few off-kilter camera angles to choppy editing, it's a profound, brilliant display of one of the world's greatest singers performing in her element \u2014 the church.\n\n\"It's the most important document of American popular music ever filmed,\" said Elliott. \"It's completely unique to any other experience that I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them.\"\n\nThe album \"Amazing Grace\" is one of the seminal albums in not only Franklin's discography, but the canon of American pop music. Franklin, then 29 and at the height of her fame, recorded the album in a Los Angeles church in 1972, with a full choir and an audience that included Mick Jagger, over two nights. Legendary gospel star James Cleveland directed the choir. Franklin's famed father, the Rev. CL Franklin, spoke at the pulpit in praise of his daughter while the revered gospel star Clara Ward sat in the front row.\n\nWarner Brothers Films contracted Oscar-winning director Sydney Pollack to helm the movie, with hopes it could be as popular as the concert film of Woodstock. But Pollack made critical errors, including not utilizing a machine to sync the audio to the visuals. With such problems, the film was written off by the movie studio. While the album would go double platinum and become one of best-selling gospel album of all time, the film was forgotten \u2014 but not by everyone.\n\nJerry Wexler, the renowned Atlantic Records producer who helmed many of Franklin's greatest hits, told Elliott \u2014 his protege, a then-25-year-old music executive \u2014 about his hopes to one day get the film to screen, and it would become Elliott's \"passion project\" for two decades.\n\nAccording to Sabrina Owens, Franklin's niece, the legend spoke about her love for the film. But by the time Elliott and Whittley were ready to release it, Franklin wasn't ready for the world to see it.\n\n\"I honestly don't know what her concerns were,\" said Owens. \"We never really discussed her business ... . I do know for a fact that she did love the movie.\"\n\nElliott suspects it may have been frustration at the poor handling of the project.\n\n\"I'm sure she was upset that Warner Films couldn't finish the movie in the way that she was expecting it to be done and that was probably something that stuck with her,\" he said.\n\nElliott spoke to Franklin about the project only once \u2014 and very briefly. Elliott went to a concert of Franklin's and afterward waited backstage for the Queen of Soul to beckon him, and when she did, he nervously talked about the film project he had embarked on with Wexler.\n\n\"And she said, 'Yes we'll be talking.' And she walked away.\"\n\nHe never spoke to her after that, but kept in touch with her family over the years, particularly Owens, to give her updates on the project. After the Telluride injunction, Elliott reached out again, and Owens explained her aunt was ill. That revelation reinforced Elliott's approach to be patient; he had hoped a recovered Franklin would be involved in the project at some point.\n\n\"There was no place to have her be a part of the movie while she was not doing well,\" he said. \"We didn't know how sick she was, and we didn't know how long she had been ill.\"\n\nOwens invited Elliott to Franklin's funeral, and a few weeks later, Elliott screened the film for about 60 members of her family. The reaction was immediate and effusive, and soon afterward, the family agreed to the film's release.\n\n\"It was just interesting seeing her at that age and her voice was crystal clear, and she just sang her heart and soul out, and almost every song makes you cry or makes you feel some kind of way just like all the rest of her music,\" Owens said. \"So it was it was wonderful. I loved the performance.\"\n\n\"Amazing Grace\" does not yet have a distributor, but Whittley and Elliott are showing it in New York and Los Angeles to give it a push during Oscar season in hopes it could garner a nomination for best documentary, and it has received resplendent praise since its release.\n\n\"This film, it's going to take you to church,\" said Franklin's nephew Vaughn Franklin.\" You know, I expect to see people up on their feet, tears coming down and holding hands and laughing and joking ... the whole gamut of emotions I think is going to come out there.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Funeral prayers held in Istanbul for slain Saudi journalist", "description": "Funeral prayers have been held in Istanbul for journalist Jamal Khashoggi more than a month after his slaying at the Saudi Consulate", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/funeral-prayers-held-istanbul-slain-saudi-journalist-59240806", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_9644e2a04e6d48678a0b41705de61c28_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:20:28Z", "content": "Funeral prayers were held Friday in Istanbul for journalist Jamal Kasogi more than a month after his slaying at the Saudi Consulate.

Since securing protection in the 1970s, wolves have bounced back in the western Great Lakes states of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as in the Northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest.\n\nAbout 5,000 wolves live in the lower 48 states, occupying less than 10 percent of their historic range.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service is reviewing the wolf's status and is expected to declare they've recovered sufficiently to be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe House bill would enshrine that policy in law and restrict judicial review of listing decisions. The measure was approved, 196-180, and now goes to the Senate, where prospects are murkier.\n\nThe bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., said farmers in Wisconsin and other states are \"one step closer to having the legal means to defend their livestock from gray wolves.\"\n\nStates should be responsible for managing wolf populations, \"not Washington bureaucrats,\" Duffy said.\n\nEnvironmental groups and many Democrats slammed the bill as a last-ditch effort by Republicans to push a pro-rancher agenda after losing control of the House in this month's midterm elections.\n\n\"This final, pathetic stab at wolves exemplifies House Republicans' longstanding cruelty and contempt for our nation's wildlife,\" said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an Arizona-based environmental group.\n\n\"The American people overwhelmingly support the Endangered Species Act and the magnificent animals and plants it protects,\" Hartl said. \"We don't expect to see these disgraceful anti-wildlife votes next year under Democratic control of the House.\"\n\nLivestock industry associations representing ranchers who have to contend with wolves scaring and attacking cattle and sheep supported the bill. They said in a letter to Congress that wolf populations have recovered to the extent that the animal would have been removed from the endangered species list if not for \"activist litigants\" who \"used the judicial system to circumvent sound science and restore full ESA protections to these predators.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service said the agency is completing a review of the wolves' status in the lower 48 states and expects to make a recommendation in coming months. The agency did not take a position on the House bill."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: California wildfires leave at least 66 dead with more than 600 still missing", "description": "A public health emergency has been declared in California amid deadly wildfires.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/california-wildfires-leave-66-dead-600-missing-59247579", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181116_nwo_wildfiresMIX_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:00:07Z", "content": "Now Playing: California man stays with blind mom, battles wildfire Now Playing: Southern California wildfire latest Now Playing: Weather conditions improving but critical fire conditions still exist in California Now Playing: Toxic Bay Area air quality is amo\u2026 [+1224 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for California wildfires leave at least 66 dead with more than 600 still missing\n\nMore than a week after wildfires began tearing across California literally looks like so many dropped a bomb people are left grappling with such widespread destruction.

He was 87.\n\nGoldman's daughter, Jenny, said her father died early Friday in New York due to complications from colon cancer and pneumonia. \"So much of what's he's written can express who he was and what he was about,\" she said, adding that the last few weeks, while Goldman was ailing, revealed just how many people considered him family.\n\nGoldman, who also converted his novels \"Marathon Man,\" ''Magic\" and \"The Princess Bride\" into screenplays, clearly knew more than most about what the audience wanted, despite his famous and oft-repeated proclamation. He penned a litany of box-office hits, was an in-demand script doctor and carved some of the most indelible phrases in cinema history into the American consciousness.\n\nGoldman made political history by coining the phrase \"follow the money\" in his script for \"All the President's Men,\" adapted from the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate political scandal. The film starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Standing in the shadows, Hal Holbrook was the mystery man code-named Deep Throat who helped the reporters pursue the evidence. His advice, \"Follow the money,\" became so widely quoted that few people realized it was never said during the actual scandal.\n\nA confirmed New Yorker, Goldman declined to work in Hollywood. Instead, he would fly to Los Angeles for two-day conferences with directors and producers, then return home to fashion a script, which he did with amazing speed. In his 1985 book, \"Adventures in the Screen Trade,\" he expressed disdain for an industry that elaborately produced and tested a movie, only to see it dismissed by the public during its first weekend in theaters.\n\n\"Nobody knows anything,\" he wrote.\n\nIn the book, Goldman also summed up to the screenwriter's low stature in Hollywood. \"In terms of authority, screenwriters rank somewhere between the man who guards the studio gate and the man who runs the studio (this week),\" wrote Goldman.\n\nBut for a generation of screenwriters, including Aaron Sorkin, Goldman was a mentor.\n\n\"He was the dean of American screenwriters and generations of filmmakers will continue to walk in the footprints he laid,\" Sorkin said in a statement. \"He wrote so many unforgettable movies, so many thunderous novels and works of non-fiction, and while I'll always wish he'd written one more, I'll always be grateful for what he's left us.\"\n\nGoldman launched his writing career after receiving a master's degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. Weary of academia, he declined the chance to earn a Ph.D., choosing instead to write the novel \"The Temple of Gold\" in 10 days. Knopf agreed to publish it.\n\n\"If the book had not been taken,\" he told an interviewer, \"I would have gone into advertising ... or something.\"\n\nInstead, he wrote other novels, including \"Soldier in the Rain,\" which became a movie starring Steve McQueen. Goldman also co-authored a play and a musical with his older brother, James, but both failed on Broadway. (James Goldman would later write the historical play \"The Lion in Winter,\" which he converted to film, winning the 1968 Oscar for best adapted screenplay.)\n\nWilliam Goldman had come to screenwriting by accident after actor Cliff Robertson read one of his books, \"No Way to Treat a Lady,\" and thought it was a film treatment. After he hired the young writer to fashion a script from a short story, Goldman rushed out to buy a book on screen writing. Robertson rejected the script but found Goldman a job working on a screenplay for a British thriller. After that he adapted the Ross Macdonald novel \"The Moving Target\" into the 1966 detective film, \"Harper,\" starring Paul Newman.\n\nHe broke through in 1969 with the blockbuster \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" starring Newman and Redford. Based on the exploits of the real-life \"Hole in the Wall\" gang of bank robbers, the movie began a long association with Redford, who also appeared in \"The Hot Rock,\" ''The Great Waldo Pepper\" and \"Indecent Proposal.\" Goldman's script set a then-record $400,000 (or about $2.9 million today).\n\nThough the sum made Goldman a target in an industry that had long devalued screenwriters, the price proved worth it. \"Butch Cassidy\" was the year's biggest box office hit, grossing $102 million (or close to $700 million today).\n\n\"All the President's Men\" (1976) further enhanced Goldman's reputation as a master screenwriter, though he initially had a low opinion of the project (\"Politics were anathema at the box office, the material was talky, there was no action,\" he later wrote) and was even regretful afterward because of the production's headaches, including the use of multiple writers.\n\n\"We had a long earlier history and I'm sorry to hear of his passing,\" Redford said in a statement.\n\nOther notable Goldman films included \"The Stepford Wives,\" ''A Bridge Too Far\" and \"Misery.\" The latter, adapted from a Stephen King suspense novel, won the 1990 Oscar for Kathy Bates as lead actress.\n\nIn 1961 Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, and they had two daughters, Jenny and Susanna. The couple divorced in 1991. Goldman passed away Friday in the Manhattan home of his partner, Susan Burden.\n\nBorn in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, Goldman grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1952 and served two years in the Army.\n\nGoldman wrote more than 20 novels, some of them under pen names. \"The Princess Bride,\" published in 1973, was presented as Goldman's abridgment of an older version by \"S. Morgenstern.\" The scheme, he said, was liberating.\n\n\"I never had a writing experience like it. I went back and wrote the chapter about Bill Goldman being at the Beverly Hills Hotel and it all just came out. I never felt as strongly connected emotionally to any writing of mine in my life,\" Goldman once said. \"It was totally new and satisfying and it came as such a contrast to the world I had been doing in the films that I wanted to be a novelist again.\"\n\nThe film, directed by Rob Reiner, grew into a cult classic, adding more phrases of Goldman's to the lexicon: \"As you wish,\" ''Inconceivable!\" and \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\"\n\nReiner on Friday said he had seen Goldman just days earlier. He called \"The Princess Bride\" his favorite book. \"I was honored he allowed me to make it into a movie,\" Reiner said on Twitter.\n\nDespite all his success as a screenwriter, Goldman always considered himself a novelist. He didn't rate his scripts as great artistic achievements.\n\n\"A screenplay is a piece of carpentry,\" he once said. \"And except in the case of Ingmar Bergman, it's not an art, it's a craft.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe late AP Entertainment Writer Bob Thomas contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Missing-persons list tops 600 in fire-stricken California - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Missing-persons list tops 600 in fire-stricken California ABC News The potential magnitude of the wildfire disaster in Northern California escalated as officials raised the death toll to 63 and released a missing-persons list with 631 names on it mor\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/fire-death-toll-hits-63-sheriff-hundreds-missing-59235927", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_ab7e7dc8d5454fb5b1b16243bf877010_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:42:00Z", "content": "The potential magnitude of the wildfire disaster in Northern California escalated as officials raised the death toll to 63 and released a missing-persons list with 631 names on it more than a week after the flames swept through.

Others have been located and are safe, but authorities haven't gotten around to marking them as found.\n\nTamara Conry said she should never have been on the list.\n\n\"My husband and I are not missing and never were!\" Conry wrote Thursday night on Facebook. \"We have no family looking for us. ... I called and left a message to take our names off.\"\n\nAuthorities compiled the list by going back to listen to all the dispatch calls they received since the fire started, to make sure they didn't miss anyone.\n\nIn last year's catastrophic wildfires in California wine country, Sonoma County authorities at one point listed more than 2,000 people as missing. But they slowly whittled down the number. In the end, 44 people died in several counties.\n\nThe wildfire this time all but razed the town of Paradise, population 27,000, and heavily damaged the outlying communities of Magalia and Concow on Nov. 8, destroying 9,700 houses and 144 apartment buildings, authorities said.\n\nFirefighters were gaining ground against the blaze, which blackened 222 square miles (575 square kilometers). It was 45 percent contained and posed no immediate threat to populated areas. Crews managed to stop it from spreading toward Oroville, population 19,000.\n\nThis patch of California, a former Gold Rush region in the Sierra Nevada foothills, is to some extent Trump country, with Trump beating Hillary Clinton in Butte County by 4 percentage points in 2016.\n\nBut some survivors resent that Trump took to Twitter two days after the disaster to blame the wildfires on poor forest mismanagement. He threatened to withhold federal payments from California.\n\n\"If you insult people, then you go visit them, how do you think you're going to be accepted? You're not going to have a parade,\" Maggie Crowder of Magalia said Thursday outside an informal shelter at a Walmart parking lot in Chico.\n\nBut Stacy Lazzarino, who voted for Trump, said it would be good for the president to see the devastation up close: \"I think by maybe seeing it he's going to be like 'Oh, my goodness,' and it might start opening people's eyes.\"\n\nIn his Fox News interview on the eve of his visit, the president repeated his criticism. Asked if he thought climate change contributed to the fires, he said, \"Maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management.\"\n\nNick Shawkey, a captain with the state fire agency, said the president's tweet blaming poor forest management was based on a \"misunderstanding.\" The federal government manages 46 percent of land in California.\n\n\"The thing he's tweeting about is his property,\" Shawkey said.\n\nCalifornia's outgoing and incoming governors said they would join Trump on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats Gov. Jerry Brown and governor-elect Gavin Newsom said they welcomed the president's visit and \"now is a time to pull together for the people of California.\" Brown and Newsom have been vocal critics of Trump.\n\nThere were also worries the presidential visit would be disruptive.\n\n\"It's already a zoo here and I don't care who the president is. He needs to wait because the traffic's already horrendous,\" said Charlotte Harkness, whose home in Paradise burned down. \"He could just tweet something nice \u2014 three words: 'I am sorry,' and that's fine.\"\n\nMore than 450 searchers continued looking for human remains in the ashes.\n\nAround 52,000 people have been driven out and have gone to shelters, motels and the homes of friends and relatives. With winter coming on, many are seeking answers on what assistance will be provided.\n\nAt the Chico Mall where the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others set up an assistance center, 68-year-old Richard Wilson sought information about lodging. His wife is nearly bedridden from lupus and fibromyalgia.\n\n\"We're having to stay at a Marriott, which is like $100 a night, and we're running out of money,\" Wilson said as he stood outside in rubber sandals and no socks \u2014 the only footwear he had when he fled the flames that destroyed his home.\n\nIn Southern California , meanwhile, more residents were being allowed back in their homes near Los Angeles after a blaze torched an area the size of Denver and destroyed more than 600 homes and other structures. The blaze was 69 percent contained, authorities said.\n\nAt least three deaths were reported.\n\nSchools across a large swath of the state were closed because of smoke, and San Francisco's world-famous open-air cable cars were pulled off the streets.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press reporters Janie Har and Olga Rodriguez in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Crowder spoke by Walmart and that Wilson spoke at an assistance center."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Mariah Carey belts out 'All I Want for Christmas is You' to celebrate NYC's first snow of the season - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Mariah Carey belts out 'All I Want for Christmas is You' to celebrate NYC's first snow of the season ABC News It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but pop star Mariah Carey is already in the Christmas spirit.

The Connecticut U.S. Attorney's Office, which is defending the Navy against the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nIn a court filing, a federal prosecutor listed several reasons why a class-action lawsuit should be rejected, including that the plaintiffs could reapply for discharge upgrades under new rules put in place last year that call for more leniency for veterans with mental health problems.\n\nYale Law School students are representing the veterans and have filed a similar lawsuit against the Army. They say nearly a third of the more than 2 million Americans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD and related mental health conditions and the military is issuing less-than-honorable discharges at historically high rates, often for minor infractions attributable to undiagnosed mental illness.\n\nLast year, the discharge review boards for the Army and Air Force granted about 51 percent of discharge upgrade applications involving PTSD, while the Navy board granted only 16 percent. Haight called the discrepancy \"stark.\"\n\nAnother plaintiff in the Navy lawsuit, which was filed in March, is the Connecticut-based National Veterans Council for Legal Redress, a group of veterans with less-than-honorable discharges.\n\n\"We filed this lawsuit to make sure that the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with service-connected PTSD do not suffer the same injustices as the Vietnam generation,\" said Garry Monk, executive director of the veterans group. \"We are thrilled with the court's decision and look forward to creating a world where it doesn't take years of wading through unlawful procedures for these veterans to get relief.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Meghan Keneally", "title": "Twitter lights up after journalist comments on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's outfit", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, is the center of some Twitter tussles.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/twitter-lights-journalist-comments-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-outfit/story?id=59243303", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-washington-01-ap-jc-181116_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:29:17Z", "content": "The newly-elected youngest member of Congress is teaching D.C. a thing or two about the Twitter verse.

Add Interest\n\nThe Tubbs Fire burned 36,000 acres last fall and was the most destructive wildfire in state history until last week\u2019s Camp Fire set ablaze over three times as much land in a neighboring county.\n\n\"A lot of that night seems like a complete blur,\" said Assistant Fire Marshal Paul Lowenthal about the fateful night of October 8, 2017, when the Tubbs Fire overtook the quiet suburb of Santa Rosa. \"I just remember hearing sirens... it seemed like for days.\"\n\nFor some, the fire came without warning and dealt a vicious hand. In its wake, it left utter devastation with whole neighborhoods reduced to ash.\n\nEarlier that night, around 11 p.m., Lowenthal, who lives in Santa Rosa, got a call from work \u2013 there was a fire over in neighboring Napa County, and he needed to respond to it. On his way there, his car became surrounded by flames. He quickly found himself in the midst of a raging wildfire.\n\nLowenthal realized that the fire was too massive and intense to try and fight, so instead he turned his attention to saving lives; but it was the middle of the night, and most of the city was asleep \u2013 so Lowenthal called the Santa Rosa Police Department for help.\n\n\"It seemed like in a matter of moments, you just heard sirens coming from all directions,\" he said. \"Those police officers just dove in without asking questions and immediately started going door to door and getting people out of harm's way.\"\n\nWith body cameras rolling, the police officers were deployed to areas where they thought they fire was going, but the winds that night had a mind of their own.\n\n\"We were seeing embers the size of quarters to the size of footballs flying through the sky,\" Lowenthal remembered.\n\nPlay\n\nThe wind pushed the fire farther than first responders had anticipated \u2013 leaving some residents in the Santa Rosa neighborhood of Coffey Park unaware of what was headed their way.\n\n\"It was the loudest wind I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. It was like, just a barreling sound of nonstop wind,\" Kate Higgins remembered.\n\n\"I went out to the front yard and seeing it was really windy and smoky and ash was flying,\" her husband Charlie Higgins said. \"Then within that, like less than five seconds, I looked back and there was a wall of red. I figured by the way the wind was blowing, that house was gonna be burned down within 15 minutes.\"\n\nABC News\n\nJeff Okrepkie said he and his wife had no time to even process what was happening. \"It was like, 'Grab the dogs. Grab some clothes.' I mean we literally pulled a duffel bag out. We grabbed some of our son's stuff, put it all in a duffel bag. It was one duffel bag for the three of us. I get in my car, I turn the corner. And right as I turn the corner, there\u2019s somebody\u2019s lawn on fire. I see flames coming up from over the rooftops. And that\u2019s when it registered with me -- This is bad. This is real bad.\"\n\nIn another area of Coffey Park, Ken and Nancy Mazzoni were unaware of how dire the situation was. Nancy said she and her husband believed that the Santa Rosa Fire Department would be able to put the fire out. \"The fire department had to be ... they had to be coming. They've got this... we\u2019re gonna help.\"\n\nPolice officers approached their house, urging Ken to evacuate, but Ken, holding a hose, asserted that he was \"going to fight it out.\"\n\nAt the time, Nancy and Ken didn\u2019t realize that whole chunks of their neighborhood were already engulfed in flames. The fire just hadn\u2019t reached their house yet.\n\n\"He couldn\u2019t grasp it. We were in shock,\" Nancy said.\n\nBut terror soon set in when Nancy began to see her block on fire. \"There were 30-foot flames in the house across the street from us. All you saw was fire.\"\n\nWith only seconds to spare, Nancy and Ken fled their home.\n\nThe fire spread throughout multiple neighborhoods in Santa Rosa. \"It was literally structure after structure after structure burning. Thousands of structures all on fire within a matter of hours. ... It [was] completely wiping out, not only residential neighborhoods, but commercial areas,\" Lowenthal said. The Press Democrat's photographer, Kent Porter, captured much of the devastation that night.\n\nBut for all the chaos and fear, the strength of Santa Rosa\u2019s citizens was undiminished. The best parts of humanity were on display that night -- from the city\u2019s police officers to its bus drivers, who volunteered their time to drive their buses through the flames to help evacuate dozens of the elderly.\n\nSo much of that night was comprised of life changing, split-second decisions to choose courage over fear.\n\nAt the Kathleen Rose Gardens Assisted Living Facility, Mario Monte was the sole nurse on duty. When a police officer approached the building urging Mario to evacuate, Mario told him that he couldn\u2019t leave - he had five elderly ladies in the house with him that needed help.\n\nWhile the police officer sought backup, Mario began waking the residents up and wheeling them out the front door.\n\n87-year-old Irene Lopez was one of the facility\u2019s residents. When Officer Adams arrived on scene, Mario directed him to Irene. Officer Adams wheeled her out of the house and loaded her into the back of his car while embers rained down upon them.\n\nAdams safely drove Irene to an evacuation shelter where she was welcomed by first responders, volunteers and a mass of evacuees - so many afraid of what the morning held.\n\nWhen a new day dawned, Santa Rosa\u2019s residents slowly returned to find the community they once knew, now unfamiliar.\n\nJeff Okrepkie came home to a pile of ruins where his house once stood.\n\n\"We're driving to our house, and we actually passed our street because everything was burnt,\" Okrepkie remembered. \"It was hard to take in, and it was hard to really grasp for a while.\"\n\nHe said many referred to the destruction as a \"war zone,\" a term he feels correctly depicts what he saw.\n\n\"My neighbors - I had some that owned guns and were hunters, and they had gun safes, and all those rounds cooked off. So, the street was littered with shells and bullets.\"\n\n\"I wanted to be sick,\" Kate Higgins said of returning to the ruins of her home. \"Everything we've worked for, all of the things that, you know, we treasured, the gifts from relatives, all of the photos. It's all gone.'\"\n\n\"We had stone columns in front of our house. And those were the only things standing,\" her husband remembered. On those two stone columns, her husband hung an American flag. It would become a symbol of the community\u2019s strength and perseverance.\n\nOkrepkie said in the days and weeks after, he became frustrated when he heard people say, \"'They\u2019re just things. It\u2019s just stuff.' In your mind, you... just wanna cuss 'em out. Because it\u2019s \u2026 not 'just stuff.' It\u2019s the memorial flag for my wife\u2019s father. My wife lost her dad in Iraq in 2004, and that's all we had left of him. And... it's my son's favorite toy... It's the ornaments that I had from when I was four or five years old. Those aren't just things. Those are... remnants of our lives.\"\n\nJeff Okrepkie\n\nThe fire laid waste to more than 3,000 residences in Santa Rosa. Some of these included the homes of first responders who worked tirelessly to evacuate others... like the house of firefighter Paul Lowenthal.\n\n\"I was one of seven other firefighters that lost their home that night, and all of us were 100% committed to our jobs... when it kinda finally hit me, it was day five,\" Lowenthal said. He says he worked for five days straight after his home was destroyed in the fire.\n\nLowenthal said that his fire chief Tony Gossner, and the battalion chief of Cal Fire, Jonathan Cox, finally both told him to take a break.\n\nABC News\n\n\"I looked at him and said, 'I don't really-- where, what do you want me to do? I don't really have anything to go to,'\" Lowenthal said.\n\nHe says the hardest part was having to break the news to his then 9-year-old daughter.\n\n\"Trying to explain to my daughter that our home... was destroyed in the fire\u2026 It was one of the most difficult conversations I have had,\" he said.\n\nLowenthal is now rebuilding his home. Of the 3,062 residences in Santa Rosa that were destroyed by the fire, 788 are currently under construction. 55 are completed.\n\nNancy and Ken are also rebuilding their home and hope to move back in by the end of this year, as do Kate and Charlie Higgins.\n\nNancy Mazzoni\n\n\"Every time we come and there\u2019s a little bit more done, it means we\u2019re a little closer to being back home,\" Higgins said. \"Feels like a little piece of me was being put back together.\"\n\nCompounding Kate\u2019s loss, her mother passed away last Christmas Eve. She says she wants nothing more than to be home in her new house when that difficult anniversary hits.\n\nAfter living in homes in fire prone areas-- so many in Santa Rosa have a constant fear that disaster could strike again. Climate science has found that longer, dryer periods, have created tinderbox conditions, that when sparked, and mixed with coastal winds, are leading to high-speed infernos, like the one we saw earlier this week that destroyed the town of Paradise, California.\n\n\"Northern California seems to be the spot where we're seeing the destructive wildfires,\" Paul Lowenthal said. \"We're seein' 'em time and time again. So it's definitely becoming the new norm.\"\n\n\"The only good thing that\u2019s come out of this disaster is the neighborhood coming together and being more of a family,\" Jeff Okrepkie\u2019s wife, Stephanie, said. \"We\u2019re stronger together now than we were a year ago.\"\n\nBeautiful bonds were forged in that fire \u2013 like the one between 87-year-old Irene Lopez and Santa Rosa police officer Andy Adams. One year after the night of the fire, she finally got to say thank you to Adams for selflessly rescuing her from her senior care home.\n\nABC News\n\n\"I\u2019m alive thanks to you,\" Lopez said. \"I\u2019m not gonna forget... I thank God every night and I pray for your family too.\"\n\nJeff Okrepkie now runs a neighborhood organization called \"Coffey Strong.\" On the one year anniversary of the fire, the group organized a vigil, where more than a hundred people gathered together in Coffey Park to commemorate the lives of those lost and to honor the strength of their community.\n\nPlay\n\nSanta Rosa resident, Ronnie Duvall, hung lights from trees. This Christmas, he plans to have \"Christmas in Coffey Park,\" complete with lights and Christmas trees.

Add Interest\n\nWhile the report did not say what kind of weapon it was, the announcement comes amid some renewed tensions with the U.S. and an impasse in talks over its nuclear weapons program.\n\nJust last week, North Korea\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator abruptly canceled a trip to New York to meet Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with those talks now postponed.\n\nThe North Korean regime also announced Friday that it had detained an American last month and would release him soon \u2013 a gesture of goodwill despite the weapon test.\n\nNorth Korean state media did not show the test, but said Kim was visiting a test site \u2013 the first time he has supervised a weapons test since their last missile launch, an intercontinental ballistic missile tested in November 2017. The weapon\u2019s development began under Kim\u2019s father Kim Jong Il and its success made the young dictator miss him \u201cvery much,\u201d state media reported.\n\nA U.S. official told ABC News there was no missile launch and no missile trajectories were detected. At this point, they say this was probably a small tactical weapon, but an assessment is still underway.\n\nPerhaps a troubling sign, a second official told ABC News there is no intelligence on the North Korea report beyond what state media has revealed.\n\nBut the Trump administration is trying to lower concerns about the test, brushing it off as bravado and a tit-for-tat response to recent developments.\n\n\u201cWe remain confident that the promises made by President Trump and Chairman Kim will be fulfilled,\u201d a State Department official told ABC News.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea militaries conducted unit-level joint training earlier this month, exercises that the Pentagon says were never canceled as part of the agreement at the Singapore summit in June, while command-level major exercises were. But North Korea did not make a distinction and protested the training as an aggressive move by its neighbor and the U.S.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nIt was also reported Monday that the country continues to develop ballistic missile sites at more than a dozen locations, according to a new report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Beyond Parallel project.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the U.S. will not require North Korea to provide a full list of its nuclear weapons facilities before Trump and Kim meet again \u2013 an important demand that Pompeo had been pursuing in his talks, but that North Korea had been denying.\n\nInstead, Pence told NBC News in an interview, the U.S. wants the outcome of that meeting to be a plan to identify all of North Korea\u2019s weapons and sites, grant inspectors access to them, and outline how to dismantle them \u2013 a tall order that critics say should have been outlined and agreed to before Trump ever met Kim.\n\nNorth Korea also announced it will deport an American citizen it detained on October 16 for illegally entering the country from China, according to state media. They said the man, reportedly named Bruce Byron Lowrance, will be released.\n\nThe State Department would only say that they are \"aware of reports of the release of a US citizen who had been detained by the DPRK,\" but provided no other details."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Music Review: Anderson.Paak cruises home on 'Oxnard\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

He was 87.\n\nGoldman's daughter Jenny said her father died early Friday in New York due to complications from colon cancer and pneumonia. \"So much of what's he's written can express who he was and what he was about,\" she said, adding that the last few weeks, while Goldman was ailing, revealed just how many people considered him family.\n\nGoldman, who also converted his novels \"Marathon Man,\" ''Magic,\" ''The Princess Bride\" and \"Heat\" into screenplays, clearly knew more than most about what the audience wanted. He was not only a successful film writer but a top script doctor, the industry title for an uncredited writer brought in to improve or \"punch up\" weak screenplays.\n\nGoldman also made political history by coining the phrase \"follow the money\" in his script for \"All the President's Men,\" adapted from the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate political scandal. The film starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Standing in the shadows, Hal Holbrook was the mystery man code-named Deep Throat who helped the reporters pursue the evidence. His advice, \"Follow the money,\" became so widely quoted that few people realized it was never said during the actual scandal.\n\nA confirmed New Yorker, Goldman declined to work in Hollywood. Instead, he would fly to Los Angeles for two-day conferences with directors and producers, then return home to fashion a script, which he did with amazing speed. In his 1985 book, \"Adventures in the Screen Trade,\" he expressed disdain for an industry that elaborately produced and tested a movie, only to see it dismissed by the public during its first weekend in theaters.\n\n\"Nobody knows anything,\" he remarked.\n\nScreenwriter and filmmaker Aaron Sorkin called Goldman a mentor.\n\n\"He was the dean of American screenwriters and generations of filmmakers will continue to walk in the footprints he laid,\" Sorkin said in a statement. \"He wrote so many unforgettable movies, so many thunderous novels and works of non-fiction, and while I'll always wish he'd written one more, I'll always be grateful for what he's left us.\"\n\nGoldman launched his writing career after receiving a master's degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. Weary of academia, he declined the chance to earn a Ph.D., choosing instead to write the novel \"The Temple of Gold\" in 10 days. Knopf agreed to publish it.\n\n\"If the book had not been taken,\" he told an interviewer, \"I would have gone into advertising ... or something.\"\n\nInstead, he wrote other novels, including \"Soldier in the Rain,\" which became a movie starring Steve McQueen. Goldman also co-authored a play and a musical with his older brother, James, but both failed on Broadway.\n\nJames Goldman would later write the historical play \"The Lion in Winter,\" which he converted to film, winning the 1968 Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nWilliam Goldman had come to screenwriting by accident after actor Cliff Robertson read one of his books, \"No Way to Treat a Lady,\" and thought it was a film treatment. After he hired the young writer to fashion a script from a short story, Goldman rushed out to buy a book on screen writing. Robertson rejected the script but found Goldman a job working on a screenplay for a British thriller. After that he adapted his novel \"Harper\" for a 1966 film starring Paul Newman as a private eye.\n\nHe broke through in 1969 with the blockbuster \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" starring Newman and Redford. Based on the exploits of the real-life \"Hole in the Wall\" gang of bank robbers, the movie began a long association with Redford, who also appeared in \"The Hot Rock,\" ''The Great Waldo Pepper\" and \"Indecent Proposal.\"\n\nOther notable Goldman films included \"The Stepford Wives,\" ''A Bridge Too Far\" and \"Misery.\" The latter, adapted from a Stephen King suspense novel, won the 1990 Oscar for Kathy Bates as lead actress.\n\nIn 1961 Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, and they had two daughters, Jenny and Susanna. The couple divorced in 1991.\n\nBorn in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, Goldman grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1952 and served two years in the Army.\n\nDespite all his success as a screenwriter, Goldman always considered himself a novelist and didn't rate his scripts as great artistic achievements.\n\n\"A screenplay is a piece of carpentry,\" he once said. \"And except in the case of Ingmar Bergman, it's not an art, it's a craft.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe late AP Entertainment Writer Bob Thomas contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Shawn Slater", "title": "Captain Marvel Touches Down at Disney California Adventure Park in Early 2019", "description": "Early next year, Super Hero fans will flash back to the \u201890s when \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d opens in theaters on March 8, 2019, and for a limited time, Disney California Adventure park guests will have the opportunity to encounter Captain Marvel herself.", "url": "https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2018/11/captain-marvel-touches-down-at-disney-california-adventure-park-in-early-2019/", "urlToImage": "https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sdlf1831.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:01:58Z", "content": "Early next year, Super Hero fans will flash back to the 90s when Captain Marvel opens in theaters on March 8, 2019, and for a limited time, Disneyland Resort guests will have the opportunity to encounter Captain Marvel herself.

Add Interest\n\nAcosta was allowed back into the White House Friday afternoon and participated in a press gaggle on the North Lawn.\n\nCNN filed a lawsuit suit earlier this week claiming that revoking Acosta's press pass to the White House, known as a \"hard pass,\" violated the First Amendment.\n\nPresident Trump, whose back-and-forth with Acosta, had become particularly tense over the past few months, weighed in on Friday saying that the White House is writing rules and regulations that would offer guidance related to the press corps.\n\n\"You can't take three questions and four questions and just stand up and not sit down. Decorum you have to practice decorum,\" Trump said in response to questions about the ruling. \"We want total freedom of the press. That's very important it\u2019s more important to me than anybody would believe. But you have to act with respect, you\u2019re in the White House.\"\n\nCarlos Barria/Reuters\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly repeatedly emphasized that his decision to return Acosta's press pass as litigation continues was based on the Fifth Amendment, under which the judge ruled Acosta was denied his right to due process. Due process would give Acosta and CNN the chance to rebut and challenge the appropriateness of the government\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cI do hold that plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claim that adequate process was not provided to Mr. Acosta,\u201d the judge said, rejecting the government's argument that statements from White House officials issued after Acosta's pass was revoked sufficed.\n\n\u201cIndeed, whatever process occurred within the government is still so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me at oral argument who made the initial decision to revoke Mr. Acosta\u2019s press pass,\u201d the judge added.\n\nAcosta was stripped of his credentials, without warning, when he returned to the White House, where he works daily, after a heated exchange between Trump and Acosta at a press conference on Nov. 7.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Kelly made clear that the ruling, which is only the beginning of the court proceedings to decide Acosta\u2019s White House access, was narrow and didn\u2019t determine whether or not Acosta\u2019s First Amendment right was violated.\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize the very limited nature of today\u2019s ruling,\u201d he said of his decision to grant the temporary restraining order that restores Acosta\u2019s press pass.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve found that it must be granted as to the due process claim, I haven\u2019t had to reach the plaintiffs First Amendment claim at all, in which they alleged that the government engaged in viewpoint or content discrimination,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cSo I want to make very clear I have not determined the First Amendment was violated here,\u201d Kelly said, adding that he had not determined what legal standard would apply to the claim or how the 1971 case of Sherrill v. Knight, relied heavily upon by CNN\u2019s legal team, would bind the judge, if at all.\n\nThe judge also said during the ruling, in addressing an argument from the government during the first hearing, that \u201cthe public doesn\u2019t have a general First Amendment right to enter the White House grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no quarrel with that at all,\u201d the judge said.\n\nBut, Kelly said, Sherrill v. Knight holds that \u201conce the White House opens up a portion of it to reporters for their use, some kind of First Amendment liberty interest protected by a due process right is created and I simply have no choice but to apply that precedent here.\u201d\n\nResponding to the decision, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders focused on Kelly\u2019s comments on the First Amendment, despite the judge\u2019s comments about his lack of a decision on that specific claim.\n\n\u201cToday, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\"We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House,\" Sanders said.\n\nProceedings are expected to continue next week, and Kelly made it clear that the door was still open for changes in Acosta\u2019s White House access.\n\n\"If at some point after restoring the hard pass the government would like to move to vacate the restraining order on the grounds that it has fulfilled its due process obligations then it may, of course, do so and I will promptly address that and then the remaining basis of the temporary restraining order.\"\n\nSpeaking after the ruling, Ted Boutros, an attorney for CNN said the news organization is \"extremely pleased with the ruling today.\"\n\n\"A great day for the First Amendment and journalism,\" he said. \"We're very excited to have Mr. Acosta be able to go back and get his hard pass and report the news about the White House.\"\n\nAcosta thanked journalistic colleagues for their support and the judge for his ruling.\n\n\"Let's go back to work,\" Acosta said.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nEarlier in the week, CNN and Acosta filed an emergency motion to have Acosta\u2019s press pass immediately reinstated as the court case continues and asked for a ruling from Kelly, a Trump-appointed U.S. district judge.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union in a statement applauded Friday's ruling saying it \"reaffirms that no one, not even the president, is above the law.\n\n\"The White House surely hoped that expelling a reporter would deter forceful questioning, but the court's ruling will have the opposite effect,\" Ben Wizner, the ACLU's director of speech, privacy and technology project wrote in a statement. \"The freedom of the press is a bedrock principle, and our democracy is strengthened when journalists challenge our leaders rather than defer to them.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Holocaust scholar sues group that said he 'slandered' Poland", "description": "A prominent Holocaust researcher says he is suing a Polish organization for libel after it waged a public campaign last year accusing him of slandering Poland's good name for research exploring Polish violence against Jews during World War II", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/holocaust-scholar-sues-group-slandered-poland-59243099", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:40:43Z", "content": "A prominent Holocaust researcher said Friday he is suing a Polish organization for libel after it waged a public campaign last year accusing him of slandering Poland's good name for his work exploring Polish violence against Jews during World War II.

Last year, the league said Grabowski \"falsifies the history of Poland, proclaiming the thesis that Poles are complicit in the extermination of Jews.\"\n\n\"During World War II, due to the demoralizing circumstances and German actions, it is true that vile-acting individuals could be found among Poles and Jews alike,\" the group wrote in a statement signed by dozens of Polish academics. \"Yet, we should remember that the objective of the Germans was also to 'eradicate the Polish nation' and 'completely destroy Poland.'\"\n\nThe anti-defamation organization has been part of a broader effort under the government of the populist Law and Justice party to challenge research on Polish participation in the killing of Jews by Nazi Germany. Poland was under German occupation during World War II.\n\n\"What is important, from my point of view, is that the militant nationalists who nowadays hold sway in Poland be warned that they will be held to account, that they are wrong if they think that their outrageous statements and slanders will go unnoticed,\" Grabowski, who was born and attended university in Warsaw, told the AP.\n\nOfficial efforts under the Law and Justice government have included promoting the memory of the Polish gentiles who sheltered Jews during the war. Scholars who research Polish violence against Jews have faced censure and prosecution.\n\nThe issue came under international scrutiny earlier this year when Polish lawmakers voted to make it illegal to blame the nation for Holocaust crimes. The law has since been amended to remove prison as a possible punishment for violators, though individuals can still be tried and fined. The measure created a rift with Israel and was also condemned by the U.S.\n\nAlso Friday, the Polish ambassador to Germany, Andrzej Przylebski, accused Germans of frequently reducing World War II to the Holocaust \"as if Adolf Hitler was primarily or exclusively concerned with the murder of European Jews.\"\n\nAt a Berlin conference attended by the German foreign minister, Przylebski said Polish victims \"are almost completely forgotten or downplayed,\" according to a report from the Wirtualna Polska news portal.\n\nGrabowski's \"Hunt for the Jews: Betrayal and Murder in German-Occupied Poland\" documents the involvement of Poles in one rural area in finding and killing Jews who had escaped from ghettos and were trying to survive by hiding among gentiles. It was awarded the 2014 Yad Vashem International Book Prize for Holocaust Research.\n\nThe book also sparked heated debates, and the scholar says he received death threats after its publication. After a German newspaper reviewed the book favorably, a far-right Polish website ran an article with a photograph of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The headline was \"Sieg Heil, Herr Grabowski, Three Times Sieg Heil.\"\n\nGrabowski successfully sued for libel."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: CNN's Jim Acosta arrives at District Court to appeal for White House press pass", "description": "The reporter had his press credentials revoked after a tense exchange with President Trump.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/cnns-jim-acosta-arrives-district-court-appeal-white-59243864", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181116_vod_orig_acosta_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:38:28Z", "content": "Now Playing: Major networks back CNN and Jim Acosta Now Playing: CNN sues Trump, aides over suspending reporter's press pass Now Playing: President Trump's combative exchanges with the press Now Playing: Painting fetches $90M in record-setting auction Now Pla\u2026 [+1133 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for CNN's Jim Acosta arrives at District Court to appeal for White House press pass\n\n--\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: Hamas abides by cease-fire, restrains protests - ABC News", "description": "ABC News The Latest: Hamas abides by cease-fire, restrains protests ABC News The Latest on the political developments in Israel (all times local):. 5:35 p.m..

And she has spent her entire premiership trying to deliver on the voters' decision.\n\nBefore the referendum, May had backed remaining in the bloc, but she has become one of the staunchest advocates of Brexit. \"Brexit means Brexit,\" became her mantra \u2014 a meaningless one, according to her detractors.\n\nFor a time, May was able to unite the warring factions of her party. But her authority was severely dented when she gambled in April 2017 by calling a snap election in hopes of strengthening her hand in divorce negotiations with the EU \u2014 only to lose her majority in Parliament.\n\nMay kept her government going by cobbling together a deal with the small Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland. It is now threatening to withdraw its support because of opposition to her Brexit deal.\n\nMuch of May's Conservative Party also hates the agreement, struck after a year and a half of tough negotiations between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe pro-Brexit wing of the party says it gives too much away and will leave Britain bound to EU rules after it leaves. Pro-EU Conservatives criticize May for ruling out a softer Brexit in which Britain remains in the EU's single market and customs union.\n\nMay vowed this week that she would \"see this through\" and secure Parliament's backing for her deal.\n\nFew doubt her fortitude and commitment to an idea of public service instilled in her upbringing as the daughter of an Anglican vicar.\n\nMay was first elected to Parliament in 1997, and soon established a reputation for unflashy competence and a knack for vanquishing her rivals.\n\nShe served for six years in the notoriously thankless job of home secretary, responsible for borders, immigration and law and order. In 2016 she beat flashier and better-known politicians, including flamboyant Brexit-backer Boris Johnson, to the post of prime minister.\n\nBut stubbornness alone may not be enough.\n\nAs Britain's second female prime minister, May is inevitably compared to the first, Margaret Thatcher, whose steely determination May admires.\n\nIn November 1990, Thatcher faced a leadership challenge from Conservative rivals. She won the ballot, but not by enough to avoid a second-round vote.\n\n\"I shall fight on,\" Thatcher said defiantly. \"I fight to win.\"\n\nWithin a week, she had been replaced."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Islamic State group suspect arrested, charged in Germany", "description": "German prosecutors say they've charged a 32-year-old Syrian man with membership in a terrorist organization for alleged involvement with the extremist Islamic State group", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/islamic-state-group-suspect-arrested-charged-germany-59243103", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:01:05Z", "content": "German prosecutors say they've charged a 32-year-old Syria n man with membership in a terrorist organization for alleged involvement with the extremist Islamic State group.

Add Interest\n\nThe move to rework guidelines put in place during the Obama administration is aimed at college campuses and universities, where one in four women who are seniors say they have experienced unwanted and nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college, according to the latest government survey.\n\nThe administration's approach, led by the Education Department under Secretary Betsy DeVos, comes in the era of #MeToo, in which victims' rights groups have said more should be done to protect survivors of sexual assault and to encourage women to speak up against harassment.\n\n\"Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\" DeVos said in a statement.\n\n\"We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it while ensuring a fair grievance process,\" she added. \"Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function.\u201d\n\nThe rules, once posted online, are subject to public comment for 60 days. Depending upon the public's response, the Education Department will decide whether to make the rules final.\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\n\nA small group of mens' rights groups have pushed for the changes, contending that schools have gone too far and provided little due process to the accused. That criticism has resonated with several White House supporters, including President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., who has said he's more worried about his sons than to his daughters in the #MeToo era.\n\nCynthia P. Garrett, co-president of a group called \"Families Advocating for Campus Equality,\" said she's been pushing for many of the changes included in the latest proposal because they give students accused of misconduct better opportunities to defend themselves. She said most campus sexual misconduct cases she's seen \"involve the lack of affirmative consent, regretted sex, not life-threatening, criminal conduct.\"\n\nThe proposal got an immediate nod from a top Senate Republican who oversees education issues. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said in a statement that \"the department\u2019s approach seems to balance fairness and support for survivors.\"\n\nBut women's rights groups are pushing back.\n\nThey argue the new approach would unfairly tilt investigations in favor of the perpetrator and dramatically reduce the number of women willing to come forward. They contend the new rules would encourage colleges and universities to become more complacent when it comes to addressing allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nFatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women's Law Center, said the new rules would radically weaken federal oversight of colleges responding to campus assault and sexual harassment and would make schools \"more dangerous.\"\n\nShe signaled that her group would fight the guidelines from taking effect.\n\n\"Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, hear us loud and clear: attacks on Title IX are attacks on students' dignity and safety - and we will not tolerate it,\" she said.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAt issue are the federal guidelines for Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits gender discrimination in any education program that receives federal funding. Under that law, sexual harassment and assault if a form of unlawful discrimination. If schools reject the guidance, they can lose billions of dollars in federal assistance.\n\nOne of the biggest changes to the rule would be a new definition of sexual harassment. Under Obama, it was defined it as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\" The new rule would define sexual harassment as unwanted sexual conduct that is \"so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity.\"\n\nThat definition would likely dramatically narrow the number of harassment cases a college or university would consider because the victim would have to show that the misconduct prevents them from receiving an education or participating in an activity. The Education Department says it based its definition on a 1999 Supreme Court case that held student-on-student sexual harassment could constitute discrimination.\n\nThe guidelines also require that any alleged harassment \"must involve conduct that occurred within the school's own program or activity.\" That could include off-campus activities if they are tied to the school.\n\nAnother major change would guarantee someone accused of sexual misconduct would be given the right to cross-examine their accuser, but only through an intermediary such as an adviser or an attorney.\n\nThe proposal follows a bruising Supreme Court confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault at a house party when he was in high school three decades earlier. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the account and was subsequently endorsed by the Senate in a narrow 50-48 vote.\n\nHelping to lead the effort under DeVos has been Candice Jackson, who wrote a 2005 book detailing assault allegations against former President Bill Clinton. She later swung behind Trump's candidacy despite reports that he faced his own allegations of sexual assault.\n\nAn earlier version of this story quoted the Education Department\u2019s definition of sexual harassment based on a preliminary draft document. The agency\u2019s final proposal defines sexual harassment as denying \u201cequal access\u201d to an education program or activity."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Amazon's 'National Landing' leads to confusion and jokes", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

A major fight broke out when National Airport was named for Ronald Reagan in 1998. A fight continues over whether to name a park next to the airport for Nancy Reagan. And in the 1920s, the Postal Service refused to establish a post office in Arlington because the street names were so confusing and haphazard.\n\nSo it is fitting that as Arlington officials celebrated Amazon's decision to locate a new headquarters in the area, there was a bit of confusion over the place name.\n\nAmazon announced Tuesday that it was coming to National Landing, a place people had not heard of because it doesn't exist. Economic development officials who were wooing the online retailing giant came up with the name as a way to describe the multiple neighborhoods that were being offered as a site.\n\nThose neighborhoods \u2014 Crystal City and Pentagon City in Arlington County, and Potomac Yard in the city of Alexandria \u2014 span multiple jurisdictions, so the name allowed Alexandria and Arlington to work cooperatively without marketing one locality over another.\n\nUnfortunately, because the yearlong process of wooing Amazon had been so secretive, the moniker that had become so commonplace in the economic-development discussions had zero recognition among the general public. So Amazon's use of the name in its big announcement left people scratching their heads.\n\nSome people confused it with National Harbor, a new development in Maryland that has attracted one of the biggest casinos on the East Coast. Comedian Remy Munasifi, who made his name poking fun at Arlington in a YouTube rap that has been viewed more than 2 million times, suggested that Arlington National Cemetery would soon be renamed \"Kindle Shores.\"\n\nRep. Don Beyer, whose congressional district encompasses the neighborhoods, got in on the act when he suggested that the location of a new $1 billion graduate campus be dubbed \"Hokie Landing.\" The campus was a key incentive offered to Amazon by Virginia, which promised to double the number of students who graduate each year with bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science and related fields.\n\nNo official steps were ever taken to rename the region, and local officials have made clear they have no intention of trying to rename Crystal City or any other neighborhood.\n\nIn a tweet posted by Arlington Economic Development on Thursday, Arlington County Manager Mark Schwartz explained that National Landing was simply \"a way to avoid saying, 'Parts of Arlington, parts of Alexandria.' \"\n\nChristina Winn, director of business investment for Arlington Economic Development, said officials never imagined \"there would be so much conversation\" about the concept. Winn said there's no intention to supplant or override the name of Crystal City, which draws its name from a big chandelier in one of the first apartment buildings to go up in the area in the 1960s.\n\nStill, she said, if Arlington and Alexandria team up on another economic-development pitch in the future, she said that the moniker might be revived.\n\n\"It worked once,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "US energy official sees 'great promise' in eastern Med", "description": "A U.S. State Department official says Washington sees 'great promise' in developing energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean as ExxonMobil began exploratory drilling off Cyprus' southwestern coast", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-energy-official-sees-great-promise-eastern-med-59243097", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_eee0c492782f4196bd6d4690e950c49b_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:52:51Z", "content": "A U.S. State Department official says Washington sees \"great promise\" in developing energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean as ExxonMobil began exploratory drilling off Cyprus' southwestern coast.

He added that the company is in talks with Ford about possible cooperation in making light commercial vehicles.\n\nEstablished automakers are rolling out electric models to compete with Tesla , but also to meet new environmental standards.\n\nIn Europe, manufacturers need to sell more battery-powered cars to meet tougher EU limits on carbon dioxide emissions that come into force 2021 and aim to fight global warming. Automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW risk penalties of thousands of euros per vehicle if they can't meet requirements for lower average emissions.\n\nAuthorities in China, where Volkswagen gets much of its profit, have also mandated a bigger share of electrics and hybrids.\n\nYet right now, such vehicles remain a niche market due to higher price and lack of places to charge. Battery-only vehicles were only 0.6 percent of the market in the European Union last year. Major new models unveiled in recent weeks from Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and Volksagen's Audi brand have been expensive SUVs; Audi's e-tron starts at a German price of 80,000 euros. The starting price for Tesla's Model X is around $80,700 while the Model S is around $74,500.\n\nPoetsch said the company's forthcoming I.D. compact would cost about what today's Golf diesel does.

The next model up the price scale starts at 30,625 euros.\n\nHigher cost is one reason consumers are not yet buying purely electric vehicles in large numbers. The lack of charging points is another, leaving many owners of electric vehicles to use them mainly in cities or for short trips. Volkswagen and other automakers are working together on building a freeway network of fast-charging stations to enable longer trips with battery powered cars.\n\nThe shift to electric cars is a big one for a company the size of Volkswagen, which has over 600,000 employees and makes about 10 million vehicles a year.\n\nIt is converting three of its German plants from internal combustion to battery car production as it pivots away from diesel vehicles in the wake of its emissions scandal.

It is being discussed as Georgia elections officials appear to be on the cusp of certifying Republican Brian Kemp as the winner of a bitterly fought campaign that's been marred by charges of electoral malfeasance.\n\nTop Abrams advisers outlined her prospective case to The Associated Press, stressing that the Democratic candidate hasn't finalized a decision about whether to proceed once state officials certify Kemp as the victor. That could happen as early as Friday evening.\n\nAllegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams' campaign chairwoman, is overseeing a team of almost three-dozen lawyers who in the coming days will draft the petition, along with a ream of affidavits from voters and would-be voters who say they were disenfranchised. Abrams would then decide whether to go to court under a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \"misconduct, fraud or irregularities ... sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\"\n\nThe legal team is \"considering all options,\" Lawrence-Hardy said, including federal court remedies. But the state challenge is the most drastic. And some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statutes that set a high bar for the court to intervene.\n\nKemp's campaign, which already has shifted into transition mode presuming he'll be inaugurated in January, said Abrams is pushing a \"publicity stunt\" and said her refusal to concede is a \"ridiculous temper tantrum.\"\n\nShe already faces a narrow path to the governor's mansion. Unofficial returns show Kemp with about 50.2 percent of more than 3.9 million votes. That puts him about 18,000 votes above the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a Dec. 4 runoff. The Associated Press is not calling the race until state officials certify the results.\n\nAbrams would assert that enough irregularities occurred to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 Georgians either had their ballots thrown out or were not allowed to vote.\n\nLawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams will weigh legal considerations alongside her belief that many of her backers \u2014 particularly minority and poorer voters who don't regularly go to the polls \u2014 heeded her call to participate and ran into barriers.\n\n\"These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,\" said Lawrence-Hardy, who was among the army of lawyers who worked on the Bush v. Gore presidential election dispute in 2000. \"It's just a much bigger responsibility. I feel like our mandate has blossomed. ... Maybe this is our moment.\"\n\nKemp, who served as the state's chief elections officer until two days after the election when he resigned as secretary of state and declared victory, has maintained that any uncounted ballots won't change the outcome. Kemp supporters have gathered at some local elections offices protesting what they cast as an attempt to steal the election.\n\nThe circumstances leave Abrams, a 44-year-old rising Democratic star, with a tough decision. The former state lawmaker became a national political celebrity with her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor. Her strategy of running as an unapologetic liberal who attracts new voters to the polls resonated in a rapidly changing state. Yet Abrams also must consider her own political future and the consequences of a protracted legal fight she might not win.\n\nAll of that is playing out against the backdrop of Kemp's unabashed embrace of President Donald Trump's nationalism.\n\nSince Election Day, Abrams campaign workers have transitioned from get-out-the-vote efforts to helping voters determine whether their ballots were counted and documenting reported problems. The idea is to assemble a body of evidence to support the claim that the problems could account for Kemp's 18,000-vote margin above the runoff trigger.\n\nAffidavits from poll workers reviewed by the AP describe long lines that discouraged people from voting, poll workers failing to offer provisional ballots to people who didn't show up on the rolls or were at the wrong polling place and election equipment that froze and had to be rebooted.\n\nCathy Cox, a Democrat who served as secretary of state from 1999 through 2007 and is now the dean of Mercer University's law school, said Georgia law puts a heavy burden on candidates such as Abrams who ask a court to intervene.\n\n\"I would say with pretty great confidence there has probably never been an election ... without some irregularity, where some poll worker did not make some mistake,\" Cox said in an interview. The key, she said, is proving someone erred to the point that it could change the outcome.\n\nLawrence-Hardy agreed the law requires a quantitative analysis. She said Abrams' team doesn't have a list of 18,000 disenfranchised voters. The evidence, she said, would consist of hundreds, if not thousands of such examples, along with data analysis of projected lost votes based on other problems, such as a lack of paper ballots at precincts where voting machines broke down and voters left long lines.\n\nCox said courts must attempt to apply a nonpartisan standard of \"doubt\" to the election. \"Would a reasonable person have a reason to doubt this election? Not would a hard-core partisan Democrat doubt a partisan Republican opponent,\" she said.\n\nAbrams and voting rights activists have argued for months that Kemp mismanaged the elections system as secretary of state, with Abrams often calling Kemp \"an architect of suppression.\"\n\nUnder Georgia law, Abrams could file a challenge against Kemp or his successor as the secretary of state. The challenge must be filed within five days of certification in a trial court of the county where the chosen defendant resides. The defendant has between five and 10 days to respond, and the presiding judge sets a hearing within 20 days after that deadline, a calendar that could push a dispute well beyond what would have been a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nIf the judge determines the election is so defective that it casts doubt on the results, the judge can declare the election invalid and call a new vote among the same candidates. Cox called that \"the real extreme remedy.\"\n\nA more \"surgical\" course, she said, would be to affirm irregularities but only order that certified results be reopened and recertified once those problems are remedied. The judge could then declare a winner or order a runoff if the results are close enough.\n\nThe judge could also declare a winner after hearing the evidence, but Cox said that's unlikely because the case will probably hinge on uncounted votes and there's no way to know before a count which candidate won those votes.\n\nOnce the judge rules, the loser has 10 days to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and Brumback at https://twitter.com/katebrumback."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Philippines' Duterte to cut short APEC trip, officials say", "description": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will cut short his participation in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea just days after coming under criticism for skipping some regional meetings in Singapore", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/philippines-duterte-cut-short-apec-trip-officials-59241968", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:03:34Z", "content": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will cut short his participation in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea just days after coming under criticism for skipping some regional meetings in Singapore.

The main difficulty in the Brexit talks has been how to not disturb that liberty, which has helped to ensure peace since 1998.\n\nThe big fear in this region is that Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan, which aims to safeguard an open border, will fall apart and the U.K. will leave the EU with no deal on future relations. Overnight, that could bring back customs checks and police watch-points.\n\n\"I'd be horrified - absolutely horrified - if there was some sort of border,\" said Jim Deary, who lives in nearby Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland and, at the age of 95, can recall the violence that plagued the region for decades.\n\nJust across the invisible border, which is now physically represented by nothing more than a placid river, the sentiment is much the same.\n\n\"Britain is facing, and Northern Ireland is facing, absolute chaos,\" says Conor Patterson, the CEO of an agency that promotes economic growth in Northern Irish border regions of Newry and Mourne. \"This is not a theoretical risk, these are real risks.\"\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Catholic and Protestant communities remain divided decades after 30 years of conflict claimed around 3,700 lives. The peace agreement signed in 1998 provides people with the freedom to identify as Irish or British, or both. Having a border could rekindle identity politics and, potentially, violence.\n\nMay's deal involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, eliminating the need for border checks, with some provisions that are specific to Northern Ireland. Pro-Brexiteers say that would leave the U.K. too close to the EU, taking its rules for years, and some are trying to get rid of May \u2014 as well as her deal, which is due to be voted on in Parliament.\n\nEconomically, this region has a lot to lose from a return of tariffs and customs checks.\n\nIn the days of hard borders, trade between the north and south was a fraction of what it is today. It took truck drivers hours to get cleared and across the other side.\n\nOn average, commercial vehicles cross the border 13,000 times each day. Some go back and forth several times in a single day. So do ships carrying goods to and from the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. An estimated 30,000 people cross the border every day.\n\nThe dividing line stretches for 500 kilometers (312 miles) and is dotted with over 250 official road crossings, more than on Europe's entire eastern flank.\n\nFor entrepreneurs who founded and grew their businesses here, taking advantage of the highway connecting Dublin to Belfast, the return of border checks is unthinkable.\n\nPaddy Hughes has a company selling horse supplements and his factory is smack on the border, on the north side. If you walk out left from his gate you're on the south side.\n\nHe has already felt an impact from Brexit, with sales down 35 percent as buyers in the U.K., where the pound has fallen sharply since the 2016 Brexit vote, worry about the future.\n\n\"People are unsure how to spend their money, whether to spend their money, where their next money is coming from, how much their money is going to be worth, how much things are going to cost in the future, whether they will have a job,\" he says.\n\nSome vestiges of the old borders are visible outside Newry, where weeds grow tall around an abandoned customs clearance post where goods used to be checked. Graffiti now covers the metal gates of the inspection booths.\n\nLooking back into the past, Deary recalls when as a child he would go swimming at a spot across the border and had to face border guards.\n\n\"It was difficult. Cars were searched and you were asked for identity,\" he says. \"Since the borders (are open) it is terrific.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Simone Miranda", "title": "Get Thanksgiving-Ready With Our Latest Digital Wallpaper", "description": "What I love about Thanksgiving is that our family gathers for a day of eating and gratitude.

Some see that as a natural slowdown after much stronger, trade-fueled expansion of 0.7 percent at the end of last year.\n\nBut worries rose this week after new data showed Germany's economy, the currency union's largest, shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter. Much of the fall can be attributed to delays faced by major automakers like Daimler and Volkswagen in getting cars certified under new emissions rules. However, a slowdown in exports also played a role, raising questions of how much more pain the U.S. trade war and uncertainties like Brexit could create for Europe's many exporters.\n\nHolger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, says that surveys of business activity \"point to a further loss of momentum in late 2018.\"\n\nA key risk is the conflict between Italy's populist government, which wants to spend more on social welfare, and the European Union's executive Commission, which is demanding Italy lower its budget deficit under the rules that go with belonging to the euro. The danger is that if the Italian government persists in running larger deficits, its borrowing costs rise to unsustainable levels and the country is unable to roll over its debt at an affordable interest rate. Debt costs spiked in 2011 but fell after a reform-minded government took office and the European Central Bank promised to backstop the debt of countries that are facing high debt costs but show a willingness to correct their finances.\n\nItaly is \"the most serious risk facing the eurozone,\" Schmieding says.\n\nHe says an Italian financial crisis could erupt next year, but that it is more likely that the country would muddle through until a new recession \u2014 perhaps in 2021 \u2014 exposes the weaknesses in the economy.\n\nThen there's Brexit. European officials are waiting to see if Prime Minister Theresa May can push through a deal on an orderly exit from the European Union. If the deal is rejected in parliament, in a vote that could be held in December, Britain could wind up leaving in March 2019 without a settled trade relationship with its biggest trading partner, the EU. That could reinstate tariffs and border checks on trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAdd to that the trade conflict between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods, and the Chinese have responded with tariffs of their own. Europe is getting sideswiped by the U.S.-China collision as global trade slows.\n\n\"It is not our base-case scenario, but a fully-fledged trade war could obviously and easily push the eurozone economy toward the brink of recession,\" said economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Germany.\n\nIt's not as if things are falling apart. Unemployment, now at 8.1 percent, continues to fall from its 2013 peak above 12 percent as the eurozone slowly heals from a debt crisis that threatened to break it up in 2011-2012. Despite its woes, the auto industry remains solidly profitable, with major employers like Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW, PSA Group, and Fiat Chrysler enjoying steady profits in an auto market that grew 2.9 percent in the first half of the year ahead of the certification bottlenecks as consumers shelled out for new SUVs.\n\nBut none of that has stopped speculation about the future path of the European economy, especially with global trade slowing.\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Draghi said the bank was sticking with its plan to phase out its bond purchase stimulus program at year-end. The purchases are a way of pushing newly created money into the banking system, and, it is hoped, the wider economy. But he indicated that the bank could postpone a first interest rate increase, currently expected no earlier than September 2019, if things take a turn for the worse.\n\n\"There is certainly no reason why the expansion in the euro area should abruptly come to an end,\" Draghi said Friday in a speech in Frankfurt. He noted that the eurozone expansion is still \"relatively short in length\" at 22 quarters, compared to the average of 31 quarters for the five periods of growth since 1975.\n\nBrzeski, the economist, said a downturn could find the ECB with few tools left to stimulate the economy. Interest rates are already at record lows, and the bank is phasing out its bond purchase stimulus in part because it is running out of eligible assets to buy.\n\nHistory suggests that upswings keep going until they hit an unexpected obstacle, he said. Examples range from the 1974 crisis over the Arab oil embargo and the high inflation period of the late 1970s and early 1980s to the financial crisis of 2008 and the eurozone debt crisis that erupted in Greece in 2009.\n\nIt all proves, he said, that \"eurozone recoveries don't die of old age \u2014 they always need a special trigger.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Shooter who allegedly killed 2 at Kentucky Kroger charged with hate crime", "description": "Gregory Bush, 51, is alleged to have killed two people based on their race.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/shooter-allegedly-killed-kentucky-kroger-charged-hate-crime-59240854", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181116_vod_orig_kroger_hate_crime_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:28:05Z", "content": "Now Playing: Alleged mistress of man charged with killing wife, 2 daughters speaks out Now Playing: The story of one man's incredible face transplant journey Now Playing: Shooter who allegedly killed 2 at Kentucky Kroger charged with hate crime Now Playing: N\u2026 [+1039 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Shooter who allegedly killed 2 at Kentucky Kroger charged with hate crime\n\nThere is no place no place.

Some were driven by religious zeal, others simply were attracted by the mystery of a remote and cloistered country that seems the polar opposite of anything they had experienced.\n\nA look at some of the Americans who have entered North Korea in past decades:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBRUCE BYRON LOWRANCE\n\nThe North's official Korean Central News Agency said Lowrance was detained last month after he entered illegally from the border with China. While it said he entered under the \"manipulation\" of the CIA, many detained foreigners have said after their release from North Korea that their declarations of guilt were coerced.\n\nNorth Korea's decision to deport Lowrance after only a month of confinement would be remarkably quick by Pyongyang's standards, apparently reflecting an eagerness to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue with the United States.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang have been engaging in talks on the North's nuclear program since a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in June, when they issued vague aspirational goals for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn November last year, South Korea said a man matching Lowrance's name was caught in an area just south of the Demilitarized Zone without approval. The man later told South Korean investigators that he believed his trip to North Korea would resolve tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the death of Otto Warmbier, an American university student who died last year days after being released from the North in a coma.\n\nLowrance was arrested in South Korea on the same day a North Korean soldier made a dramatic escape to the South, rushing across the border under a barrage of bullets fired by his former comrades.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOTTO WARMBIER\n\nWhile the majority of Americans detained by North Korea have been released in relatively good condition, Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, died in June last year shortly after he was flown home comatose after 17 months in captivity.\n\nWarmbier was seized from a tour group while visiting North Korea in January 2016 and convicted on charges of trying to steal a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. North Korea has denied accusations by relatives that it tortured Warmbier and said he was provided \"medical treatments and care with all sincerity.\" The North accused the United States of a smear campaign and called itself the \"biggest victim\" in his death.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMATTHEW MILLER\n\nIn September 2014 North Korea sentenced Miller \u2014 then a 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California \u2014 to six years of hard labor on charges he illegally entered the country to commit espionage.\n\nNorth Korea's Supreme Court said Miller tore up his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport upon arrival in April that year and admitted to the \"wild ambition\" of experiencing prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation.\n\nMiller was freed in November that year along with another American, Kenneth Bae, a missionary and tour leader.\n\nWeeks before his release, Miller spoke briefly to The Associated Press at a Pyongyang hotel where the North Korean government allowed him to call his family. He said he was digging in fields eight hours a day and being kept in isolation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKENNETH BAE\n\nBae, from Lynnwood, Washington, was detained in November 2012 while leading a tour group in North Korea. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for \"hostile acts\" after being accused of smuggling in inflammatory literature and trying to establish a base for anti-government activities at a border city hotel.\n\nWhile in detention, he told a pro-North Korea newspaper based in Japan that he felt abandoned. His family said he suffered from chronic health issues, including back pain, diabetes, an enlarged heart and liver problems.\n\nBae went home in November 2014 after a secret mission by the U.S. intelligence chief at the time, James Clapper, secured his release, as well as that of Miller. A month earlier, North Korea released another U.S. citizen, Jeffrey Fowle, after detaining him for six months for leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the city of Chongjin.\n\nNorth Korea officially guarantees freedom of religion, but analysts and defectors describe the country as militantly anti-religious. The distribution of Bibles and secret prayer services can mean imprisonment or execution, defectors say.\n\nIn 2009, American missionary Robert Park walked into North Korea with a Bible in his hand to draw attention to North Korea's human rights abuses and to call for the resignation of then leader Kim Jong Il. Park, who was deported from the country in February 2010, has said he was tortured by interrogators.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCHARLES JENKINS\n\nCharles Jenkins of North Carolina was one of a handful of U.S. soldiers who fled to North Korea during the Cold War and later appeared in North Korean propaganda films.\n\nJenkins deserted his army post in South Korea in 1965 and fled across the DMZ. In 1980, he married 21-year-old Hitomi Soga, a Japanese nursing student who had been abducted by North Korean agents in 1978.\n\nSoga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002. That was two years before Jenkins was allowed to leave North Korea for Japan, where he surrendered to U.S. military authorities to faced charges that he abandoned his unit and defected to North Korea. He died in Japan in 2017.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nEVAN HUNZIKER\n\nEvan Hunziker had reportedly been drinking with a friend in 1996 when he decided to swim naked across the Yalu River between China and North Korea.

The question on the ballot paper simply asked whether the U.K. should remain or leave, and the country remains bitterly divided on the details of what the new relationship with Brussels should look like.\n\nOn Thursday, May faced a grueling session in Parliament in which she took hostile questions for nearly three hours -- anger and criticism from all sides of the Commons, including bruising attacks from her own members of Parliament.\n\nThere were shouts of \"Resign!\" as she delivered her opening statement that argued the deal she'd negotiated was Britain's best offer from Brussels.\n\nShe later held a press conference at Downing Street and took questions from journalists, some of whom asked about the effectiveness of her leadership when her party appeared in open revolt.\n\n\"I believe with every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one,\" she said. \"From the very beginning, I have known what I wanted to deliver for the British people to honor their vote in the referendum.\"\n\n\"The British people,\" she added, \"just want to get on with it -- they are looking to the Conservative party to deliver.\"\n\nWhen asked by ABC News what she would say to Britain's friends and allies anxious about the current chaos, she said, \"I think they see a government intent on working ... to ensure we can deliver a good deal for the British people.\"\n\nAt the same time, an influential Conservative MP exited the Commons and announced he had written a letter to the chairman of an influential party committee saying he had no confidence in the PM's leadership.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg chairs an influential group of around 60 Conservative MPs called the European Research Group.\n\nSpeaking outside the Commons he told the press: \"This is not Brexit. This is a failure of government policy. It needs to be rejected.\"\n\nHe added: \"What we need is a leader who will say to the E.U. it is impossible to divide the U.K., it is impossible to agree to a situation where we have a perpetual customs union, it is impossible to pay 39 billion pounds of taxpayers' money for a few promises which was meant to be 39 billion pounds for the implementation of a deal, and it is impossible for us to allow the continued jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The problem is the negotiations have given away on all the key points.\"\n\nThere is a mechanism whereby a leadership challenge may be triggered should the 1922 committee receive letters of no confidence in the party leader from 15 percent of Conservative MPs.

But the big ones -- which have long dominated both parties -- remain.\n\nAP\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nWhen it is all said and done, it is likely Democrats will have netted just shy of 40 seats in the House for next year.\n\nWith each passing day this week, they flipped more seats as vote tallies were finalized.\n\nAs of Thursday they had turned 35 congressional districts from red to blue, and they led in three additional outstanding races.\n\nThe total number helps them make the case that the country is asking for a check on the Trump administration, though Republicans\u2019 big victories in the Missouri, North Dakota and Indiana Senate races give them a counter and strong footing in Washington all the same.\n\nHowever, while some voters -- in red and blue states -- sent their incumbents packing, Florida feels like a wild card. The shadow and uncertainty the president cast over the vote count, plus the messy legal battles, stories of damaged ballots and failing machines, surely left many Floridians wondering if their vote even counted.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe TIP with Adam Kelsey\n\nOn Thursday, a portrait of two vote-counting efforts:\n\nIn Florida, Palm Beach County election supervisor Susan Bucher railed against outdated equipment that encountered mechanical issues as she described the \"heroic effort\" made by her staff to meet the 3 p.m. machine recount deadline -- one that ultimately fell short.\n\nWhile in Maine, officials in the secretary of state's office shared a laugh with reporters as they described the minor inconvenience of using \"find and replace\" on an Excel spreadsheet because some entries for 2nd Congressional District Democrat Jared Golden's name contained a comma and others did not. The minor hiccup soon passed as they input the correct ballot information into a computer program that vaulted Golden to a ranked-choice-aided victory.\n\nIf there wasn't already enough evidence out of Florida and Georgia, where debate about matching signatures and confusing ballots rage on, Thursday's contrasting scenes offered greater proof that many states, and perhaps the country as a whole, are in dire need of updated election technology. As for a solution? Look no further than Estonia.\n\nThough the specter of meddling, Russian or otherwise, could forever loom, the United States may be wise to follow the lead of the booming Eastern European nation, where internet-based ballots have been offered since 2005 and are now utilized by nearly one-third of all voters.\n\nJoe Skipper/Getty Images\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.

Things didn't turn out as planned.\n\nAnimal Defenders International, a group that airlifted the lions to South Africa, has secured a court order allowing the removal of 27 surviving lions from the Emoya Big Cat Sanctuary in Vaalwater. The two organizations had collaborated on the project, but disputes over alleged mismanagement at the sanctuary soon arose and six lions have died since arriving there.\n\n\"ADI believes that if we leave our rescued lions at Emoya, they will die before their time,\" Animal Defenders International said Thursday. \"We will move the animals as soon as possible and in accordance with the court order.\"\n\nThe group said it was acting after the \"preventable deaths\" of five lions, including from food poisoning and poaching, and that it was denied immediate access to another lion that died. Animal Defenders International cited \"other problems including misappropriation of funds, materials for the lions and associations with trophy hunters and more.\"\n\nEmoya has denied allegations of wrongdoing and said the South African court ruling against it is based solely on a 90-day termination clause in its contract with Animal Defenders International.\n\n\"The truth is this: Despite unforeseen tragic events, the lions have been and are in excellent condition,\" Emoya said on its website. The lions live in large enclosures \"in the natural Africa habitat,\" receive a venison diet with added supplements and are protected by an upgraded security system, according to Emoya.\n\nWhile Animal Defenders International said it is organizing a \"road trip\" for the lions to another location, Emoya said the move can only happen if it is satisfied with the logistics of the lion transfer. The judge's order requires Emoya to \"do whatever is necessary\" to coordinate the return of the lions to the animal defense group.\n\nNine of the original 33 lions were surrendered by a circus in Colombia. The remaining 24 were rescued in raids on circuses in Peru as part of a crackdown on wildlife trafficking. The transfer to South Africa had no conservationist value because the animals, which were in poor condition, had been held in captivity and could not live in the wild.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Spat over WWII brothels shows Japan's trouble facing past", "description": "A journalist close to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has defended her view that South Korean women who were sent into Japanese WWII military brothels were not sex slaves, accusing a liberal-leaning newspaper of fabrication", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/spat-wwii-brothels-shows-japans-trouble-facing-past-59238861", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:52:04Z", "content": "A journalist close to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has defended her view that South Korea n women who were sent into Japan ese WWII military brothels were not sex slaves, accusing a liberal-leaning newspaper of fabrication.

The conservatives hold the Asahi newspaper, where Uemura used to work, responsible for spreading the impression that all so-called \"comfort women\" were coerced. Liberals say evidence, including court documents and accounts of the women, shows many people were forced into sexual slavery.\n\nSakurai told a news conference on Friday that she sympathizes with comfort women despite their being \"prostitutes\" but that \"I still think the Asahi and Mr. Uemura should be held accountable\" for hurting Japan's image. She said Japan can't have a unified view of its wartime history because of what she called media bias.\n\nSakurai spearheads the view of Japanese nationalists that comfort women were voluntary prostitutes, and that Japan has been unfairly criticized for a practice they say is common in any country at war. Sakurai, a former newscaster at Nippon Television, is close to the country's powerful conservative political lobby, which includes many lawmakers in Abe's Cabinet and ruling Liberal Democratic Party and backs Abe's campaign for an amendment of Japan's pacifist constitution.\n\nUemura, who currently teaches at a university in South Korea while heading a liberal Japanese magazine, says he is worried about a widening gap in the understanding of wartime history between the two countries, especially as female students in South Korea increasingly sympathize with the victims from the perspective of sexual violence against women. The comfort women and other wartime issues have often strained relations between Tokyo and Seoul, most recently after a South Korean court ruling on Japan's forced mobilization of Korean laborers during the war.\n\n\"The point is not whether the comfort women involved forced recruitment or human trafficking. Let's just squarely face the damage done, overcome it and join hands in promoting understanding among Asian countries,\" Uemura told a news conference in Tokyo on Thursday.\n\nUemura in 2015 filed a defamation suit against Sakurai and three publishers that carried articles by her that alleged his stories were \"fabrication.\" A district court in Sapporo in northern Japan ruled last Friday that Sakurai's articles hurt Uemura's reputation but did not amount to defamation.\n\nAt issue are two articles Uemura wrote for the Asahi 27 years ago, including one based on the account of the first South Korean comfort woman to come forward, Kim Hak-soon. Uemura has been criticized by conservatives since then, but their attacks have escalated in recent years. After Sakurai's magazine articles in 2014 accused him of fabricating the comfort women issue, threats were sent to him, his family and a university in Sapporo where he taught after losing a promised professorship elsewhere.\n\nUemura wants Sakurai and the magazines to publish an apology and pay 16.5 million yen ($146,000) in compensation. He said he will appeal to a high court. He has also filed other libel suits against a scholar and a publisher in Tokyo.\n\nHistorians say tens of thousands of women, including Japanese, Koreans and others from around Asia were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sex for Japanese soldiers. A 1991-1993 Japanese government investigation concluded many of the women were recruited against their will, leading to a landmark Japanese apology. The investigation found no written proof in official documents, and conservatives have cited that in arguing the women were not coerced.\n\nA fund set up by Japan's government in 1995 paid nearly 5 billion yen ($44 million) for medical care and welfare for more than 280 women, including 61 South Koreans, but many others in that country rejected the money under a policy of their support group to seek further official apologies. The two countries are still divided despite a 2015 agreement intended to resolve the differences.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Insomniac Theater: 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' and 'Instant Family'", "description": "Take a look at two movies hitting the box office this weekend.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNN/video/insomniac-theater-fantastic-beasts-crimes-grindelwald-instant-family-59238602", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNN/181116_wnn_theater_pic_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:47:15Z", "content": "Now Playing: This Harry Potter photo shoot is giving us major wedding inspo Now Playing: Harry Potter stars on the making of the Broadway production Now Playing: Insomniac Theater: 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' and 'Instant Family' Now Playing\u2026 [+1294 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Insomniac Theater: 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' and 'Instant Family'\n\nIt is fun offerings on the theater of course Revere into movies hoping to give the grinch a run for the money.

Add Brexit as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Brexit news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May won support for her beleaguered Brexit deal Friday from key politicians and business groups, but she remained besieged by internal party opponents determined to oust her.\n\nIn a tumultuous week, May finally clinched a divorce deal with the European Union \u2014 only for it to be savaged by the political opposition, her parliamentary allies and large chunks of her own Conservative Party. Two Cabinet ministers and a handful of junior government members resigned, and grumbles about her leadership erupted into a roar.\n\nFriday brought some respite, as supportive Cabinet ministers rallied around her. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a prominent pro-Brexit voice in Cabinet, threw May a lifeline by urging rebels to \"take a rational and reasonable view of this.\"\n\n\"Ultimately I hope that across Parliament we'll recognize that a deal is better than no deal,\" he said.\n\nBritain's Conservatives have been divided for decades over Britain's membership in the EU, and the draft withdrawal agreement has infuriated the most strongly pro-Brexit members, who want the country to make a clean break with the bloc. They say the draft agreement, which calls for close trade ties between the U.K. and the EU, would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to rules it has no say in making.\n\nThe deal drove a group of disaffected Brexiteers to try to topple May by submitting letters saying they have lost confidence in her leadership. They are aiming for the magic number of 48 \u2014 the 15 percent of Conservative lawmakers needed to trigger a challenge to her leadership under party rules.\n\nAfter a day of conflicting rumors about whether 48 letters had been sent, leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said, \"I think we're very close.\"\n\nHe suggested the threshold might be reached \"sometime next week.\"\n\nIf May lost her job as party leader, she would also lose her position as prime minister. But winning a leadership vote could strengthen her position, because the rules say she can't be challenged again for a year.\n\nCabinet Office Minister David Lidington, one of May's chief allies, predicted that \"if it does come to a challenge, the prime minister will win handsomely.\"\n\n\"I've seen no plausible alternative plan from any of those criticizing her or wanting to challenge her position,\" Lidington said.\n\nMay got another piece of good news when Environment Secretary Michael Gove decided not to follow two Cabinet colleagues and quit over the divorce deal.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey quit Thursday, saying they could not support the agreement. Like them, Gove was a strong supporter of the \"leave\" campaign in Britain's 2016 EU membership referendum.\n\nGove said Friday that he \"absolutely\" had confidence in May, adding that he would work with government colleagues to achieve \"the best future for Britain.\" But he did not answer when asked if he supported May's Brexit deal.\n\nMay replaced Raab and McVey on Friday with two lawmakers with track records of loyalty. Former junior Health Minister Stephen Barclay replaced Raab as Brexit secretary, while ex-Interior Minister Amber Rudd was named to the work and pensions post.\n\nBut May's Cabinet still contains tensions and potential fissures. Some pro-Brexit ministers, including House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, have not resigned but also have not publicly endorsed May's deal.\n\nMay is determined to fight on, warning that abandoning her Brexit plan, with Britain's withdrawal just over four months away on March 29, would plunge the country into \"deep and grave uncertainty.\"\n\nShe appealed directly to voters Friday by answering questions on a radio call-in show. It was not an easy ride. One caller said May should resign and let a more staunchly pro-Brexit politician take over; another compared her to Neville Chamberlain, the 1930s prime minister who tried in vain to appease Nazi Germany to avoid war.\n\nMay stood by her plan.\n\n\"For a lot of people who voted 'leave,' what they wanted to do was make sure that decisions on things like who can come into this country would be taken by us here in the U.K., and not by Brussels, and that's exactly what the deal I've negotiated delivers,\" she said.\n\nBusinesses, which fear the turmoil that could follow a disorderly Brexit, have largely welcomed the withdrawal deal. The Confederation of British Industry, a leading business lobby group, said the agreement represented \"hard-won progress.\"\n\nIn a statement, the group said the withdrawal agreement \"opens a route to a good long-term trade deal.\"\n\nIt warned that leaving the EU without a deal on trade and other relations \u2014 a path advocated by some Brexit supporters \u2014 \"is not an acceptable option\" and \"would badly damage our economy by disrupting supply chains, causing shortages, and preventing vital services reaching people.\"\n\nSimon Kempton of the Police Federation, a union for police officers, said a \"no-deal\" Brexit could spark protests, and \"it's a real concern that those protests might escalate into disorder.\"\n\n\"It's 2018. It's the year that people dial (emergency number) 999 because KFC ran out of chicken,\" he told Sky News. \"If that will happen, imagine what will happen if we start seeing food or medical supply shortages.\"\n\nEU leaders, who have called a Nov. 25 summit in Brussels to sign off on the draft agreement, were doing their best to refrain from commenting on Britain's political chaos.\n\nBut they stressed that the U.K. should not hope to renegotiate the deal \u2014 it is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.\n\n\"This is a withdrawal agreement which took the best part of two years to negotiate involving 28 countries, all of whom have their own particular concerns and interests,\" said Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. \"If you start trying to amend it or unthink it, you might find that the whole thing unravels.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Pan Pylas in London and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rohingya refugee camp quiet after Bangladesh postpone return - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Rohingya refugee camp quiet after Bangladesh postpone return ABC News Normal life returned to a Rohingya Muslim refugee camp in Bangladesh on Friday a day after government officials postponed plans to begin repatriating residents to Myanmar when no o\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/rohingya-refugee-camp-quiet-bangladesh-scraps-return-59238071", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:12:00Z", "content": "Normal life returned to a Rohingya Muslim refugee camp in Bangladesh on Friday a day after government officials postponed plans to begin repatriating residents to Myanmar when no one volunteered to go.

Thousands of acres (hectares) of national forests usually roamed by wild elephants have been taken over by the cramped and unsanitary camps.\n\nBut Hasina's decision not to force the repatriation is unlikely to hurt her bid to win a third term in December, according to Pinak Chakravarty, India's former ambassador to Bangladesh and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.\n\n\"The people of Bangladesh are sympathetic to the plight of the Rohingya. Apart from the fact that they're refugees, they're fellow Muslims. She understands that these feelings are strong, and that is why I think she would not force anyone to go,\" he said.\n\nAs it became apparent that refugees were unlikely be sent back, tensions eased in the camps. The checkpoints at the entrance to Unchiprang, one of the refugee camps near the city of Cox's Bazar, were temporarily left unguarded on Friday morning as about 500 people crowded into a mosque for Friday prayers.\n\nOne of the imams, Abdul Hakim, told the devotees that the government could not force Rohingya to go back without Myanmar guaranteeing them protection and civil rights, to which they raised their hands and replied, \"Amen.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from western Myanmar's Rakhine state since last year to escape killings and destruction of their villages by the military and Buddhist vigilantes that have drawn widespread condemnation of Myanmar.\n\nBangladesh's refugee commission had planned to begin a voluntary repatriation process under a United Nations-brokered deal with Myanmar by escorting about 150 refugees across the border on Thursday, despite calls by U.N. officials, Human Rights Watch and others to wait until the Rohingya's safety in Myanmar could be assured.\n\nU.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said earlier this week that the agency continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in Rakhine, including \"allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests,\" as well as widespread restrictions on freedom of movement, health and education.\n\nFearful of returning home, some people on Bangladesh's repatriation list left their shanties and disappeared into other camps.\n\nAfter a demonstration involving about 1,000 Rohingya broke out at Unchiprang, Refugee Commissioner Abul Kalam said plans had been shelved because no refugees were willing to return.\n\nKalam did not immediately return calls and messages on Friday, and it was unclear when the process would begin again.\n\nNabi Hossain, 45, left his shanty at Unchiprang camp late Wednesday with his wife, Jamila Begum, and six other family members after noticing extra security at the camp.\n\n\"We heard they will come and take us. We were in a panic,\" Hossain said, adding that the family slept outside and didn't eat much because they didn't want a cooking fire to attract attention.\n\nThey returned Thursday after hearing about the protest.\n\n\"If they allow us to have our rights, our citizenship, we want to go. But if we are forced, if our rights are not given, it is better to crush us under the wheels of cars or be thrown in a river,\" Hossain said.\n\nNot everyone who fled Unchiprang has returned.\n\nJohara, 30, a mother of five, said her husband left five days ago with their 6-year-old daughter, who was traumatized after witnessing Myanmar soldiers ransack their home village.\n\n\"My daughter is terrified. She told her father to take her with him,\" she said.\n\nJohara, who goes by one name, said her husband left to find his parents at another camp after she gave an interview to aid workers, and the family found out they were on the government's repatriation list.\n\nWhile Johara waited for her husband and daughter to return, activity at Unchiprang returned to normal, with little sign of the aid workers, journalists or government officials who had swarmed the camp earlier in the week.\n\nEven as refugees in Bangladesh protested against repatriation, concerns grew that another Rohingya exodus from Myanmar by sea may be in the works.\n\nAuthorities in Myanmar arrested 106 people, believed to be Rohingya, whose boat drifted to shore Friday morning in Kyauktan township, south of Yangon, during what they said was an effort to sail to Malaysia.\n\nOne of the people detained, who did not give his name, told reporters that the group came from a displacement camp for Rohingya near Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine. He said the group departed on Oct. 25, and one passenger, a 20-year-old woman, had died of hunger.\n\nThe boat drifted to shore after they decided to return to Rakhine because of the lack of supplies and tried to turn it around, he said.\n\nSittwe is a frequent exit point for Rohingya seeking to make the dangerous and illegal voyage by sea to Malaysia, which is a Muslim majority country which generally tolerates their arrival.\n\nIn 2015, a mass of such journeys caused a regional crisis, especially as the policy of some nations, especially Thailand, was to turn away the boats, even when those aboard were in desperate circumstances. Unknown hundreds of refugees are believed to have perished at sea. Several boats made the same voyage in April this year.\n\nAnother boat believed to be carrying Rohingya refugees was sighted Friday near Indonesia.\n\nMuhammad Nasir, who heads a disaster mitigation office in the northern part of Indonesia's Sumatra island, said fishermen reported seeing a wooden boat carrying about 80 people believed to be Rohingyas.\n\nMeenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Friday that the continued Rohingya flight from Myanmar shows that Bangladesh's repatriation plans should remain shelved.\n\n\"Myanmar might claim that it is ready to receive the refugees, but the truth is that the conditions are not safe, and the Rohingya cannot make a decision about voluntary returns until human rights protections are guaranteed with international monitoring, and there is accountability for the horrible abuses by the military,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press journalist Min Kyi Thein in Kyauktan, Myanmar, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Facebook executive denies blocking investigations into election meddling", "description": "Sheryl Sandberg released a statement saying that the company cut ties with the PR firm reportedly hired to discredit its critics.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/video/facebook-executive-denies-blocking-investigations-election-meddling-59238454", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/181116_vod_techbytes_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:06:22Z", "content": "Now Playing: Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram suffer temporary outage Now Playing: Facebook apps go dark Now Playing: Facebook executive denies blocking investigations into election meddling Now Playing: Apple investigating complaint iPhone X overheated and caug\u2026 [+919 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Facebook executive denies blocking investigations into election meddling\n\nIn today's tech vice Facebook's damage control based look executive Sheryl Sandberg is denying allegations that she stood in the way and investigators looking into election interference.

Florida Senate race moves to manual recount\n\nFlorida's Senate race between incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott has moved into a manual recount after a deadline passed Thursday for the state to complete an initial recount.\n\nRepublican Ron DeSantis held his lead over Democrat Andrew Gillum after the machine recount in the governor's race, while Scott remained ahead of Nelson by 12,603 votes, within the 0.25 percent threshold that triggers a manual recount.\n\nA manual recount is a hand recount of overvotes and undervotes. An overvote is when a voter designated more choices than allowable in the recounted race and an undervote is when a voter made no choice or fewer than the allowable number of choices.\n\nThe results of the manual recount will be reflected in official returns that are due to the Department of State no later than Sunday at noon.\n\nABC News' Stephanie Wash joins us from Tallahassee, where a lot of the lawsuits being filed by campaign are being heard.\n\n2.

Last year, American university student Otto Warmbier died days after he was released in a coma from North Korea after 17 months in captivity.\n\nOn Friday, the Korean Central News Agency said American national Bruce Byron Lowrance was detained on Oct. 16 for illegally entering the country from China. It said he told investigators that he was under the \"manipulation\" of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It was not clear if the North's spelling of the man's name was correct, and past reports from Pyongyang have contained incorrect spellings.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday expressed appreciation for the cooperation of North Korea and the embassy of Sweden \u2014 which handles consular issues for U.S. citizens in North Korea \u2014 \"in facilitating the release of an American citizen.\" His brief statement provided no further details.\n\nA U.S. official said the man had left North Korea and was on a flight back to the United States. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. He provided no other details.\n\nThe North's decision matches its general push for engagement and diplomacy with the United States this year after a string of weapons tests in 2017, and a furious U.S. response, had some fearing war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn May, North Korea released three American detainees in a goodwill gesture weeks ahead of leader Kim Jong Un's June 12 summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore. The three Americans returned home on a flight with Pompeo.\n\nThe United States, South Korea and others have previously accused North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions.\n\nSome foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt had been coerced while in North Korean custody. Warmbier and other previous American detainees in the North were imprisoned over a variety of alleged crimes, including subversion, anti-state activities and spying.\n\nThe latest detained American is likely a man that South Korea deported last year, according to South Korean police.\n\nIn November 2017, a 58-year-old man from Louisiana was caught in South Korea after spending two nights in the woods in a civilian-restricted area near the border with North Korea. The name written in his passport was Lowrance Bruce Byron, said police officers at Gyeonggi Bukbu Provincial Police Agency.\n\nBefore his deportation, the man told interrogators that he \"knows lots of people in the Trump administration so that he wants to work as a bridge between the United States and North Korea to help improve their ties worsened by Warmbier's death,\" said one of the police officers who investigated the man. He requested anonymity, citing department rules.\n\nEarlier Friday, KCNA said Kim observed the successful test of an unspecified \"newly developed ultramodern tactical weapon,\" though it didn't describe what the weapon was.\n\nIt didn't appear to be a test of a nuclear device or a long-range missile with the potential to target the United States. A string of such tests last year pushed always uncomfortable ties on the peninsula to unusually high tension before the North turned to engagement and diplomacy.\n\nStill, any mention of weapons testing could influence the direction of stalled diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Washington and aimed at ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\n\nExperts say the weapon test was likely an expression of anger by North Korea at U.S.-led international sanctions and ongoing small-scale military drills between South Korea and the United States. It's the first publicly known field inspection of a weapons test by Kim since he observed the testing of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November of last year, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.\n\n\"It's North Korea-style coercive diplomacy. North Korea is saying 'If you don't listen to us, you will face political burdens,'\" said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea's Foreign Ministry warned it could bring back its policy of bolstering its nuclear arsenal if it doesn't receive sanctions relief.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems. Yang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \"tactical weapon\" in North Korea refers to \"a weapon aimed at striking South Korea including U.S. military bases\" there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nDiplomacy has stalled since the Singapore summit, with Washington pushing for more action on nuclear disarmament and the North insisting the U.S. first approve a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and lift sanctions.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, attending a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, cited the \"great progress\" made on North Korea since the tensions of 2017 but said more had to be done. He stressed that U.N. sanctions had to remain enforced.\n\nThe North said the test took place at the Academy of National Defense Science and that Kim couldn't suppress his \"passionate joy\" at its success. But North Korea's report was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn't focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility.\n\nLast year's string of increasingly powerful weapons tests, many experts believe, put the North on the brink of a viable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that can target anywhere in the mainland United States.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea.

Add Israel as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Israel news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIsrael moved closer to early elections Friday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main coalition partner, the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, said it wants a vote \"as soon as possible,\" and will press for consultations on a date on Sunday.\n\nThe call for early elections came after a meeting Friday between Netanyahu and Education Minister and Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett. The two men have been locked in a tense rivalry, with Bennett often criticizing Netanyahu from the right.\n\nBennett had demanded the post of defense minister, after the incumbent, Avigdor Lieberman, resigned earlier this week in protest over Netanyahu's Gaza policies.\n\nA senior Jewish Home official said it became clear after the Bennett-Netanyahu meeting that there \"is a need to go to elections as soon as possible.\" He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing the content of a closed meeting.\n\nThe official said leaders of coalition parties will meet Sunday to coordinate the date for early elections.\n\nThe apparent failure of the Netanyahu-Bennett meeting seemed to seal the coalition's fate.\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Israel Beitenu party had left the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament. Without Bennett's Jewish Home, Netanyahu's coalition would lose its parliamentary majority.\n\nThe political crisis began with a botched Israeli undercover raid in Gaza on Sunday. The raid led to two days of intense cross-border fighting. Gaza's Hamas rulers fired hundreds of rockets at southern Israel, while Israeli warplanes targeted scores of targets in Gaza.\n\nAfter two days, Egypt brokered an informal truce between Israel and the Islamic militant Hamas. Netanyahu averted a war, but drew blistering criticism from ultra-nationalists.\n\nLieberman resigned in protest on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, he toured southern Israel and accused Netanyahu of being soft on terrorism. He said Netanyahu's Gaza policy is strengthening Hamas.\n\nLieberman alleged that the truce will put southern Israel under a growing threat from Hamas, similar to the threat posed to northern Israel by Lebanon's heavily armed Hezbollah militia.\n\n\"It's impossible that after Hamas launches 500 rockets at the Israeli border communities. the heads of Hamas are actually getting immunity from the Israeli cabinet,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"We are now feeding a monster\" that will only grow if not stopped, he said. \"Within a year we will have a twin brother of Hezbollah, with all the implications.\"\n\nBut on Friday, Hamas kept border protests widely restrained.\n\nThousands of Palestinians participated in a Hamas-led rally along the perimeter fence dividing Gaza from Israel, with most crowds staying 300 meters from the fence.\n\nHowever, Gaza's Health Ministry said 40 Palestinians were wounded, 18 by live fire from Israeli forces.

I quickly noticed that in order to get academic advising from ... my adviser, it required me to engage with him, socially, in a lot of ways that I felt were very unprofessional,\" Rapuano said, adding that, \"from an early point, it became clear that this was what was needed.\"\n\nRapuano says the culture of harassment was so prevalent within the department that she was told by others that drinking with the professor was the way to gain more academic advising, which she felt she wasn't getting when she first arrived. But, over time, the professor began to \"break down professional boundaries.\"\n\nABC News\n\nRapuano alleges she was sexually assaulted at a professional conference in 2015 in California, where she was to present her research. She didn't think much at first of her adviser moving her flight so they would be in California together an additional night, she said.\n\n\"I didn't think too much of it, because at that point, heavy drinking was sort of the norm with him, and that was part of the expectation,\" she said. \"It wasn't until the following morning that I realized it wasn't just drinking that had happened that night.\"\n\nAfter the alleged assault, she says she told the professor that she \"didn't want that to ever happen again\" and aimed to \"appease him as minimally\" as possible so she would receive the advising and resources that she needed, but he continued to treat her as a \"sex object\" and not his graduate student.\n\n\"After that point, I had tried to navigate the situation that I was in as best as I could,\" she said. \"It was incredibly challenging, but I just tried to get through it.\"\n\n'I refused to participate in that culture.'\n\nAndrea Courtney, who graduated from Dartmouth with her masters in September 2017 and is now a post-doctoral scholar at Stanford University, characterized the climate at Dartmouth's psychology department as \"a boys' club environment.\"\n\n\"There was excessive drinking, and graduate students and undergraduate students were expected to socialize outside of work hours\" and to \"drink pretty excessively with their advisers,\" Courtney told ABC News.\n\nHaving access to resources and academic advising were \"crucial\" to graduate students' success, Courtney said.\n\n\"And our scientific endeavors were very tied to that boys' club culture,\" she added.\n\nABC News\n\nCourtney, who was in the lab of the professor who allegedly sexually assaulted Rapuano for five years, described it as a \"highly sexualized culture,\" where comments about the attractiveness of the female lab members were common.\n\n\"He commented on the breast sizes of his graduate students,\" she said. \"He asked about our sex lives.\"\n\nThat same professor was \"very fond\" of making his students take photos in which they flashed their middle finger at the click of the camera, Courtney said.\n\n\"It was just little things like that that started to build up and degrade the professional climate in graduate school,\" she said, adding that she and others who experienced the harassment would chalk it up to a friendly notion or assume they were misinterpreting something.\" She says they would also receive what she described as \"fake apologies,\" where the professors would offer \"emotionally manipulative explanations for what had happened\" and make the women feel as if it was their fault.\n\nCourtney also had interactions with another one of the accused professors, who she said made \"inappropriate comments\" on her attractiveness and would grab her and pull her away from other students in some instances, one time grabbing her hand and walking her up the block.\n\n\"It wasn't as overtly sexual as many other people's experiences have been, but it was certainly an uncomfortable one,\" she said.\n\nCourtney said she received \"much less academic advising\" than she \"expected and deserved\" because she \"refused to participate in that culture at times.\"\n\nDartmouth allegedly knew about the allegations for a decade.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Dartmouth \"willfully ignored more than a decade of widespread sexual harassment.\"\n\nSome female professors came forward as early as 2002 and 2005 to complain about the conduct of the three professors, but \"nothing was done,\" Marcuse said.\n\nDartmouth did not take action until the plaintiffs and other women within the department organized and filed a collective Title IX complaint against the professors in the spring of 2017, Marcuse said.\n\n\"It wasn\u2019t until I began to learn about other stories of women getting hurt at the department that I realized that this wasn\u2019t an isolated case -- that this was happening to other women,\" Rapuano said. \"At that point, I felt that I needed to come forward because this was a pattern that was going to continue if we didn\u2019t speak up.\"\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAdministrators displayed \"willful ignorance\" at first, Courtney said, and advised students to wait until after their annual standing meeting -- in which their advisers would evaluate them in front of the department -- because if they didn't stay in their labs before the meeting their character might be slammed in front of the department.\n\nSome students stayed in their labs for up to four months after the complaints were made, and during that time \"some pretty severe cases of sexual harassment and sexual assault continued,\" Courtney alleged.\n\n\"So, I really feel like that's the point where Dartmouth failed us,\" she said. \"Some of those people wouldn't have been harmed the way that they were harmed had these men been removed immediately following the complaints, and there was sufficient information at that point in time to know that they were a pretty severe threat to the female graduate students and undergraduate students.\"\n\nStudent activism brought media attention to the issue, which prompted the New Hampshire attorney general to launch a criminal probe into the conduct of the accused professors, the law firm stated.\n\nIn an email to the college community on Thursday, Dartmouth President Philip Hanlon praised the women for coming forward, but did not address any of the allegations that were made as early as 2002, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"I would like to reiterate that sexual misconduct and harassment have no place at Dartmouth,\" Hanlon said in an email to the college community Thursday. \"We applaud the courage displayed by members of our community within PBS who brought the misconduct allegations to Dartmouth's attention last year. And we remain open to a fair resolution of the students' claims through an alternative to the court process.\n\nAccused professors no longer with the university\n\nOne of the accused professors retired over the summer after he was told that he would be fired, while the other two professors resigned soon after, according to the school.\n\nDartmouth launched an investigation into the professors in 2017, but never released the findings, according to The Associated Press.\n\nOne of the three professors objected to being lumped in with the other two men, including the professor whom Capuano accused of sexual assault, releasing a statement through his lawyer denying \"creating a toxic environment at Dartmouth College.\"\n\nLawsuit aims to prevent \"pervasive discrimination against women\" in academia\n\nThe plaintiffs' goal in filing the lawsuit is \"to shine a light on pervasive discrimination against women in academic sciences, at Dartmouth and beyond,\" according to the law firm's press release.\n\nMary Altaffer/AP\n\nThe women risked their careers in order to come forward, Marcuse said.\n\n\"They came forward not knowing whether this would be the end of their careers,\" Marcuse said, \"the careers they have been struggling to maintain despite being harassed and assaulted and neglected by their advisers, despite being retaliated against and inadequately taken care of by the institution with which they were studying.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also aims to force Dartmouth to \"fully examine the root cause of the pervasive discrimination\" the women suffered, Marcuse said, and \"to make whatever changes are necessary to ensure women scientists and female students in general are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\"\n\nABC News' Ben Stein and Jason Volack contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Mark Osborne", "title": "Kroger shooter charged with hate crime in alleged murder of black shoppers", "description": "Gregory Bush, 51, is alleged to have killed two people based on their race.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/shooter-allegedly-killed-kentucky-kroger-charged-hate-crime/story?id=59237201", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/greg-bush-shooting-ap-mo-20181116_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T08:53:52Z", "content": "The man who allegedly opened fire at a Kroger grocery store in October, killing two people, is now facing hate crime charges.

Several opposition lawmakers and policemen were wounded.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a political crisis since Oct. 26, when President Maithripala Sirisena abruptly sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointed Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe says he still has the support of a majority in Parliament.\n\nJayasuriya, using a microphone, conducted the proceedings while standing on the floor of Parliament, which for the second time passed a no-confidence motion against Rajapaksa and his government by a voice vote.\n\nJayasuriya first offered to take the vote by name, but was unable to do so because of the commotion and opted for a voice vote. He then adjourned the house until Monday.\n\nLawmakers loyal to Rajapaksa hooted and continued to hurl abuse at Jayasuriya until he left the chamber. Arundika Fernando, a lawmaker allied with Rajapaksa, sat in the speaker's chair while others shouted slogans.\n\nIn a tweet, Sirisena vowed not to dissolve Parliament and called upon \"all parties to uphold principles of democracy and parliamentary traditions at all times.\"\n\nSirisena dissolved Parliament a week ago and ordered new elections, but the Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended Sirisena's directive.\n\nOpposition lawmaker R. Sampathan accused Rajapaksa loyalists of preventing a roll-call vote on the no-confidence motion, as requested earlier by Sirisena.\n\nOn Thursday, Sirisena held an emergency meeting with the leaders of the opposition parties that voted for the first motion against Rajapaksa and asked them to take up the motion again and allow it to be debated and then put to a roll-call vote.\n\nSirisena held the meeting following the chaos in Parliament on Thursday, when rival lawmakers exchanged blows, leaving one injured, after the speaker announced the country had no prime minister or government because of Wednesday's motion against Rajapaksa.\n\nRajapaksa has refused to accept the no-confidence motion, also saying it should not have been done by voice vote. He also insisted the speaker had no authority to remove him and said he is continuing in his role as prime minister.\n\nRajapaksa, a former president, is considered a hero by some in the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Shooter who allegedly killed 2 at Kentucky Kroger charged with hate crime - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Shooter who allegedly killed 2 at Kentucky Kroger charged with hate crime ABC News The man who allegedly opened fire at a Kroger grocery store in October, killing two people, is now facing hate crime charges.

Add WikiLeaks as an interest to stay up to date on the latest WikiLeaks news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will not willingly travel to the United States to face charges filed under seal against him, one of his lawyers said Friday, foreshadowing a possible fight over extradition for a central figure in the U.S. special counsel's Russia-Trump investigation.\n\nAssange, who has taken cover in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been granted asylum, has speculated publicly for years that the Justice Department had brought secret criminal charges against him for revealing highly sensitive government information on his website.\n\nThat hypothesis appeared closer to reality after prosecutors, in an errant court filing in an unrelated case, inadvertently revealed the existence of sealed charges. The filing, discovered Thursday night, said the charges and arrest warrant \"would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\"\n\nA person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case had not been made public, confirmed that charges had been filed under seal. The exact charges Assange faces and when they might be unsealed remained uncertain Friday.\n\nAny charges against him could help illuminate whether Russia coordinated with the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election. They also would suggest that, after years of internal Justice Department wrangling, prosecutors have decided to take a more aggressive tack against WikiLeaks.\n\nA criminal case also holds the potential to expose the practices of a radical transparency activist who has been under U.S. government scrutiny for years and at the center of some of the most explosive disclosures of stolen information in the last decade.\n\nThose include thousands of military and State Department cables from Army Pvt. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, secret CIA hacking tools, and most recently and notoriously, Democratic emails that were published in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election and that U.S. intelligence officials say had been hacked by Russia.\n\nFederal special counsel Robert Mueller, who has already charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with hacking, has been investigating whether any Trump associates had advance knowledge of the stolen emails.\n\nAssange could be an important link for Mueller as he looks to establish exactly how WikiLeaks came to receive the emails, and why its release of the communications \u2014 on the same day a highly damaging video of Trump from a decade earlier surfaced publicly \u2014 appeared timed to boost his campaign.\n\nAssange, 47, has resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy under a grant of asylum for more than six years to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was accused of sex crimes, or to the United States, whose government he has repeatedly humbled with mass disclosures of classified information.\n\nThe Australian was once a welcome guest at the embassy, which takes up part of the ground floor of a stucco-fronted apartment in London's posh Knightsbridge neighborhood. But his relationship with his hosts has soured over the years amid reports of espionage, erratic behavior and diplomatic unease.\n\nBarry Pollack, a Washington lawyer for Assange, said he expected Ecuador to \"comply with its obligations\" to preserve asylum for him, though he acknowledged a concern that the county could revoke his asylum, expel him from the embassy and extradite him to the U.S.\n\n\"The burden should not shift to Mr. Assange to have to defend against criminal charges when what he has been accused of doing is what journalists do every day,\" Pollack said. \"They publish truthful information because the public has a right to know and consider that information and understand what its government and institutions are doing.\"\n\nThe charges came to light in an unrelated court filing from a federal prosecutor in Virginia, who was attempting to keep sealed a separate case involving a man accused of coercing a minor for sex.\n\nThe three-page filing contained two references to Assange, including one sentence that said \"due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Assange's name was included in the document. Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the Justice Department's Eastern District of Virginia said, \"The court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.\"\n\nThe filing was discovered by Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who posted it on Twitter hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department was preparing to prosecute Assange.\n\nThe case at issue concerns a defendant named Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, a 29-year-old teacher who has since been indicted in Virginia on charges of enticing a 15-year-old girl to commit sex acts and to produce child pornography. There doesn't appear to be any connection between Assange and Kokayi.\n\nThe since-unsealed document, a motion filed in late August asking to keep Kokayi's case secret, mentions Assange in two boilerplate sections, suggesting a copy-and-paste error or that his name was inadvertently left in a template used for the common filings.\n\nThe filing suggests prosecutors have reason to believe they will be able to arrest and extradite Assange.\n\nEcuadorian officials say they have cut off his high-speed internet access and will restore it only if he agrees to stop interfering in the affairs of Ecuador's partners, such as the U.S. and Spain. He is allowed to use the embassy's WiFi, though it is unclear if he doing so. Officials have also imposed a series of other restrictions on Assange's activities and visitors, and ordered him to clean after his cat.\n\nCarlos Poveda, Assange's lawyer in Ecuador, said he suspects Ecuador has been maneuvering to kick Assange out of the embassy through the stricter new living requirements it recently imposed.\n\nHe said possible U.S. charges, however, are proof his client remains under threat, and he called on Ecuador's government to uphold Assange's asylum protections. He said Ecuador would be responsible if anything happened to Assange.\n\nWith shrinking options \u2014 an Ecuadorian lawsuit seeking to reverse the restrictions was recently turned down \u2014 WikiLeaks announced in September that former spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic journalist who has long served as one of Assange's lieutenants, would take over as editor-in-chief.\n\nIn a brief interview in Reykjavik, Iceland, Hrafnsson called the U.S. news \"a very black day for journalism.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Raphael Satter in Paris, Chad Day in Washington and Egill Bjarnason in Iceland contributed to this report.\n\nLink to court filing: http://apne.ws/Me9YxB9"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Plaintiffs in $70 million Title IX class action lawsuit against Dartmouth describe 'systemic' sexual harassment - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Plaintiffs in $70 million Title IX class action lawsuit against Dartmouth describe 'systemic' sexual harassment ABC News Details of alleged widespread sexual harassment conducted by tenured professors in Dartmouth College's psychology department are \u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/plaintiffs-70-million-title-ix-class-action-lawsuit/story?id%3D59223760", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T08:18:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "German chancellor visiting scene of far-right violence", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel is heading to Chemnitz to talk with residents of the eastern city three months after it was the scene of violent far-right protests", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/german-chancellor-visiting-scene-violence-59237486", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T08:07:49Z", "content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel is heading to Chemnitz to talk with residents of the eastern city three months after it was the scene of violent far-right protests.

The strain on resources and a number of violent crimes allegedly committed by migrants stoked doubts about Germany's ability to cope with the influx.\n\nOpinion polls have reflected the shift. Merkel's center-right bloc has lost support, while gains have been made by the nationalist Alternative for Germany party.\n\nSenior Alternative for Germany leaders marched alongside known far-right extremists during one of the Chemnitz protests. The nationalists hope to win next year's state election in Saxony, where Chemnitz is located and which is currently governed by Merkel's party.\n\nChemnitz Mayor Barbara Ludwig, who was thrust onto the front line of a debate on handling anti-migrant sentiment following the summer violence, said Friday that \"we're experiencing a polarization at all levels of society.\"\n\n\"What happened in Chemnitz even threatened to tear apart the federal government,\" said Ludwig.\n\nThat threat appears to have ebbed, for now, with Merkel's party poised to choose a new party chair next month to lead it into the 2021 national election.\n\nMeanwhile, Merkel's own approval ratings appear to have been boosted by her announcement that she won't run again.\n\nIn a poll published Thursday by public broadcaster ARD, 56 percent of respondents said they wanted Merkel to govern for a full term, compared with 49 percent in January.\n\nThe phone survey of 1,006 respondents took place on Nov. 12 and 13, and had a margin of error of up to 3.1 percentage points.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJordans reported from Berlin.

For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \"Le Grand K,\" has been the world's sole true kilogram since 1889 .\n\nNow, with the vote, the kilogram and all of the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card. Those numbers were read to the national delegates before they voted. The update will take effect May 20.\n\nScientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: some even sported tattoos on their forearms that celebrated the science.\n\nNobel prize winner William Phillips called the update \"the greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution,\" which ushered in the metric system of meters and kilograms.\n\nThe Grand K and its six official copies, kept together in the same safe on the outskirts of Paris and collectively known as the \"heir and the spares,\" will be retired but not forgotten. Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses change over time.\n\nThe update will have no discernable impact for most people. Bathroom scales won't suddenly get kinder and kilos and grams won't change in supermarkets.\n\nBut the new formula-based definition for the kilogram will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump that set the standard from the 19th century to the 21st, through periods of stunning human achievement and stunning follies, including two world wars.\n\nUnlike a physical object, the formula for the kilo, now also known as \"the electric kilo,\" cannot pick up particles of dust, decay with time or be dropped and damaged, but will be easier to share.\n\n\"If we stay where we are, and someone did accidentally drop the kilogram or if there was a contamination that we couldn't control, then the whole system has got no head. We're in chaos,\" said Barry Inglis, a scientist from Australia. \"That's the thing that's really been worrying us, I think, for maybe 15 years or more is just how vulnerable the system is, by depending just on that one little piece of platinum-iridium.\"\n\nThe redefined kilo is expected to allow for more accurate measurements of very, very small or very, very large masses and help usher in innovations in science, industry, climate study and other fields. In humankind's efforts to quantify and understand the world, stretching back centuries to when ancient Babylonians measured mass with stones, the vote marked a major milestone, scientists agreed.\n\n\"Those units, those constants chosen now, include everything we know, everything we have always known and provide that springboard for us to go pursue those things that we don't know,\" said Jon Pratt of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Add Interest\n\nBillboards across Cairo advertise luxury homes with \"breathtaking\" views in compounds with names like \"La Verde\" or \"Vinci\" in Egypt's new capital that is under construction in the desert, miles from the Nile-side city which has been the seat of power for more than 1,000 years.\n\nOften, what lies behind the billboards are Cairo's most overcrowded neighborhoods, with shoddily built homes and dirt roads frequently inundated with sewage water.\n\nA city of some 20 million people combining charm and squalor, Cairo may soon witness an exodus by well-heeled residents, state employees and foreign embassies to the New Administrative Capital, as the vast project in the desert is provisionally known. It will be the latest phase in the flight of the rich, many of whom have already moved to gated communities in new suburbs, leaving the old Cairo in neglect and decay.\n\nThe new capital \u2014 a proper name has yet to be found \u2014 is the $45 billion brainchild of general-turned-president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the biggest of the mega-projects he launched since taking office in 2014. He contends the projects, ranging from new roads and housing complexes to a Suez Canal expansion, attract investors and create jobs.\n\nSenior officials boastfully compare what has been built under el-Sissi to monuments like the Giza Pyramids.\n\n\"History will do justice to this generation of Egyptians and our grandsons will remember its achievement, a wave of construction unprecedented in modern-day Egypt,\" Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly, also the housing minister, proclaimed.\n\nCritics call the new capital a vanity project, arguing its cost could have been better put to rebuilding the wrecked economy and refurbishing Cairo.\n\nThey also see it as evidence of el-Sissi's authoritarianism, launching a multibillion-dollar plan with little debate. El-Sissi often lashes out at those who question him, telling Egyptians to listen only to him and saying he's answerable to God alone. He often says Egypt's resources are limited \u2014 leading some Egyptians, struggling amid skyrocketing prices, to wonder why so much is spent on questionable projects.\n\n\"There is something very wrong with the order of priorities,\" said political analyst Hassan Nafaa. \"Maybe el-Sissi wants to go down in history as the leader who built the new capital, but if Egyptians don't see an improvement in their living conditions and services, he will be remembered as the president who destroyed what is left of the middle class.\"\n\nThe government argues that Cairo is already bursting at the seams and will grow to 40 million by 2050.\n\nThe new city is being built on 170,000 acres about 28 miles east of Cairo and nearly twice its size. Construction began in 2016, and the first of its forecast 6.5 million residents are scheduled to move there next year.\n\nThe city will house the presidency, Cabinet, parliament and ministries. Planners promise a 21-mile-long public park, an airport, an opera house, a sports complex and 20 skyscrapers, including Africa's highest, at 345 meters.\n\nMadbouly denied the new city will only attract the well-off, saying it is \"for all Egyptians.\"\n\nPrices tell a different story. The smallest apartment there \u2014 120 square meters \u2014 is expected to cost 1.3 million Egyptian pounds ($73,000), out of reach for a mid-level bureaucrat, who may make the equivalent of about $4,800 a year.\n\n\"Those targeted to live in the new capital constitute a very, very limited segment of society,\" said Nafaa.\n\nIronically, the new capital could one day be overwhelmed by the old, as illegal construction expands. That has often been the way Cairo has evolved, with the rich moving out, only to move again as the city swells, adding layer after layer.\n\n\"Throughout the history of Cairo, the ruling elite and the rich have failed to completely isolate themselves from the rest of the population,\" said novelist Hamdy Abu Golayyel, who authored a book about the city called \"Cairo, Streets and Stories.\" It will take draconian laws to keep the new city distinct, he said.\n\nNo one knows how Cairo will be impacted by a new capital and the shift of the seat of power outside of the city for the first time since the Muslim conquest in the 7th Century.\n\nMany government buildings in Cairo, for example, are palaces and mansions confiscated by the socialist government of the 1950s and 1960s. In theory, they could be renovated and turned into museums or hotels, proponents argue. But then, many such empty architectural treasures are already left to fall apart or even torn down.\n\nThe government is renovating some of Cairo's illegally built neighborhoods. But in one case, it razed a run-down district and moved out residents after compensating them to make way for a high-end district.\n\nAmar Ali Hassan, a sociopolitical expert, believes Cairo's woes will only deepen.\n\n\"It could be neglected, become estranged and left to die a slow death,\" he said.\n\nSameh Abdallah Alayli, an urban planning expert, wrote in the Al-Shorouk newspaper that the idea of a new capital was unacceptable, construction should be halted and the focus put back on overhauling the ancient city.\n\n\"Historical Cairo must remain the political capital of Egypt,\" he wrote.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: In alleged scheme, couple, homeless man accused of raising $400,000 'on a lie'", "description": "Prosecutors say the trio's entire story was fabricated to earn money from kindhearted people through GoFundMe.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/alleged-scheme-couple-homeless-man-accused-raising-400000-59235432", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Nightline/181116_ntl_homeless_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T06:25:32Z", "content": "Now Playing: Homeless man, couple created GoFundMe scheme: Report Now Playing: Homeless men attacked with baseball bat in LA Now Playing: In alleged scheme, couple, homeless man accused of raising $400,000 'on a lie' Now Playing: 'The Boys in the Cave': How 1\u2026 [+1314 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for In alleged scheme, couple, homeless man accused of raising $400,000 'on a lie'\n\nI was glad to offer, you know, to help them. Somebody needed it. Reporter: It was the good samaritan story that captivated the nation, seeming almost too good to be true. And authorities now say, it was. I was driving down 95 and ran out of gas, so I pulled over on to the side of the road. Reporter: Kate Mcclure stranded on the outskirts of Philadelphia when homeless veteran Johnny bobt Jr. Came to her rescue. He walked up and said, get back in the car, lock the doors, you know, I'll be back. Reporter: Spending his last $20 to buy her gas. You know, she needed the help and she took the help. Reporter: With the title, paying it forward, the gofundme page and the story of Bobbitt's selflessness went viral. The couple's original goal of $10,000 quickly ballooned to more than $400,000. It's like winning the lottery. Reporter: But today, a shocking twist. The entire campaign was predicated on a lie. Reporter: Authorities say it was all a coordinated scam from the start. The cover photo on the page, staged. All three of them were in on the elaborate hoax. She did not run out of gas on an I 95 off ramp and did not spend his last $20 to help her. Rather, they conspired to pass off a fake feel-good story that would compel donors to contribute to their cause and it worked. Reporter: All three charged with conspiracy and theft by deception. Their attorneys had no comment today. This case, you're talking about over $400,000 and so this takes it to a different level. And the amount of money at stake is why the crime got elevated to the level that it's at. Reporter: Prosecutors now claiming the idea could have come from Bobbitt himself. In 2012, Johnny Bobbitt posted a remarkably similar story on his Facebook page out of North Carolina where he reported that he helped a woman who had both ran out of gas and had a flat tire at a Walmart, spent his supper money to get her on her way and fix her flat tire. I don't think that's a coincidence. Prosecutors are taking this really seriously. Because this has gone from a heartwarming story to a sad, troubling story, and so effectively, they're having the book thrown at them. Reporter: At one point, Mcclure and Bobbitt sitting side-by-side detailing the heartwarming story of how they came to meet. Mcclure telling ABC that she and her boyfriend were moved by the homeless vet's generosity so the couple went back to visit Bobbitt where he was living under a bridge. When you got someone that's, you know, coming back to help you, you know, it makes you feel good, you know? That someone's actually showing a interest in you. Reporter: The story now in question would then lead to Mcclure and her boyfriend returning the so-called good deed to Bobbitt. We were thinking what if we started a gofundme for this guy, just to get him, you know, off of the streets even for a weekend. Reporter: Authorities today saying the truth behind the alleged conspiracy trickled out less than an hour after the page went live. Mcclure, in a text exchange with a friend, stated that the story about Bobbitt assisting her was fake. Specifically, she wrote, \"Okay, so, wait. The gas part is completely made up. But the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel ba so shush about the made-up stuff.\" Reporter: And as we now know, the inspiring tale pulled the heart strings of thousands across the country. By the middle of March, d'amico and Mcclure squandered the vast majority of money. Reporter: As the money poured in, Mcclure and d'amico stipulated the funds would go to buy Bobbitt a new home which Johnny will own and the dream truck he's always wanted. We have meetings set up with us and a financial adviser and a lawyer, obviously, because it's gotten to this point. We're just going to really go off of them and what they say. Reporter: But this August, the bubble began to burst when Bobbitt accused the couple of stealing his money. I have to ask them for everything. It was kind of -- in the beginning, it was a joke. Like they were like my parents. But the joke stops being funny after a while. Reporter: Alleging they bought him a camper that they parked on their property and of the $400,000 plus, he says he only got $75,000, claiming the couple spent the rest on themselves, money that allegedly went into funding a lavish lifestyle, one that they flaunted on social media, going to Vegas, visiting the grand canyon on a private helicopter tour. Mcclure seen here with a Louis Vuitton bag, gambling. Then in late summer, the legal woes between the trio started to raise questions. The question remains, what happened to all that money and where did it go? Reporter: According to court records, on August 27th, d'amico allegedly texted Bobbitt saying, in part, I say I get rid of my team of lawyers, you get rid of yours, and Kate and I will write you a check. Seriously. Prosecutors claiming the fantasy-filled hoax quickly turned into a nightmare. Bobbitt filing a civil suit against Mcclure and d'amico eventually igniting a criminal investigation. We're here today asking the defendants where the money went. Reporter: With much of the money missing, the couple's attorney said in New Jersey court that they promised to provide an accounting of the fund. I would urge anybody to withhold judgment until that's been made public. Reporter: But when the judge ordered the couple to return any remaining money into escrow, their attorney said there is nothing left. The next day, police executed a search warrant on the couple's home, towing away this BMW and taking out bags of evidence as d'amico stood in his yard, swinging a golf club. Today, prosecutors say it was that legal battle that motivated them to look into the alleged scheme. If they hadn't started fighting over the money, would they have gotten away with it? There's a good chance they might have. Reporter: In a statement to ABC news, gofundme writing in part that while this type of behavior by an individual is extremely rare, it's unacceptable and clearly it has consequences. Committing fraud, whether it takes place on or offline is against the law. The company also stating that campaigns with misuse make up less than 0.1% of all campaigns. The company today saying all donors will receive a full refund. What I needed was money and what I received was love. Thank you! Thank you. Reporter: But crowd sourcing websites have raised billions of dollars for good and with the holidays approaching, there are steps you can take to help make sure that your money is going to the right place. The better business bureau recommending you learn all you can about the charity or individual. Do a reverse image search on any photos used in the campaign. And caution that scammers often put up multiple campaigns across several platforms. There's definitely an element of buyer beware. You are not dealing with organizations that have tax exemptions, for example, that have been vetted. You're dealing with people.

Cindy Hyde-Smith and a GOP campaign group have launched ads questioning whether Espy lied about his work for Ivory Coast ex-President Laurent Gbagbo, who is on trial at the International Criminal Court. Fox News reported on Espy's lobbying work Thursday.\n\nFederal registration papers show Espy was hired by the Cocoa and Coffee Board of the Ivory Coast from Jan. 1 to March 15 in 2011, collecting $750,000 before terminating the contract two weeks before its scheduled end.\n\n\"He lied because he said he cancelled the contract and there's evidence to the contrary that he did not,\" Hyde-Smith campaign spokeswoman Melissa Scallan said Friday. \"Also, that he was willing to have a contract with someone who is now on trial in international court is, I think, telling.\"\n\nFor days the Espy campaign and Democratic groups have hammered Hyde-Smith over her video-recorded statement praising a supporter at a Nov. 2 campaign stop by saying: \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nCriticism of Espy's lobbying work comes as his supporters are hitting Hyde-Smith over additional video-recorded statements from Nov. 3 in which she joked about \"liberal folks\" and making it \"just a little more difficult\" for them to vote.\n\nEspy spokesman Danny Blanton told Fox on Thursday that Espy ended the contract after realizing his Ivory Coast client \"didn't pass the smell test.\" On Friday, Blanton pointed back at Hyde-Smith's earlier remarks.\n\n\"Since that hasn't worked, she's trying to change the subject with a smear campaign against Mike,\" Blanton said in a statement.\n\nA racially diverse group of more than 50 people gathered Friday in downtown Jackson and chanted, \"No hate in our state\" and \"Cindy gotta go.\"\n\n\"She'll be glad to sit in a front-row seat of a public hanging, yet she'll brag about being endorsed by the Right to Life,\" said George H. Williams, a 65-year-old Marine Corps veteran from Ridgeland. \"Isn't that ironic?\"\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy will compete in a Nov. 27 runoff for the final two years of a six-year term begun by Republican Thad Cochran, who retired in April. Mississippi's governor appointed Hyde-Smith as a temporary successor.\n\nEspy was Mississippi's first African-American congressman in the 20th century and U.S. secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton. He's running in a state that last elected a Democrat to the Senate in 1982.\n\nEspy's involvement with Gbagbo was the subject of news stories in 2010 and 2011. Documents filed with the U.S. Justice Department also show the Cocoa and Coffee Board paid Espy an initial $40,000 to travel to the West African nation and consult in December 2010, weeks after a disputed presidential election. The international community agreed that challenger Alassane Ouattara was victorious, but Gbagbo claimed he had won another term.\n\nEspy appeared on Ivory Coast television in that country during the December 2010 visit and told The Telegraph newspaper in London that civil war threatened to resume there.\n\n\"President Gbagbo is very clear that he's not backing down,\" The Telegraph quoted Espy.\n\nEspy, through a company he owned, agreed to begin working Jan. 1, 2011, to prevent the U.S. from \"blacklisting\" purchases of Ivorian coffee and cocoa, to advocate on \"issues relating to child labor laws\" and to urge the U.S. government \"to investigate irregularities\" in the elections, according to forms he filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nWith reports of abuses against civilians by Gbagbo's security forces mounting, Washington publication The Hill questioned Espy about his work there. Espy said in a March 12, 2011, article that he had ended work in February and had only been paid $400,000.\n\n\"I have voluntarily suspended it,\" Espy told The Hill. \"Events are spiraling rapidly. It is very difficult to work in that context.\"\n\nBut documents Espy filed months later showed a $350,000 payment on March 1, 2011, bringing the total to $750,000. The contract didn't end until March 15. That was 15 days before it was originally supposed to conclude.\n\nGbagbo surrendered in April 2011 after Ouattara's forces closed in and United Nations and French forces began fighting against him. Later that year, he was transferred to the custody of the International Criminal Court, where he stands accused of inciting murder, rape and other inhumane acts. Gbagbo denies guilt and says the court lacks evidence.\n\nEspy resigned his Cabinet post in 1994 amid a special counsel investigation that accused him of improperly accepting gifts. He was tried and acquitted on 30 corruption charges, but the Mississippi Republican Party has called him \"too corrupt for the Clintons.\"\n\nEspy said he refused offers of plea deals.\n\n\"Of all their 70 witnesses, no one even touched me,\" he said Thursday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .

They were out, Dan. I mean, these boys were so sedated, you could easily have operated on them and they would have felt nothing. I mean, they were essentially vegetables being hauled through that tunnel and the decision was if we don't do this, they will panic and almost certainly die. Not only them, but they would take the divers down with them. When people panic when they dive, they grab at the divers, their rescuers, rip face masks, tear their regulators out of their mouth. They'll do anything to try to survive even though what they're actually doing is killing themselves and the diver. Reporter: It's the heart-stopping untold story of the rescue that captivated the world. In the urgent ask you operation in Thailand, 12 young soccer players and their coach. Found alive in a flooded cave in Thailand. More than two weeks in a cave without any real food, very little water. Authorities say that high risk operation is now under way. Tonight, all 12 young soccer players and their coach are free. That is the great news. Reporter: Outside that cave in Thailand, a picture of patience and perseverance. Inside, 12 boys and their soccer coach. How many of you? 13? Brilliant. Reporter: Trapped miles deep by flood waters, struggling to survive as they waited to be rescued. The boys used to practice on this soccer field. My colleague, ABC's Matt Gutman right there for it all, now revealing startling new details about the massive international ask you effort in his new book \"The boys in the cave\" the mistakes that nearly doomed the mission and a controversial decision that rendered the boys unconscious. The decision to sedate, was that controversial? It's so controversial, and one of the only places that you'll see it is in the book, that the Thai government has basically clamped down on it, censored information and there was a very awkward moment in Thailand where I met the parents and I started talking about the sedation, and they said, what? What do you mean, sedation? I was the first person to tell them nearly six weeks after the rescue that their children had been sedated. They had no idea. Reporter: Shedding new light on the urgency facing Thai officials and a stunning admission. Soon after the reporting started, I understood that the divers themselves expected most of the boys to die on the way out, and they told the Thai government this. They basically said to the Thai government, they will asphyxiate in this tiny chamber that they're in, they might die of disease, two of them have pneumonia. This is going to get really ugly really fast. We have to do something now. I never had to think for a second about whether I would go. I think it's human nature to know if you've got an ability and of course you will. We always knew we could get them out. It was whether we could get them out alive or not. Reporter: In the book, Matt uncovers many of the harsh realities. Behind difficult decisions the divers were forced to make. They really thought going in there that 75% to 80% of the boys would die that day. They were using completely unorthodox methods that had never been tried or tested. Reporter: Revealing two of the boys nearly didn't make it. One of the boys nearly went hypothermic because his diver got lost and after a while he just stopped in one of these chambers, found some dry ground, put his boy on the side, tried to find something to wrap him in and waited for somebody to come find him, which luckily they did. Another boy stopped breathing when he was sedated. They were given ketamine but we're talking about one boy, one diver in a short tunnel and they couldn't be sure if the boys had died or if something was wrong with them, they didn't know, and they weren't doctors. Reporter: Under a mountain that according to Thai legend is inhabited by a mythical sleeping princess, the boys were marooned a mile and a half into the cave, the entire rescue effort a carefully calibrated human relay, a guideline set up spanning back to the kids and their coach, moving as a cohesive unit, the divers implemented a buddy system to escort each of the boys out. A lead diver tethered to each boy carrying their oxygen tank while the rear diver helped them navigate the twisting maze of those tight underwater passages. It is a tremendous moment here in Thailand. Hard to understate. Reporter: Was that the end of the operation? They still had four Thai Navy S.E.A.L.S in the back of the cave. They had stayed with them for the last few days just to keep up their spirits and to let the boys know, they're not giving up without them. Those guys were willing to die with the boys if it came to that. Those four Thai Navy S.E.A.L.S brought up the rear. They were given extra air tanks to come out and the first one pops out, hooray. Second one, hooray. After the second Thai Navy S.E.A.L. Came out, the pumps broke so the water started rising. Feet within a few minutes. The U.S. Special ops guy describes going through that part of the cave, puckering his lips, leaning his head all the way back and just sucking the little sips of air left on the ceiling and it's incredibly dramatic. It's a time capsule. All the pumps are there, the water bottles, the chairs, all their air tanks by the hundreds were left in there as they abandoned ship. Reporter: What have you learned about the dynamics among the boys and their coach inside that cave? The coach acted as a coach, father figure, priest, meditation leader. He got them into that mess. He also helped keep them alive in the cave. He instituted a regiment where they would dig for part of the day, then rest, then meditate, then talk, then sleep, and he kept their spirits up the whole time. And basically, every boy broke down. They all cried. In fact, the boys started hallucinating in the cave. You're so deprived of all the ambient sound that all you hear is the drip and those drips can turn into any sound your brain wants and this is a really common phenomenon. When they were found, they started talking about all the children they heard and the dogs barking, there must be an exit near us but there wasn't. It was just their minds playing tricks on them. Reporter: The coach turning into a national hero. As for the boys, besides becoming international celebrities, Matt says they are still embracing adventure. When I was there in Thailand, I saw the kids riding bikes around at night and I asked the parents, what's going on? They said, in order to hold on to our kids, we have to let them go. We have to let them be the adventurers they were before. And that's the only way that they're really going to recover is by being them.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Severe cyclone kills 10 in southern India; 80,000 evacuated", "description": "A severe cyclone has unleashed heavy rains and winds of 90 kilometers (55 miles) per hour, killing at least 10 people in southern India", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/severe-cyclone-kills-10-southern-india-80000-evacuated-59235928", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:46:17Z", "content": "A severe cyclone has unleashed heavy rains and winds of 90 kilometers (55 miles) per hour, killing at least 10 people in southern India.

But it decided it will focus its initial batch of recommendations on less controversial areas such as school hardening before addressing difficult issues like mental health.\n\nThe 14-member panel must file its initial report to outgoing Gov. Rick Scott, his successor and the Legislature by Jan. 1.\n\nState Sen. Lauren Book, a member of the commission, said she expects all legislators will read the report and take it seriously, given the magnitude of the tragedy.\n\n\"We all within the Legislature come from different backgrounds and different knowledge bases,\" Book said. \"Giving some information is good, getting too much into the weeds is dangerous.\"\n\nStoneman Douglas social studies teacher Ernie Rospierski, who herded students down a stairwell and used his body to barricade the door behind them after being grazed by two bullets, told commissioners to be \"very careful\" about putting more safety requirements on teachers because they are already overworked. But, he said, the panel needs to begin writing \"the playbook\" for preventing future tragedies.\n\n\"Until that is finished, we are going to see this again and again,\" Rospierski said.\n\nThe commissioners decided not to go through their items publicly Friday. They said they would review possible recommendations accumulated by their staff individually, submit suggestions and concerns and then debate them publicly at their meeting next month.\n\nMeanwhile, the attorney for the sheriff's deputy who was on the campus during the massacre started a charity website to raise money for the man's legal defense. Joseph DiRuzzo III started a GoFundMe page for now-retired Broward County sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson in hopes of raising $150,000 \"to defend him against any spurious claims of criminal liability.\" As of Friday afternoon, $40 had been raised before the drive appeared shut down.\n\nDiRuzzo noted the GoFundMe page in a lawsuit filed this week to block Scott Peterson from being forced to testify before the commission. Many commissioners have called Peterson \"a coward\" for not charging into the building with his handgun and confronting the shooter, who was armed with a semi-automatic rifle.\n\nSecurity video shows Peterson arrived outside the three-story building where the killings happened shortly after the shooting began, about the same time the gunman finished slaying 11 people on the first floor. Peterson drew his handgun, but retreated to cover next to the neighboring building. The video shows Peterson never left that spot for 50 minutes, even after other deputies and police officers arrived on campus and went inside.\n\nPanel members have said they believe Peterson's inaction allowed suspect Nikolas Cruz to climb to the third floor, where five students and one teacher were killed. They believe if Peterson, 55, had confronted Cruz and engaged him in a shootout he could have killed him or given others more time to reach safety.\n\nDiRuzzo said in his lawsuit that as the first deputy on scene, Peterson was the incident commander charged with coordinating law enforcement's response until relieved by a superior. DiRuzzo said Peterson was never relieved and fulfilled that duty by directing officers into the building and ordering the closing of the school and surrounding streets.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, the panel's chairman, said Friday that DiRuzzo's lawsuit is \"a work of fiction.\"\n\n\"Peterson did not do his job. Peterson is a failure, and he should be embarrassed and held accountable for what he did not do,\" Gualtieri said.\n\nAlso Friday, the commission learned that eight of the state's 67 countywide school districts haven't filed safety assessments mandated after the massacre.\n\nState Education Commissioner Pam Stewart, a commission member, said Friday there's little she can do to districts that don't file the assessments, which were due Oct. 31. She said one county's report was delayed because of Hurricane Michael and others are completed but awaiting approval of their district school boards.\n\nPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd, a commission member, said the new state law should require the suspension of a district's superintendent and board chair if the deadline is broken.\n\nThe panel has been meeting periodically since April and includes law enforcement, education and mental health officials, a legislator and the fathers of two dead students.\n\nCruz, a 20-year-old former Stoneman Douglas student, is charged with the slayings. He has pleaded not guilty, but his attorneys have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence.

The migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the teeming border city of more than 1.6 million to handle the influx.\n\nPleading for financial support from the Mexican government, Gastelum sternly warned migrants against criminal behavior, though authorities reported only seven arrests so far \u2014 five for drug consumption and two for disorderly conduct.\n\n\"Supposedly they are fleeing catastrophe, mistreatment in their countries of origin. How is it possible that they arrive here and, if they want, create disorder?\" the mayor said. \"It's not right.\"\n\nHis language linking the latest arrivals to crime underscores how the caravan is already testing Tijuana's proud history as a melting pot for immigrants, a tradition that Gastelum also highlighted.\n\nA municipal gymnasium and recreational complex that has been converted to a shelter was expected to register up to 1,000 people Thursday night but ended up housing more than 2,000, including more than 400 children.\n\nTijuana officials said they opened the shelter as part of an effort to keep migrants out of public spaces.\n\nThe city's privately run shelters are meant to have a capacity of 700.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, long lines formed for showers and meals of tuna casserole or noodle soup with coffee. Outdoor canopies covered rows of mattresses and blankets.\n\nA woman singing Mexican \"ranchera\" music on a loudspeaker drew a small crowd, while men congregated in circles to play cards. Eighteen new portable toilets on a grass field made bathroom lines disappear.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in last week's elections, took to Twitter on Friday to aim some new criticism at the migrants.\n\n\"Isn't it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country \u2014 yet they are proudly waving ... their country's flag. Can this be possible? Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it,\" he said in a pair of tweets.\n\nMigrant Ronald Calderon, who picked coffee beans back in Honduras, said he would seek asylum in the U.S. if he felt there was a 90 percent chance of success. But he figures the odds are long and doesn't want to risk being deported, so he hopes to find work and settle in Tijuana.\n\n\"I see that Donald Trump talks about us as criminals and killers, and I don't think an opportunity may present itself,\" said Calderon, 23.\n\nAndrea Ramirez, 42, said that her siblings were killed by gangs in Honduras and that she registered her name Friday to seek asylum in the U.S.\n\n\"The only thing we want is not to go back to Honduras,\" Ramirez said.\n\nAlso Friday, another caravan set out from Mexico City heading toward the border.\n\nGastelum, the mayor, wondered why the migrants chose Tijuana instead of other Mexican cities on the U.S. border, vaguely suggesting a sinister plot without elaborating.\n\n\"There is an intention to do things badly. There is an intention to prejudice Tijuana, and we cannot allow that,\" he said.\n\nHis comments marked a contrast to a more welcoming tone from other officials. Francisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said Thursday that the state had 7,000 jobs available for any migrants who obtain legal status in Mexico.\n\nGustavo Magallanes, director of Baja California's migrant attention agency, said Friday that the state is doing the best it can at a difficult time and that, nearing the end of the year, agencies at all levels of government lack funds.\n\nThe governor had also asked federal officials to speak to their U.S. counterparts about possibly accelerating asylum processing, he said.\n\nMagallanes said the governor had not ordered that more migrants be prevented from arriving in Tijuana, but said state officials were telling people in the caravan they might get processed faster in the city of Mexicali because the list in Tijuana is so long.\n\nMagallanes said it was \"likely\" the migrants could be waiting in Tijuana for four to six months. The state government plans to push them to regularize their immigration status in Mexico so they can be offered work.\n\nHe said he could not speak for Tijuana's mayor but believed his comments had been misinterpreted.\n\n\"We are looking for the best way for these Central American migrants ... to be able to be in the best situation in this state,\" Magallanes said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "AP PHOTOS: Editor selections from Latin America, Caribbean", "description": "AP PHOTOS: Vanguard of migrant caravan arrives at border, Colombian officials grapple with growing numbers of Venezuelans, Argentina gets a new national park", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ap-photos-editor-selections-latin-america-caribbean-59235106", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_d8d2e88164db4b44b49889b8960fc4e0_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:04:40Z", "content": "This photo gallery highlights some of the top news images made by Associated Press photographers in Latin America and the Caribbean published in the past week.

Chiefs-Rams is back in Los Angeles, in prime time and, if it lives up to its billing, could be a wild, high-scoring affair.\n\nRegardless of who wins, both clubs figure to be in the Super Bowl mix. And because of the extracurriculars associated with Monday night's meeting, perhaps it won't be a fair measurement which is the superior team.\n\nWho cares?\n\nFor a mid-November match, fans can't ask for much better than a pair of 9-1 teams with powerhouse offenses and stars galore \u2014 leading MVP contenders Todd Gurley of Los Angeles and Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City for starters \u2014 going at it as the only show in town. No matter which town.\n\nIt's the first meeting in NFL history this late in a season between two teams averaging 33 points per game.\n\n\"He's made some plays that you sit back and you can't help but just say, 'Wow, what a great play,'\" Rams coach Sean McVay says of Mahomes, who leads the NFL in yards passing (3,150). Rams QB Jared Goff is second (3,134).\n\nMahomes set a Chiefs record with an NFL-best 31st TD pass of the season last week. Len Dawson had held that KC record since 1964.\n\nGurley paces the NFL in scoring (108 points), yards rushing (988), carries (198), yards from scrimmage (1,390) and touchdowns (17). He has scored a touchdown in 13 consecutive games, extending his own franchise record.\n\n\"He is a heck of a player. A great player,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid says when asked how to slow Gurley. \"You have to be disciplined. They're a disciplined offense, so you have to be disciplined from a defensive standpoint. Then practice that way and then you go play.\"\n\nOK, guys, go play. Let America watch what could be a classic.\n\nThe weekend began Thursday night with Seattle's 27-24 home victory over Green Bay. Russell Wilson threw for 225 yards and his 15-yard touchdown pass to Ed Dickson with 5:08 left was the difference. Seattle (5-5) snapped a two-game losing streak. Green Bay dropped to 4-5-1.\n\nOff this week are New England (7-3), the New York Jets (3-7), Miami (5-5), Cleveland (3-6-1), San Francisco (2-8) and Buffalo (3-7).\n\nMINNESOTA (5-3-1) at CHICAGO (6-3)\n\nWe soon will find out if the Bears are for real. They are on top of the NFC North, now face the defending division winners, then in a ridiculously short turnaround from Sunday night, they play the early Thanksgiving Day game at Detroit. They also have the Rams and Packers on the road in December.\n\nTwo of the NFL's stingiest and most physical defenses should be main factors Sunday.\n\nMinnesota has allowed an average of only 252.5 yards over last four games, winning three. It did so missing some starters. Safety Harrison Smith likes seeing the Bears: Smith has four interceptions and six passes defended in 10 career games vs. Chicago.\n\nChicago dropped 10 in a row against the NFC North before beating Detroit last Sunday. It leads the NFL with 16 interceptions, and ranks second with 24 takeaways.\n\nHOUSTON (6-3) at WASHINGTON (6-3)\n\nTwo also-rans of 2017 now leading their divisions.\n\nThe Texans have won six in a row and come off a bye. Key personnel such as DE J.J. Watt and QB Deshaun Watson were injured last year and are now playing at peak efficiency.\n\nIf Watson gets time to throw \u2014 Houston has surrendered 30 sacks \u2014 DeAndre Hopkins will be the biggest challenge to cover. He has four games with 10-plus catches, 100-plus yards and a touchdown through the air. That's most in the league since the start of 2017, and Hopkins has five TD catches over the past four games. .\n\nWashington has showed some balance on offense, but the defense has been a major factor in its strong year. It has forced a turnover in 13 consecutive games, the NFL's longest active streak.\n\nTENNESSEE (5-4) at INDIANAPOLIS (4-5)\n\nSuddenly, there's a race in the AFC South, and the Colts could get even more involved with a fourth consecutive victory. But the Titans, coming off their best game by far in an upset of the Patriots, have won six straight within the division.\n\nOf course, Andrew Luck was not in the lineup for any of those; Luck is 9-0 in starts against Tennessee.\n\n\"I'm aware of it,\" Luck says. \"But what's happened has happened, and good, bad or ugly, it doesn't really matter.\"\n\nThe Titans have the league's No. 1 scoring defense, allowing 16.8 points a game, and have yielded a league-low 16 touchdowns.\n\nPHILADELPHIA (4-5) at NEW ORLEANS (8-1)\n\nNew Orleans looks like the NFL's top team right now, and the Eagles don't resemble their title-winning squad of last season.\n\nInjuries are damaging Philly's defense at a really bad time. A banged-up secondary takes on Drew Brees and his assortment of helpers. The Saints have scored at least 40 points in five games this season, the third team in NFL history to score 40 in five of the first nine. Brees is completing 77.1 percent of his passes, has thrown for 21 TDs with one interception, and has a 123.8 passer rating.\n\nMichael Thomas is tied for the NFL lead with 78 catches, ranks second with 950 yards, while Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram form a formidable and versatile backfield.\n\nPITTSBURGH (6-2-1) at JACKSONVILLE (3-6)\n\nThe Steelers will be wise to look forward and not back at their last encounter with the Jaguars. Jacksonville beat Pittsburgh twice last season, including a 45-42 playoff shocker at Heinz Field.\n\nThinking revenge would be foolish because the Steelers are on a roll. Well, so are the Jags: Pittsburgh has won five in a row, Jacksonville has dropped that many consecutively.\n\nSteelers running back James Conner has not allowed the team to regret the contract impasse that has led to Le'Veon Bell sitting out the season. Conner is the eighth player in team history with at least 10 rushing touchdowns, leads the AFC in rushing, and is expected to play after being placed in concussion protocol following last week's win over Carolina.\n\nCINCINNATI (5-4) at BALTIMORE (4-5)\n\nCincinnati brings an historically leaky defense to Baltimore, which might be without regular quarterback Joe Flacco (hip). That would mean either first-round pick Lamar Jackson or veteran Robert Griffin III will try to further expose that Bengals unit.\n\nThe Bengals have won eight of the last 10 in the series, but they fired first-year defensive coordinator Teryl Austin after a 51-14 loss to the Saints, the second-most points allowed in franchise history. They became the first team in the Super Bowl era to give up 500 yards in three straight games and are on pace to give up an NFL-record 7,273 yards.\n\nHead coach Marvin Lewis takes over defensive coordinator duties, too.\n\nDALLAS (4-5) at ATLANTA (4-5)\n\nThe Falcons appeared ready to take a role in the playoff race with three successive wins. Then, they put forth a stinker at Cleveland.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys seemed headed toward irrelevance before they went into Philadelphia and outplayed the Super Bowl champions.\n\nDallas will want to run with Zeke Elliott, who's second in the NFL in rushing behind Gurley after gaining 151 yards against the Eagles. Atlanta will want to throw: Matt Ryan has seven games with a QB rating over 100 and six games with more than 300 yards passing, while Julio Jones became the fastest player in NFL history with more than 10,000 yards receiving.\n\nCAROLINA (6-3) at DETROIT (3-6)\n\nBoth teams would like to forget last week's poor performances.\n\nCarolina leads this infrequent series 6-2 and remains in good position in the wild-card race with a victory. Detroit needs an immediate turnaround to get into contention.\n\nIf this is close, expect Cam Newton and Co. to win. Since 2013, the Panthers are 26-14 in games decided by seven points or fewer. They have won five straight games decided by three or fewer.\n\nNewton has thrown at least two TD passes in eight straight games, the longest streak in franchise history.\n\nDENVER (3-6) at LOS ANGELES CHARGERS (7-2)\n\nWhile the Rams grab the headlines in LA, the Chargers keep grabbing victories. They could get help in the AFC West if their neighbors knock off KC, too.\n\nThe Chargers are a league-best 13-3 since Week 9 of last season. Their six-game winning streak marks the 11th time since the merger they had a streak of six or more. Philip Rivers has thrown for two or more TDs in nine straight games. Only five quarterbacks in league history have a string of 10 or more games.\n\nTAMPA BAY (3-6) at NEW YORK GIANTS (2-7)\n\nSaturday's Notre Dame-Syracuse matchup in the New York area figures to be more fun than this, although the Bucs usually pile up the yards in passing offense and the Giants come off a stirring Eli Manning-led comeback win.\n\nTampa has lost three in row and six of seven, while New York broke a five-game slide on Monday night. Bucs wideouts Mike Evans (13 catches for 217 yards and a TD in two games) and DeSean Jackson (five touchdowns in the last six games) have feasted on the Giants' defense.\n\nOAKLAND (1-8) at ARIZONA (2-7)\n\nThe lowest-ranked teams in the AP Pro32 face off with the Cardinals coming off a solid effort at Kansas City. The Raiders? They seem to have fallen into the Black Hole, outscored 54-9 in the last two games.\n\nCardinals star Larry Fitzgerald needs eight receptions to surpass Jerry Rice for the most catches for one team.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Australia, Malaysia trade words over Israel embassy shift", "description": "A diplomatic war of words has erupted between Australia and Malaysia over the possibility of Canberra moving its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/australia-malaysia-trade-words-israel-embassy-shift-59233684", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T04:22:52Z", "content": "A top Australia n official seized Friday on past comments from Malaysia's prime minister seen as anti-Semitic, amid a diplomatic war of words over the possibility of Canberra moving its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

For the next five years, according to Christie's, he was both \"the great love of Hockney's life\" and one of his favorite models.\n\nThe relationship ended in 1971.

Its support officially ended in June despite an outcry among health officials in North Korea and in the international community that it could spark a major epidemic.\n\nNeurosurgeon Kee Park, of the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School, said in an email to The Associated Press that the situation is extremely dire and likely to get dramatically worse in the years ahead if it is not properly dealt with.\n\nThe U.S.-based nonprofit Eugene Bell Foundation, which works on the ground treating tuberculosis in North Korea, said Friday that the crisis is being compounded by U.S.-led sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and missile program.\n\nNorth Korea has one of the world's highest rates of tuberculosis, a highly infectious disease that, while treatable, globally causes more than 1 million deaths each year. According to the World Health Organization, about 107,000 cases of tuberculosis were reported in North Korea in 2017. Making matters worse, North Korea has estimated that 6-7 percent of its tuberculosis population has the drug-resistant variety, known as MDR-TB, which is far more difficult and costly to cure.\n\n\"As a result of the loss of the Global Fund grants for the DPRK, we expect a 50-75 percent reduction in treatment capacity for non-MDR-TB patients,\" Park said. \"Consequently, our model predicts between 155,000 to 210,000 more people will die from TB-related causes within five years. To be clear, these are new deaths that are expected on top of the current mortality rates. We have assumed that the treatment of MDR-TB will continue at current levels.\"\n\nDrug-resistant tuberculosis generally results from patients not taking the proper amount or combination of medications to completely cure them of the disease, or by coming into contact with someone who has been infected with it already.\n\nIt is often found among populations that have had some exposure to TB medications, such as cities or other places with populations that are relatively more affluent \u2014 or at least affluent enough to have paid for some form of TB medication already.\n\nPyongyang, the North Korean capital, is believed to have a particularly high incidence of the drug-resistant TB strain.\n\nGlobal Fund announced in February that it was ending its grants to North Korea, effectively ending the largest outside public health assistance program ever for the North, because of a lack of transparency and difficult operating conditions. It has said its stockpile would last for a year, which is longer than the average 6- to 9-month course of treatment for a TB patient.\n\nBut the concern is over what will happen after that, how any new cases can be treated if no one else steps in to fill the gap and whether the limited pool of medications would be \"rationed\" in an ill-advised effort to spread out what medications are left.\n\n\"Time is ticking,\" Park said. \"I have heard from people who have been inside recently that the rationing has already started.\"\n\nThe problem is especially acute because North Korea has a fragile public health system that could easily be overwhelmed by a large outbreak, sending North Koreans streaming across the country's border with China, making the epidemic a bigger, regional issue.\n\nConcerns over such a calamity prompted the North to essentially close its borders during the Ebola scare in 2015 and during the SARS outbreak in 2003 in China, though neither seemed to present much of a threat to the isolated North.\n\nStephen Linton, chairman of the Eugene Bell Foundation, told reporters in Seoul that South Korea lacks the sense of urgency to help groups like his gain sanctions exemptions so that they can deliver supplies to treat patients in North Korea.\n\nHe likened the problem to having the house next door on fire, and said North Korea's tuberculosis problem could potentially have health consequences for South Korea.\n\nLinton said he believes Global Fund's decision was at least partially connected to sanctions-related pressure. The U.S. government, which pledged $1.4 billion this year, is one of the biggest donors to Global Fund.\n\nHe noted that it has also gotten harder for American aid workers to get permission to travel to the North since President Donald Trump announced his travel ban for U.S. citizens more than a year ago.\n\nChoi Seemoon, a Eugene Bell director, said that while Eugene Bell and Global Fund have provided MDR-TB medications to about 2,000 patients this year, that's less than 30 percent of the estimated 8,000 North Koreans with the condition. Global Fund's stock of regular tuberculosis medicine will run out in early 2020, she warned, while its stock of MDR-TB medicine can only cover patients registered by the autumn of this year.\n\n\"There needs to be a quick purchase of medicine and supplies to overcome the void left by Global Fund,\" Choi said. \"Whether the issue is resolved through inter-Korean talks or through international bodies and non-governmental channels, there should be a quick delivery of tuberculosis medicine to North Korea regardless of what channel it takes.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTalmadge is the AP's Pyongyang bureau chief.

The communist Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of the late Pol Pot, sought to eliminate all traces of what they saw as corrupt bourgeois life, destroying most religious, financial and social institutions.\n\nNuon Chea (NOO'-ahn CHEE'-ah) and Khieu Samphan (KEE'-yoh sahm-PAHN') were sentenced by the U.N.-assisted court to life in prison, the same punishment they are already serving after being convicted in a previous trial for crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers of people and mass disappearances. Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was considered the Khmer Rouge's main ideologist and Pol Pot's right-hand man, while Khieu Samphan, 87, served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nDissent under Khmer Rouge rule was usually met with death, and even the group's loyalists faced torture and execution as the radical experiment at revolution failed, with blame cast about its ranks for alleged sabotage.\n\nBut executions counted for only a fraction of the death toll. Starvation, overwork and medical neglect took many more lives, amounting to as much as one-quarter to one-third of the entire population.\n\nOnly when an invasion by Vietnam finally drove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979 did the magnitude of Cambodia's holocaust become known.\n\nFriday's verdict, read aloud by Judge Nil Nonn, established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities.\n\nScholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. They included murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nThe tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC, also ordered reparations for some of those judged to be victims.\n\nIt found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham for insufficient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nAmong the large crowd of spectators at Friday's session was 65-year-old Sum Rithy, who said he had been jailed for nearly two years under the Khmer Rouge, who accused him of being a spy for the CIA. His life was spared only because he was a skilled mechanic who could maintain engines and generators for his captors.\n\nRithy said three of his siblings were killed, also accused of being CIA spies, while his father died of starvation.\n\n\"Today, I am very happy that both the Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to life in prison. The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\" he said. \"Last night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\"\n\nNuon Chea suffers heart problems and was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution.\n\nThe tribunal in 2010 also convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia's long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further cases to go forward, saying they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by Vietnam's invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to attain a broader sweep of justice has troubled some observers.\n\n\"Today's verdict hopefully brings some measure of justice to the victims, 40 years after the unspeakable mass atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia,\" said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East and Southeast Asia. \"While this second trial of the Khmer Rouge's last surviving senior leaders results in two convictions, and 14 reparation projects, this is bitter justice: the world has waited far too long for this moment. Decades after the crimes and 13 years after it was established, the ECCC should have achieved much more.\"\n\nOthers, however, highlighted the tribunal's accomplishments.\n\n\"International tribunals are better than the alternative, impunity. They will always be political and fall short of expectations,\" Alexander Hinton, an anthropology professor at Rutgers University and author of two books about the tribunal, said ahead of Friday's verdicts. \"But justice is usually delivered, even if at times, as has been the case with the ECCC, it staggers across the finish line.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rebel Wilson loses bid to keep most of defamation payout", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

This is how Californians are trying to cope with wildfires choking the state, but experts say an increase in serious health problems may be almost inevitable for vulnerable residents as the disasters become more commonplace.\n\nResearch suggests children, the elderly and those with existing health problems are most at risk.\n\nShort-term exposure to wildfire smoke can worsen existing asthma and lung disease, leading to emergency room treatment or hospitalization, studies have shown.\n\nIncreases in doctor visits or hospital treatment for respiratory infections, bronchitis and pneumonia in otherwise healthy people also have been found during and after wildfires.\n\nSome studies also have found increases in ER visits for heart attacks and strokes in people with existing heart disease on heavy smoke days during previous California wildfires, echoing research on potential risks from urban air pollution.\n\nFor most healthy people, exposure to wildfire smoke is just an annoyance, causing burning eyes, scratchy throats or chest discomfort that all disappear when the smoke clears.\n\nBut doctors, scientists and public health officials are concerned that the changing face of wildfires will pose a much broader health hazard.\n\n\"Wildfire season used to be June to late September. Now it seems to be happening all year round. We need to be adapting to that,\" Dr. Wayne Cascio, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cardiologist, said this week.\n\nIn an overview published earlier this year, Cascio wrote that the increasing frequency of large wildland fires, urban expansion into wooded areas and an aging population are all increasing the number of people at risk for health problems from fires.\n\nWood smoke contains some of the same toxic chemicals as urban air pollution, along with tiny particles of vapor and soot 30 times thinner than a human hair. These can infiltrate the bloodstream, potentially causing inflammation and blood vessel damage even in healthy people, research on urban air pollution has shown. Studies have linked heart attacks and cancer with long-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nWhether exposure to wildfire smoke carries the same risks is uncertain, and determining harm from smog versus wildfire smoke can be tricky, especially with wind-swept California wildfires spreading thick smoke hundreds of miles away into smoggy big cities.\n\n\"That is the big question,\" said Dr. John Balmes, a University of California, San Francisco, professor of medicine who studies air pollution.\n\n\"Very little is known about the long-term effects of wildfire smoke because it's hard to study populations years after a wildfire,\" Balmes said.\n\nDecreased lung function has been found in healthy firefighters during fire season. They tend to recover but federal legislation signed this year will establish a U.S. registry tracking firefighters and potential risks for various cancers, including lung cancer. Some previous studies suggested a risk.\n\nBalmes noted that increased lung cancer rates have been found in women in developing countries who spend every day cooking over wood fires.\n\nThat kind of extreme exposure doesn't typically happen with wildfires, but experts worry about the kinds of health damage that may emerge for firefighters and residents with these blazes occurring so often.\n\nWhether that includes more cancer is unknown. \"We're concerned about that,\" Balmes said.\n\nRegular folks breathing in all that smoke worry about the risks too.\n\nSmoke from the fire that decimated the Northern California city of Paradise darkened skies this week in San Francisco, nearly 200 miles southwest, and the air smelled \"like you were camping,\" said Michael Northover, a contractor.\n\nHe and his 14-year-old son have first-time sinus infections that Northover blames on the smoke.\n\n\"We're all kind of feeling it,\" Northover said.\n\nThe smoke was so thick in San Francisco, the skyline was barely visible from across the Bay. The city's iconic open-air cable cars that are popular with tourists were pulled off the streets Thursday because of the bad air.\n\nAn Environmental Protection Agency website said air quality in Sacramento was \"hazardous\" Thursday and San Francisco's was \"very unhealthy.\" Many people walking around the cities wore face masks.\n\nMost schools in San Francisco, Sacramento, Oakland and Folsom said they would be closed Friday. At least six universities in Northern California canceled classes Thursday.\n\nAt Chico State University, 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Paradise, ash fell this week and classes were canceled until after Thanksgiving.\n\n\"It's kind of freaky to see your whole town wearing air masks and trying to get out of smoke,\" said freshman Mason West, 18. \"You can see the particles. Obviously, it's probably not good to be breathing that stuff in.\"\n\nWest returned home this week to Santa Rosa, hard hit by last year's wine country fires, only to find it shrouded in smoke from the Paradise fire 100 miles (160 kilometers) away. West's family had to evacuate last year for a week, but their home was spared.\n\n\"It's as bad here as it was in Chico,\" West said. \"It almost feels like you just can't get away from it.\"\n\nSmoke has been so thick in Santa Rosa that researchers postponed a door-to-door survey there for a study of health effects of last year's fire.\n\n\"We didn't feel we could justify our volunteer interns going knocking on doors when all the air quality alerts were saying stay indoors,\" said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a public health researcher at the University of California, Davis. The study includes an online survey of households affected by last year's fire, with responses from about 6,000 people so far.\n\nPreliminary data show widespread respiratory problems, eye irritations, anxiety, depression and sleep problems around the time of the fire and months later.\n\n\"Conventional thinking is that these effects related to fires are transient. It's not entirely clear that's the case,\" Hertz-Picciotto said.\n\nResearchers also will be analyzing cord blood and placentas collected from a few dozen women who were pregnant during the fire, seeking evidence of stress markers or exposure to smoke chemicals.\n\nThey hope to continue the study for years, seeking evidence of long-term physical and emotional harms to fire evacuees and their children.\n\nOther studies have linked emotional stress in pregnant women to developmental problems in their children and \"this was quite a stress,\" Hertz-Picciotto said.\n\nIt's a kind of stress that many people need to prepare for as the climate warms and wildfires proliferate, she said.\n\n\"Any of us could wake up tomorrow and lose everything we own,\" she said. \"It's pretty scary.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at https://twitter.com/LindseyTanner .

Add Interest\n\nThe accusations were detailed in a year-long investigative report, \"Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis\" published by the New York Times on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the more damaging aspects of the Times report was that Facebook hired a Republican-linked D.C. consulting firm to plant negative stories about Facebook's competitors and critics. The move seemingly contradicts the company's public claims that it is transparent about how it handles fake stories on the platform.\n\nSince the 2016 elections, Facebook has launched several \"transparency\" initiatives over the past year.\n\nAnnouncing a campaign targeting accountability for ads in June, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said, \"we are providing much more transparency than any other advertising platform, either online or offline.\"\n\nJosh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nFacebook fired the D.C. consulting firm, Definers Public Affairs, on Wednesday. Zuckerberg, in a conference call with reporters Thursday, repeatedly claimed he did not know that the company had been hired, trying to distinguish Facebook's culture with repeated references to \"Washington, D.C., firms.\"\n\n\"I learned about this relationship when I read The New York Times piece yesterday. I looked into whether this was the kind of firm we should be working with. And we\u2019re not working with them,\" Zuckerberg told reporters. \"This type of firm might be normal in Washington but it\u2019s not the kind of firm I want Facebook to be working with.\"\n\nZuckerberg also defended his key lieutenant, Sandberg.\n\nAntoine Antoniol/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"I want to be clear, I mentioned a couple of times I was not in the loop on some of these decisions, and Sheryl was also not involved and she learned about this the same time as I did,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Overall Sheryl is doing great work for this company, she\u2019s been a great partner to me and will continue to be a great partner to me.\u201d\n\nSandberg commented on Facebook late Thursday, saying she \"wanted to address some of the claims that have been made in the last 24 hours.\"\n\n\"On a number of issues -- including spotting and understanding the Russian interference we saw in the 2016 election -- Mark and I have said many times we were too slow. But to suggest that we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth, or we wanted to hide what we knew, or that we tried to prevent investigations, is simply untrue,\" she wrote. \"The allegations saying I personally stood in the way are also just plain wrong. This was an investigation of a foreign actor trying to interfere in our election. Nothing could be more important to me or to Facebook.\"\n\n'There are lot of things I\u2019d do differently'\n\nThe company has repeatedly admitted it had not done enough to prevent the spread of fake news and political manipulation on its site, which executives repeated on Thursday through multiple press statements and on a call with reporters.\n\n\"But to suggest we weren't interested in knowing the truth, or that we wanted to hide what we knew is simply untrue,\" Zuckerberg said at the beginning of the call, which was originally meant to tout the company's progress cracking down on fake accounts, hate speech, terrorist propaganda, bullying and child pornography.\n\nFor example, Facebook removed over 1.6 billion fake accounts between April and September of this year, the company reported on Thursday.\n\nFacebooks Community Standards Enforcement\n\nInstead, the call turned into a crisis management session in which Zuckerberg and other executives defended their decisions amid a barrage of media questions related to the claims in the Times story and continuing problems with bad actors on the platform.\n\n\"There are lot of things I\u2019d do differently in retrospect,\" Zuckerberg said about the company's actions regarding the election meddling.\n\nEarlier in the day, Facebook fought back against the Times story.\n\n\"The story asserts that we knew about Russian activity as early as the spring of 2016 but were slow to investigate it at every turn. This is not true,\" Facebook wrote in a statement. \"We also saw some new behavior when [Russia-linked group] APT28-related accounts, under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake personas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists. We shut these accounts down for violating our policies.'\"\n\nWhen asked if Facebook monitors the messages of journalists on its platform, Zuckerberg replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nZuckerberg effectively said he would not step down as chairman of his board of directors when asked specifically by reporters. Many corporate governance experts said it's an inherent conflict of interest for a CEO to also be chairman.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think that specific proposal is the right way to go,\" he said, when asked if he'd give up the chairman role.\n\nActivist investors had already been pushing for Zuckerberg to step down as chair.\n\n\"I think The New York Times reporting illustrates exactly why we are recommending an independent board chair. The fact that they kept the board in the dark for so long shows us that an independent board chair is necessary,\" Jonas Kron, whose company Trillium Investments owns 53,000 shares of Facebook, told ABC News. \"We knew that already, but the report should remove any lingering doubts.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Fundraising scam?", "description": "A couple and a homeless man are accused of concocting an elaborate scheme to rip off generous Americans.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/fundraising-scam-59230566", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/181115_wn_johnson_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:45:51Z", "content": "Now Playing: Judge orders couple behind $400,000 GoFundMe account in court Now Playing: Woman allegedly used social media to solicit donations for fake firefighter husband Now Playing: High Levels of carbon monoxide in the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy Now Pla\u2026 [+1000 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Fundraising scam?\n\nNext tonight, to the couple raising money on go fund me to help a homeless man, and tonight, all three of them are now facing charges.

The offense was punishable by up to 99 years if convicted, Flores said.\n\nHowever, CJ Precopia hadn't had contact with his ex in more than two years and was \"totally stunned\" by the allegations, according to Flores. He didn't even know where she lived at the time, Flores added.\n\nThe two dated for about six weeks while CJ Precopia was a 17-year-old high school senior and she was a 15-year-old sophomore, his mother, Erin Precopia told ABC News, adding that the breakup was not amicable.\n\nBut, the mother said when she discovered the date and time the woman was alleging the crime occurred: Sept. 20, 2017, around 7:20 p.m., a lightbulb went off in her head.\n\nShe said at that same time, Erin and CJ Precopia were at the Renaissance Austin Hotel, about 70 miles away from Bell County, for a Rodan + Fields event, \"Men Tell All,\" and they had the evidence to prove it.\n\nErin Precopia remembered a selfie she took with her son and two friends that night and posted to Facebook minutes later. The metadata for the photo showed that it was taken at 7:02 p.m., which a forensic expert hired by the Bell County Prosecutor's Office confirmed, Flores said.\n\nCourtesy Erin Precopia\n\nThe mother and son also provided screenshots from text messages showing that Erin Precopia was going to pick him up around \"6:10ish\" p.m. that night as evidence, and the two were located inside the hotel ballroom until about midnight, pings from cell towers showed, according to Flores. In addition, they interacted with more than a dozen people, some of whom provided sworn affidavits to prosecutors, Flores said.\n\nOn June 21 of this year, the Bell County Prosecutor's Office dismissed the case \"in the interest of justice,\" court documents showed.

And authorities in Maryland have just said they've had more than 300 car crashes in their state alone. All traffic stopped on the George Washington bridge here in New York City late today. And more than 6,000 flights have been delayed or canceled already. Take a look. The storm sweeping up from the south, the heavy snow and ice moving up into Philadelphia, new York City and Boston. Meteorologist rob Marciano leading us off. Reporter: Tonight, a white knuckle ride for drivers as a deadly winter storm wreaks havoc across nearly half the country. The storm hitting New York City at the height of the evening commute. Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Reporter: Multiple cars crashing on the George Washington bridge. We've been stuck on the road now for hours. And just take a look. That is the George Washington bridge into New York City. No car is moving. For much of the northeast, it's a traffic nightmare. Reporter: Washington, D.C., blanketed early in snow. In Maryland, state police responding to more than 300 crashes in just six hours. In the St. Louis area, cars fishtailing, even spinning out of control on the slick streets. Up to nearly ten inches of snow keeping plows busy on the roads, and de-icers busy at the airport. More than 1,300 flights cancelled and more than 5,600 others delayed across the country in the storm's wake. Hundreds of thousands losing power across the storm zone. Snowy, icy roads to blame for multiple crashes and at least four deaths in Arkansas. And in Mississippi, two people killed Wednesday when this tour bus, on its way to a casino, overturned.

I got to tell you, it's rare to see snow-covered streets in Manhattan, the earliest snow in 30 years. Let's get to the radar right now. The low is over the delmarva, and the snow shield is spreading north. Parts of Pennsylvania, already over eight inches. This will traverse the coast as a nor'easter tonight. The snow along I-95 will change to rain briefly. This wind will increase, as well, and then changing back to snow. So, not only a horrific commute tonight, but a horrific commute in the morning. Clearing out in the afternoon, and colder air. An additional one to three inches on the shoreline. Upstate New York could see over seven inches of snow. What a November snow event.

China's footprint is everywhere, from a showpiece boulevard and international convention center built with Chinese help to bus stop shelters that announce their origins with \"China Aid\" plaques.\n\nOn the eve of Xi's arrival for a state visit and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, newspapers in the country ran a full-page statement from the Chinese leader. It exhorted Pacific island nations to \"set sail on a new voyage\" of relations with China, which in the space of a generation has transformed from the world's most populous backwater into a major economic power.\n\nWith both actions and words, Xi has a compelling message for the South Pacific's fragile island states, long both propped up and pushed around by U.S. ally Australia: they now have a choice of benefactors. With the exception of Papua New Guinea, those island nations are not part of APEC, but the leaders of many of them have traveled to Port Moresby and will meet with Xi.\n\nThe APEC meeting, meanwhile, is Xi's to dominate. Headline-hogging leaders such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump are not attending. Trump's stand-in, Vice President Mike Pence, is staying in Cairns in Australia's north and flying into Papua New Guinea each day. Australia's new prime minister, Scott Morrison, the country's fifth leader in five years, is barely known abroad.\n\n\"President Xi Jinping is a good friend of Papua New Guinea,\" its prime minister, Peter O'Neill, told reporters. \"He has had a lot of engagement with Papua New Guinea and I've visited China 12 times in the last seven years.\"\n\nPacific island nations, mostly tiny, remote and poor, rarely figure prominently on the world stage but have for several years been diligently courted by Beijing as part of its global effort to finance infrastructure that advances its economic and diplomatic interests. Papua New Guinea with about 8 million people is by far the most populous, and with its extensive tropical forests and oil and gas reserves is an obvious target for economic exploitation.\n\nSix of the 16 Pacific states still have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, a sizeable bloc within the rapidly dwindling number of nations that recognize the island regarded as a renegade province by Beijing. Chinese aid and loans could flip those six into its camp. A military foothold in the region would be an important geostrategic boost for China, though its purported desire for a base has so far been thwarted.\n\nBeijing's assistance comes without the oversight and conditions that Western nations and organizations such as the World Bank or International Monetary Fund impose. It is promising $4 billion of finance to build the first national road network in Papua New Guinea, which could be transformative for the mountainous nation. But experts warn there could also be big costs later on: unsustainable debt, white elephant showpieces and social tensions from a growing Chinese diaspora.\n\n\"China's engagement in infrastructure in PNG shouldn't be discounted. It should be encouraged but it needs to be closely monitored by the PNG government to make sure it's effective over the long term,\" said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Sydney.\n\n\"The benefits of these projects, because a lot of them are financed by loans, only come from enhanced economic output over a long time to be able to justify paying back these loans,\" he said.\n\n\"The history of infrastructure investment in PNG shows that too often there is not enough maintenance going on,\" Pryke said. \"There's a build, neglect, rebuild paradigm in PNG as opposed to build and maintain which is far more efficient.\"\n\nSome high-profile Chinese projects in Papua New Guinea have already run into problems. A promised fish cannery hasn't materialized after several years and expansion of a port in Lae, the major commercial center, was botched and required significant rectification work. Two of the Chinese state companies working in the country, including the company responsible for the port expansion, were until recently blacklisted from World Bank-financed projects because of fraud or corruption.\n\nXi's newspaper column asserted China is the biggest foreign investor in Papua New Guinea, a statement more aspirational than actual. Its involvement is currently dwarfed by the investment of a single company- ExxonMobil's $19 billion natural gas extraction and processing facility.\n\nAustralia, the former colonial power in Papua New Guinea, remains its largest donor of conventional foreign aid. Its assistance, spread across the country and aimed at improving bare bones public services and the capacity of government, is less visible.\n\nBut its approach is shifting in response to China's moves.\n\nIn September, the Australian government announced it would pay for what is typically a commercial venture - a high-speed undersea cable linking Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands that promises to make the internet and telecommunications in the two island countries faster, more reliable and less expensive.\n\nEarlier this month, Australia announced more than $2 billion of funding for infrastructure and trade finance aimed at Pacific island nations and also agreed to joint development of a naval base in Papua New Guinea, heading off feared Chinese involvement. It is also boosting its diplomatic presence, opening more embassies to be represented in every Pacific island state.\n\n\"The APEC meeting is shaping up to be a faceoff between China and Australia for influence in the Pacific,\" said Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch.\n\nThat might seem a positive development for the region, but Pearson cautioned that competition for Papua New Guinea's vast natural resources has in the past had little positive impact on the lives of its people.\n\n\"Sadly exploitation of resources in PNG has fueled violent conflict, abuse and environmental devastation,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Jim Gomez contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Meghan Keneally", "title": "Why the link between veterans and mass shootings is more complicated than you think", "description": "Comes after the latest instance where a shooter was a veteran.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/link-veterans-mass-shootings-complicated/story?id=59057321", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/thousand-oaks-gty-er-181115_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:50:50Z", "content": "The murder of 12 people at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, earlier this month is the latest example of a veteran perpetrating a mass shooting, adding another complicated addition to a growing list of incidents of gun violence in the U.S. Some see the disc\u2026 [+5247 chars]", "fulltext": "The murder of 12 people at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, earlier this month is the latest example of a veteran perpetrating a mass shooting, adding another complicated addition to a growing list of incidents of gun violence in the U.S.\n\nSome see the discussion of veteran-involved shootings as promulgating of an inaccurate narrative that service members are prone to violence when they come home from war.\n\nThis is particularly sensitive after recent comments from President Trump that drew a connection between veterans, mental health issues, and violence.\n\n\u201cHe was a war veteran. He was a Marine. He was in the war. He served time. He saw some pretty bad things, and a lot of people say he had PTSD, and that\u2019s a tough deal,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 9, referring to alleged shooter Ian David Long, two days after the shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California. Long has been identified as a Marine Corps veteran, but it is unclear if Long was ever formally diagnosed with PTSD.\n\n\u201cPeople come back -- that\u2019s why it\u2019s a horrible thing -- they come back, they\u2019re never the same,\u201d Trump added.\n\nPaul Rieckhoff, the CEO and founder of the non-profit group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cextremely unhelpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey perpetuate a false and damaging narrative that veterans are broken and dangerous. Most people who suffer from PTSD, when able to access effective treatment, are able to live healthy, happy, meaningful lives,\u201d Rieckhoff said in a statement.\n\nBarbara Van Dahlen, the founder and president of the non-profit Give an Hour, which works to provide counseling help and other support to veterans, said that Trump\u2019s comments spoke to an incorrect stereotype.\n\n\u201cPeople who go through war absolutely come back changed. You won't find a veteran or a family member of a veteran [who] won\u2019t say that\u2019s not true,\u201d Van Dahlen said. \u201cBut what that means and how people take that to mean that... all of them are broken [or] more likely to go off, that is false,\u201d she said.\n\nThat said, the shooting in Thousand Oaks is the latest addition to a list of U.S. mass shootings involving a veteran.\n\nThree of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history were at the hands of veterans: the Sutherland Springs shooting in 2017 that left 26 people dead, the shooting at Luby\u2019s Cafeteria in California in 1991 where 23 people were killed, and the U.T.-Austin tower shooting during which a former U.S. marine sniper killed 14 people.\n\nEric Gay/AP, FILE\n\nThe military sometimes also factors into the location of these attacks, like in the case of the Washington Navy Yard shooting in 2012 in which a Navy veteran killed 12 people, or when an Army psychologist killed 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009.\n\nBut as the list of deadly shootings in America increases, so does the number and variety of shooters. The remaining seven of the 10 deadliest mass shooters didn\u2019t have any known military ties. Neither did other high-profile shooters, like the perpetrators of Columbine, or the man who shot 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October.\n\nVarious studies point to links between post-traumatic stress disorder and anger or aggression, a theme that percolates around veteran-involved shootings because of PTSD rates among veterans.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the levels of PTSD in veterans varies by their service area. Between 11 and 20 percent of veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, which largely focused on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan respectively, have PTSD in a given year.

But university and federal researchers estimate a healthy and abundant population of nearly 3,000 animals in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's northwest coast, according to a study published Wednesday in Scientific Reports.\n\n\"It the near-term, it's absolutely good news,\" said lead author Eric Regehr, who began the project more than a decade ago as a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist and last year joined the University of Washington's Polar Science Center.\n\nIn the longer term, it doesn't mean the Chukchi Sea bear population will not be affected.\n\n\"Polar bears need ice to hunt seals, and the ice is projected to decline until the underlying problem of climate change is addressed,\" Regehr said.\n\nThe study shows there is variation around the world in the effects of sea ice loss on polar bears, he said Thursday.\n\n\"Some subpopulations are already declining while others are still doing OK,\" he said.\n\nPolar bears are classified as marine mammals because they spend most of their lives on sea ice. Less sea ice means less productive time to hunt ice seals, more time on shore and longer, energy-sapping swims.\n\nThe world's polar bears are divided into 19 subpopulations, including two in U.S. waters. Besides Chukchi bears, the United States shares the southern Beaufort Sea population with Canada.\n\nStress in southern Beaufort bears from a loss of sea ice was partly why the United States in 2008 declared polar bears a threatened species.\n\nFewer cubs were surviving into their second year and adult males weighed less and had smaller skulls, the U.S. Geological Survey found. Researcher Steven Amstrup at the time said the trends were consistent with changes in nutritional status likely associated with declines in sea ice.\n\nA more recent study by USGS researcher Karyn Rode found that Chukchi bears spend more time on shore and have almost 30 fewer days to hunt seals on ice than 20 years ago, Regehr said. However, that doesn't appear to have affected the population, he said.\n\nPolar bears have an amazing ability to build fat reserves, Regehr said, and the Chukchi's abundant seal population apparently allows bears to compensate for the loss of hunting time. The difference with the southern Beaufort was obvious from an airplane, he said.\n\n\"It's visually striking to me, the difference, having worked in both places,\" Regehr said.\n\nWhen ice melts, many Chukchi bears rest on Russia's Wrangell Island, where they occasionally can find a whale or walrus carcass.\n\nThe Chukchi population study used data collected by sampling about 60 polar bears between 2008 and 2016. Some were fitted with GPS transmitters. The data was used in a model designed to estimate population size for highly mobile large carnivores.\n\nBlaine Griffen, an associate professor of biology at Brigham Young University, said the study was good news.\n\n\"It's nice to see that there's at least one population that's doing better than others,\" he said.\n\nThe difference may be geography, he said. The Chukchi Sea has a more extensive continental shelf area with primary productivity that enables the food chain to support seals.\n\nThe research agrees with past studies that suggested Chukchi bears would do better than bears elsewhere, Griffen said."}]
