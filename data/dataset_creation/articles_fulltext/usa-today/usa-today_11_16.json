(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Iowa learned a lot last season. The Hawkeyes are putting those lessons to good use right now.\n\nTyler Cook scored 26 points, Luka Garza had 22 and Iowa beat Connecticut 91-72 in the 2K Classic championship game on Friday night.\n\nThe Hawkeyes went 14-19 last season, losing to Michigan in the Big Ten tournament. But they shot 51 percent (29 for 57) from the field while improving to 4-0 this year.\n\nCook said the biggest difference is the team is more together for this campaign.\n\n\"We're more connected on both ends of the floor,\" he said. \"And we're playing for one another and our coaching staff and our program with more pride than we did a year ago.\"\n\nGarza was named MVP of the tournament. He also joined Cook, UConn's Eric Cobb, Oregon's Bol Bol and Syracuse's Jalen Carey on the all-tournament team.\n\nBol led No. 13 Oregon to an 80-65 victory over No. 15 Syracuse in the consolation game. He finished with 26 points and nine rebounds on his 19th birthday.\n\nPayton Pritchard had 18 points for the Ducks (3-1), and Kenny Wooten scored 12 in the first-ever meeting between the ACC and Pac-12 programs.\n\n\"We competed,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said.\n\nSyracuse (2-2) lost on consecutive nights, also falling 83-76 to UConn on Thursday night. The Orange shot 35 percent (18 for 51) from the field.\n\nTyus Battle scored 17 points for Syracuse, and Elijah Hughes and Jalen Carey each had 14.\n\n\"We tried things but none of them seemed to work very well,\" coach Jim Boeheim said. \"We tried different sets, different movements, different perimeter things, subbing people out, setting ball screens and all of those things (but) sometimes if the ball doesn't go in, none of that works.\"\n\nIowa improved to 3-1 all-time against UConn. It was the first meeting between the schools since Iowa's 70-68 win on Nov. 11, 1999, also at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"It's an honor \u2014 I think I speak for all of us \u2014 to be able to come and play in such a historical arena, such a historical city, so much basketball history,\" Cook said. \"The fact that we were able to come into this environment and play against two really good teams and come out with two really good victories I think it speaks to our growth as a unit.\"\n\nJalen Adams led the Huskies (3-1) with 20 points. Cobb finished with 16.\n\nUConn coach Danny Hurley was ejected with 1:44 left. He received his first technical foul earlier in the half.\n\n\"I did not like the job I did getting my team ready for today,\" Hurley said.\n\nUConn trimmed Iowa's lead to 33-22 on Adams' layup with 4:15 left in the first half. But Iowa responded with a 10-5 spurt for a 43-27 halftime lead.\n\n\"We took our pain that came with last year and used it as motivation this summer to come out here and be a better team,\" Garza said. \"We did a good job at that on every aspect. Just really proud of our guys. Everybody who came here stepped up.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court agreed Friday to weigh in on the dispute over the Trump administration's plan to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census.\n\nThe issue that will come before the justices in February is what evidence can be considered in a challenge mounted by state and local governments and immigrant rights groups. They want to expose the decision-making process, while the administration has argued that's irrelevant.\n\nThe court's decisions on the matter could affect the political and financial clout of immigrant communities for the next decade. What's at stake is an accurate count of immigrants in the Census, including non-citizens. Challengers fear a citizenship question could prompt many to avoid being counted.\n\nThat, in turn, could cause parts of the country with large percentages of immigrants \u2013 mostly in states dominated by Democrats \u2013 to be undercounted. That could result in a loss of federal funds and, potentially, seats in Congress.\n\nThe overall battle is not what will come before the Supreme Court at oral argument Feb. 19. Instead, the justices only agreed to hear the dispute over what evidence can be considered.\n\nThe justices already had refused the Trump administration's request to delay an ongoing federal court trial in New York over the Commerce Department plan. The high court's decision to take on the dispute could delay a ruling in that case.\n\nThe court had given both sides a partial victory earlier, when it said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross did not have to give a deposition concerning his decision-making process before the trial, but other federal officials could be questioned out of court.\n\nRoss announced the addition of the citizenship question in March, but it has been tied up in court ever since. The government has not asked about individuals' citizenship on the Census since 1950.\n\nOpponents, including California, New York, the American Civil Liberties Union and immigration rights groups, contend fears of deportation among undocumented immigrants will cause them to be undercounted.\n\nThat could have two detrimental effects in immigrant communities. Areas with large immigrant populations, which tend to be urban and vote Democratic, could lose seats in the House of Representatives. They also could lose federal, state and local funds used for public works and social service projects.\n\nRoss initially said the Justice Department wanted to reinstate the citizenship question as a means of enforcing the Voting Rights Act. It was later revealed that he made the decision himself and asked Justice Department officials to back him up, despite their reluctance.\n\nThe government recently acknowledged in court papers \"for the sake of completeness\" that Ross discussed the plan with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a leading proponent of crackdowns on alleged voter fraud.\n\nMore: Supreme Court still divided along ideological lines on illegal immigration\n\nMore: President Trump says he plans to end birthright citizenship with an executive order\n\nMore: ACLU goes to court to challenge Trump\u2019s new asylum ban\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/census-2020-supreme-court-hear-case-adding-citizenship-question/2026725002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Edward C.

USA TODAY\n\nMartin County Supervisor of Elections Vicki David (right) and Chief Deputy Debbie Dent confer during manual recount of U.S. Senate results on Nov. 16, 2018. (Photo: GEORGE ANDREASSI/TCPALM)\n\nAs Florida's statewide hand recount rumbles on, Sen. Bill Nelson's chances of winning re-election are growing increasingly dim.\n\nA couple of court losses late Thursday and \u2013 perhaps most damaging \u2013 Friday's hand recount in Democrat stronghold Broward County that did not appear to give Nelson the lift he needed.\n\nThen came word late Friday afternoon that the vast majority of the ballots in the hand recount across the state are unlikely to help Nelson because voters chose to skip the Senate race altogether. That recount was considered a linchpin of Nelson's already uphill strategy to victory.\n\nMost experts say Nelson now needs a miracle to erase Republican challenger Rick Scott's 12,603-vote lead, formalized after Thursday's machine recount ended. A hand recount of disputed ballots that were set aside because the machines had trouble counting them is now being conducted.\n\n\"He can pull this off but everything has to go his way,\" said Charles Zelden, a political science professor and election recount expert at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. \"And any one small glitch can be enough to keep him from winning.\"\n\nAt this point, Nelson has until Sunday at noon to pull off his long-shot bid. Barring a court ruling, that's the deadline for canvassing boards at each of Florida's 67 counties to report their final recount tallies to the state.\n\nMarc Elias, Nelson's lead recount attorney, admitted to reporters late Thursday that a lot of factors have to break the senator's way for victory. But he also was confident they would, given that Scott's initial lead on the night of Election Day shrank from about 60,000 votes (out of nearly 8.2 million cast) to fewer than 13,000.\n\n\"It's never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in the race,\" Elias said. \"If you look at each stage where the margin has shrunk, it has not shrunk because of one big thing, but rather it has shrunk from a number of smaller things. As we move forward I continue to expect that (12,603) margin to go down and disappear entirely.\"\n\nHere's a look at some of the obstacles facing Nelson:\n\nThe hand recount is not going his way\n\nThere are about 65,000 questionable ballots statewide to examine in the hand recount, according to the Florida Secretary of State's office. Nelson would have to win about 60 percent of those votes to take the lead.\n\nThe recount is examining ballots with \"overvotes\" (where the machine did not tabulate it because both candidates were chosen) and \"undervotes\" (where the machine did not tabulate it because no one was chosen).\n\nA human review of an overvote ballot could show if the voter intended to pick one candidate over the other. The belief was that could help Nelson because the county overwhelmingly voted for him against Scott, who is Florida's governor, and those disputed ballots would break the same way.\n\nCLOSE Florida's battle for the U.S. Senate is headed to a legally required hand recount (Nov. 15) AP\n\nThe recount in Broward was finished after just two hours Friday. Election officials didn't immediately release results, but the speed with which the recount was conducted suggests most of the ballots were undercounts. That doesn't help Nelson because those are votes that won't be counted.\n\nIn fact, the news got even worse for Nelson. Of the roughly 65,000 votes being reviewed, 62,257 \u2013 or about 95 percent \u2013 were undervotes. With fewer than 3,000 votes up for grabs, Nelson will have to find \"silver bullets\" in other places to scrounge up the difference.\n\nCourts offer little remedy\n\nNelson will need the courts to side with him in his effort to give counties more ballots to count and more time to tabulate them.\n\nThe senator gained one court victory earlier this week when U.S. Chief Judge Mark Walker ordered Secretary of State Ken Detzner to give voters whose ballots were tossed because their signatures didn\u2019t match what was on file until 5 p.m. Saturday to \"cure\" their ballots. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Nelson after a GOP appeal.\n\nBut the judge denied a request by Nelson to extend Thursday's 3 p.m. machine recount deadline. Palm Beach County was unable to finish in time. So now Nelson is seeking a hand recount of each of the nearly 585,000 ballots in the county \u2013 a process that likely would take weeks.\n\nWalker also denied a request to give election monitors more flexibility in divining voter intent during the hand recount. And he threw out a motion by the Florida League of Women Voters to have Scott recuse himself from the recount process and step down as governor.\n\nElection workers place ballots into electronic counting machines at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Florida. (Photo: Joe Cavaretta, AP)\n\nStill pending was Walker's motion on a lawsuit from VoteVets demanding that domestic vote-by-mail ballots, which must be received by the day of the election, be treated the same as overseas ballots, which can be received as late as 10 days after the election.\n\n\u201cCitizens in the U.S. should be given the same opportunity as expatriates living abroad,\u201d Elias said.\n\nTime running out\n\nNelson has less than a week to pull off a win. Or at least buy more time.\n\nCounties have until noon Sunday to finish their hand recounts on the Senate race. Then on Tuesday, the state Elections Canvassing Commission, consisting of the governor (who has recused himself) and two cabinet members, meets to certify the Nov. 6 election official returns.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Nov. 30 deadline for any candidate, voter or taxpayer to contest election results in circuit court.\n\nZelden, the election expert, likened Nelson's chances to a player in a card game betting all his chips on a specific card being pulled from the deck.\n\n\"He's literally depending on it to be the queen of hearts,\" Zelden said. \"Anything else, he loses. Sometimes it shows up, but the odds are pretty good it's not going to.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/florida-recount-bill-nelsons-chances-beating-rick-scott-slim/2027236002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Nick Schwartz", "title": "College football Week 12 guide: TV schedule, point spreads for every Top 25 game", "description": "Betting lines for every Top 25 NCAA Week 12 game NFL game on Saturday.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/gallery/college-football-week-12-guide-tv-schedule-point-spreads-for-every-top-25-game", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/cov10-e1542410632324.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:33:49Z", "content": "All betting lines via William Hill unless otherwise stated.

If we do win, it\u2019ll be because of the fact that we\u2019ve had fast race cars all year. I look at the experience of our race team; we\u2019ve been together for five years now, and we all work for a great organization that gives us all the resources and things that we need to compete. In the end, you can\u2019t drive a slow car fast and it takes great people to build a fast car.\u201d\n\nKyle Busch, No. 18 Toyota\n\n2018 wins: 8, T-1st\n\nBest Homestead finish: 1st, 2015\n\nAverage Homestead finish: 18.5 in 13 starts\n\nQualified for Championship 4: Win at ISM Raceway\n\n\u201cI think everybody does have their pros and have their cons. For us, I just look at it as though we\u2019ve been really fast here as a group every single year we\u2019ve been down here. First and foremost, you have to have a fast race car. Last year, we were the fastest car. Fastest cars don\u2019t always win the race. You\u2019ve got to have other things go your way. It\u2019s much easier and your job is a lot more calculated if you have that fast car.\u201d\n\nMartin Truex Jr., No. 78 Toyota\n\n2018 wins: 4, T-3rd\n\nBest Homestead finish: 1st, 2017\n\nAverage Homestead finish: 11.5 in 13 starts\n\nQualified for Championship 4: Based on points\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m gonna (win). We\u2019re gonna try as hard as we can to win it for our team because this is our last race together (before the team shuts down). And yeah, my owner, Barney Visser, has given us all, and for me, an unbelievable five years driving for him and an opportunity to win a lot of races and become a champion. \u2026\n\n\u201cJust that brotherly bond of building that car and sending it off to the race track is like sending your kid off to college every week. And it was hard this week.

(AP) \u2014 The Oakland Raiders practiced at an off-site facility for a second consecutive day Friday as thick smoke from California's deadly wildfires blanketed the Bay Area.\n\nMuch like they did a year ago when similar conditions arose due to fires in Northern California, players and coaches were bused to an indoor gym at the former Alameda Naval Air Station for practices Thursday and Friday.\n\nAlthough the Raiders were forced to scale back their workouts as a result, coach Jon Gruden was mostly pleased with how things went under the circumstances.\n\n\"It's like an indoor ice rink that was transformed into a soccer field,\" Gruden said. \"We didn't have much room to get the splits and get the routes but I'm not going to make any excuses. We're not the only people dealing with adversity right now. It was either that or get nothing so I'm really pleased with the players, the coaches and the preparation that we were able to get in.\"\n\nSmoke has filled the sky in Northern California for more than a week and the air quality has been at dangerously unhealthy levels in recent days.\n\nThe Raiders will get a break from the conditions with road games each of the next two weeks. They play Sunday in Arizona and are in Baltimore to face the Ravens on Nov. 25.\n\n\"We have to deal with what we have to deal with,\" Gruden said. \"We got a lot of reps in. We are confident that they know what to do. We just have to trust that they'll go out there and perform at the highest level possible.\"\n\nThe Raiders have lost five straight games and are 1-8 overall. Offensive coordinator Greg Olson said that the fires have helped keep things in perspective.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to all the people who lost lives and property, and certainly to all the first responders.\" Olson said. \"For us, yeah, we are missing a practice. We are missing the ability to go outside, but for other people it's changing their lives or has changed their lives. Nobody here on this team has lost lives or property, so we are fortunate in that regard.\"\n\nRight guard Gabe Jackson has tried to remain indoors as much as possible to avoid the smoke-filled air.\n\n\"From being here to going home I haven't spent much time outside,\" Jackson said. \"You're always concerned about what's going on around you, especially the people that's affected, but at the same time you have to do what you have to do.\"\n\nNotes: Wide receivers Jordy Nelson (knee) and Martavis Bryant (knee) did not practice and are out for Sunday's game. . Cornerback Gareon Conley (groin) is questionable.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLs\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Apple says its one-third of the way into remodeling or making over its 100 flagship stores, and using a new store design for new locations.\n\nWhile the idea is to bring in customers and get them hooked on Apple products, Angela Ahrendts, the company\u2019s senior vice-president of retail, says she wants the stores to act as \u201cgathering spaces, where people can come in, get service and support and learn about everything they would do on their devices.\u201d\n\nThe new re-designed Apple Store in Santa Monica part of the 100 flagship Apple Stores getting a major makeover. The store is now focused on four areas--the Forum, Avenues and Grove, where the Genius support staff and Today at Apple instructors congregate. (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nAnd how does that help the bottom line?\n\n\u201cWhen you do the right thing, naturally, then you get the right outcome,\u201d she says.\n\nGene Munster, an analyst and investor with Loup Ventures, calls the Apple Stores the company\u2019s most \u201cunder-appreciated competitive advantage,\u201d over rivals.\n\n\u201cNo other tech company has Apple's base of 65,000 retail employees delivering face-to-face advice, support, and experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cMicrosoft comes in second with about 6,000 retail employees.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft also has a retail store to show off its products, with just under 100 locations.\n\nClearly, the approach is paying off for Apple, which raised prices on nearly every product line in 2018, bringing the top of the line iPhone to a starting price of $1,100 ($100 more than last year) and, for the first time, selling an iPad that starts at $1,000.\n\nApple competes with many companies, mostly notably at retail with device makers like Samsung and Google, who make rival smartphones.\n\n\"Apple is able to sell through discovery,\" says Munster. \"This is how to sell technology today, offering something more than just a place to look and buy, but instead an experience.\"\n\nApple hasn\u2019t specified how much it\u2019s spending on the upgrades. The store concept began in 2001 at a time when Microsoft dominated computer usage, and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said retail did a poor job of showing his products.\n\nToday, there are over 500 Apple Stores globally. Besides the remodeled Santa Monica location, Apple also opened a new store on the historic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es this weekend as well.\n\nAhrendts says the older stores really needed to be updated, as Apple has so many more product lines now. (Originally, it was just computers and iPods.)\n\nThe flagship stores are broken into three areas:\n\n\u2014Avenues: This is where Apple devotes product selection to themed areas, like photography and health, and where customers can go hands-on time with them.\n\n\u2014The Grove: Trees are imported and are a visual to bring customers to the newly renamed \u201cGenius Grove,\u201d where more product specialists will be available to help with support, Apple says. Customers still need to make reservations via the Apple Store smartphone app, although walk-ins can try their luck, usually right when the store opens.\n\n\u2014The Forum: This is where Apple stages its daily, free \u201cToday at Apple\u201d seminars, devoted to photography, art, computer coding and the like. The list of classes is available on the Apple Store app. Customers can't miss it--the Forum is flanked by a giant video screen at the back of the store.\n\nRows of iPhones in the remodeled Apple Store in Santa Monica (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/16/apple-store-gets-major-remodel/2028536002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Bengals hold out hope WR Green could play vs Ravens", "description": "The Bengals are leaving a slight possibility that receiver A.J.

Between the talent of the drivers and the speed their teams have demonstrated this season and in the first nine playoff races, the final four championship contenders agreed they\u2019ll probably have to win the race to win it all.\n\nFor Harvick, Busch and Truex, a victory would be their second Cup Series title, while Logano is still searching for his first. Harvick and Busch won in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and Truex is trying to defend his 2017 championship.\n\nSo ahead of the Cup Series finale, the Ford EcoBoost 400, For The Win asked each of them why they will win on Sunday, and here\u2019s what they said.\n\nKevin Harvick, No. 4 Ford\n\n2018 wins: 8, T-1st\n\nBest Homestead finish: 1st, 2014\n\nAverage Homestead finish: 6.8 in 17 starts\n\nQualified for Championship 4: Based on points (after Texas Motor Speedway win was penalized)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you that I\u2019m going to win. If we do win, it\u2019ll be because of the fact that we\u2019ve had fast race cars all year. I look at the experience of our race team; we\u2019ve been together for five years now, and we all work for a great organization that gives us all the resources and things that we need to compete. In the end, you can\u2019t drive a slow car fast and it takes great people to build a fast car.\u201d\n\nKyle Busch, No. 18 Toyota\n\n2018 wins: 8, T-1st\n\nBest Homestead finish: 1st, 2015\n\nAverage Homestead finish: 18.5 in 13 starts\n\nQualified for Championship 4: Win at ISM Raceway\n\n\u201cI think everybody does have their pros and have their cons. For us, I just look at it as though we\u2019ve been really fast here as a group every single year we\u2019ve been down here. First and foremost, you have to have a fast race car. Last year, we were the fastest car. Fastest cars don\u2019t always win the race. You\u2019ve got to have other things go your way. It\u2019s much easier and your job is a lot more calculated if you have that fast car.\u201d\n\nMartin Truex Jr., No. 78 Toyota\n\n2018 wins: 4, T-3rd\n\nBest Homestead finish: 1st, 2017\n\nAverage Homestead finish: 11.5 in 13 starts\n\nQualified for Championship 4: Based on points\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m gonna (win). We\u2019re gonna try as hard as we can to win it for our team because this is our last race together (before the team shuts down). And yeah, my owner, Barney Visser, has given us all, and for me, an unbelievable five years driving for him and an opportunity to win a lot of races and become a champion. \u2026\n\n\u201cJust that brotherly bond of building that car and sending it off to the race track is like sending your kid off to college every week. And it was hard this week. So I think for all the guys and me, no matter what happens Sunday, we\u2019re going to enjoy it, we\u2019re going to celebrate afterwards, but we damn sure hope it\u2019s on the stage with a big trophy.\u201d\n\nJoey Logano, No. 22 Ford\n\n2018 wins: 2, T-6th\n\nBest Homestead finish: 4th, 2015 and 2016\n\nAverage Homestead finish: 14.9 in 9 starts\n\nQualified for Championship 4: Win at Martinsville Speedway\n\n\u201cFor us, I feel like as a race team, we\u2019re pretty strong right now. Our cars have been good, our pit crews have been spectacular, driver\u2019s been doing his part, and I think we\u2019re in a good spot to make this happen. We\u2019ve had a few weeks to think about this race and only this race, and that\u2019s a great advantage to have.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Patrick Ryan, USA TODAY", "title": "Susan Boyle returns with other fan favorites for 'America's Got Talent: The Champions'", "description": "British singer Susan Boyle, who became an Internet phenomenon with her cover of \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" will compete once again on \"America's Got Talent: The Champions.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/16/susan-boyle-returns-americas-got-talent-champions-cast/2029739002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d35d4b354cbc0c2cd22f232a52a56d86aea94bb8/c=0-185-3000-1873/local/-/media/USATODAY/usatsports/2014/12/01/susan_boyle_singing.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:54:01Z", "content": "Susan Boyle, who shot to fame after her memorable appearance on \"Britain's Got Talent\" in 2009, when she placed as a runner-up.

A victory against Arizona State this weekend in Eugene would assure that Oregon finishes above .500. (AP Photo/Chris Pietsch, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nArizona State heads to Oregon this weekend needing a win to stay alive in the Pac-12 South.\n\nIf the Sun Devils (6-4, 4-3 Pac-12) can take care of the Ducks, then win at rival Arizona in the regular-season finale, the team will go to the league championship game. Or, they could seal a trip a week early if they win at Oregon, combined with a Utah loss at Colorado and an Arizona loss at Washington State.\n\nBasically, there are still a lot of moving parts to the South race. What is for sure is that the Sun Devils have those coveted six wins.\n\n\"It is fun to say that you are bowl-eligible,\" Arizona State coach Herm Edwards said. \"It is like getting in the playoffs for the NFL. We always say that it is a race to 10 in the NFL. If you can get to 10, things start looking really good. You will probably make it into the playoffs and if you win a few more, you can maybe win your division. In college, if you win six, you are eligible for a bowl and if you win more, then bigger bowls appear. Our players are well aware of that. It is a good thing.\"\n\nThe Sun Devils are coming off a 31-28 victory over UCLA for their third straight win. It gave them bowl eligibility.\n\nThe Ducks (6-4, 3-4) are also bowl-eligible but have stumbled with three losses in their last four games. Saturday's game will be Oregon's last at home this season before the Civil War against Oregon State on Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nA victory against the Sun Devils would assure that Oregon finishes above .500.\n\nCoach Mario Cristobal went into his new job this season knowing there would be ups and downs.\n\n\"When we don't win of course we're going to be disappointed. We're big on the whole Bill Parcells thing: There are no medals for trying. We've highlighted to our team, when you are working hard and you are rebuilding a culture, the painful steps that come with it,\" he said.\n\nThe Ducks are coming off a 32-25 loss at Utah last Saturday.\n\nROBERTSON'S ABSENCE: The Sun Devils will be without freshman linebacker Merlin Robertson for the first half against Oregon after he was flagged for targeting UCLA quarterback Wilton Speight in the third quarter of last weekend's game.\n\nRobertson has 66 tackles, five sacks, an interception and a recovered fumble this season.\n\n\"He is standing with me with a baseball hat,\" Edwards said. \"Let him get a couple of plays called and then as soon as he can go in, I'm going to shove him in there real fast.\"\n\nTHE WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART: The game in Eugene comes at 7:30 p.m. local time, after three straight daytime starts for the Sun Devils. Then there's the temperature: The low on Saturday night at gametime is expected to be 43 degrees.\n\n\"I have played in some really cold, cold games and they don't cancel them, you just play. When you start talking about all that stuff, it's just why? You are going to play so why worry about it?\" Edwards said.\n\nIT ALL STARTS AT THE LINE: The Sun Devils have running back Eno Benjamin, who leads the Pac-12 with an average of 129.5 yards a game. Cristobal said part of what makes ASU's rush tough to defend is a stout offensive line.\n\n\"Those guys have done a great job opening up holes for Benjamin and all their backs and giving the quarterback time to throw the ball. Formationally, they do a lot of things, they do unbalanced stuff, they do the tackle over stuff, they do some things that present schematic issues if you're not ready for them,\" Cristobal said.\n\nRECEIVERS ON DISPLAY: The game will feature two of the top receivers in the league: Oregon's Dillon Mitchell and Arizona State's N'Keal Harry. Mitchell is ranked 10th nationally with an average of 100.2 receiving yards a game. He set an Oregon record with five 100-plus-yard receiving games this season. Harry is averaging 92.8 yards receiving a game, ranked 17th nationally. He's got 22 career touchdown receptions to rank fifth on ASU's all-time list. He's had at least one catch in all 35 games with the Sun Devils.\n\nSURE, THEY'RE CUTE: \"One of my daughters is excited about going up there because she likes the mascot. She likes the duck. I told her, 'You are not pulling for the duck are you?' She said, 'No daddy, I don't pull for the duck but I like the duck.' What do you tell a 12-year-old?\" Edwards said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Second-year player Matt Feiler will fill in for Gilbert as he has the past three weeks, while nine-year veteran Tyson Alualu is set to replace Tuitt.\n\n\"I think you just always have to be ready and be prepared when you do get opportunities to play more,\" Alualu said. \"You just have to make sure there's no drop-off when someone goes out, especially with it being Tuitt because we all know what he's capable of and what he's done.\"\n\nGilbert has only played 13 of the team's last 25 games after missing just three games the previous two seasons.\n\nIt will be Feiler's fifth start of the season and sixth of his career. He has already started four games this season. The first came in Week 3 against Tampa Bay, the Steelers' first win of the season, when Gilbert sat with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"I'm just trying to stay ready because you never know when they're going to need me,\" Feiler said. \"I've just been preparing like I have been every week like I'm going to be playing.\"\n\nThe Steelers have won all four times Feiler has started at right tackle, including the last three games. Those wins were part of a five-game winning streak that has helped the Steelers climb atop the AFC North after a 1-2-1 start.\n\nThe Steelers have averaged 424 yards of total offense the previous three weeks, including 140 on the ground. James Conner, third in the league with 771 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, has rushed for more than 100 yards in two of the last three weeks. Conner will play Sunday after leaving last week's win against Carolina with a concussion.\n\n\"Every lineman wants to run-block and kind of push other guys around,\" Feiler said. \"We've been clicking. We've been staying on the field longer and keeping our momentum. It's a lot of fun.\"\n\nAlualu will get the start against Jacksonville, a city where he spent his first seven seasons before signing with the Steelers.\n\nThe Jaguars shocked the Steelers on the road, 30-9, last season and did it again in the playoffs, winning 45-42 in Pittsburgh before falling to New England in the AFC Championship game.\n\nLeonard Fournette rushed for 290 yards and five touchdowns in those two games against the Steelers. He missed six games because of injury this season before returning last week during a loss at Indianapolis. The Jaguars have lost five of those six and are 3-6, last in the AFC South.\n\n\"Their record doesn't show how hard they're playing,\" said Alualu, who has exchanged texts with former teammates. \"The guys in the locker room are still fighting.

(AP) \u2014 Charles Howell III is playing some of his best golf when he least expected it.\n\nComing from a missed cut in Mexico to a tournament where he missed the cut last year, Howell kept bogeys off his card for the second straight day and was just as good Friday on the tougher scoring course at Sea Island.\n\nHe had a 6-under 64 on the Seaside course and matched the best 36-hole score of his career to build a three-shot lead in the RSM Classic.\n\n\"You just never know what's around the corner in this game,\" Howell said. \"I thought I played pretty good in Mexico and just missed the cut there. Came here, I like it here, I didn't really know what to expect and then this happens. So it's a crazy game and we're reminded of it daily. This is another reminder.\"\n\nHowell was at 14-under 128, his best two-day total on the PGA Tour since the Las Vegas Invitational in 2003, when it was a 90-hole event.\n\nHe was three shots ahead of PGA Tour rookie Cameron Champ and Jason Gore, who only recently was certified as an insurance salesman and found out just five days ago there was room for him at Sea Island.\n\nGore was headed to Pebble Beach for an mixed invitational event until getting word that he was in the RSM Classic. This is his first tournament in three months, though he has kept busy playing golf with clients in his new insurance venture with his wife.\n\nHe looked plenty sharp in sunshine that warmed the Georgia coastline ever so slightly. Gore birdied his last four holes for a 63.\n\n\"I haven't played a weekend in so long, I don't know what to do,\" Gore said. \"I've got nothing to lose. This is fun for me. I'm an insurance salesman now. I've got a real job now and all that good stuff. Just glad my boss would let me off to play.\"\n\nHis boss is his wife, Meghan, who presumably does most of the work. Gore plays a lot of golf with clients, and it restored some of the fun in the game that beat him up over the years.\n\nChamp also birdied his last four holes and goes into another week in the mix on the PGA Tour. He already has one victory, the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi in his second start as a tour member, and was in range in Las Vegas and Mexico.\n\nPlaying with tournament host Davis Love III, his birdie run began with a tricky lie in thin sand to the left of the green about 90 feet from the hole on the par-5 15th. He blasted that out to 10 feet and made the putt, hit a wedge to 8 feet on the next hole, a 6-iron to 5 feet into the stiff breeze on the par-3 17th and closed out his big run with a 10-foot birdie putt for a 63.\n\n\"I decided to just get in the fairway, just give myself looks on the greens, and that's been paying off so far,\" Champ said. \"On top of that, I've been making the putts.\"\n\nNick Watney shot an 8-under 64 on the Plantation and was five shots behind.\n\nThe final two rounds will be at Seaside.\n\nHowell can't think of a better two days striking the ball, evidenced by missing only two fairways and two greens over 36 holes, both of those on Friday at Seaside. He thought he played better than his opening 64, mainly because Seaside features so many holes with a cross wind.\n\nHe also picked up most of his shots on the inward nine at Seaside, which was the early part of his round because he started on No. 10. The 14th hole along with water causes the most consternation because the wind is strongest along the water, blowing into him and to the right. With the tees slightly forward because of the wind, he hit driver and 9-iron to 15 feet, and then birdied three of the next four holes.\n\nHowell has two PGA Tour victories in nearly 20 years, and yet the weekend feels like a new experience to him. This is only the fifth time he's had the 36-hole lead, and the first time since the 2003 Tour Championship.\n\n\"I've almost done everything in my career, but playing with a lead isn't one thing I've really done a whole lot,\" Howell said. \"I could talk to you about finishing second or third a lot. As many golf tournaments as I've played, this is still relatively new for me, which is kind of surprising at almost 40 years old.\"\n\nHowell says one problem he has battled is thinking too far ahead and trying too hard. The golf courses, especially Seaside because of the cold and wind, have kept him from thinking too much about anything except the shot in front of him. For two rounds, it has worked beautifully.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) \u2014 For the Seattle Seahawks to have a say in the NFC playoff picture, they had to get past Green Bay. A loss would have likely proved too much to overcome with games remaining against Carolina, Minnesota and Kansas City.\n\nSo Pete Carroll celebrated Thursday's win in the way everyone would have expected. He rode Seattle's waterfront Ferris wheel.\n\n\"It's a wonderful ride. Everyone should do it,\" Carroll said Friday.\n\nThe Seahawks' 27-24 win over Green Bay snapped a two-game losing streak and created a path to where the postseason is now at least a realistic opportunity for Seattle. There are still challenges ahead, but Seattle is now in the conversation.\n\n\"To be in it right now, we're not where we want to be record-wise, but we're fighting,\" said tight end Ed Dickson, who caught the winning touchdown pass from Russell Wilson with 5:08 remaining.\n\nSeattle's path to the postseason is relatively straightforward because of the way its schedule is structured. Five of the Seahawks' final six games are against NFC teams. Three of those are against San Francisco, twice, and Arizona, who have combined records of 4-15 going into this week. The other two NFC opponents are Carolina next week and Minnesota in Week 14, the two teams directly in front of the Seahawks in the wild-card race.\n\nSo while Seattle doesn't have complete control of its playoff fortunes, it will have a say in whether it can stay in the race into the final weeks of the regular season. And it's why knocking off the Packers was so crucial.\n\n\"Doug (Baldwin) and I were talking about going back to 2015. We were 4-5, I think it was, and we got on a hot streak,\" Wilson said. \"This is one game, we have a lot of games to go. We have a tough game ahead of us. Just a reminder of where we've been and where we've gone and how we've done it before.\"\n\nThat run Wilson referenced from 2015 was based largely on a passing offense that erupted in the final two months of the season. Seattle won six of its final seven games that season, scoring 29 or more points in each victory with Wilson throwing 24 touchdown passes and one interception during the seven-game span.\n\nA passing explosion like that isn't likely to happen this time. But something could happen on the ground as Seattle continued to show it can run the ball with any of its three running backs.\n\nThe Seahawks rushed for 173 yards against the Packers, their eighth straight game running for at least 100 yards as a team and the seventh straight game topping 150 yards. Last week against the Rams, Seattle used a healthy dose of Wilson's legs when he rushed for a season-high 92 yards to complement the first 100-yard game of Rashaad Penny's rookie season.\n\nAgainst the Packers, it was a combo of Penny, Chris Carson and Mike Davis as the closer. Carson had 83 yards on 17 carries; Penny had 46 yards, including a highlight 30-yard run in the first half; and Davis had just one carry until Seattle's final drive when he had three carries for 16 yards as Seattle picked up two first downs to close out the game.\n\n\"It might frustrate some people like we can't make up our mind but I feel really comfortable with how we're doing this,\" Carroll said. \"Some games it will go in a different direction like we've seen, but it's great to have that kind of flexibility. They all have characteristics and attributes that help us.\"\n\nNOTES: Carroll was unclear about the status of LB K.J. Wright and his lingering knee problems. Wright couldn't finish last week's game against the Rams due to issues stemming from surgery he had in August. He was inactive Thursday. \"We're trying to get his knee confident to where he can get back and stay back. We're going to take our time, whatever time it takes to check that out,\" Carroll said. ... LB Mychal Kendricks will be able to rejoin the team in practice next week, but won't be eligible to play until Week 14 against Minnesota. Kendricks was originally suspended indefinitely after pleading guilty to federal insider trading chargers, but had the suspension reduced to eight games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Everything from soccer is playing into my success as a kicker.\"\n\nWhittingham said settling for a half dozen field goals isn't usually the recipe for success.\n\n\"He was really the difference in the game,\" Whittingham said. \"It's usually a case where a bunch of field goals won't win it for you, but in this case it was the exception.\"\n\nSHENAULT BACK: The Buffs are hoping for more impact from star sophomore Laviska Shenault Jr., who was the nation's leading receiver before being sidelined for a month by a right turf toe injury. He returned last week and had 10 catches for 102 yards plus an 18-yard run. But he was unable to add to the 11 TDs he'd scored in his first 5\u00bd games.\n\nBUDDING RIVALRY: Although the Pac-12 pits the Utes and Buffs against each other in rivalry week, this series hasn't organically risen to that level quite yet. Utah is 5-2 since the series was renewed after a 49-year dormancy when both schools joined the Pac-12 in 2011.\n\n\"Rivalry, it's starting to feel a little bit that way, but I think we've got that same feel with USC,\" Whittingham said. \"That's something that has to play out and evolve, you can't force-feed that or make that happen. ... I don't think it is a full-on, full-fledged rivalry at this point.\"\n\nGOING BOWLING: While the Buffs are seeking bowl eligibility for just the second time in 11 seasons, the Utes are bowl-eligible for the 13th time under Whittingham, whose 11-1 record in bowl games represents the highest (92) winning percentage in NCAA history.\n\nTROPHY TIME: The Utes can win their first Pac-12 South title by beating Colorado and with Arizona State losing either to Oregon or Arizona in the next weeks. If Utah and Arizona tie for the title, the Utes own the tiebreaker.\n\n\"We were calling it earlier in the season,\" Utes linebacker Cody Barton said. \"This is our year to win the south. Our hopes and dreams are still alive and it feels great.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP freelancer John Coon contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's controversial appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general has already reached the Supreme Court.\n\nVeteran Supreme Court litigator Thomas Goldstein filed a motion in an unrelated case late Friday that asks the justices to decide if Whitaker was legally installed as the temporary successor to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who Trump ousted last week.\n\nHis goal is the same as that of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh: getting a federal court to rule that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the legal and constitutional heir to Sessions. That would protect special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nFrosh filed his challenge in federal district court in Maryland earlier this week, calling Whitaker's appointment \"illegal and unconstitutional.\" The case is scheduled to be heard Dec. 19 but could take months before reaching the Supreme Court.\n\nGoldstein's effort, which also is based on the Constitution's appointments clause and federal laws, is aimed at leapfrogging lower courts and getting the justices to decide who Sessions' replacement should be, perhaps within weeks.\n\nThe issue is important nationwide because all lawsuits against the Justice Department that name Sessions as respondent must be automatically changed to name his successor. Currently, courts are automatically substituting Whitaker's name.\n\n\"This is the extraordinary case in which the identity of the successor is both contested and has important implications for the administration of justice nationally,\" Goldstein said in legal papers.\n\nCLOSE Matthew Whitaker was previous Jeff Sessions' chief of staff. Sessions submitted his resignation on Wednesday, one day after the 2018 midterm elections. USA TODAY\n\n\"There is a significant national interest in avoiding the prospect that every district and immigration judge in the nation could, in relatively short order, be presented with the controversy over which person to substitute as acting attorney general.\"\n\nGoldstein noted that Whitaker's routine actions, such as authorizing national security warrants and approving or withdrawing regulations, could lead to additional lawsuits contesting his appointment.\n\nThat appointment has drawn a wave of criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who contend Whitaker lacks authority to serve as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIn addition, Whitaker\u2019s past public criticism of the Russia investigation has prompted Democrats to call for his recusal from overseeing the Mueller inquiry.\n\nMore: Maryland files federal court challenge asking judge to block Whitaker\n\nMore: DOJ: Whitaker 'unquestionably' authorized to lead department\n\nA 20-page Justice Department opinion issued earlier this week concluded that Whitaker\u2019s standing as a senior department executive authorized Trump to elevate the former Iowa federal prosecutor. It cited the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who has been in office for at least 90 days. Prior to his appointment, Whitaker served as Sessions' chief of staff.\n\nBut Goldstein argued that an existing line of succession within the department, known as the Attorney General Succession Act, provides for the deputy attorney general or another Senate-confirmed official to serve as acting attorney general in the event of a vacancy.\n\n\"This is a problem of the president's own creation,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/supreme-court-asked-dispute-over-acting-attorney-general-matthew-whitaker/2029371002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY", "title": "Apple's remodeled flagship Santa Monica store", "description": "Apple is one third of the way through a big remodel of its flagship Apple Stores.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Mike McCarthy knows his job is on the line.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers' 13th-year head coach acknowledged he is aware that the team's 4-5-1 record has led to questions about his future.\n\nBut he insisted he and the team are focused on next week's pivotal NFC North matchup with the Vikings in Minnesota, and not the uncertainty surrounding his job security.\n\n\"That's the job. That's the way this business has gone,\" McCarthy said Friday. \"We set a standard here the past 12 years, and it's our responsibility to play to that standard. That's the way we approach it.\"\n\nThe 27-24 loss in Seattle on Thursday left the Packers 0-5 on the road and third in the division behind the Chicago Bears (6-3) and the Vikings (5-3-1). A seemingly softer portion of the schedule follows next week's showdown with Minnesota, but a loss in that game could put the Packers in a hole too deep to climb out of.\n\nMcCarthy has had teams rally late in seasons past, including in 2016, when quarterback Aaron Rodgers famously said the team could \"run the table\" over the final six weeks. After starting 4-6, the Packers won eight straight games to win the NFC North and advance to conference title game, in which they fell to the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThat was Green Bay's fourth NFC championship game under McCarthy, who led the 2010 team to the Super Bowl title. His Packers made the playoffs in eight consecutive seasons before missing the postseason last year, when Rodgers missed nine-plus games with a broken right collarbone.\n\n\"I have great confidence. I've been in this position before, so I have confidence in how we do things,\" McCarthy said. \"You have to react \u2014 there's no doubt about that \u2014 but you can't overreact. So, you've just got to stay in tune with the specifics and the details of why we're not getting it done in those situations.\"\n\nThe Packers have lost three of their last four games, despite being in position in the fourth quarter to win on the road against the Rams, Patriots and Seahawks.\n\n\"We're not going to turn on each other or nothing. We love each other and we stick together as a team,\" defensive back Tramon Williams said. \"Is it frustrating? Yes, it's very frustrating to come out on these types of losses when you know you should be winning these games.\"\n\nAgainst the Seahawks, the Packers had a 21-20 lead with 9 minutes left and were facing third-and-5 at Seattle's 12-yard line when Rodgers was sacked, forcing them to settle for a field goal to make it 24-20.\n\nSeattle responded with a 75-yard touchdown drive. When Rodgers missed an easy third-down throw on the ensuing possession, McCarthy opted to punt on fourth-and-2 with 4:20 to go. Green Bay never got the ball back.\n\n\"It's tough losing on the road. It's tough losing by one possession. Obviously, I'm frustrated, not just by the last throw but some other stuff that we could've done better out there,\" Rodgers said. \"This is an important, obviously, six-game stretch left. I still believe we have a lot to play for.\"\n\nMcCarthy said Friday that he still felt it was a \"solid decision\" to punt in that situation, and that his decision not to challenge a 34-yard Russell Wilson-to-Tyler Lockett completion that set up the go-ahead touchdown was based on not having a clear replay to look at in the coaches' booth. But he acknowledged both calls were open to second-guessing.\n\n\"Frankly, those are the kind of decisions that keep all of us up,\" McCarthy said. \"Now that I'm standing here and I know what the result is of them running out the clock, you go, 'Oh, yeah, I wish I would've went for it on fourth-and-2.'\"\n\n\"My first reaction was to go for it,\" he added. \"But we talked it over game management-wise and that's the decision I made.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Referee Craig Pawson took a while before pointing to the spot and did so only on the advice of one of his linesman.\n\n\"It's a shame that it comes down to a bit of a controversial situation,\" Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez said. \"It was the linesman that flagged for it.\"\n\nThough the five-time world champion enjoyed a lot of possession, Brazil failed to create many chances after Neymar had a close-range goal disallowed as early as the 11th minute.\n\nUruguay, which has lost three games in a row, went closest to scoring before Neymar's winning penalty.\n\nStriker Luis Suarez took advantage of a loose ball on the edge of the Brazil penalty area but his shot was flicked over the bar by goalkeeper Alisson.\n\nBrazil had its goalkeeper to thank again in first-half injury time when he parried away a sharp volley from Suarez's forward partner, Edinson Cavani.\n\nAlisson was called upon again early in the second half when he dived to his left to turn a low curling free kick from Suarez behind for a corner.\n\nThis was the first time Suarez and Cavani have played together since the World Cup round of 16, where Cavani was injured after he scored the two goals that beat Portugal 2-1. Cavani's absence was noticeable when the two-time world champion was eliminated in the quarterfinals by eventual champion France.\n\nBrazil coach Tite was particularly impressed by his defense, which has not conceded a goal since the quarterfinal loss to Belgium in the World Cup.\n\nHe heaped praise on the Uruguay strikers, too, especially Cavani.\n\n\"Cavani does make marking hard and he gives Suarez space,\" he said.\n\nBrazil plays Cameroon next in Milton Keynes, north of London, while Uruguay takes on world champion France at the Stade de France. Both matches are on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Tony Gibson was driving home from Stewart-Haas Racing's shop this summer when he lost feeling in his hands and feet.\n\nHe had to pull over. He had no other choice. He ended up in the emergency room for overnight observation, where doctors found a blood clot in his vertebral artery.\n\nHe was hospitalized more than a week and seemed to be making progress when he suffered a mini-stroke in his optical nerve system. He lost 85 percent of the hearing in his left ear and most of the functions in his left eye.\n\n\"It was quite a deal,\" Gibson said.\n\nIt's been quite a recovery, too. Gibson has come so far that he will play a pivotal role in the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Sunday.\n\nThe 54-year-old Gibson is filling in for suspended crew chief Rodney Childers on Kevin Harvick's No. 4 Ford. Gibson will be atop the pit box and making key decisions for Harvick's championship run .\n\n\"My biggest fear is just making the wrong call or doing the wrong thing,\" Gibson said. \"I want those guys to be proud of me.\"\n\nGibson made the perfect call at Phoenix last week, opting for two tires on the final pit stop that helped Harvick finish fifth and earn the fourth and final playoff spot. Gibson joked during the race that he hadn't brought enough medication to get through the tense final laps.\n\nHe packed extra for Homestead. He's even missing a neurologist appointment Friday to be with the team.\n\n\"I'm managing it,\" he said. \"It's just part of life and things. I was very lucky, and I don't take that for granted. There's a lot of people out there that are way worse than me, so it's just something that I'll overcome and I'll get used to it and go on.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he has a championship to chase.\n\nHarvick is considered one of the two favorites at Homestead. He's tied for the series lead with eight victories, but two of those came in illegal cars. His Las Vegas victory from earlier this year was disqualified as was his win at Texas two weeks ago. That penalty cost Harvick an automatic berth in the championship race and forced him to have to outperform several others at Phoenix.\n\nChilders and car chief Robert Smith were suspended for the final two races.\n\nFortunately for Harvick, Gibson was available \u2014 and healthy enough \u2014 to fill in.\n\n\"When you take two of the key people off, you always wonder whether it's a quarterback or a running back or a wide receiver,\" Gibson said. \"Can the others step up and do a good job? I think that's where Rodney and this company at Stewart-Haas has done a good job. We have a lot of depth here at this company.\"\n\nGibson won the 2017 Daytona 500 with Kurt Busch and was a part of championship-winning teams featuring Jeff Gordon (1998, 2001) and the late Alan Kulwicki (1992). So he's well-equipped to deal with the pressure and distractions that often come in a one-race championship.\n\n\"The biggest thing that Tony brings is just a ton of experience,\" Harvick said. \"Obviously a familiar face to the NASCAR officials, and he's been with Stewart-Haas for a long time and worked with all those guys and worked with everybody in the shop.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nWith Black Friday only one week away, virtually every major retailer in America is rolling out Black Friday deals and doorbusters, and Costco is no different. The members-only bulk-shopping superstore will be selling some of its best Black Friday doorbusters in-store and online. And you don't even have to be a member to take advantage of some of these sales.\n\nCostco, the No. 4 retailer in the U.S. has two ads this year called \"holiday savings books\" covering their Black Friday sales, with deals on televisions, electronics, gaming systems, jewelry, food, and more.\n\nThe first savings book is 13 pages and features extended deals available now through Nov. 26, while supplies last. The smaller eight-page book starts with a page of Thanksgiving Day online-only doorbusters.\n\nThe warehouse club giant's 520-plus stores will be closed Thanksgiving. But they will continue their in-store savings on Black Friday when they open 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.\n\nNot all deals listed in the books include the savings. Several do say how much members will get off the regular price and some require members to log in online to see pricing.\n\n*Most computers and some appliances note they come with \"Costco Concierge Services technical support,\" and some include a second-year warranty.\n\nIf you're not already a Costco member, now is a good time to join the membership club. But it's still possible to take advantage of some of the deals without a membership, however it will cost you. Non-members are charged a 5% surcharge over posted prices for members.

And it\u2019s having success where others have failed.\n\n\u201cWe are discovering our son for the first time in 13 years,\u201d Joe Bashta said.\n\nIsaac Bashta, 13, has a form of autism as well as a genetic disorder that prevents him from being able to speak, gives him little ability to control his own limbs. In a classroom setting back in his hometown of Melbourne, you might have seen Isaac writhing on his back, screaming, kicking a wall and slapping himself \u2014 and it was getting worse, Bashta said.\n\n\u201cHe was getting more and more aggressive, upset,\u201d Bashta said.\n\nContrast that with the boy\u2019s demeanor one day a couple weeks ago, when he had a one-on-one session with teacher Erika Anderson at her Green Bay School, ACE Teaching & Consulting. The session was a continuation of a section Isaac and his classmates have been working on in the field of business, in which they have been developing a make-believe cleaning service, so they could learn about budgeting, profit-and-loss and other practical lessons.\n\nThis particular day, Isaac was tasked with developing a company profile for their company, which Isaac had named \u201cThe Artists of Shine.\u201d\n\nWearing a set of headphones to block out distracting noises and chewing on a chew-straw attached by lanyard to his shirt, Isaac calmly dictated the following, one letter at a time:\n\n\u201cWith living such busy lives, having a company that is trustworthy, goes above and beyond and can make your home shine like a piece of art is key to your happiness. We have many years of experience and our small staff of myself, Will and Luke really hope to have your business. We serve only the Green Bay area.\u201d\n\nMore: Student with autism who rarely speaks gives inspirational graduation speech\n\nTruth be told, Isaac kind of missed the boat on this one.

It was developed not quite two decades ago by Soma Mukhopadhyay, an immigrant to the U.S. from India, a scientist and mother of an autistic son, who developed it into a business in Austin, Texas, seven years ago.\n\nThe program is most often associated with a system in which autistic students are taught to point to letters on a letterboard so they can spell things out.\n\nStudents who can\u2019t control their limbs can\u2019t easily point to whatever they want, but RPM is incremental: They start out pointing to one side or the other of a two-choice board \u2014 yes-no, big-little, up-down \u2014 and, when they get to the point of being able to make the correct choices, the chart becomes finer and more complex until it eventually includes a small alphabet.\n\nIsaac works with a stencil board; the letters are negative spaces, and he must put the point of a pencil inside each of the letters he chooses before Anderson formally recognizes the selection.\n\nAnderson\u2019s job is to jot down the letters as they come up and to keep up a rapid patter of encouragement, prompts and whatever else it takes to keep the easily distracted Isaac on task.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense, Isaac, go again,\u201d she orders as he struggles one letter at a time. \u201cGo again. Go, go, go. Now you\u2019ve touched three things. Do it again. Keep going. Nice! Good reaching! You\u2019re there!\u201d\n\nMore: Autism rates continue to climb, and experts don't exactly know why\n\nIt\u2019s not like Isaac is cured or better or anything. His disabilities are his disabilities. But as far as Joe and Susan Bashta are concerned, this is the first time their boy has been involved in a program that presupposes he has at least average intelligence and tries to tap into it without taking his behavioral lapses as anything but a momentary obstacle to be worked around.\n\nThe letterboard is just part of the overall difference RPM has from other approaches.\n\n\u201cWhile most programs are waiting for speech to happen, and discard intelligence, RPM presumes intelligence because speech and language areas are in different parts of the brain,\u201d Soma Mukhopadhyay explained in an email interview with the Press-Gazette.\u201d\n\n\u201cRPM is an individualized educational program where the teacher identifies the open learning channels of the student to teach the topic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo a visual student will learn geometry concepts using visual skills of looking at the diagram while a tactile student will learn geometry concepts using his touch \u2026 The teacher uses different \u2018sensory activities\u2019 to teach the student who may not be able to visually focus.\u201d\n\nAs Isaac gets more skilled at picking out his letters, he\u2019ll graduate to a laminated plastic board on which the letters are positive shapes. The goal is independence, whether it involves the student holding his own letterboard or handwriting, or a keyboard or whatever it takes to allow the most open-ended communication possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just all about this magical board,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s really just the method of how we engage the student, and that\u2019s what makes it so successful. There are kids who come in where I don\u2019t even hold the board; it just sits on the table. Or we\u2019re doing handwriting. Or speech. As long as it\u2019s purposeful.\u201d\n\nGetting to know Isaac\n\nFor Isaac, this whole new world started with an RPM teacher from Mukhopadhyay\u2019s school visiting Australia. After pulling Isaac from his traditional autism classwork, Susan Bashta began researching heavily and learned of RPM, which was only available in the U.S. The Bashtas and seven other sets of Australian parents of autistic children pooled their money and brought in representatives of Mukhopadhyay\u2019s school.\n\nWith the parents watching on closed circuit television, the teacher worked with the students one-on-one. When Isaac\u2019s turn came up, he wasn\u2019t happy about it.\n\n\u201cIsaac was very upset, hitting himself and screaming,\u201d Susan Bashta recalled. \u201cThe teacher said, \u2018Isaac, I know you\u2019re in there. I just want to help.\u2019 It was the first time anyone treated him with dignity.\u201d\n\nIsaac was indeed \u201cin there.\u201d Before the session ended, the teacher read him an Aesop\u2019s fable about a wolf with a bone stuck in his throat and asked him, \u201cHow would you feel with a bone in your throat?\u201d Isaac spelled out the word \u201churt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know he could spell,\u201d Susan Bashta recalled. \u201cI started crying. Joe started laughing.\u201d\n\nTheir brief experience with Mukhopadhyay\u2019s program convinced them they needed to move to the U.S. The problem was, Mukhopadhyay\u2019s school in Austin had a two-year waiting list.\n\nMore: An Iowa autistic teen is missing. This is why it's a common problem for families.\n\nMukhopadhyay has so far trained just 11 instructors around the world, and Erika Anderson happens to be one of them. In fact, she was Mukhopadhyay\u2019s first trainee, and she spent three years shadowing the instructor all over the world to learn her methods.\n\nAll of the certified instructors hold workshops at their home headquarters and abroad, but Anderson also holds a daylong session, a whole school day of classwork in a single place, under the umbrella of the RPM methodology, and she\u2019s the only one in the world doing it.\n\nThat\u2019s what brought the Bashtas from Melbourne to Green Bay. Joe Bashta owns an artificial intelligence business that he can operate from anywhere in the world, and so it was a relatively simple matter to pull up stakes and move his family to Wisconsin.\n\nThey did it 21 months ago, and \u201cwe\u2019ve had no regrets,\u201d Susan Bashta said. \u201cWe made the right decision.\u201d\n\nSince arriving in Green Bay in January 2017 and enrolling Isaac in the full-time program, the Bashtas have learned their boy loves art and music and hopes someday to work with horses \u2014 none of which they knew from his previous 12 years of life.\n\nOne other thing they learned about him: He was in pain. Through his newfound communication skills, he was able to tell them he had pain in his back, something he had been living with but could never tell anyone about. He has since been able to receive treatment for it.\n\nACE Teaching and Consulting student Will Sheppard, 14, colors a picture during socializing time Oct. 26, 2018 in Green Bay, Wis. Sarah Kloepping/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: Sarah Kloepping/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\nProgram is still growing\n\nAnderson\u2019s school works regularly with about 40 students through short, weekly sessions and scheduled camps, and she and her staff work with countless others when they take their program on the road once a month. So far, in her daylong classroom session, she has just four students, all four families of which came from outside the Green Bay area. The Bashtas are the only ones so far who came all the way from the other side of the world, but a family they know in Perth, Australia, will soon be moving to Green Bay to take advantage of Anderson\u2019s classes.\n\nRPM is still a new thing, and as such, it\u2019s not without controversy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason RPM is not the gold standard\u201d for teaching autistic students, said Amy Campbell, who co-owns ACE with Anderson and serves as the school\u2019s business manager. \u201cIt\u2019s so new, there\u2019s no scientific research to validate it. Soma hasn\u2019t taken it through any validation study. In the eyes of the autism community, this is still controversial. But we just look at it as teaching.\u201d\n\nRPM differs from other systems in that it starts with the assumption that all of its students are capable of learning, Campbell said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying they are all little geniuses trapped inside these bodies, just that they\u2019re capable of learning, if someone can sit down and figure out how they learn,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s one-on-one. A key cornerstone of autism is you\u2019ll see different motor difficulties. It varies. Maybe the student can\u2019t grab anything. Or they\u2019ll slap someone. They\u2019re easily distracted, easily taken off track. \u2018Stimming,\u2019 they call it \u2014 the regulatory things they do to keep their bodies calm, some external thing, like rocking, flapping. Every kid with autism has stims.\n\n\u201cRPM looks at those things, looks at accommodations to make it easier for them to learn. One big thing is, often they don\u2019t have an output method like speech. Some talk, but it\u2019s not purposeful.\u201d\n\nThe letterboard ends up being the most common output method the school uses, Campbell said.\n\nIsaac Bashta, 13, uses a letterboard held by ACE Teaching and Consulting co-owner and instructor Erika Anderson to communicate with his classmates, including Will Sheppard, 14, right, on Oct. 26, 2018 in Green Bay, Wis. Sarah Kloepping/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: Sarah Kloepping/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\nWhether it\u2019s been scientifically validated or not, parents of the students going through ACE have watched their kids succeed, and that\u2019s plenty of validation enough, at least for Melanie Sheppard, whose boy, Will, has been with Anderson\u2019s program the longest.\n\nIn fact, Melanie Sheppard is the one who talked Anderson into starting a full-time program in the first place. She and her husband, Andrew Sheppard, were living in Iowa about five years ago when they learned of RPM and Anderson. They started bringing Will to two-week sessions that Anderson offered.\n\n\u201cAt that very first camp, he spelled out one of the colors of the flag,\u201d Melanie Sheppard recalled. \u201cI had no clue he knew that. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but I was blown away.\u201d\n\nThe family started coming for entire summers so Will could get as much training as possible.\n\nThen, one summer, Anderson and Campbell had to be gone for part of the summer session, for one of their out-of-state demonstration sessions, and Will was heartbroken. When they returned, he spelled out on the letterboard: \u201cI thought you were not coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a pivotal moment,\u201d Melanie Sheppard said. \u201cWe decided we\u2019re not leaving.\u201d\n\nAs soon as she could persuade Anderson to start a full-time program, the Sheppards moved to Green Bay to enroll Will in it.\n\nMore: How teen's soap business helps him thrive with Asperger's\n\nLike the Bashtas, it was almost like they were meeting their own son for the first time.\n\n\u201cWill would spend all day playing with an iPad and watching TV,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cThat\u2019s all he would do. I bought millions of dollars\u2019 worth of toys, but he never played with them. I didn\u2019t understand the motor skills problem.\u201d\n\nNow, after three years of working with Anderson, this boy with motor skills problems has demonstrated a huge interest in art, and he can color neatly within the lines of an intricate color-by-number picture.\n\nA friendly chat\n\nOn this particular day, he sat at a table coloring on the work and munching frozen green beans \u2014 those and ice cubes seem to calm him down, his mother said \u2014 as he participated in a round-table \u201csocial session\u201d with Isaac Bashta and Brady Accette, another autistic young man.\n\nWith Anderson providing stenographer duties, the three autistic students spelled out a conversation on letterboards. Anderson hoped they\u2019d continue a discussion of their fictional cleaning business, but the three had minds of their own.\n\n\u201cThanks Brady for joining us,\u201d Will spelled out on the letterboard. \u201cDo you like our press?\u201d This after showing no sign whatsoever that he had even noticed a visiting reporter and videographer from the Green Bay Press-Gazette.\n\n\u201cI brought them to show off our minds,\u201d Isaac spelled out, the first indication he gave that he had been paying attention at all when a reporter had visited him and his parents at their home a few days earlier.\n\n\u201cI can say it is very impressive,\u201d Brady added. \u201cThere should be more knowledge about what we can do.\u201d\n\nThe conversation continued in round-robin fashion, with Brady periodically leaping to his feet and walking off nervous energy, Isaac slapping himself on the back of the neck and chewing on his chew straw and Will munching green beans and coloring, none of them really making eye contact with each other or anyone else in the room.\n\nMore: Woman with autism finds the independence she dreamed of\n\nIsaac told the others he had been at an educational disadvantage in Australia, where no such program for autism exists.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot better here,\u201d he said.\n\nBrady thought so, too. \u201cI know when I was younger not many people believed in me. Finally I found my saving grace in a school who did. That made a difference.\u201d\n\nWill expressed hope that it eventually would lead people to grow more accepting of those with autism.\n\nJust three buddies sitting around the table having a chat. Until Isaac decided it had gone on long enough.\n\n\u201cSee now its lunch,\u201d he spelled out.\n\nFollow Paul Srubas on Twitter: @PGpaulsrubas\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/16/autism-australian-family-moves-green-bay-school/2027856002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, John Fritze, USA TODAY", "title": "Donald Trump says he 'should have' commemorated Veterans Day at Arlington", "description": "President Trump expressed regret in an interview to be aired this weekend for not marking Veterans Day with a visit to Arlington National Cemetery.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/donald-trump-says-he-should-have-observed-veterans-day/2029265002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/295aeda7-adbf-43c1-a761-1d998a816d11-AP_Trump_14.JPG?crop=5312,2990,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:04:14Z", "content": "Days after he was criticized for canceling a trip to a WWI cemetery in Paris and not visiting Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, President Donald Trump honored the nation's veterans and touted his administration's commitment.

The Giants face the Buccaneers on Sunday. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nA look at some key fantasy football questions going into Week 11:\n\nWHICH UNDER-THE-RADAR PLAYERS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR A BIG GAME THIS WEEK?\n\nGiants QB Eli Manning has a juicy Week 11 matchup against the Buccaneers, who have given up multiple TDs to QBs in seven of nine games. Other Giants you should consider starting this week include wideout Sterling Shepard and tight end Evan Engram. The Bucs can't stop WRs and TEs, and have yielded the second-most fantasy Points Per Game (FPPG) to both positions.\n\nYou can stick a fork in the Raiders. They're done and should be targeted in fantasy football every week. The Cardinals, their Week 11 opponent, have a rookie and veteran that have the potential of having a big game against them.\n\nChristian Kirk is averaging just under seven targets per game over the past four weeks. Despite his quiet Week 10 against the Chiefs, he had averaged just over 65 receiving yards in his previous four games. He's an excellent route runner with good hands and should be considered a trade target in dynasty leagues.\n\nLarry Fitzgerald slumped badly earlier this season but he's averaging just under 10 targets over the past four weeks and has 23 receptions and two TDs during that time frame.\n\nThe Raiders have surrendered multiple TDs to the WR position in seven straight games. Tight end Ricky Seals-Jones has a good matchup against the silver and black. Tight ends have caught 18 passes and scored four TDs against Oakland over the past three weeks.\n\nRavens RB Alex Collins could be a sneaky play against the Bengals, who've given up 13 total TDs to RBs this season. QB Joe Flacco's Week 11 status is not known (hip) and if either Lamar Jackson or Robert Griffin III start in his place, the Ravens might lean on their running game a bit more.\n\nANY GOOD BUY LOW OPTIONS TO FOCUS ON AS TRADE DEADLINES APPROACH?\n\nCorey Davis, WR, Titans: The Titans averaged just over 15 points per game for the first seven weeks of their season. They've averaged 31 points over the past two weeks and Davis has averaged 10 targets and 90.5 receiving yards during that time. Davis is fourth with eight targets inside the 10 this season. With the Titans offense finally showing some life, look for Davis to continue to have some upside.\n\nSony Michel, RB, Patriots: For many fantasy owners the bloom may be off the rose when it comes to Michel, but the Patriots have shown that when he's healthy they're going to give him the ball. He averaged just over 22 carries, 4.72 yards per carry and scored four TDs from Week 4 to Week 6. Fantasy football playoffs take place from Week 14 to Week 16 in most leagues and he faces the Dolphins in Week 14 and the Bills in Week 16. Both have been very friendly to the run.\n\nANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRADE TARGETS BASED ON REST OF SEASON SCHEDULES?\n\nCam Newton, QB, Panthers: Newton has scored the eighth-most fantasy points among QBs this season and has future matchups against the Buccaneers, Browns, Saints and Falcons. The Browns are 17th in FPPG allowed to QBs, but the other three teams are in the top 4 in points allowed to the position.\n\nEmmanuel Sanders, WR, Broncos: Sanders has scored the 11th most fantasy points among WRs. With the Broncos trade of Demaryius Thomas to the Texans, Sanders will continue to be heavily targeted in the passing game. He still has favorable matchups against the 49ers, who've yielded 14 TDs to WRs and the Browns, who've allowed the seventh most FPPG to WRs this season. In Week 16, which is usually championship week in fantasy football, Sanders will have a very favorable matchup against the Raiders. In addition, Phillip Lindsay, RB for the Broncos, should also take advantage of Denver's soft schedule down the stretch and should also be considered a trade target.\n\nWITH COOPER KUPP OUT FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON IS THERE A RAMS WR THAT COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS ABSENCE?\n\nHis target share is tough to predict, but look for Josh Reynolds, who has big-play potential, to play some of his reps out of the slot, where he'll absorb some of Kupp's targets. In his last game with Kupp on the sidelines he caught three passes for 42 yards, but two of those catches were for TDs.\n\n___\n\nFor more fantasy tips and insight, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 When the Netherlands beat Germany 3-0 last month the score flattered the Dutch. Ronald Koeman's resurgent young team beat France 2-0 on Friday and this time the margin of victory flattered the French.\n\nThe rampant men in orange, driven forward by the pinpoint passing of midfielder Frenkie de Jong and given a creative spark in attack by Memphis Depay's trickery, could have scored five. Only a string of saves by France captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris managed to keep the score respectable for the recently crowned world champion.\n\nThe Dutch victory relegated Germany from the top tier of the new UEFA Nations League, a second humbling this year after Germany crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage four years after winning the tournament in Brazil.\n\nNow the Netherlands, which didn't even qualify for the last World Cup or the 2016 European Championship, needs just a draw against Germany on Monday in Gelsenkirchen to win League A Group 1.\n\n\"This was a complete match at the very highest level,\" said Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman, who has in a matter of months turned an underachieving team into a European force to be reckoned with. In its last three matches, the Netherlands has beaten Germany 3-0, drawn with top-ranked Belgium 1-1, and outclassed France.\n\n\"I want to congratulate this Dutch team,\" France coach Didier Deschamps said. \"They played a very good match. They had a lot of quality.\"\n\nMidfielder Georginio Wijnaldum scored just before halftime and Memphis Depay converted an audacious stoppage-time penalty as the Dutch overran the world champion.\n\nFrance tried to play a waiting game, sitting back and hoping to launch speedy 19-year-old striker Kylian Mbappe on the break. But led by midfielder De Jong and center back Virgil van Dijk, the Dutch not only dominated possession, but also shut down the World Cup star.\n\n\"It is exceptional how he reads the game,\" Koeman said of De Jong.\n\nThe result left the Dutch one point behind France in League A Group 1 ahead of the group's final match, between the Netherlands and Germany on Monday, when Joachim Loew's team will be playing only for pride.\n\nWijnaldum broke the deadlock just a minute before halftime with his 10th international goal in his 52nd appearance for the Netherlands.\n\nDepay doubled the lead with a \"Panenka\" penalty in stoppage time, chipping the ball over Lloris to complete a memorable victory.\n\nThe Netherlands must wish they could play every match at Feyenoord's De Kuip stadium \u2014 the victory extended the Dutch run of wins there to 15.\n\nA depleted France arrived in Rotterdam after injuries sidelined Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial, Benjamin Mendy, Thomas Lemar, Lucas Hernandez and Thomas Lemar.\n\nDeschamps refused to use their absence as an excuse for his team's lackluster display.\n\n\"We had confidence in the players we had here,\" he said. \"We lost to a Dutch team that played very well and we did not play well.\"\n\nElsewhere in the Nations League, Denmark beat Wales 2-1 in Cardiff to secure promotion from League B Group 4. Nicolai Jorgensen and Martin Braithwaite scored for the Danes before Gareth Bale hit a late consolation goal.\n\nSlovakia beat Ukraine 4-1 in League B Group 1. Ukraine had already secured promotion before the match.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I would say the second piece of that is he's really effective as a pass catcher, too.\"\n\nAtlanta's struggling defense was hoping to get a boost from the return of middle linebacker Deion Jones, who hasn't played since breaking his right foot in the season opener and was ruled out a couple of days after rejoining the active roster. When healthy, Jones is the Falcons' best defender. He calls the plays, is stout against the run and is fast enough to cover running backs and receivers in coverage.\n\nJones' injury and season-ending surgeries for starting safeties Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen have been too much for the Falcons to overcome. They rank third-worst in average yards allowed and fourth-worst in scoring average.\n\nElliott is coming off a dazzling performance \u2014 19 runs and six catches for 187 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns \u2014 in a win at Philadelphia. But the Cowboys had to stay the course early when Elliott had just seven yards through the team's first two possessions.\n\n\"Honestly, at the beginning, it was a little bit tough sledding,\" Elliott said. \"We made some good adjustments. We have to have the same mentality going into this game.\"\n\nDallas' defense faces a tough challenge in matching up against Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan and star wideout Julio Jones, who has reached 10,000 yards receiving quicker than any player in NFL history.\n\nSo, there isn't much wiggle room for either team. Both are 4-5 and trying to stay in the playoff hunt.\n\nHere are things to know about the Cowboys-Falcons matchup:\n\nTHIN D-LINE\n\nThe Cowboys started practice this week with five defensive linemen sidelined by injuries: David Irving (ankle), Taco Charlton (shoulder), Maliek Collins (knee), Daniel Ross (calf) and Antwaun Woods (concussion).\n\nCollins and Woods both played more than 60 percent of the snaps against Philadelphia. If either can't play against the Falcons, the depth on the interior line will be tested.\n\nDallas might not be able to use Tyrone Crawford outside as much to ease the load on DeMarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory. Lawrence, who has battled shoulder issues this season and has a history of back trouble, played a season-high 90 percent of the snaps against the Eagles.\n\nFIGHTING FOR RESPECT\n\nFalcons cornerback Desmond Trufant is enduring his toughest year as a pro with five dropped interceptions, the worst coming on Cincinnati's game-winning drive in Week 4.\n\nTrufant, a first-round pick in 2013, takes the blame for not playing consistently sound fundamentals.\n\n\"I'm judging myself harder than anybody else can,\" he said. \"So it is what it is. It's the league. I'm in the spotlight. I'm earning what I'm earning. It just comes with it. That's just how it goes. I'm in that position. I'll just keep working, attack the issues, stay humble. I've been here before. I'll just keep working.\"\n\nCOMPARING PICKS\n\nThe Cowboys were high on Calvin Ridley going into the draft, having spent plenty of time with the former Alabama receiver and needing a replacement after releasing Dez Bryant, the franchise's career leader in touchdown catches, in a cost-cutting move in the offseason. Instead, Dallas went with Boise State linebacker Leighton Vander Esch at No. 19. The Falcons chose Ridley seven picks later.\n\nBoth teams are pleased.\n\nVander Esch set a rookie franchise record with 19 tackles against the Eagles, according to the coaches' count. Ridley leads all rookies with 500 yards receiving and has been a strong complement to Julio Jones.\n\nLOOKING BETTER\n\nPrescott was steady in leading 75-yard drives for touchdowns in the fourth quarter last week, each of which answered a TD from the Eagles. It has been an inconsistent season for the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie the Year as he ranks 33rd in average yards passing, but Dallas coach Jason Garrett says the team ignores outside criticism.\n\n\"Well, we don't spend much on that,\" Garrett said. \"We spend most of our time on ourselves and what we need to do to be better. That's every one of us. Every coach. Every player. And we love Dak. Dak has done some really great things for our team in the 2\u00bd years that he's been our starting quarterback. He's continuing to grow as a player.\"\n\nSTAY STRONG\n\nRyan needs the threat of play-action, but that's hard to maintain when the Falcons' running game starts strong and fades. It's been a frustrating trend all season.\n\n\"We just need to stick with it,\" he said. \"Last week, we just played from behind most of the third and fourth quarter, which makes it difficult to run the football. I thought that we had our opportunities. We did some nice things in the run game last week, so staying in front of the chains and staying ahead and the score is key to keeping our run game rolling.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon in Dallas contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jones returned to the active roster this week after spending two months on injured reserve with a broken right foot.\n\n\"He's certainly close,\" Quinn said. \"We were able to give him more reps as the week went on. He's been working in the pass game for a while. This week he got really involved in the run game and taking guys on and the power that goes with it.\"\n\nThe Falcons (4-5) will face the Cowboys (4-5) with a defense that ranks third worst in yards allowed and fourth worst in scoring. Strong safety Keanu Neal's season ended in the opener, and free safety Ricardo Allen was lost for the season two weeks later.\n\nBryant, the franchise career scoring leader, was a full participant in practice for the second straight day. Quinn said the Falcons have no immediate plans to cut Giorgio Tavecchio, who is 5-for-5 on field-goal attempts with a pair of 50-yarders. Tavecchio will not be active Sunday but will stay on the roster in case the 43-year-old Bryant has a setback.\n\nFriday's injury report listed receivers Calvin Ridley (elbow) and Mohamed Sanu (hip), linebackers De'Vondre Campbell (calf), Foyesade Oluokun (elbow) and Bruce Carter (knee) and safety Damontae Kazee (shoulder) as full participants.

(AP) \u2014 The annual Big Game between Stanford and California scheduled for Saturday was postponed two weeks because of the unhealthy air quality in the Bay Area from a wildfire some 150 miles to the north.\n\nCal announced Friday that the game would be played Dec. 1 with a noon kickoff at Memorial Stadium.\n\n\"First and foremost our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the tragic California wildfires,\" Golden Bears football coach Justin Wilcox said in a Twitter post. \"While we realize the importance of the Big Game right now, our thoughts are centered around so many who have been so deeply affected. Our primary factors in making the decision to postpone the game were centered around the health and safety of our student-athletes, fans and everyone involved in putting on the game. We look forward to seeing you in Berkeley on Dec. 1.\"\n\nThis is the just the second postponement of the Big Game between Cal (6-4, 3-4 Pac-12) and Stanford (6-4, 4-3). It was delayed one week in 1963 following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The rival schools have been playing each year since 1892 with the exception of breaks during World Wars I and II.\n\n\"The entire Stanford Athletics community recognizes this has been an extremely challenging time for so many people who have been affected by the wildfires, both in the Bay Area and throughout the state. Our thoughts are with them, first and foremost,\" Stanford athletic director Bernard Muir said. \"We are thankful to the University of California for collaborating with us on the logistical challenges of rescheduling the Big Game, and are looking forward to playing the game on Dec. 1.\"\n\nStanford noted the schools tried to hold off a final decision until Saturday but the forecast shows air quality isn't expected to sufficiently improve.\n\nThe schools, which also utilized the NCAA and Pac-12 guidelines on air quality in making the decision, offered thoughts to those affected by the devastating Northern California fire.\n\n\"We have been carefully tracking air quality in Berkeley and the Bay Area over the past week, relying on the best data and guidance available to us from medical and environmental experts. The forecasts we have received show a minimal chance of the improvement necessary to hold the game on Saturday,\" Cal athletic director Jim Knowlton said. \"While we would have preferred to play the Big Game on its scheduled date, once we realized that air quality would likely not return to acceptable levels, we made the decision to postpone for the health and safety of our student-athletes, coaches, gameday staff, students, band and spirit groups, alumni and fans.\"\n\nIn the NFL, the Oakland Raiders were unable to practice outdoors Thursday and Friday, so they instead held indoor walkthroughs.

Of all the people I came across, I developed perhaps one of my closest personal friendships with Javier, 33, a visual artist and first generation Cuban American.\n\nJavier has had several run-ins with the law involving drugs, and now spends his time picking up life\u2019s various pieces and creating beauty out of them through painting. Of the many burdens he carried, one that weighed disproportionately heavy on his mind and spirit, was his inability to vote. That disenfranchisement seemed to strike a chord at the root of basic human dignity, self-worth and self-determination. After the 2016 election, Javier left Florida for a place where he felt more agency in his future.\n\nRelated content\n\nCOLUMN: Midterms show that voters are ready for criminal justice reform.

Sign up now!\n\nFlorida had been disenfranchising more than 1 million citizens for violations as small as driving with a suspended license. On Nov. 6, a Florida ballot measure passed that restores voting rights immediately to former felons (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault), one of the largest expansions since the early 1970s, when the voting age was lowered to 18 nationwide.\n\nAs a physician, I believe that restoring voting rights is imperative not only as a matter of basic human rights, but also as a matter of public health.\n\nVoting your interests can impact your health\n\nVoter disenfranchisement, and specifically voting restrictions on former felons, takes a disproportionate toll on communities of color and is an institutionalized form of discrimination.\n\nIn Florida, nearly 20 percent of black voters were kept from the polls because of the state's felony restrictions. In America, nearly 6 million former felons have been kept out of the voting booth. Black men are affected by voter disenfranchisement at a rate that is seven times higher than any other group.\n\nEnding that discrimination nationwide gives former felons the power to vote their own interests \u2014 and, most important, that includes voting on life-and-death issues affecting health.\n\nMortality rates among former felons is significantly higher than rates among populations that have never been incarcerated. And health coverage for former felons is spotty \u2014 many don't have coverage upon release and can't get it \u2014 leaving them to deal with a greater prevalence of chronic illness such as HIV/AIDS and diabetes on their own, which often leads to emergency room visits after symptoms have gotten too unbearable to handle.\n\nAfrican-Americans in particular suffer from stark differences in health outcomes compared with other ethnic groups.\n\nFor example, infant mortality is more than twice as likely among blacks than whites. These disparities are largely driven by differences in both access to care and other social and economic determinants. Blacks and Latinos are also more likely than other groups to live in or near environmentally toxic areas.\n\nPeople who can vote their interests have greater control over the health and safety of their communities. That voice is one that every American deserves.\n\nMore states need to follow\n\nDespite Florida\u2019s expansion, the right to equal suffrage is far from realized \u2014 Iowa and Kentucky still disenfranchise former felons for life, in addition to partial restrictions in several other states, leaving millions without the right to equal suffrage across the country.\n\nTellingly, these voter disenfranchisement laws were born of racist origins. Dr. Jonathan Purtle of Drexel University has noted that although the 14th Amendment provided a constitutional basis for voter disenfranchisement \u201cfor participation in rebellion, or other crime,\u201d the actual implementation of such policies was explicitly racially motivated. He notes that in 1850, about one-third of states had disenfranchisement laws. Within 20 years, after the 15th Amendment (which gave blacks the right to vote) was ratified, nearly 75 percent of states had them.\n\nIn our current political environment, filled with historic baggage, the beauty of America still shows. Despite our imperfections, we are endlessly approaching a more perfect union. Florida's efforts to restore voting rights is not just a second chance for incarcerated citizens. It, and other efforts like it, are a second chance for America.\n\nThe state's actions should serve as a bellwether for voting restoration rights across the country for the millions who are still disenfranchised.\n\nI'm grateful those days are over for my friend Javier.\n\nI still talk to him, though he lives in California now, so the exchanges of \u00bfQu\u00e9 bol\u00e1? are done by phone. In that state, voting rights are automatic for former felons who have completed parole or who are on probation.\n\nI imagine my friend now with a voice that affords him the dignity that should be afforded to all Americans, and which he couldn't fully realize while he lived in Miami.\n\nAs a physician, I work to preserve fundamental human rights through medicine.\n\nAs Americans, we can all do the same. Let's use our vote and our voices to ensure that all former felons get their fundamental human rights back.\n\nDr. Akash Goel is an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/politics-policing/2018/11/16/voting-rights-florida-felons-policing-usa/2005008002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Samantha Gordon, USA TODAY", "title": "Amazon's 2018 Black Friday deals are happening right now", "description": "Amazon's 2018 Black Friday deals are happening right now", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/16/amazons-2018-black-friday-deals-happening-right-now/38545105/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/fa25daf1-2708-4a4c-a19e-59b783797cf0/fa25daf1-2708-4a4c-a19e-59b783797cf0_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:19:28Z", "content": "Amazon's Black Friday deals are here and we're here for it.

(AP) \u2014 A reclamation project off the waiver wire is galvanizing the New York Giants' beleaguered offensive line.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Jamon Brown thought he was without a job. He was released by the Los Angeles Rams on Oct. 31 after spending the better part of four years with the team. Brown, a guard for the Rams who started all 16 games and a playoff game in 2017, was on the waiver wire.\n\n\"That was definitely disappointing,\" Brown said. \"I didn't see it coming.\"\n\nBrown had signed a $2.5 million, four-year contract with the Rams after being selected in the third round by the team out of Louisville in 2015. He earned a starting spot as a right guard with the Rams in 2017 after missing most of his rookie season with a fractured right leg.\n\nIn July, however, Brown was suspended for the first two games of the 2018 season after violating the NFL's policy for substance abuse. He would not comment on what banned substance he used.\n\nWhen the season began, Brown was replaced by Austin Blythe as the starter at right guard for the Rams and he never regained his spot.\n\n\"It was all very disappointing, the way it went down,\" Brown said. \"I never got the opportunity to make things right.\"\n\nAs part of a numbers crunch, after the Rams acquired defensive end Dante Fowler Jr. in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Brown was released.\n\nAt the same time, the Giants' offensive line was in turmoil. The problems began when former first-round pick Ereck Flowers was released after a move to right tackle from left tackle didn't pan out.\n\nOne free-agent signing, tackle Nate Solder, hasn't lived up to the four-year, $62 million contract he signed in the offseason. Center Jon Halapio broke his right ankle and lower leg in the second week of the season. Free agent Patrick Omameh didn't perform well and was released.\n\nAmid the upheaval, the Giants took a chance on Brown, a 6-foot, 340-pounder.\n\n\"We knew that he was a starter on a team that won 11 games last year,\" Giants coach Pat Shurmur said. \"He's a big man, a really big man. We liked what we saw in Jamon.\"\n\nWhen the claim on Brown became official, the Giants were on their bye week. So Brown flew to New Jersey and met with Shurmur and team officials. He worked out for a couple of days, then headed back to Los Angeles to clean out his apartment.\n\n\"I got a lot of frequent flier miles,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Giants resumed practice last week and Brown was learning the offense. He practiced as if he were going to play.\n\nSure enough, on Saturday before the game with the San Francisco 49ers, Omameh was let go. Brown slid in as the starter in the game in California. That meant Brown flew back and forth across the country four times in two weeks.\n\n\"It's really crazy how that all turned out,\" Brown said. \"I'm still learning the Giants' way. I'm learning everything I can. This is definitely a great opportunity for me.\"\n\nBrown was part of the line that gave Eli Manning time to throw, allowed only one sack provided room for sensational rookie Saquon Barkley to run. More important, the Giants won 27-23 on Monday night for their second win in nine games.\n\n\"I thought he did a good job,\" Shurmur said of Brown. \"I thought he did some of the things that we thought he could do. I think that's a settling force for the quarterback when he's pretty certain that the interior of the pocket's going to be firm.\"\n\nBrown will start at right guard when the Giants host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. He tweaked his ankle during Friday's practice, but the team did not list him on the injury report.\n\n\"I'm going to bring energy,\" Brown said. \"I think I can be reliable because I've been doing this awhile. I've experienced my times of success.\"\n\nNOTES: The Giants listed no injuries after Friday's practice. Brown (ankle), LB Alec Ogletree (ribs), CB Antonio Hamilton (hip), FB Eli Penny (back) and S Curtis Riley (shoulder) all practiced fully, so the team is 100 percent healthy for a second straight week. ...

That\u2019s the premise behind Swagbucks, an app that rewards you SB points, which can be redeemed for free gift cards at Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks and many other places \u2013 or you can choose to get cash back via PayPal.\n\nIn other words, shop at the places you normally would, but you\u2019ll first launch the Swagbucks app, website or use the Swagbutton browser extension. The percentage you get back from each retailer will vary, but it can add up, plus there are some exclusive deals and coupons, too.\n\nThe Swagbucks app also awards you SB points for other activities, like watching videos, answering surveys, searching the web and more.\n\nMore: 8 apps we used to save money on gas, hotels and shopping\n\nMore: Looking to save money on a new phone or phone plan?

Then you\u2019ll see your screen populate with those circulars (\u201cflyers\u201d) for stores near you \u2013 whether it\u2019s a big-box electronics store, clothing chain, home improvement center, supermarket and so on \u2013 and you\u2019ll can now flick through them all and virtually clip items into a shopping list by tapping it. Or tap and hold for more info.\n\nSpeaking of the shopping list, you can type a word, like \u201cheadphones,\u201d and you\u2019ll see the related deals near you. Another tip is to tap the flame icon at the bottom of the screen to see all the best sale prices. Or tap the magnifying glass to search by keyword.\n\nThe app also holds all your loyalty and rewards cards, so you don\u2019t need to carry a pocket- or purse-full of plastic.\n\nEbates\n\nSimilar to the revenue share model with other apps like Swagbucks and Ibotta \u2013 where the company splits the commission referral with you \u2013 Ebates has more than 2,500 store partners and is offering \u201cdouble cash back\u201d at participating retailers, too, for a limited time.\n\nFor example, you\u2019ll usually get 3 percent cash back by shopping at Macy\u2019s (by first starting at Ebates), but you\u2019ll now get 6 percent back. Similarly, Ebates would normally pay you 6 percent of the shared revenue at Shoes.com, but you can now expect 12 percent. You get the idea.\n\nAfter you make an eligible purchase, you'll earn cash back in the form of a check or PayPal payment every quarter.\n\nThe app also offers exclusive deals, as well as sales and coupons, too.\n\nMore: Black Friday 2018: Best Buy's ad is a must-see for electronics gifts\n\nMore: The 20 best gifts under $50 of 2018\n\nSlickdeals (Photo: SlickDeals)\n\nSlickdeals\n\nHere\u2019s another handy shopping companion for leading up to (or on) Black Friday.\n\nDubbed the \u201clargest deal-sharing community on the web,\u201d the company says millions of people regularly use the Slickdeals app to discover, share and rate the best deals and coupons for their favorite stores.\n\nEssentially, wherever there\u2019s an outstanding deal \u2013 like 50 percent off the hottest tech toy at Best Buy, a two-for-one special at Groupon or a code to use at Kohl\u2019s \u2013 Slickdeals may promote these on its front page of the app or site.\n\nTo ensure it\u2019s legitimate, every deal gets vetted by the community through votes and comments, and the good ones move up to the Popular Deals forum.

It was first reported by Yahoo that Green was suspended one game by the Warriors after calling Durant an expletive, but Yahoo later reported that Green also told Durant that the Warriors \u201cdon\u2019t need\u201d him and dared him to leave.\n\nMany analysts are already declaring that Durant\u2019s relationship with the organization has been damaged to the point that won\u2019t return next season, but Charles Barkley believes that the Warriors suspended Green in an attempt to appease Durant.

Poland is already assured of finishing last in the group and will be relegated to League B.\n\nMancini was hired after previous coach Gian Piero Ventura was blamed for Italy's failed World Cup qualification.\n\n\"I see a team that wants to roll its sleeves up and bring Italy back where it belongs,\" Mancini said. \"Let's be clear, we still need some time, but we're on the right path.\"\n\nDefender Giorgio Chiellini is slated to make his 100th appearance for Italy while wearing the captain's armband.\n\n\"I want to celebrate the achievement only at the end of the match,\" Chiellini said. \"First let's focus on Portugal, try to bring home three points and provide continuity to the good work done to this point.\"\n\nChiellini retired from the national team in the aftermath of the loss to Sweden but then changed his mind.\n\n\"The real disappointment came in June when many of my club teammates left for Russia while I was preparing my suitcases for vacation,\" Chiellini said.\n\nFellow defender Alessio Romagnoli left Italy's squad on Friday with a muscular injury, and Italy is also without forward Federico Bernardeschi.\n\nBernardeschi was a key performer in the 1-0 win over Poland last month, lining up alongside Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Chiesa.\n\nUnable to use the same lineup, Mancini announced that Ciro Immobile will likely start at center forward.\n\nItaly has had trouble scoring.\n\nThe last time the Azzurri scored more than one goal was in May, a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia in a friendly , while the last time they accomplished the feat in a competitive match was in June 2017, a 5-0 victory over Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nItaly next plays the United States in a friendly in Genk, Belgium, on Tuesday.\n\nMancini announced Chiellini, Alessandro Florenzi, Jorginho and Insigne would be sent home after the Portugal game and Gianluca Mancini and Moise Kean would be called up from the under-21 side.\n\nMancini and Chiellini both expressed disappointment that Ronaldo, who is taking a break from the national team, isn't with Portugal.\n\n\"It's always great to face the best players,\" Mancini said. \"Anyhow, Portugal remains a great squad even without Cristiano.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Those were also the colors of Sweden. Wearing a blue shirt and white shorts, Brazil beat the Swedes 5-2.\n\nBrazil wore yellow and blue when it won its other World Cup finals in 1962, 1970, 1994, and 2002.\n\nYellow and blue was not Schlee's only option when he entered the 1953 contest. He also pitched a green shirt and white shorts, and a yellow shirt with transversal blue and green stripes.\n\n\"The rules said there needed to be a balance in the colors of the kit,\" Schlee said in the 2007 interview. \"I left green and yellow on the shirt, put blue shorts and the white socks. But I thought that design would never go beyond 1954 because of Brazil's defeat in Switzerland.\"\n\nSchlee would have turned 84 next Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 UCF and Cincinnati are Top 25 teams eager to show the college football world what they and the American Athletic Conference are all about.\n\nThe undefeated, 11th-ranked Knights and once-beaten No. 19 Bearcats are ready to state their case Saturday night in a prime time, nationally televised matchup with league championship implications.\n\nUCF (9-0, 6-0 AAC, CFP No. 11) can clinch the AAC East Division, as well as a berth in the conference title game for the second straight year, by extending the nation's longest winning streak to 23 games.\n\nCincinnati (9-1, 5-1, No. 24), back in the spotlight after winning four games a year ago in its first season under coach Luke Fickell, can extend the East race to the final week of the regular season by knocking off the defending AAC champions.\n\n\"It's exactly what you want as a program,\" UCF coach Josh Heupel said embracing \u2014 for at least for one day \u2014 Orlando being the epicenter of college football with ESPN's \"College GameDay\" setting up on the Knights' campus for the first time.\n\n\"You want the spotlight on you. You want each game you play to get bigger,\" Heupel added. \"That indicates you're doing the right things inside your program, and you're winning games.\"\n\nThen, there's the College Football Playoff conversation, which UCF is hoping to remain of part of by going unbeaten for a second straight season.\n\nThe biggest knock against the Knights a year ago, as well as today is strength of schedule. Heupel and Fickell both feel the level of competition in the AAC is underappreciated by outsiders, and Saturday night is an opportunity for a national audience to get a taste of the league.\n\nUCF climbed one spot in the latest CFP rankings, the highest spot an AAC team has occupied in the five-year history of the current playoff format.\n\nThe Bearcats are relishing being back on a national stage. The 9-1 start is their best since Cincinnati had a 12-0 regular season in 2009.\n\n\"You can't not talk about it. You don't want to say there's an elephant in the room and nobody talks about it,\" Fickell said.\n\n\"It's a Catch-22. You love it,\" the coach added of the attention his team is receiving. \"You love it for the campus, for our fans, for our alumni, for our kids. These guys deserve that. But if you ask me, I'm a little different. I'm under a rock. ... You've got to be able to celebrate it, and you've got to be able to handle it. I think that's the test for us.\"\n\nSome other things to know about UCF and Cincinnati:\n\nSTRENGTH VS. STRENGTH\n\nUCF, led by QB McKenzie Milton, is third in the nation in total offense and eighth in scoring. Cincinnati has the AAC's top defense. The Bearcats lead the conference in rushing defense, scoring defense, total defense and fewest first downs allowed.\n\nHeupel doesn't want the Knights to get caught up in the magnitude of the matchup.\n\n\"We don't need to do anything differently than what we've done. There's going to be a ton of emotion in the ball game. It will be electric,\" the UCF coach said. \"But at the end of day, it's 11 on 11. It's 11 guys operating as one. It's everybody doing their job. Don't do anything extraordinary, just do the ordinary at a very high level.\"\n\nKEEP YOUR COOL\n\nThe Bearcats exchanged words with South Florida players before their game on Saturday, and then got off to a sloppy start and trailed at halftime. Fickell says keeping their cool is a point of emphasis this week.\n\n\"Having your emotions under control -- I don't think we did a great job of it last week,\" Fickell said. \"This emotional roller coaster, you come in right before the game and all of a sudden your Adenalin just drops. We had some of those situations. So as a mature team, we can take that next step. I know there are a lot of other things that are on this game.\"\n\nON THE RUN\n\nSophomore running back Michael Warren II scored four times against South Florida, including his first touchdown catch. He has 18 touchdowns this season, a school record. His 17 touchdowns rushing tie the school record. He has run for 1,082 yards overall, becoming the first Cincinnati player to run for 1,000 since 2012. He's been the Bearcats' most consistent player on offense, scoring in all but one game. They're leaning on him as the season reaches its biggest games.\n\n\"He's built for November,\" Fickell said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Kay in Cincinnati contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Grateful)\n\nThanksgiving used to make me miserable.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love eating. If it were socially acceptable to bathe in mashed potatoes, I would do it. I can bake a mean pumpkin pie, and I even love the taste of turkey. Decorative gourds are my jam.\n\nMy problem with Thanksgiving was that mine never looked or felt the way society made me believe it should look and feel. Hollywood and Hallmark sold me this image of a Thanksgiving full of family and travel, of warm conversations by candlelight and pumpkin-colored leaves blowing in the breeze just outside the window.\n\nProblem is, I don\u2019t have a big family nor a particularly culinary one. There was never anyone to travel to, I live in a state with more cacti than trees and a football game was always blaring in the background.\n\nMore: How to throw a Taco Bell Thanksgiving\n\nMore: These festival cocktails will put you in the holiday spirit\n\nI felt like I was doing the holidays wrong. That all changed the year I took matters into my own hands, dispensed with picturesque expectations and decided just to have fun. Now, it\u2019s one of my favorite days of the year.\n\nHere\u2019s the secret: Thanksgiving can be whatever you want it to be. Want to throw a costume party? Serve a fast-food buffet? Play flag football with your friends? Eat an entire pumpkin pie in your underwear? You can do all those things.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a rut like I was, here are some easy ways to reclaim the holidays and make them fun again. It's easier than you think.\n\nThrow a Friendsgiving\n\nWhat is Friendsgiving? Good friends are family. If you\u2019re short on blood relations (or blood relations whose company you enjoy), well, that\u2019s what friends are for. Gather all your fellow wayward spirits and throw a potluck-style Friendsgiving.\n\nMore: How to host a vegan, gluten-free Friendsgiving\n\nMore: The only Keto-approved Friendsgiving menu you need\n\nFun dress code\n\nDo you know how big a hero you\u2019ll be if you dispense with the formalities and instruct your guests to show up in their comfiest pajamas? Only the biggest hero. Stretchy waistbands make weathering the inevitable turkey coma so much more pleasant.\n\nDisposable table settings\n\nThe best Thanksgiving is one where you don\u2019t have to do any dishes. Ditch the fine china for some eco-friendly disposable dishware so you can simply toss the dirty dishes (with minimal guilt). Craft a cheap tablecloth out of butcher paper, trade elaborate centerpieces for buckets of crayons and markers and encourage your guests to make funny drawings or leave notes about what they\u2019re thankful for this year. Not only will you not have to clean it afterwards, but you\u2019ll be left with a memorable keepsake.\n\nMore: Food and drink bars that are perfect for any Friendsgiving\n\nMake a signature cocktail\n\nServe a festive cocktail that\u2019s quick and easy to mix for a crowd. Think seasonal flavors, such as apple, pumpkin and cranberry. Don\u2019t forget to make a nonalcoholic version for teetotalers and designated drivers who still want to feel festive. Visit thanksgiving.com for some ideas, such as the delectable pumpkin fizz cocktail. Plus, alcohol means you\u2019ll have the option of devising drinking games.\n\nCLOSE This seasonal cocktail is perfect for Halloween or Thanksgiving parties. Thanksgiving.com, USA TODAY\n\nParty games\n\nThis isn\u2019t your grandma\u2019s Thanksgiving (unless your grandma is particularly cool), so leave Parcheesi and Cribbage in the attic and update your stash with some easy-to-learn card games that show off your friends\u2019 humor, creativity and wit. Anomia tests the ability of players\u2019 brains to find connections between simple prompts, while Superfight has players create superheroes they have to argue to victory like demented lawyers. If you opt for those custom cocktails and there are no kids within earshot (and you have a wicked sense of humor), you can never go wrong with Cards Against Humanity, which bills itself as \u201ca party game for horrible people.\u201d\n\nFootball party\n\nA bigger fan of football than of Thanksgiving? Then dispense of finery entirely and throw a game-day party. You\u2019re an adult, you can do what you want. And if what you want is to wear your team jersey, deep-fry a turkey, drink plastic cups of beer poured straight from a keg and trash-talk your friends, not a soul on earth can stop you.\n\nMore: Here are the do's and don't's of holiday potlucks\n\nEating contest\n\nReally lean into the gluttony of the occasion and have an eating contest. Make Instant Pots full of stuffing, prepare a vat of mashed potatoes, load up on cheap store-bought pumpkin pie and go to town. A good prize for the winner, in addition to eternal bragging rights, will make the tummy ache that follows a little more palatable.\n\nHave fun\n\nThe whole point of an irreverent Thanksgiving is to have fun. So you burn the pie. So the dog eats the turkey. So the power goes out. So what? At its core, Thanksgiving is little more than an excuse to spend time with the people you love. As long as you get that part right, the rest is gravy.\n\nReach the reporter at bvandenburgh@gannett.com.

Marc Saltzman for USA TODAY\n\nEbates (Photo: Ebates)\n\nWhether you're shopping for family, friends or colleagues \u2013 or hey, even yourself \u2013 your smartphone can be an invaluable companion as you wander the aisles at your favorite retailer or shop online (or a bit of both).\n\nIn fact, there are several free apps that can sniff out great deals, give you cash back, display coupons or reward you in other ways for using them. Here\u2019s a look at a few noteworthy examples, all of which are available on iOS, Android and the web.\n\nMore: Amazon drops $25 minimum for free shipping through holiday shopping season\n\nMore: Forget lines: At Walmart, you can make purchases right where you are this holiday season\n\nSwagbucks (Photo: Swagbucks)\n\nSwagbucks\n\nGet cash back while you shop online at more than 1,500 retailers, including big names like Amazon, Walmart and Target. That\u2019s the premise behind Swagbucks, an app that rewards you SB points, which can be redeemed for free gift cards at Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks and many other places \u2013 or you can choose to get cash back via PayPal.\n\nIn other words, shop at the places you normally would, but you\u2019ll first launch the Swagbucks app, website or use the Swagbutton browser extension. The percentage you get back from each retailer will vary, but it can add up, plus there are some exclusive deals and coupons, too.\n\nThe Swagbucks app also awards you SB points for other activities, like watching videos, answering surveys, searching the web and more.\n\nMore: 8 apps we used to save money on gas, hotels and shopping\n\nMore: Looking to save money on a new phone or phone plan? Here are a few tips\n\nFlipp (Photo: Flipp)\n\nFlipp\n\nRather than sorting (and cutting through) all the paper circulars you get each week, and getting newsprint on your hands in the process, Flipp is a free app that delivers your local circulars right to your phone \u2013 and calls out the best deals, too.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: the first time you open the app, let the phone identify where you are or type in your ZIP code. Then you\u2019ll see your screen populate with those circulars (\u201cflyers\u201d) for stores near you \u2013 whether it\u2019s a big-box electronics store, clothing chain, home improvement center, supermarket and so on \u2013 and you\u2019ll can now flick through them all and virtually clip items into a shopping list by tapping it. Or tap and hold for more info.\n\nSpeaking of the shopping list, you can type a word, like \u201cheadphones,\u201d and you\u2019ll see the related deals near you. Another tip is to tap the flame icon at the bottom of the screen to see all the best sale prices. Or tap the magnifying glass to search by keyword.\n\nThe app also holds all your loyalty and rewards cards, so you don\u2019t need to carry a pocket- or purse-full of plastic.\n\nEbates\n\nSimilar to the revenue share model with other apps like Swagbucks and Ibotta \u2013 where the company splits the commission referral with you \u2013 Ebates has more than 2,500 store partners and is offering \u201cdouble cash back\u201d at participating retailers, too, for a limited time.\n\nFor example, you\u2019ll usually get 3 percent cash back by shopping at Macy\u2019s (by first starting at Ebates), but you\u2019ll now get 6 percent back. Similarly, Ebates would normally pay you 6 percent of the shared revenue at Shoes.com, but you can now expect 12 percent. You get the idea.\n\nAfter you make an eligible purchase, you'll earn cash back in the form of a check or PayPal payment every quarter.\n\nThe app also offers exclusive deals, as well as sales and coupons, too.\n\nMore: Black Friday 2018: Best Buy's ad is a must-see for electronics gifts\n\nMore: The 20 best gifts under $50 of 2018\n\nSlickdeals (Photo: SlickDeals)\n\nSlickdeals\n\nHere\u2019s another handy shopping companion for leading up to (or on) Black Friday.\n\nDubbed the \u201clargest deal-sharing community on the web,\u201d the company says millions of people regularly use the Slickdeals app to discover, share and rate the best deals and coupons for their favorite stores.\n\nEssentially, wherever there\u2019s an outstanding deal \u2013 like 50 percent off the hottest tech toy at Best Buy, a two-for-one special at Groupon or a code to use at Kohl\u2019s \u2013 Slickdeals may promote these on its front page of the app or site.\n\nTo ensure it\u2019s legitimate, every deal gets vetted by the community through votes and comments, and the good ones move up to the Popular Deals forum. Then, the best Popular Deals are screened by the company\u2019s editors after getting enough votes to be considered for the front page. There\u2019s also a dedicated Black Friday page, too.\n\nAlternatively, you can set a Deal Alert and get notified whenever a deal matching what you\u2019re looking for is posted on Slickdeals, such as when the 60-inch TV you had your eye on drops below $800 for the first time.\n\nTo find other deals this season, also consider other good shopping-related apps, including eBay, Pricegrabber, RetailMeNot,Craigslist and Red Laser (available in the iOS App and Google Play stores).\n\nWhat are your \u201cgo to\u201d shopping apps and why?

USC takes on UCLA on Saturday. (AP Photo/Thomas Boyd, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPASADENA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The annual crosstown showdown has arrived at a particularly low point in the football history of both Southern California and UCLA.\n\nThe schools' 13 combined losses are the most they've ever had in 88 editions of the game for the Victory Bell. Both the Trojans (5-5, 4-4 Pac-12) and the Bruins (2-8, 2-5) are out of the conference title race and playing for little more than local pride.\n\nThat's still more than enough to motivate the players on both sides of Los Angeles' ever-roiling rivalry.\n\n\"It will mean sending out our seniors not having lost to UCLA,\" Trojans defensive lineman Brandon Pili said. \"It will mean a lot to our seniors never losing to them, never giving up the Victory Bell. And it will also mean a lot to (underclassmen). Nobody at USC ever wants to lose to those guys across town.\"\n\nWhile the result doesn't mean much outside the LA metroplex, the stakes remain high inside the Rose Bowl on Saturday. The game is also the first in the rivalry for two major figures going forward: USC quarterback J.T. Daniels and UCLA coach Chip Kelly.\n\n\"A lot of our guys know their guys,\" Kelly said. \"A lot of guys played high school football together, and then one went here and one went there. That's part of the uniqueness of the rivalry with the proximity of both schools. There's a real familiarity with this team more than any other we play.\"\n\nA win would be the 50th in rivalry history for the Trojans, who have won the last three straight meetings. Clay Helton has never lost to the Bruins as a head coach, and keeping that streak alive would make the Trojans bowl-eligible while removing a modicum of the pressure currently weighing on him.\n\n\"Los Angeles is home to both of us, and I've thought this is such a cool rivalry because we all live together,\" Helton said. \"Los Angeles is the best city in the world, and we've got two great universities that love to compete against each other.\"\n\nHere are more things to know about the rivalry that began in 1929 with a 76-0 win for the Trojans:\n\nTROJAN STAND\n\nUSC has lost three of its last four to fall out of contention in the Pac-12 South. The Trojans need one win to gain bowl eligibility, and they would be wise to get it this week with No. 3 Notre Dame traveling to the Coliseum next Saturday for the regular-season finale. USC's struggles have put heat on Helton's job security, particularly given Daniels' inconsistent play for the longtime quarterbacks coach in a struggling offense that managed only 14 points last week in a home loss to California.\n\nSTARTING POINT\n\nThe Bruins have lost three straight after back-to-back victories, and they'll finish with a losing record for the third consecutive year. But Kelly is seeing signs of progress from his first year in charge, and UCLA would love to justify its high-priced coach's work with a rivalry win. Kelly doesn't see USC's three-game winning streak in the series as a major factor, either: \"At one point Milli Vanilli was on top of the world, and then it all crashed and burned,\" he said.\n\nPASSING FANCY\n\nKelly hasn't settled on a quarterback all season, playing both veteran Wilton Speight and youngster Dorian Thompson-Robinson to similarly modest success. Kelly doesn't see the point in relying on just one passer, and their divergent skill sets allow Kelly to mix up his offensive plans. USC's defense has been solid nearly all season long, and it will be ready. \"We're scheming for both quarterbacks,\" Trojans defensive lineman Jay Tufele said. \"But whoever is in there, we're going to have the same game speed. We're going to play like our hair is on fire no matter which quarterback is in there. We're going to get to him and make sure he doesn't make plays.\"\n\nTIES THAT BIND\n\nBecause both teams recruit extensively from their own backyards, just about everybody knows everybody on the opposite sideline in the crosstown showdown. For instance, USC freshmen Daniels and receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown both played high school football in Orange County with UCLA sophomore safety Quentin Lake, who has become the Bruins' third-leading tackler. \"I kind of know his releases, tendencies and what he does at the top of routes,\" Lake said of St. Brown. \"I feel like I might have a little bit of an edge, but he has gone against me a couple hundred times in practice, too.\"\n\nBEAR VANDALISM\n\nBoth teams are having poor seasons, but the city rivalry doesn't take a year off: The Bruin Bear, a statue on UCLA's campus, was covered in red and yellow spray paint Thursday. The schools toned down the rivalry in other areas, however: Both schools decided to forgo their traditional pregame bonfires out of respect for the victims and firefighters involved with the wildfires raging throughout Southern California this month.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: www.apnews.com/CollegeFootball and www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The railroad will be giving up three years of intense branding efforts in exchange for Virgin's internationally known name.\n\nThe Virgin partnership also carries financial benefits, and could bring a needed infusion of cash to the $4 billion railroad, which began service among Fort Lauderdale, Miami and West Palm Beach earlier this year and plans to begin full Miami-to-Orlando service by 2021.\n\nBrightline currently is trying to finance construction between West Palm Beach and Orlando International Airport, the second phase of the project.\n\nThe company has pursued a variety of financing options for the second phase, and now is facing a Dec. 31 deadline to sell $1.15 billion of tax-exempt bonds.\n\nUnaudited financial statements reveal Brightline struggled in the first half of the year, losing $28.2 million in the first quarter of this year and $28.3 million in the second quarter. The railroad began West Palm-to-Fort Lauderdale service in January and expanded to Miami in May.\n\nVirgin Group\u2019s existing high-speed railroad in the United Kingdom, also called Virgin Trains, has had its own financial struggles and faced criticism earlier this year for accepting a government bailout.\n\nMore: Brightline clears first hurdle in Orlando-to-Tampa expansion: No competition\n\nVirgin and Brightline officials on Friday expressed enthusiasm about the new partnership.\n\n\u201cBrightline is at the forefront of innovation in this market, and the ideal partner for Virgin to work with to alter perceptions and traveling habits across the United States,\u201d Branson wrote in a blog post on Virgin's website.\n\nEdens on Friday said working with Virgin is \u201canother leap forward\u201d for Brightline.\n\n\u201cVirgin has built a respected and trusted brand in travel and hospitality,\u201d Edens said in a news release. \u201cWith our shared focus on customer experience, powered by a culture of innovation and disruption, we are well positioned to build on our success.\u201d\n\nThe new partnership is the latest in series of major developments the company has announced this year.\n\nIn June, Brightline revealed it would pursue an expansion from Tampa to Orlando along state-owned right of way.\n\nThen, in September, Brightline announced plans to buy the rights to build a high-speed railroad between Southern California and Las Vegas. Service there is to launch in 2022, and eventually could expand into the Los Angeles area, according to Brightline.\n\nBrightline\u2019s current management team will continue to oversee daily operations, engineering, business development and strategy, the company said Friday.\n\nMore: Treasure Coast deserves a Brightline train stop (or two) | Our view\n\nMore: Counties spent $7.2 million fighting Brightline; what a waste | Thumb down\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/16/brightline-virgin-trains-usa/2027361002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Nick Schwartz", "title": "The #PatMahomesChallenge is here and it's unspeakably disgusting", "description": "Patrick Mahomes loves ketchup\u2026 maybe a little too much.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/patrick-mahomes-challenge-ketchup", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/patrickmahomes.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:55:53Z", "content": "Patrick Mahomes is having an MVP season in his first full year as a starter, so he probably didn\u2019t expect his ketchup preferences to become one of the biggest stories of the year on social media.

He apprehended the gunman outside the bar, pinned him down and was waiting for police help when a responding officer from the neighboring town of Midlothian arrived.\n\nPolice say the officer ordered Roberson to drop his gun. Witnesses say they shouted that Roberson was a security guard. The officer shot and killed Roberson.\n\nCivil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who is representing the mother of Roberson\u2019s 9-month-old son, accused Illinois State Police and the Midlothian Police Department of withholding the name of the officer to give him time to clean up his internet footprint and \u201chide evidence.\u201d\n\nMerritt also represents the family of Botham Jean, the Dallas man who was shot to death in his home in September by an off-duty police officer.\n\nDallas Police Officer Amber Guyger has said she mistakenly entered the man\u2019s apartment in the same complex where she lived. She has said she thought she was in her apartment, and Jean was an intruder.\n\nDallas Police kept Guyger's name out of the public until she was arrested and charged with manslaughter, about 48 hours after the incident.\n\n\u201cThey refused to release Amber Guyger\u2019s name, which gave her a chance to scrub the internet and hide evidence,\u201d Merritt told USA TODAY on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on here.\u201d\n\nMerritt said he\u2019s learned the name of the Midlothian officer independently and plans to release it to the media on Monday if authorities haven't by then.\n\nIllinois State Police, which is investigating the shooting, referred questions on the officer's identity to Midlothian Police. Officials in Midlothian did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMidlothian Police have confirmed that the officer is white, has been a police officer for about seven years, including four years with Midlothian, and is a team leader on a SWAT task force that includes officers from south suburban Chicago law enforcement agencies.\n\nMore: Police: Cop who shot security guard Jemel Roberson gave 'multiple' commands to drop weapon before firing\n\nMore: Police officer near Chicago fatally shot security guard who was detaining a suspect\n\nThe shooting outside Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins has drawn national headlines, outrage and questions about whether race factored into the officer\u2019s decision to open fire. Roberson was black. The officer is white.\n\nThe person Roberson apprehended had allegedly fired a weapon inside the bar moments earlier, wounding multiple people and drawing police from surrounding jurisdictions to rush to the establishment.\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office is investigating the shooting inside the bar. The state police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the shooting outside the bar. No charges have been filed in either incident.\n\nThe task force has said the Midlothian officer was responding to reports of a shooting when he saw a man decked out in \u201cplain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard, armed with a gun.\"\n\n\u201cAccording to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject,\u201d state police said.\n\nMidlothian\u2019s Police chief has praised Roberson as a brave man who was doing his job. He said he saw the incident ultimately as a \"blue on blue,\" friendly fire shooting.\n\nMerritt accused Illinois State Police and Midlothian Police of releasing a slow drip of information \u201cdesigned to exonerate this officer \u2026 and throw water on the community unrest.\u201d\n\nMerritt said witnesses have told him that Roberson was wearing a beanie-styled hat emblazoned with the word \u201cSECURITY,\u201d and a shirt and vest with similar markings.\n\nThe attorney said witnesses \u2013 some of whom he said were not interviewed by police \u2013 told him the officer did not give Roberson an opportunity to comply with his order to drop the gun.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re (police) saying 'We told him drop the gun and he didn\u2019t, that there was time to reflect,' \u201d Merritt said. \u201cThe people we\u2019ve interviewed are saying \u2018It was drop the gun \u2013 Pop! Pop! Pop!\u201d\n\nRoberson suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Officer.\n\nRoberson's mother, Beatrice Roberson, has filed a federal civil lawsuit against Midlothian and the officer. Her attorney, Gregory Kulis, issued a subpoena Friday calling on Illinois State Police to release the name of the officer, according to a court filing.\n\nSeveral Chicago area pastors and civil rights activist joined Merritt\u2019s call to release the officer\u2019s name. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a prominent Catholic pastor and civil rights activist, said Midlothian should immediately fire the officer and the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office should file murder charges.\n\nAuthorities say that officers from several jurisdictions were at the scene. The Midlothian officer is the only one who discharged his weapon.\n\n\u201cIt was not a blue on blue,\u201d Pfleger said. \u201cIt was blue-on-black crime. This was no accidental murder. This was racial profiling.\u201d\n\nThis photo provided by Avontea Boose shows her baby Tristan Roberson and the boy's father Jemel Roberson.

She is pregnant with their second child.\n\nHe planned to apply to become a police officer in the Chicago area.\n\nRoberson had been hustling to pick up work wherever he could find it, Merritt said, so he\u2019d have money to buy plenty of gifts for his son\u2019s first Christmas.

Our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nMacBooks are great for all sorts of reasons, but they tend to be pricey. We're here to help: In addition to scouring the Internet for the best Black Friday deals available right now, we have been specifically on the hunt for great deals on Apple's laptops, from the MacBook Pro, to the Air, to the svelte 12-inch MacBook.\n\nThe Best Black Friday 2018 MacBook deals available now:\n\nMacBook Air 11-inch (4GB RAM + 128GB SSD)\u2014$809.99 at Amazon (Save $89.01): If you\u2019re in the market for a stylish laptop to browse the web on, the MacBook Air 11-inch model is a great option. Not only is the display bright and colorful, it\u2019s plenty fast for basic tasks like checking e-mail and watching Netflix. According to reviews on Amazon, battery life is pretty good too, so you should get quite a bit of juice out of it on a single charge. Plus, at just a little over two pounds, it\u2019s really compact and portable, making it the perfect travel companion. MacBook Air 13-inch (8GB RAM + Bluetooth 4.0 Thunderbolt 2)\u2014$888 at Amazon: If you\u2019re on a tight budget, the MacBook Air 13-inch is a good value purchase. It\u2019s zippy enough to handle multiple open tabs and battery life is long. What we really like best about this machine are its USB-A ports. This is nice because you don\u2019t have to carry a bunch of dongles with you. With USB-C reigning supreme, legacy ports are less common these days.The only con is that it\u2019s heavier than other MacBooks, so it doesn\u2019t make the best travel companion. MacBook 12-inch (256GB SSD + Retina display)\u2014$1,052.16 at Amazon (Save $246.84): The MacBook 12-inch is great for bouncing around the Internet on. With its 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, you can expect programs like Excel and Microsoft Word to open up quickly. The only drawback is that the underside gets hot with moderate use, so you may want to keep it on a table. Nitpick aside, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable laptop to surf the web on, you\u2019ll definitely want to check this one out. MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar (8GB RAM + Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics)\u2014$1,399 at B&H (Save $400): The MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar is an excellent machine for the home or office. It should last you a full work day on a single charge and the upward-facing speakers produce excellent sound. That said, it\u2019s a bit more than what the average user might need. While the Touch Bar (the touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard) may offer some intuitive shortcuts, it might be a nuisance to the everyday user, as you have to keep looking down from the screen to use it and it costs extra. MacBook Pro 15-inch with Touch Bar (16GB RAM + Retina Display)\u2014$2,149 at B&H (Save $650): If it\u2019s power you\u2019re after, the MacBook Pro 15-inch with Touch Bar should fit the bill. Between the 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, you can expect incredibly speedy performance. I mean, it\u2019s powerful enough to handle demanding editing software like GIMP. The 2880 x 1800 Retina display is great for editing photos and videos on, too, as it produces ultra crisp images and vivid colors. While we have mixed feelings about the Touch Bar (the touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard), it makes logging in with your finger super easy.\n\nWhile we believe the above deals are awesome, many other retailers are offering pretty good deals as well. Along with a few Windows laptops and Chromebooks (MacBooks too!), here are some other deals worth checking out:\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

(Sept. 7) AP\n\nMorgan McCaul confronts Larry Nassar Friday, Jan. 19, 2018, in Circuit Judge Rosemarie Aquilina's courtroom during the fourth day of victim impact statements regarding the former sports medicine doctor. Nassar pled guilty to seven counts of sexual assault in Ingham County, and three in Eaton County. (Photo: MATTHEW DAE SMITH/Lansing State Journal)\n\nMorgan McCaul knows what impact Betsy DeVos' proposed overhaul of campus sexual assault investigations would have on victims.\n\nIn mid-January, McCaul went to a podium in a mid-Michigan courtroom and faced Larry Nassar, the former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor who sexually assaulted her and hundreds of other female athletes over decades. It was incredibly stressful and traumatic, she says. But Nassar, or his lawyers, couldn't question McCaul.\n\n\"I truly can\u2019t imagine the overwhelming fear that facing him with the possibility of interrogation would bring,\" she told the Detroit Free Press Friday morning. \"Every shred of emotion and anxiety that I felt seeing my abuser at his sentencing was under ideal circumstances. I got tremendously lucky.\"\n\nSo when she looks at the proposed rules put forth Friday by the Department of Education, she says she knows what's behind the changes. The new guidelines, which now enter a 60-day comment period, would narrow the definition of what sexual harassment is on campus and reinforce \"due process\" rights for students accused.\n\n\"I believe the new Title IX procedures defined by the Department of Education accomplish exactly what they set out to do: impose further strain on survivors of sexual assault and alleviate institutions of their responsibility to protect students and their safety,\" McCaul said.\n\nWhat is sexual harassment?\n\nThe new rules aren't likely to be adopted until 2019 at the earliest, so they wouldn't take full effect until 2020.\n\nUnder guidelines from President Barack Obama's administration, sexual harassment was defined more loosely as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\"\n\nDeVos' proposal creates three categories for harassment, including \"unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program\"; harassment in exchange for something, like a school employee's tying an educational benefit to a person's sexual conduct; and sexual assault.\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos speaks during a meeting of the Federal Commission on School Safety, focusing on the best practices for school building security, active shooter training for schools and practitioner experience with school-based threat assessment in Washington, DC, August 16, 2018. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe proposal limits who must respond to sexual assault complaints: Title IX coordinators at schools or an official authorized to take action. Schools would only be required to respond if the alleged incident occurred on campus or on areas overseen by the school, leaving out, for example, study abroad programs.\n\nKey to the proposed changes are requirements that universities hold live hearings on accusations and allow representatives for the accused and accuser to cross-examine the other party.\n\nThat section of the ruling perfectly matches a ruling this fall in the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In that case, which involved the University of Michigan, the court ruled emphatically that the only way to be fair would be to have both sides face off.\n\n'Students are not DeVos' priority'\n\nMcCaul's comments and feelings were echoed by groups and victims' rights advocates from across the country.\n\n\u201cThis rule abdicates the responsibility to protect every student\u2019s right to safety on campus. It tells academic institutions that they needn\u2019t bother helping to protect students; they won\u2019t be liable,\" said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten in a statement. \"These changes once again demonstrate that students are not DeVos\u2019 priority.\"\n\nThe proposed rules, said Shilpa Phadke, vice president of the Women\u2019s Initiative at the Center for American Progress, favor students accused of sexual misconduct. They will, she said, \"\n\ndissuade students from reporting sexual misconduct.\"\n\nMore: Why sexual assault survivors are fuming over rumored college guidelines by Betsy DeVos\n\nU.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, who chairs the Senate\u2019s education committee, stood by the rules.\n\n\"The Department\u2019s approach seems to balance fairness and support for survivors,\" he said in a statement.\n\nMany of the nation's colleges and universities currently use a model where a single investigator conducts separate interviews of the person making the accusation and then the person accused. The two sides don't have a chance to ask questions unless they appeal a decision.\n\nIn a court case this fall, a University of Michigan student was thrown out of school after being found to have violated the school's sexual misconduct code. He sued, alleging the university did not give him his due process rights.\n\nThe appeals court agreed and was emphatic in writing about what it wanted to see.\n\n\"Due process requires cross-examination in circumstances like these because it is 'the greatest legal engine ever invented' for uncovering the truth,\" the court wrote.\n\n\"Without the back-and-forth of adversarial questioning, the accused cannot probe the witness\u2019 story to test her memory, intelligence, or potential ulterior motives.\"\n\n'Fair' is the essence of American justice, DeVos says\n\nDeVos said her rule changes would make sure the process is fair.\n\n\u201cThroughout this process, my focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cEvery survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.\n\n\u201cWe can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function.\u201d\n\nMore: The conversation that is not happening about campus sexual assault\n\nThe proposed rules would bar the accuser and the accused from directly questioning each other. The back and forth would have to be done through representatives.\n\nBut that raises a whole set of issues, said Karen Truzwoski, a Michigan attorney who is currently representing women in two federal lawsuits against Michigan State University.\n\n\"I support due process for all parties as it's done fairly,\" she said. \"A hearing can be OK if it's done just for fact-finding and not trying to discredit the other side. I just have a problem when you start getting defense attorneys involved. And what if one side can't afford an attorney?\n\n\"It just opens a can of worms, and I don't think anyone has thought through just how big a can it is.\"\n\nMarina Pitofsky of USA TODAY contributed to this report.\n\nFollow David Jesse on Twitter: @reporterdavidj\n\nUSA TODAY\u2019s education coverage is supported by a grant from the nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has no involvement in editorial decision-making.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/department-education-sexual-assault-survivors-betsy-devos/2026026002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "ntrejos", "title": "The best things to do in the world, according to Time Out", "description": "", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/2018/11/16/the-best-things-to-do-in-the-world-according-to-time-out/38542833/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7b6cb7f89bd14dce4baa6b0ca869a1e52c915da1/c=0-0-719-406/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636779618958315201-no.50--VR-Park-image-credit---Fred-Aguirre.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:45:21Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nTime Out has named the 50 best things to do in the world right now.

(Rod Aydelotte/Waco Tribune-Herald via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWACO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Baylor freshman Matthew Mayer scored 18 points and graduate transfer Makai Mason had 11 in his Bears' debut in their 81-54 victory over Nicholls State on Friday.\n\nMark Vital had 11 points, 11 rebounds and five assists for Baylor (3-1), which has won three in a row since being upset by SWAC team Texas Southern in its season opener. King McClure also had 11 points and Tristan Clark scored 10 on 5-of-7 shooting.\n\nMayer said there was a different vibe with Mason playing.\n\n\"Oh, for sure. Makai is a great leader, he really stretches the floor and he does a good job finding everybody,\" Mayer said.\n\n\"Makai makes a huge difference, as we know. Again we'll get better the healthier he gets,\" Baylor coach Scott Drew said. \"He's really a fun player to coach. It's kind of like having a quarterback like Peyton Manning out there. You don't have to call every play. He reads the defense and knows where the ball's got to go, when it's got to go, and he does a great job of making the right decision.\"\n\nBaylor never trailed after Mason's 3-pointer made it 11-9 about 6 1/2 minutes into the game. Mayer and Mason both made three 3-pointers.\n\nMason, the first grad transfer to play for the Bears, missed the first three games because of a sprained right ankle. The 6-foot-1 guard played only one game over the last two seasons at Yale because of left foot issues after scoring 31 points for the Bulldogs in their 79-75 win over Baylor in the 2016 NCAA Tournament opener.\n\n\"It definitely felt good to get the juices flowing again, playing. The ankle was all right,\" Mason said. \"There were some times where it hurt a decent amount, but I was able to get through it. And adrenaline definitely helped.\"\n\nJeremiah Jefferson had 13 points for Nicholls (2-3), which shot only 33 percent (18 of 55) from the field.\n\n\"Obviously, disappointed with our performance today. Look, you've got to give them a lot of credit,\" Nicholls coach Austin Claunch said. \"Baylor was really good today, they made it difficult on us to get ball-reversals and to kind of get any type of flow offensively.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNicholls St.: The Colonels, like Baylor, had only three returning players this season. They also have a first-year head coach in Claunch, an assistant the past two seasons before becoming the youngest Division I coach at age 28. They couldn't build on the momentum of an 83-80 win at Idaho when their grad transfers Jefferson and Gavin Peppers each had 20-point games. Peppers had only two late free throws against Baylor and was 0-of-8 shooting in 28 minutes.\n\nBaylor: Still without 6-7 sophomore Mario Kegler, the transfer from Mississippi State who has two games left to serve on his six-game suspension for violating team rules.

Wheeler was in the audience attending the event when the president made the announcement.\n\n\"Congratulations, Andrew,\" Trump said, as a casual aside during the formal ceremony. \"Great job.\u201d\n\nWheeler, a former EPA bureaucrat, Capitol Hill aide and energy lobbyist known for his low-key manner, was named acting administrator in July after the ouster of his embattled predecessor Scott Pruitt. At the time, Wheeler was Pruitt's deputy.\n\nWheeler, who turns 54 next month, still must be confirmed by the Senate before he can be the EPA's permanent chief. The Senate confirmed him as Pruitt's deputy in April by a 53-45 vote that largely cut along partisan lines.\n\nThough not as controversial or ethically compromised as Pruitt, Wheeler is opposed by a number of environmental groups who sharply criticize the president's aggressive efforts to undo Obama-era rules designed to protect the environment and address climate change.\n\nCritics also have raised questions about whether his past lobbying for clients poses a conflict.\n\n\u201cAs acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler has pushed policies that would damage our health and environment,\" Ana Unruh Cohen, managing director for government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. \"He doesn\u2019t deserve a promotion.\u201d\n\nIndustry advocates praised the move.\n\n\u201cAndrew Wheeler\u2019s background shows that he has the capacity to advance an appropriate balance of energy, environmental and economic considerations in a manner consistent with open administrative process and respect for rule of law,\" said Scott Segal, a lobbyist with Bracewell, which represents energy firms. \"He\u2019s a good pick to lead the Agency.\u201d\n\nMore: Andrew Wheeler is no Scott Pruitt - seven things to know about the acting EPA administrator\n\nMore: Trump administration to freeze Obama-era fuel standards for cars, light trucks\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/trumps-epa-president-name-andrew-wheeler-permanent-chief/2026779002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Maeve McDermott, USA TODAY", "title": "Aerosmith's Joe Perry released from the hospital, is 'home and doing well'", "description": "Joe Perry, 68, \"was released from the hospital and is home and doing well,\" his representative Marcee Rondan told USA TODAY.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/16/aerosmiths-joe-perry-released-hospital-home-and-doing-well/2027044002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6808d7a22114e8037fc7fce2d2c56e679a6cba7/c=0-87-4883-2846/local/-/media/2018/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636699369781897947-DAY001.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:31:14Z", "content": "Joe Perry of Aerosmith gives a wave on NBC's 'Today' show at Rockefeller Center.

(Photo: James Guillory, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBobby Petrino is out at Louisville, Maryland has officially moved on from D.J. Durkin, Kansas will cut ties with David Beaty at the end of the season \u2014 and the heart of coaching-carousel season is right around the corner.\n\nSo as the final weeks of the 2018 college football season wind down, let's take a look at what it would cost to fire Football Bowl Subdivision coaches on the proverbial hot seat without cause at the end of the season, and whether their contracts would require them to look for a comparable new job and/or offset those buyout payments with future income.\n\n(Note: All buyout figures are calculated as of the arbitrary date of Dec. 1.)\n\nLarry Fedora, North Carolina\n\nBuyout: $12.2 million\n\nMitigation/offset: There would be offset, but no specified obligation to mitigate\n\nThe Tar Heels are a putrid 1-8, and they've been trending downward for three years now after going 11-3 in 2015. But Fedora's buyout, which ranks 25th in the USA TODAY Sports coaches compensation database, could be prohibitive. In terms of mitigation, Fedora's contract does not say that he has an obligation to seek another job, but if he gets one as a coach or TV commentator, the amount that North Carolina owes him each year would be reduced by the amount of his compensation in the new job.\n\nClay Helton, USC\n\nBuyout: Unknown\n\nMitigation/offset: Unknown\n\nUSC is not required to disclose the details of Helton's contract because it is a private university, but USA Today's Dan Wolken reported last week that it is believed to be north of $15 million. That figure, and the Trojans' 21 combined wins over the past two seasons under Helton, could help the 46-year-old stick around for another year despite a lackluster showing this season, albeit with a true freshman at quarterback.\n\nPaul Johnson, Georgia Tech\n\nBuyout: $4 million\n\nMitigation/offset: Not addressed\n\nAfter a rocky start to 2018, Georgia Tech has won five of six and reached bowl eligibility for the ninth time in Johnson's 11 seasons with the school. And though his buyout is relatively affordable at $4 million, it decreases by $1 million at the conclusion of every season, perhaps giving the school incentive to retain him for another year.\n\nKliff Kingsbury, Texas Tech\n\nBuyout: $4.2 million\n\nMitigation/offset: None\n\nThe Red Raiders have gone 35-38 in five-plus seasons under Kingsbury, and they've once again found themselves hovering around .500 this year. With Kingsbury's buyout now down to a reasonable $4.2 million, will Texas Tech's leadership decide it's time for a change?\n\nMike MacIntyre, Colorado\n\nBuyout: $10.3 million\n\nMitigation/offset: Both\n\nA Denver TV station reported earlier this week that MacIntyre will be out at the end of the season, though athletic director Rick George later said that he has yet to make any decisions. If MacIntyre is forced out, however, his departure would trigger a buyout north of $10.3 million \u2014 a significant sum for a school like Colorado that, despite growing athletic department revenues, has never exactly been flush with cash.\n\nScottie Montgomery, East Carolina\n\nBuyout: $866,667\n\nMitigation/offset: Both\n\nThe Pirates have been floundering since they decided to fire Ruffin McNeil in 2015. They've won just eight games in two-plus seasons under Montgomery, and two of their three American Athletic Conference wins during that span have come against fellow bottom-feeder UConn. That said, Montgomery's future is unclear largely because ECU doesn't currently have an athletic director after Jeff Compher left in May. East Carolina chancellor Cecil Staton said in a statement Wednesday that Montgomery's fate won't be decided until after the season.\n\nMike Sanford Jr., Western Kentucky\n\nBuyout: $1.2 million\n\nMitigation/offset: Not addressed\n\nA Sept. 8 loss to Football Championship Subdivision school Maine was probably the low point in a 1-9 season for Sanford, who finds himself on the hot seat less than two years after being hired as Jeff Brohm's replacement. His $1.2-million buyout, which would be paid out over 18 months, might not seem extravagant, but it would be another strain on a cash-strapped athletic department; WBKO-TV reported in April that the Hilltoppers' athletic department has an annual operating budget of just $23 million.\n\nFollow Steve Berkowitz on Twitter @ByBerkowitz.

(AP) \u2014 No. 7 West Virginia hopes for a spot in the Big 12 Championship game and possibly a berth in the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe next challenge for the Mountaineers (8-1, 6-1 Big 12, No. 9 CFP) comes Saturday when they visit Oklahoma State (5-5, 2-5), which is coming off a 48-47 loss at No. 6 Oklahoma last week.\n\nOklahoma State has endured a disappointing and inconsistent season, with big wins over quality opponents (Boise State, Texas) and puzzling losses to other teams (Texas Tech, Kansas State, Baylor).\n\nWest Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen is focused on this game, not their big showdown against Oklahoma next week.\n\n\"It's a big Big 12 game,\" Holgorsen said. \"It doesn't get any better than this, so we need to get out there, travel the right way and be ready for a hostile environment, and handle it the way we know we can if we want to continue to win to remain in the conversation. This is a huge hurdle.\n\n\"It's parity in college football, and you better have your stuff together every week or you're going to get beat. We won't look past this group, I can assure you that. I don't care what their record is.\"\n\nThe Cowboys, still seeking bowl eligibility for the 13th consecutive season, know they have another difficult task ahead.\n\n\"A lot of similarities to the game we just played,\" said OSU coach Mike Gundy of West Virginia. \"We'll certainly have our hands full with these guys. We'll get some good plans together and go play hard Saturday afternoon.\"\n\nFive things to watch on Saturday:\n\nTOP RECEIVERS: There will be two top candidates for the Biletnikoff Award, honoring the nation's top receiver, playing in the game. Oklahoma State sophomore Tylan Wallace and West Virginia senior David Sills V were both named among the 11 semifinalists for the prestigious award this week. Wallace ranks third in the nation with 1,282 receiving yards on 68 receptions, along with nine touchdowns, while Sills has 49 receptions for 687 yards and 12 touchdowns, although he has played one fewer game. The award's three finalists will be announced Monday and the winner on Dec. 6.\n\nCORN DOG RISING: Oklahoma State fifth-year senior quarterback Taylor Cornelius, who spent the previous two seasons as Mason Rudolph's primary backup, has progressed this season. He had a solid performance last week against Oklahoma, completed 34 of 53 passes for 501 yards and three touchdowns. He ranks sixth in the nation in passing yards, with 3,123. \"He just keeps on getting better and better from experience,\" Gundy said. \"He's paid his dues and he has worked hard and it's awesome for him that we were here to stick with him and believe in him. The guy is a competitor, he is tough.\"\n\nPASS RUSH, Part 1: West Virginia junior linebacker David Long Jr. has enjoyed an outstanding season, helping the Mountaineers rank fourth in the nation in tackles for loss (8.6 per game). His individual total of 17.5 tackles for loss (1.9 per game) leads the Big 12 and is second in the country, while his eight sacks is tied for 19th overall.

(Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court agreed Friday to weigh in on the dispute over the Trump administration's plan to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census.\n\nThe issue that will come before the justices in February is what evidence can be considered in a challenge mounted by state and local governments and immigrant rights groups. They want to expose the decision-making process, while the administration has argued that's irrelevant.\n\nThe court's decisions on the matter could affect the political and financial clout of immigrant communities for the next decade. What's at stake is an accurate count of immigrants in the Census, including non-citizens. Challengers fear a citizenship question could prompt many to avoid being counted.\n\nThat, in turn, could cause parts of the country with large percentages of immigrants \u2013 mostly in states dominated by Democrats \u2013 to be undercounted. That could result in a loss of federal funds and, potentially, seats in Congress.\n\nThe overall battle is not what will come before the Supreme Court at oral argument Feb. 19. Instead, the justices only agreed to hear the dispute over what evidence can be considered.\n\nThe justices already had refused the Trump administration's request to delay an ongoing federal court trial in New York over the Commerce Department plan. The high court's decision to take on the dispute could delay a ruling in that case.\n\nThe court had given both sides a partial victory earlier, when it said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross did not have to give a deposition concerning his decision-making process before the trial, but other federal officials could be questioned out of court.\n\nRoss announced the addition of the citizenship question in March, but it has been tied up in court ever since. The government has not asked about individuals' citizenship on the Census since 1950.\n\nOpponents, including California, New York, the American Civil Liberties Union and immigration rights groups, contend fears of deportation among undocumented immigrants will cause them to be undercounted.\n\nThat could have two detrimental effects in immigrant communities. Areas with large immigrant populations, which tend to be urban and vote Democratic, could lose seats in the House of Representatives. They also could lose federal, state and local funds used for public works and social service projects.\n\nRoss initially said the Justice Department wanted to reinstate the citizenship question as a means of enforcing the Voting Rights Act. It was later revealed that he made the decision himself and asked Justice Department officials to back him up, despite their reluctance.\n\nThe government recently acknowledged in court papers \"for the sake of completeness\" that Ross discussed the plan with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a leading proponent of crackdowns on alleged voter fraud.\n\nMore: Supreme Court still divided along ideological lines on illegal immigration\n\nMore: President Trump says he plans to end birthright citizenship with an executive order\n\nMore: ACLU goes to court to challenge Trump\u2019s new asylum ban\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/census-2020-supreme-court-hear-case-adding-citizenship-question/2026725002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Charles Curtis", "title": "A Charlotte meteorologist is embracing Cam Newton's famous fashion sense and dressing like him", "description": "Meet Nick Kosir, who keeps dressing exactly like the Panthers QB.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/carolina-panthers-cam-newton-fashion-meteorologist-nick-kosir-dress-like-photos", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ap-buccaneers-panthers-football.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:21:53Z", "content": "You may not know the name Nick Kosir until now, but Cam Newton does.

He's likely to face some resentment from locals for blaming the inferno on poor forest management in California.\n\nIn an interview taped Friday and scheduled for broadcast on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump said he was surprised to see images of firefighters removing dried brush near a fire, adding, \u201cThis should have been all raked out.\u201d\n\nA list of those still missing \u2014 who may not have escaped the fire's deadly wrath \u2014 has grown to over 1,000 people. Officials caution, however, that it likely includes people who simply have not checked in with authorities.\n\nButte CountySheriff Kory Honea said the list was dynamic and could easily contain duplicate names and unreliable spellings of names.\n\nHe said the roster probably includes some who fled the blaze and do not realize they\u2019ve been reported missing.\n\nSome on the list have been confirmed as dead by family and friends on social media. Others have been located and are safe, but authorities haven\u2019t gotten around to marking them as found.\n\nIn last year\u2019s catastrophic wildfires in California wine country, Sonoma County authorities at one point listed more than 2,000 people as missing. But they slowly whittled down the number. In the end, 44 people died in several counties.\n\nTeams of coroner's experts, anthropologists and others are needed to tell the difference between human remains and animal remains, Honea said.\n\nOf the eight new sets of human remains found Friday, seven were found in Paradise, California, all inside buildings. Another was found in a structure in a nearby community.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which began Nov. 8 and incinerated the retirement community of Paradise, forced the evacuation of more than 50,000 people and has destroyed nearly 12,000 structures, including 9,700 single-family homes.\n\nStill a raging inferno, the fire is 45 percent contained, growing overnight by 1,000 acres, according to CalFire.\n\nFirefighters said it was not expected to be fully contained until Nov. 30.\n\nForecasters, however, predicted a break in the weather next week that could speed up the schedule, although rain could also complicate the efforts of dozens of teams who are sifting through ash and debris, looking for human remains.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Friday that the area around the town of Paradise is expected to get rain starting Tuesday night of Wednesday and continue at least through Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Camp fire, which broke out in Butte County, continues to threaten 15,500 structures.

I don\u2019t talk about politics at all anymore. There's no way in this culture to have any kind of nuanced conversation in any way, shape or form. You have to either be for something or against something. You can't say, \"Well, I like this, I don't like this and I definitely don't like that.\" It gets turned upside down and turned into a meme. I refuse to be anybody\u2019s meme-bait. If they want to take pictures of me at Disneyland and make me a meme, that\u2019s fine. But the rest of it, I'm no longer a willing participant in the culture war.\n\nMore: Rap overtakes rock as the most popular genre among music fans. Here's why.\n\nQ: Last year was the first year that R&B/hip-hop overtook rock as the most popular genre, in terms of pure consumption (album sales, song downloads and streams). Why do you think rock has fallen out of vogue?\n\nCorgan: I don't know. I make rock 'n' roll music in its various forms, and when I do it well, people like it. I see those (statistics) and can appreciate them, but then we go to New York and sell out Madison Square Garden or play two dates at The Forum in LA. So it\u2019s hard to tell me that rock 'n' roll is dead. And certainly, rock 'n' roll has withstood other challenges at other times.\n\nI mean, back to me being a free-market libertarian capitalist, may the best music win. The public is going to go after that which they're attracted to. I don't have a problem with that. I can have a personal opinion without necessarily negating that people are going to like what they\u2019re going to like.\n\nQ: Imagine Dragons is considered the most popular rock band right now. Have you listened to their music?\n\nCorgan: I don't comment on any artist. There's no way to say anything about anybody. And I\u2019m going to play victim for five seconds: I didn\u2019t create this culture. I contributed to it, but this is somebody else's Frankenstein, and they can live in it. I don\u2019t participate. You can all argue about who\u2019s great and who\u2019s not great. I\u2019ve said so many complimentary things about artists through the years that never gets quoted.\n\nI got in this stupid thing this year with Smash Mouth because I mentioned on Instagram that at one point, we were up for the first \"Shrek\" movie (soundtrack) and then DreamWorks replaced (us) with Smash Mouth. Which was fine, that\u2019s Hollywood. Somehow the Smash Mouth guys got all bent out of shape, and I was in a meme war with guys I used to hang out with who had heard the story from me personally 15 years ago. It turned into this thing where I\u2019m a bad guy because I brought up a historical fact.\n\nThis culture is so beyond me in its level of stupidity. It weaponizes something as stupid as a historical fact into a gossipy, TMZ moment \u2013 which by the way, doesn't sell anything other than clicks.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Astros assistant general manager Mike Elias was hired Friday to rebuild the Baltimore Orioles, who traded many of their star players last season before finishing with the worst record in the majors.\n\nElias will carry the title of executive vice president and general manager. He will \"oversee all baseball operations for the club and have full autonomy to build his staff and make decisions on all baseball matters,\" the Orioles said in a statement.\n\nElias will be introduced at a news conference in Baltimore on Monday.\n\nThe 35-year-old Elias comes to the Orioles after working as scouting director and assistant GM in Houston, where he helped transform a last-place team into 2017 World Series champions.\n\nElias replaces executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette, who was fired with manager Buck Showalter in October after Baltimore's dreadful 47-115 season.\n\nOne of Elias' first tasks will be to find a new manager. He can then turn his attention toward reconstructing a team that was overhauled at the midpoint of the worst season since the Orioles arrived in Baltimore in 1954.\n\nIn July, Duquette traded Manny Machado, Zach Britton, Jonathan Schoop, Kevin Gausman, Darren O'Day and Brad Brach for 15 minor league prospects and International signing bonus slot money.\n\nA team-record 15 players made their major league debut with the Orioles in 2018, one reason why Baltimore finished 61 games behind World Series champion Boston in the AL East.\n\nThe Orioles' 115 defeats were most in franchise history, surpassing the 111 losses by the 1939 St. Louis Browns. Baltimore's previous worst season was in 1988, when the team went 54-107 following a 0-21 start.\n\nElias served as a scout with the St. Louis Cardinals before being hired in 2012 by Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow. Throughout his seven years in Houston, he helped shape an Astros roster that produced successive 100-win seasons and three playoff appearances in the last four years, one of which ended with a World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nDuring his stint in Houston, the team had the top pick in the draft three times. Elias received much of the credit for Houston's No. 1 overall selection of Carlos Correa in the 2012 draft. He'll likely have the last word when the Orioles use the No. 1 overall pick in next year's draft.\n\nA 2006 graduate of Yale, Elias was a four-time letter winner as a left-handed pitcher for the Bulldogs.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/apf-Baseball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That loss sent the Broncos into a tailspin and a 0-4 start. It also propelled the Chargers to a great start, one that made them strong contenders in the AFC.\n\nThe Chargers were expected to get their seventh win of the 1994 season on that October day at Jack Murphy Stadium, but they got the Broncos\u2019 best punch.\n\nEach team turned the ball over three times, and the Chargers gained more total yards than Denver. The difference in the game was the fact that the Broncos forced the Chargers to kick field goals. John Carney kicked five of them for the Bolts in that contest, and that accounted for all of their scoring.\n\nThe key play in the game came in the third quarter. Facing a 3rd-and-5 from the Chargers\u2019 43-yard line and trailing 12-7, John Elway hit Shannon Sharpe over the middle for a 43-yard touchdown.\n\nLate in the game, the Chargers mounted a late drive and needed a touchdown to win. But quarterback Stan Humphries, who had thrown three interceptions on the day, was knocked out of the game with an injury. Backup Gale Gilbert stepped in, and although the Chargers drove the ball to the Denver 31-yard line, they ended up turning it over on downs.\n\nElway came back onto the field for the kneeldown, and the Broncos shocked the Chargers, handing them their first loss of the season, 20-15.\n\nOf course, the Chargers would go on to win the AFC West while the Broncos finished the season at 7-9. San Diego then took care of business in the postseason, reaching the Super Bowl before losing to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nCould this year\u2019s Chargers ultimately play in the big game this season? It\u2019s certainly possible. But so is a Broncos upset victory this Sunday."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Opinion contributor, Robert L.

(Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/epa-EFE)\n\nThe facts are clear: No president has done more in two years to strengthen our military and reform the Department of Veterans Affairs to better serve our nation\u2019s heroes than President Donald Trump.\n\nFrom pushing the Islamic State terrorist organization to the brink of defeat, to increasing troop strength and modernizing our military\u2019s equipment on the battlefield, Trump sends a strong signal to any country or terrorist group that confronting the United States or our allies is a losing proposition.\n\nUntil Trump, no candidate in history had made serving our veterans the centerpiece of a presidential campaign. In office, Trump has kept his promise, improving the lives of America\u2019s veterans through a number of key initiatives that enact more reform across the organization than at any other time in decades.\n\nThese impactful reforms include the MISSION Act, which provides real health care choice to eligible veterans, and the Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which makes VA one of the most accountable agencies in the federal government.\n\nOUR VIEW: How Trump can make it up to the military and 'the vets' for recent fails\n\nTrump has also done more in less than two years to improve transparency for veterans than any of his predecessors. In contrast to every other health system in the nation, VA now posts wait times online for every VA medical center across the country, and it updates them on a weekly basis. The agency is also the first hospital system in the nation to post online its opioid prescription rates, accountability and settlement information, and chief executive travel.\n\nUnder Trump, VA is also adopting a joint electronic health record system that aligns with the one used by the Department of Defense. This transition will result in all Defense and VA patient data residing in one common system, better integrating information across components and enabling seamless care as those who fight for our country\u2019s freedoms transition back into civilian life.\n\nMake no mistake: President Trump has kept his promises to keep our country safe, revitalize our military, and reform VA. Not since President Lincoln has another president done more to \u201ccare for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan,\u201d just as our nation deserves.\n\nRobert L.

He can throw,\" defensive end Charles Omenihu said. \"He's 5-0.\"\n\nPurdy sure has been pretty running the No. 18 Cyclones offense since taking it over mid-season. The Cyclones (6-3, 5-2, No. 16 CFP) are tied for second in the Big 12 with a critical matchup at No. 13 Texas (7-3, 5-2, No. 15 CFP) Saturday night that both teams need to win if they hope to slide into the league championship game.\n\nIowa State had to dig out of an early 1-3 hole to get into the Big 12 title chase and set up arguably the program's biggest November game since the early 2000s. Purdy has led the way.\n\nPlaying in front of 100,000 at Texas would seem unlikely to faze a young quarterback who has already out-gunned West Virginia's Will Grier at home and won at rowdy Oklahoma State when coach Matt Campbell gave the offense to a quarterback who had just two snaps of experience.\n\n\"He's got a ton of moxie,\" Herman said. \"It doesn't matter the opponent, the atmosphere, the stadium. He's got that 'it' factor.\"\n\nWin Saturday and the Cyclones still need help to get to the conference championship game. But they'd be in the conversation in late November, a rarity in Ames, Iowa, and something that looked out of reach after the bad start.\n\n\"Everything was at stake when we were 1-3, and it's been that way every single week since then,\" Campbell said. \"It's just a whole different type of adversity now. It's the adversity of success, which is sometimes a lot harder to deal with.\"\n\nThe Longhorns are fighting for their own title chances. Texas was in first place in the Big 12 less than a month ago before two straight losses. Quarterback Sam Ehlinger and the Longhorns turned that around with a last-minute win at Texas Tech last week.\n\nThe contest on Saturday night will be the final home game for a Texas senior class that hasn't won a Big 12 title or more than seven games in a season since they arrived on campus. Texas has lost its final home game each of the last four seasons.\n\n\"I owe everything to these seniors,\" said Texas sophomore quarterback Sam Ehlinger. \"They have been through so much in this program.\"\n\nSome things to watch for when Iowa State and Texas play on Saturday night.\n\nPASS PROTECTION: Ehlinger was sacked a season-high five times last week against Texas Tech as a line that's been solid all season struggled with blitz protection. Purdy, while mobile, won't have junior running back David Montgomery for the first half either as a relief valve or in pass protection. Montgomery has to sit out because he swung a punch at a Baylor player last week.\n\nMINUS MONTGOMERY: Campbell didn't appeal to the Big 12 to let Montgomery play in the first half and will likely turn to a committee of players to replace him. Kene Nwangwu, Johnnie Lang and Sheldon Croney average just 3.1 yards per carry in 69 attempts this year. Lang scored last week against Baylor after Montgomery was ejected.\n\nBIG PLAYER RECEIVERS: Both teams have big receivers who make big plays. Iowa State's Hakeem Butler is 6-foot-5 and leads the nation with 22.7 yards a catch and has eight grabs of 40 yards or longer. Texas has twin towers on the outside in 6-5 Lil'Jordan Humphrey and 6-6 Colin Johnson. Humphrey and Johnson have combined for 113 catches and 1,622 yards with 12 touchdowns.\n\nACHING SECONDARY: The Texas secondary has been shredded in recent weeks by the Big 12's best offenses. Injuries have played a role. Freshman safety Caden Sterns was in concussion protocol part of the week. The Longhorns are hoping safety Brandon Jones can return after two weeks out with an ankle injury.\n\nWHERE TO WATCH: The late-season matchup between ranked teams with Big 12 title implications can only be found on the Longhorn Network, the network partnership between Texas and ESPN. For Iowa State fans in particular, that will mean searching for LHN on area cable and national satellite providers or streaming services . The broadcast contract between the networks and the Big 12 allow Texas to have one league game on LHN per season. Both schools must agree, and Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte said he and Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard decided during the summer to have the game on LHN.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Joel Martinez/The Monitor via AP)\n\nDuring his campaign and since his election, President Donald Trump has cast himself as an unwavering champion of the military and \"the vets.\"\n\nBased on some of his recent actions, he sure has a funny way of showing it:\n\n\u25baLast Saturday, Trump skipped a visit to a cemetery outside Paris to honor slain U.S. soldiers and Marines on the centennial of World War I. Other international leaders, Trump's chief of staff and the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff managed to make the rainy day journey.\n\n\u25baAfter returning home, the president also declined to visit Arlington National Cemetery on the Veterans Day federal holiday.\n\n\u25baThe commander in chief deployed service members as political pawns, taking 5,800 troops away from their families during the holidays and sending them to the U.S.-Mexico border before the midterm elections while railing about immigrant caravans \"invading\" the United States.\n\n\u25baTrump urged that winners be declared in the close races for governor and Senate in Florida before all the ballots from troops serving overseas were counted.\n\n\u25baIn nearly two years in office, the commander in chief has never traveled into a war zone to spend time with deployed troops, something his predecessors did in every major conflict and incursion dating to World War II.\n\nVA SECRETARY: President Trump has kept his promises\n\nIt's one thing for the president to commit, as duties require, to appropriate care and treatment of veterans. \"Fact is, I've done a lot,\" Trump boasted Thursday about the VA, in damage-control mode after the Paris controversy.\n\nWhich misses the point. As head of the executive branch of government, it is Trump's job to ensure competent management of that and other Cabinet positions. It's also part of the job description to honor those in uniform, even if you don't feel like it on a given day \u2014 to show appreciation and devotion to military men and women who are willing to make, and who have made, the ultimate sacrifice for country.\n\nGranted, empathy isn't Trump's strong suit. In the book \"Fear,\" about the Trump presidency, author Bob Woodward writes that a few weeks after the inaugural, the president made an effort, in an unannounced trip to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, to comfort the family of a Navy SEAL killed during an operation in Yemen. The experience rattled the new commander in chief, and he vowed not to go back to Dover.\n\nif consoling military families is too distressing, here's an uplifting alternative: Make a surprise visit on Thanksgiving or Christmas to the U.S. service members at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.\n\nToo far from Mar-a-Lago? Then drop in on Base Camp Donna in south Texas, where soldiers mark time putting up concertina wire along the border. They'd also appreciate being served turkey by the commander in chief on another holiday away from home.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Gonzalez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 For all the hype that surrounded No. 17 Washington before the year began and the disappointment of being out of the College Football Playoff conversation by midseason, the Huskies still have a legitimate shot at a more than acceptable consolation prize.\n\nThe Rose Bowl still carries significant meaning in these parts. And with two more victories \u2014 beginning Saturday against Oregon State \u2014 the Huskies would find themselves in the Pac-12 title game playing for a chance to go to Pasadena as the conference champion.\n\nThat sounds straightforward but navigating the next few weeks won't be easy. Facing the Beavers would seem the easiest of Washington's three tasks. That's followed by a showdown against No. 8 Washington State in the Apple Cup on Nov. 23 to likely decide the Pac-12 North title. And if the Huskies win both, they'd still have to get past the Pac-12 South champ in the conference title game on Nov. 30.\n\nWhile the quest for a division title will take priority, Saturday is also a chance for Washington (7-3, 5-2 Pac-12) to say farewell to two of its most successful seniors in their final home game: quarterback Jake Browning and running back Myles Gaskin.\n\nBrowning is the school's all-time leader in yards passing, touchdowns, pass efficiency, and has won 36 of the 49 games he's started despite facing criticism from fans who have expected more. Gaskin appears recovered from a shoulder injury that kept him out of games earlier in the season and needs 271 yards the rest of the way to become the ninth player in FBS history to have four 1,000-yard seasons in their career, according to the school.\n\nThey're two of the most important players to have come through Washington during coach Chris Petersen's tenure, part of a highly successful senior class.\n\n\"I hope that they are really focused on the game and not too wrapped up in the last one at Husky Stadium, because we have a lot more ball to play and practice here,\" Petersen said.\n\nOregon State (2-8, 1-6) has enjoyed few highlights most of the season \u2014 its comeback win over Colorado the lone exception \u2014 but may be in position to give the Huskies headaches thanks to familiarity. The matchup will be a return to Seattle for head coach Jonathan Smith after spending the previous four seasons as Washington's offensive coordinator.\n\n\"I have some fond memories of that place,\" Smith said. \"It's a great place to play a football game. Our kids will be excited to play there. We have some kids from that area who are looking forward to playing back home.\"\n\nHere's what else to know about the 102nd all-time meeting:\n\nSUPER FRESHMAN: One of the few upsides in Oregon State's season has been the debut of freshman running back Jermar Jefferson. He needs just 53 yards rushing to topple Jacquizz Rodgers' freshman record at Oregon State. Rodgers rushed for 1,253 yards in 2008; Jefferson has 1,201. Jefferson is the eighth player in school history to top 1,000 yards, but just the second freshman. Jefferson hasn't scored a rushing touchdown since Oct. 6 when he had four TDs in a loss to Washington State.\n\nTACKLE MACHINE: Because of the Huskies' bye last week, linebacker Ben Burr-Kirven lost his spot as the top tackler in the country. He's now third with 134 tackles on the season but should have plenty of chances to regain the top spot and finish the season as the national leader with the Huskies likely to have three and possibly four more games. Burr-Kirven is averaging more than 13 tackles per game.\n\nRUN AWAY: Oregon State's defense has been mostly forgettable this season. The Beavers are giving up 542.8 yards per game, ranking next to last in the country. Of that number, 271 yards per game are coming on the ground. Every team they've faced this season has rushed for at least 100 yards against the Beavers, even pass-happy Washington State. That's not good when facing Gaskin and the rest of Washington's talented backfield.\n\nGETTING HEALTHY: The one upside to Washington's late bye week is the chance to have a mostly healthy roster for the final stretch. The Huskies could see the play time of tight end Hunter Bryant increase and there's a chance left tackle Trey Adams could return for the final few games and not jeopardize his intent to return for a fifth-year in 2019. Adams has missed the entire season with a back injury.\n\nWashington may also get cornerback Jordan Miller back after missing the past two games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nMacBooks are great for all sorts of reasons, but they tend to be pricey. We're here to help: In addition to scouring the Internet for the best Black Friday deals available right now, we have been specifically on the hunt for great deals on Apple's laptops, from the MacBook Pro, to the Air, to the svelte 12-inch MacBook.\n\nThe Best Black Friday 2018 MacBook deals available now:\n\nMacBook Air 11-inch (4GB RAM + 128GB SSD)\u2014$809.99 at Amazon (Save $89.01): If you\u2019re in the market for a stylish laptop to browse the web on, the MacBook Air 11-inch model is a great option. Not only is the display bright and colorful, it\u2019s plenty fast for basic tasks like checking e-mail and watching Netflix. According to reviews on Amazon, battery life is pretty good too, so you should get quite a bit of juice out of it on a single charge. Plus, at just a little over two pounds, it\u2019s really compact and portable, making it the perfect travel companion. MacBook Air 13-inch (8GB RAM + Bluetooth 4.0 Thunderbolt 2)\u2014$888 at Amazon: If you\u2019re on a tight budget, the MacBook Air 13-inch is a good value purchase. It\u2019s zippy enough to handle multiple open tabs and battery life is long. What we really like best about this machine are its USB-A ports. This is nice because you don\u2019t have to carry a bunch of dongles with you. With USB-C reigning supreme, legacy ports are less common these days.The only con is that it\u2019s heavier than other MacBooks, so it doesn\u2019t make the best travel companion. MacBook 12-inch (256GB SSD + Retina display)\u2014$1,052.16 at Amazon (Save $246.84): The MacBook 12-inch is great for bouncing around the Internet on. With its 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, you can expect programs like Excel and Microsoft Word to open up quickly. The only drawback is that the underside gets hot with moderate use, so you may want to keep it on a table. Nitpick aside, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable laptop to surf the web on, you\u2019ll definitely want to check this one out. MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar (8GB RAM + Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics)\u2014$1,399 at B&H (Save $400): The MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar is an excellent machine for the home or office. It should last you a full work day on a single charge and the upward-facing speakers produce excellent sound. That said, it\u2019s a bit more than what the average user might need. While the Touch Bar (the touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard) may offer some intuitive shortcuts, it might be a nuisance to the everyday user, as you have to keep looking down from the screen to use it and it costs extra. MacBook Pro 15-inch with Touch Bar (16GB RAM + Retina Display)\u2014$2,149 at B&H (Save $650): If it\u2019s power you\u2019re after, the MacBook Pro 15-inch with Touch Bar should fit the bill. Between the 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, you can expect incredibly speedy performance. I mean, it\u2019s powerful enough to handle demanding editing software like GIMP. The 2880 x 1800 Retina display is great for editing photos and videos on, too, as it produces ultra crisp images and vivid colors. While we have mixed feelings about the Touch Bar (the touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard), it makes logging in with your finger super easy.\n\nWhile we believe the above deals are awesome, many other retailers are offering pretty good deals as well. Along with a few Windows laptops and Chromebooks (MacBooks too!), here are some other deals worth checking out:\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

Trump told reporters Friday he answered the questions \"very easily\" but added, \"you have to always be careful.\" (Nov. 16) AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Friday he has answered questions from special counsel Robert Mueller, but has not yet submitted them to prosecutors who are are investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nTrump did not detail the questions or his answers, but again denied any kind of collusion with Russians who sought to influence the presidential election in his favor.\n\nTrump also denied seeking to obstruct Mueller's investigation, even as he continued to attack the basis for it. The president said he answered Mueller's questions carefully because he feared they might have been \"tricked up\" by prosecutors in an effort to get him to commit perjury.\n\n\"So you have to always be careful when you answer questions with people that probably have bad intentions,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I haven't submitted them yet ... I just finished them,\" Trump said, noting that he is coming off a congressional election campaign and a trip to France in recent weeks. \"As you know, I've been a little bit busy.\"\n\nThe president took questions from the media after signing a bill designed to improve the nation's cybersecurity.\n\nTrump again ripped the Mueller investigation as a \u201choax,\u201d but predicted he would be vindicated soon.\n\n\"From what I hear, it's ending, and I'm sure it'll be just fine,\" Trump said. \"And you know why it's going to be just fine? Because there was no collusion.\"\n\nHe did not disclose how he might know of Mueller's plans.\n\nTrump's disclosure marked the latest turn in negotiations that stretch back to late last year, when Mueller's office began seeking testimony from the president.\n\nWhile Trump has refused to sit down with prosecutors for a face-to-face interview, he and his lawyers have worked in recent weeks on written responses to investigators' inquiries.\n\nMueller's office is investigating how Russia sought to influence the 2016 election by hacking Democrats' emails \u2013 and releasing them to the public \u2013 and by pushing negative fake news about Trump opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nProsecutors are also looking into whether Trump sought to obstruct the investigation in various ways, including the 2017 dismissal of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhite House officials, various lawyers, and numerous journalists have spent weeks speculating on Mueller's next move, and whether it will be more indictments or a report on his findings.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump unleashed another tweet storm on the Mueller operation, saying that \"the inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess\" and prosecutors \"don't care how many lives\" are ruined.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said he was \"not agitated\" with Mueller, but his investigation is a \"hoax.\"\n\n\"There should have never been any Mueller investigation because there was never anything done wrong,\" he said. \"They've wasted millions and millions of dollars.\"\n\nLawmakers have accused Trump of seeking to undermine the Mueller investigation by poisoning public opinion. They also cited Trump's recent naming of Acting Attorney Matthew Whitaker, who has also publicly criticized the probe and suggested de-funding it.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-California, who is expected to chair the House Intelligence Committee after the Democrats take control of the House next year, said this week on Twitter: \"We will do everything in our power to protect the Mueller investigation, the independence of the Department of Justice, and the rule of law.\"\n\nIn again attacking the Mueller investigation, Trump said he has defended himself aggressively, and will continue to do so.\n\n\"I like to take everything personally, because you do better that way.\"\n\nClaiming, without evidence, that Mueller's team might want to set a perjury trap for him, Trump used weather as an example. \"'Gee, you know, was the weather sunny or was it rainy?'\" Trump said. \"He said it may have been a good day. It was rainy. Therefore he told a lie. He perjured himself, OK?\"\n\nTrump again accused the Democrats and Clinton of exaggerating Russian hacking to explain away their defeat. \"The fact is I was a much better candidate than Hillary Clinton,\" he said. \"I went to the right states; she went to the wrong states.\"\n\nIn denying collusion or obstruction, Trump repeatedly insisted he did the answers himself.\n\n\"They were my answers,\" Trump said. \"I don't need lawyers to do that.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/donald-trump-says-he-has-answered-mueller-questions-hasnt-submitted/2025604002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Boilermakers, Badgers hope to rebound following losses", "description": "Purdue coach Jeff Brohm has marveled at David Blough's resilience", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/16/boilermakers-badgers-hope-to-rebound-following-losses/38544975/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89b177ce7e8c96426469e3df5b3ca1ede8a88a89/c=0-256-5157-3157/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/cdbe055c0a704ee6b53309b0b669ee15.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:49:51Z", "content": "FILE - In this Sept. 2, 2017 file photo, Purdue head coach Jeff Brohm watches from the sideline during the first half of an NCAA college football game in Indianapolis.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPurdue coach Jeff Brohm has marveled at David Blough's resilience.\n\nDuring his first two seasons in West Lafayette, Brohm watched his quarterback rebound from frustrating performances, demoralizing injuries and the loss of his starting job. Blough's steady demeanor and inspirational words found a perfect home in the Boilermakers' locker room, serving as a model of how leaders respond to adversity.\n\nNow with Blough's final game at Ross-Ade Stadium nearing, the Boilermakers need Blough to deliver a fitting finale to his comeback career Saturday against Wisconsin.\n\n\"He's fought and bled and sweat and teared up for this team and put his body on the line,\" Brohm said. \"He came back this year to try to help us win and he's done a great job. I think this moment will be special for him. I want him to enjoy the moment with his family and friends, and he's earned every right to do that.\"\n\nBlough may not be remembered for the stats or successes of other prized pupils from the Cradle of Quarterbacks.\n\nMake no mistake, though, his legacy is every bit as strong as those who went before him \u2014 from Len Dawson and Bob Griese to Jim Everett and Drew Brees.\n\nBlough, a fifth-year senior, helped engineer one of the school's greatest one-season turnarounds last year and led Purdue from a 0-3 start to the precipice of bowl-eligibility this season. He delivered a signature win over then No. 2 Ohio State before playing equally well in an upset of No. 19 Iowa.\n\nThere's also the image of Blough cheering his teammates as he was loaded into an ambulance last November after dislocating his right ankle.\n\nBut if Blough overcomes last week's struggles and leads Purdue (5-5, 4-3 Big Ten) to a bowl-qualifying victory this weekend, amid the rumors about Brohm's future plans, it could be Blough's crowning achievement.\n\nThe Badgers (6-4, 4-3) understand.\n\n\"You've had a chance to watch him in a number of different games and it looks to me like he's got a great feel of what they're trying to do. He has an understanding of the players around him,\" Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst said. \"I love the way he competes.\"\n\nSo does Brohm.\n\n\"He's very smart. He takes a lot of pride in doing the right thing, and he's been nothing but a perfect example of a student-athlete for us,\" Brohm said. \"I think the sky's the limit whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nANOTHER FAREWELL?\n\nBlough is one of 29 seniors playing saying goodbye to the home fans Saturday.\n\nThe question all week has been whether Brohm could leave town after Louisville fired coach Bobby Petrino on Sunday. The rumors were in full force all week as Brohm attempted to downplay the questions.\n\n\"I think it's important for me \u2014 and our team \u2014 to worry about improving, getting better, and attacking the next opponent,\" Brohm said. \"That's where we're going to completely focus on.\"\n\nBIG CHANGE\n\nWisconsin is in unfamiliar territory this season \u2014 being eliminated from the West Division title chase. Normally, the Badgers are positioning themselves for a trip to the conference championship game. So it's understandable why Chryst was asked about this week's motivation.\n\n\"When you talk to players \u2014 this group and previous teams \u2014 every kid has a 'Why do you play?' Most of the time it's very personal whether it's family or an individual trying to do something and there's also each other,\" Chryst said. \"They care about their teammates. Those don't change regardless of the record.\"\n\nON THE RUN\n\nOne key for Purdue this week will be re-establishing the ground game. Another will be taking some chances.\n\n\"We've erred on being aggressive and taking some chances,\" Brohm said. \"I just think we need to be more efficient in what we're doing.\"\n\nBADGERS' IRONMAN\n\nMichael Deiter is Wisconsin's ironman on the offensive line. This weekend will mark Deiter's 52nd start, setting a program record.\n\nPerhaps even more remarkable is that Deiter, a captain, has started at three positions during his career \u2014 center and left tackle before moving to left guard this season.\n\n\"I'm just glad I was able to play a bunch of football with my friends, and that's kind of how I always viewed it,\" he said. \"I never wanted to not be a part of it. I guess I just took that every week and we ended up here.\"\n\n___\n\nAP freelancer writer Dennis Semrau in Madison, Wisconsin, also contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: BIPM HANDOUT, EPA-EFE)\n\nVERSAILLES, France \u2013 In a historic vote, nations unanimously approved Friday a ground-breaking overhaul to the international system of measurements, coming together in a way that they fail to do on so many other issues behind new definitions for the kilogram and other key units vital for trade and science.\n\nScientists for whom the update represents decades of work clapped, cheered and even wept as the 50-plus nations one by one said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201coui\u201d to the update.\n\nNobel prize winner William Phillips called it \u201cthe greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution,\u201d which ushered in the metric system of meters and kilograms.\n\nThe so-called \u201cGrand K\u201d kilogram, a cylinder of polished platinum-iridium alloy that has been the world\u2019s sole true kilo since 1889, is to be retired.\n\nNations gathered in Versailles, west of Paris, instead approved the use of a scientific formula to define the exact weight of a kilogram. Scientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: some even sported tattoos on their forearms to mark the moment.\n\nThe change will have no discernible impact for most people. Their bathroom scales won\u2019t get kinder and kilos and grams won\u2019t change in supermarkets.\n\nBut it will mean redundancy for the Grand K and its six official copies. The new formula-based definition of the kilogram will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump that has set the standard for more than a century.\n\nUnlike a physical object, the formula cannot pick up particles of dust, decay with time or be dropped and damaged. It also is expected to be more accurate when measuring very, very small or very, very large masses.\n\nEven in retirement, the \u201cGrand K\u201d and its six official copies \u2013 collectively known as \u201cthe heir and the spares\u201d \u2013 will still be kept in the high-security vault on the outskirts of Paris where they are stored. That\u2019s because scientists want to keep on studying them, to see whether their masses gradually change over time.\n\nOnly exceedingly rarely have they seen the light of day since 1889, when they were taken out on a very few occasions to check whether other master kilograms that nations around the world use were still accurately calibrated, give or take the mass of a dust particle or two.\n\nThe metal kilo is being replaced by a definition based on Planck\u2019s constant, which is part of one of the most celebrated equations in physics but also devilishly difficult to explain.\n\nSuffice to say that the updated definition will, in time, spare nations the need to occasionally send their kilos back to France for calibration against the \u201cGrand K.\u201d Scientists instead should be able to accurately calculate an exact kilo without having to measure one lump of metal against another.\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/16/kilogram-changes-countries-vote-retire-grand-k-approve-formula/2023420002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Alan Gomez, USA TODAY", "title": "Homeland Security focuses on border security \u2014 not processing asylum applications from migrant caravan", "description": "The Trump administration sent military troops to the border to stop a migrant caravan, but says it cannot speed up processing of legal asylum-seekers.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/16/migrant-caravan-asylum-immigration-department-homeland-security-border-dhs-kirstjen-nielsen/2014484002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9637335ca56e6c46a0f5006129541e6524abe122/c=0-134-4656-2765/local/-/media/2018/11/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636778013792786948-EPA-MEXICO-CARAVAN-MIGRANTS.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:44:36Z", "content": "The migrants are reaching their final destination in Mexico amid inflamed tensions on both sides of the California-Mexico border.

Department of Homeland Security officials say their main focus is on preventing illegal border crossings, and do not plan on overhauling their operations to increase the number of asylum-seekers allowed to enter each day.\n\n\u201cAs we have said repeatedly, being a member of a caravan doesn\u2019t give you any special rights to enter the country,\u201d Department of Homeland Security spokesman Katie Waldman said in a statement. \u201cIf they arrive at a Port of Entry, they will have to wait in line in keeping with the lawful processes at our ports of entry.\u201d\n\nImmigration advocates say that approach represents yet another attack on a group of Central Americans who want nothing more than to exercise their legal right, written into U.S. law and international conventions, to plead their case for asylum.\n\nEnrique Morones, founder of Border Angels, a San Diego-based humanitarian group, said the administration is purposefully setting up a crisis in Tijuana, where thousands of people are already waiting to apply for asylum, with the bulk of the caravan \u2014 about 5,000 people \u2014 still on the way. The San Ysidro Port of Entry, where most of the caravan members are trying to enter, can only process up to 100 asylum-seekers a day.\n\nThe result is a prolonged waiting game for the migrants, and tensions are already boiling over with local residents in Tijuana's neighborhoods forcing out migrants who are struggling to find shelter space while they wait for their number to be called.\n\n\u201cTrump should be using resources to hire and transfer asylum attorneys, judges, and trained staff to facilitate asylum requests, instead of creating a logjam to purposefully forced refugees to wait outside,\u201d said Morones, who this week was organizing a \u201cmedical brigade\u201d of California doctors to visit Tijuana this weekend to care for the migrants.\n\nDHS officials say that even if they wanted to speed up asylum interviews, it would take widespread coordination among various agencies, changes to U.S. law, and far more funding from Congress.\n\nThe system works like this: a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer or a Border Patrol agent conducts the initial intake of an asylum-seeker. That is followed by an interview conducted by a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officer to determine if the applicant has a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of returning to their home country. Those approved are transferred to a detention center run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or the Department of Health and Human Services for minors. In either case, officials then determine if the asylum applicant will bedetained throughout their application process or released into the U.S. to await their court hearing, which could take years because of a massive backlog.And finally, Department of Justice lawyers oversee the case of each asylum application.\n\nTo increase the number of asylum applicants allowed into the U.S., each of those steps would need to be significantly ramped up, but the administration has not done so.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection has pulled 573 officers from ports around the country and reassigned them to the southwest border, but CBP Assistant Commissioner Andrew Meehan said processing asylum seekers will be only one part of their duties. The additional officers will also safeguard the ports, respond to illegal entries, assist with crowd control, transport migrants to medical facilities, and train other CBP officers.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has pulled up to 100 officers from its refugee program to handle asylum cases throughout the past year, but that number is currently down 70.\n\nThe administration erected a tent city near Tornillo, Texas, this summer to house minors who were separated from their parents under the Trump administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy, but neither ICE nor HHS has built similar structures to house asylum-seekers.\n\nDoing anything more, Waldman said, would require a major funding increase from Congress.\n\n\"(Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen) has been consistent in asking for additional funding needed to secure the border, which includes additional bed space,\" Waldman said. \"The men and women of DHS are doing everything we can to process migrants in accordance with U.S. law and court orders.\"\n\nMigrant advocates don't buy that excuse, arguing that the administration has been able to find money to send 2,000 National Guardsmen, deploy more than 5,800 active-duty military troops, and build a tent city to house minors, but somehow can't find money when asked to help asylum-seekers.\n\nThat sentiment is compounded by the fact that the administration has been trying to limit asylum applications, through new rules ordered by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions cutting off asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang threats, and through Trump's presidential proclamation cutting off asylum for immigrants who enter the country illegally. Both of those decisions will be challenged in federal court hearings on Monday in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.\n\nAngelica Salas, executive director of Los Angeles-based Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, said all those moves point to an administration more interested in blocking immigration than assisting legal asylum-seekers, even though they're heeding the administration's orders to apply the \"right way\" by going to a port of entry.\n\n\"The United States is in violation of their responsibility to properly interview individuals who are going through the 'right doors,' the ports of entry, to request that they be heard,\" Salas said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/16/migrant-caravan-asylum-immigration-department-homeland-security-border-dhs-kirstjen-nielsen/2014484002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "The Latest: Wake Forest uses late 10-0 to beat Titans", "description": "Freshman Jaylen Hoard and Brandon Childress each scored 15 points and Wake Forest beat Cal State Fullerton 66-59 in the Myrtle Beach Invitational", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/16/the-latest-wake-forest-uses-late-10-0-to-beat-titans/38544945/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:43:58Z", "content": "CONWAY, S.C.

Tulsa faces Navy on Saturday. (AP Photo/Michael Woods, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) \u2014 When Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo watched tape of Tulsa's football team, the footage was all too familiar.\n\nThere were numerous narrow defeats, mistakes that made the difference between winning and losing, and a whole lot of simple bad luck.\n\nAnd that is why the Midshipmen (2-8, 1-5 American Athletic Conference) and Golden Hurricane (2-8, 1-5) find themselves tied for last in the West Division of AAC heading into Saturday's game at the Naval Academy.\n\n\"I do think we are very, very similar in terms of how the season has gone for both of us,\" Niumatalolo said. \"They were in some games and maybe have some turnovers that hurt them. That's a talented team that, very similar to us, is struggling. So this is a big game for both of us as far as trying to finish things off right.\"\n\nTulsa has lost four games by nine points or less and narrowly missed upsetting then-No. 23 South Florida, then-No. 23 in the Associated Press poll, falling 25-24 on Oct. 12.\n\nNavy's list of frustrating defeats includes 31-30 in overtime lat SMU and 24-17 at home against Temple.\n\nTulsa head coach Phil Montgomery believes both schools are better than the combined four wins would suggest.\n\n\"For whatever reasons, we haven't gotten the breaks we needed or been able to finish games the way we needed. I don't think our records are a real good indication of the type of teams we have,\" Montgomery said. \"I think both of our teams are continuing to fight and grind and trying to come up with wins. We just got to make some breaks and get the ball to bounce our way at times.\"\n\nNiumatalolo is the longest-tenured head coach in the AAC, with 11 seasons at the helm. Montgomery is the only other head coach who has been in the AAC since Navy joined in 2015.\n\nHere are some other things to look for during Saturday's matchup at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium.\n\nOFFENSIVE WOES\n\nNavy and Tulsa are also similar in that both schools have run the ball effectively but have struggled in the passing game.\n\nThe Midshipmen lead the AAC and rank third nationally in rushing offense with 295.6 yards per game. The Golden Hurricane are No. 33 in the Football Bowl Subdivision for rushing offense and feature two tailbacks with almost identical statistics in Shamari Brooks (797 yards, six touchdowns) and Corey Taylor II (748, seven).\n\nOn the other hand, Tulsa is 113th out of 129 FBS schools in passing offense with an average of 164.8 yards\n\nNavy has displayed very little in terms of passing this season, ranking last in the FBS with just 64.7 yards per game. The Midshipmen have completed four passes or less in seven of 10 games.\n\nSIGNS OF LIFE\n\nNavy's offense took a step in the right direction during last Saturday's loss at Central Florida . Zach Abey made his second straight start at quarterback and directed three touchdown drives during the second half as the Midshipmen finished with 374 rushing yards, their second-highest total of the season.\n\nSENIOR DAY\n\nIt will be Senior Day for Navy, with the 34 varsity football players that are part of the Class of 2019 being honored during a pre-game ceremony. This senior class has not been quite as successful as its most recent predecessors, compiling a 27-21 career record and winning just three of seven games against service academy rivals Air Force and Army.\n\nNiumatalolo is hopeful Navy can snap its current seven-game losing streak on Saturday so the seniors can come away as winners in their last home game.\n\nSIMILAR SIZE\n\nTulsa and the Naval Academy are among the smallest schools competing in the FBS.\n\nTulsa, a private institution, has the smallest FBS enrollment with 3,343 students. There are 4,495 midshipmen at the Naval Academy.\n\nTOUGH COMPETITION\n\nNavy just completed a four-game stretch against teams with a combined record of 35-4: Houston, Notre Dame, Cincinnati and Central Florida. The Midshipmen have played just two opponents with losing records (Lehigh and Air Force).\n\nTulsa is playing eight teams this season that went to bowl games in 2017.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And going into Week 12, even though Alabama is No. 1 and Clemson is No. 2 in the rankings, the Tigers actually have the highest chance to make the playoff, per ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor algorithm. Clemson has a 95 percent chance while Alabama is at 86 percent. Notre Dame and Michigan have the next best chances at 77 percent and 45 percent, respectively.\n\nIf all four teams win out, they\u2019ll hold onto their spots. Alabama\u2019s biggest challenge will likely come from Georgia in the SEC championship game, but it still seems possible that Nick Saban\u2019s team will make the playoff even with one loss. Clemson is on track to finish the regular season undefeated, but we don\u2019t know who it will play in the ACC championship game.\n\nMichigan needs to beat Indiana this weekend and Ohio State after that to advance to the Big Ten championship game, where a win over Northwestern will send the Wolverines to the playoffs.\n\nAnd without a conference championship game to play in, all Notre Dame needs to do is finish 12-0. However, it plays Syracuse this weekend, and the Orange almost took down Clemson earlier this year, so that team can\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nNo. 5 Georgia\n\nThe Bulldogs\u2019 path is very simple: Beat UMass and Georgia Tech in the final two weeks of the regular season and then hand Alabama its first loss of the season by defending its SEC championship. Georgia is the conference\u2019s last real shot to have two teams in the playoff, and it currently has a 37 percent chance of getting in. But after its 20-point loss to LSU earlier this year, a second defeat, even if it\u2019s to Alabama, will knock it out of contention.\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma\n\nWith a 25 percent chance to make the playoff, Sooners have to win out, which probably means beating West Virginia in back-to-back weekends in the regular season finale and then again in the Big 12 title game. They already have a loss to Texas on their resume, so if they lose again to the Mountaineers \u2014 or, in a very unlikely scenario, this weekend against Kansas \u2014 they\u2019ll be out. But if they end up as a one-loss Big 12 champion, they\u2019ll still need a top-4 teams to lose, particularly Notre Dame or Michigan. And they\u2019ll want Alabama to pummel Georgia just for good measure.\n\nNo. 7 LSU\n\nSorry, Tigers fans, but it\u2019s not happening this year. The College Football Playoff has never invited a two-loss team to dance, and it\u2019s not going to start this year with as many as three top-ranked teams possibly finishing the season undefeated. With just a one percent chance to make the playoff, LSU would need chaos in multiple conferences to get considered, and even if upsets happen all over, the Tigers still have a loss to Florida and a shutout from Alabama holding them back.\n\nNo. 8 Washington State\n\nIt hasn\u2019t looked like the Pac-12 will have a representative in the playoff for a while, and the Cougars are in the same one-percent boat as LSU. To be seriously considered, they\u2019d have to win out and be conference champs \u2014 plus have Notre Dame lose, Northwestern win the Big Ten and the Big 12 end up with a two-loss champion. And Georgia can\u2019t upset Alabama either. But all that doesn\u2019t seem like enough to get Washington State in.\n\nNo. 9 West Virginia\n\nThe Mountaineers have the same path as Oklahoma, although they only have an 11 percent chance right now. Yes, they have a loss to Iowa State on their schedule. But if they win out and beat the Sooners in back-to-back weekends, they\u2019ll finish as a one-loss Big 12 champion and could sneak in with some help from other conferences.\n\nNo. 10 Ohio State\n\nIf you haven\u2019t figured out by now, everyone on this list needs to win out. The Buckeyes currently have a 23 percent chance to make the playoff, and they could get in as a one-loss Big Ten champion by taking down Maryland on Saturday, Michigan next weekend and Northwestern in the conference title game. Beating the Wolverines could boost Ohio State\u2019s argument ahead of a one-loss Big 12 team\u2019s, but that 29-point embarrassment to unranked Purdue could keep it out."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "One story from every state.

(AP) \u2014 The LPGA will have either 25 or 26 different winners in 32 events this season, depending on what happens when the final putt of the CME Group Tour Championship drops Sunday.\n\nCommissioner Mike Whan is just fine with that sort of diversity.\n\nWhan delivered his annual \"state of the LPGA\" address Friday during the second round of the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship, revealing that next year's total purses will exceed $70 million for the first time. A new sponsor for the Women's British Open will be revealed soon, and the entire 2019 schedule is expected by the end of the month.\n\nAnd having a tour where women from 10 countries have won this year is just fine with Whan.\n\n\"I'd definitely prefer the top 10 players in the world rankings come from 10 different countries,\" Whan said. \"And the reason is, if I get one player that wins 33 percent of the time she tees it up, when she doesn't tee it up it's not the same event.\"\n\nThe way this tournament has gone after 36 holes, there might be one more name added to the winners' list for 2018.\n\nLexi Thompson \u2014 still winless this year \u2014 shot a 5-under 67 on Friday to move to 12 under for the week, three shots clear of first-round leader Amy Olson (72) and Brittany Lincicome (71).\n\nThompson hit all 18 greens in regulation, and hasn't dropped a shot yet through two rounds.\n\n\"This is one of my favorite tournaments just because I can drive to it and I have so much family and friends out here and a lot of fans,\" said Thompson, a native South Floridian. \"It means the world to me just to come here to Naples and play in front of them. Whether I do good or bad, they're always there supporting me, giving me high fives. That's what makes the game.\"\n\nThe tournament within the tournament this week is the conclusion of the Race to the CME Globe, with world No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn now in control of that again. She's one of five women who entered this week with the best chance of taking that trophy and $1 million bonus, and is back atop the projected standings after shaking off a bogey-bogey-bogey start to finish with a 71 and get to 3-under.\n\n\"I'm very proud of my back nine,\" Jutanugarn said.\n\nNasa Hataoka, who was flawless Thursday \u2014 eight birdies, no dropped shots \u2014 to move into the top spot in the Globe projected standings, went the other way Friday. She shot a 76, four bogeys and no birdies.\n\nOnly four women have won multiple tournaments this season \u2014 player of the year Jutanugarn has three wins, as does Sung Hyun Park. Hataoka and Brooke Henderson are two-time winners, and 21 other women have prevailed once.\n\n\"Everyone always says we need more American players to do well, but it's not that we're not doing well,\" said Lincicome, one of eight American women to win once this season \u2014 and whose round Friday went haywire when a suddenly balky putter forced her to drop four shots on the final four holes. \"It's just this tour is so global and everybody is so darn good. We can't get away with mediocre golf. You have to play your best all the time.\"\n\nThe tour will set a record for purses in 2019 for the third straight year, bolstered in large part by CME Group raising the purse for the tour championship from $2.5 million to $5 million next year. The only event with a $5 million purse in 2018 was the U.S. Women's Open. That seems likely to rise next year, since Whan said the CME event would not have the biggest purse on tour in 2019.\n\nWhan said the variety of winners from the variety of nations \u2014 which isn't a new concept for women's golf \u2014 is a precursor for what he expects to see in men's golf within the next decade, and he's convinced the game will be better for that.\n\n\"It's good for our business,\" Whan said. \"Success from all over the world means TV interest from all over the world.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nLions quarterback Matthew Stafford is averaging 21.0 fantasy points per game this season with 16 touchdowns and eight interceptions. (Photo: Kamil Krzaczynski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt\u2019s Week 11 of the fantasy football season. If you are looking for an unexpected roster replacement or an inexpensive starter for your daily fantasy lineup, here are players who could help.\n\nThese deep sleepers are players flying under the radar whose matchups suggest they could have a big game in Week 11. Just remember, they are risky fantasy plays given the other options likely available.\n\nQB Matthew Stafford, Detroit Lions\n\nStafford is out of the top tier in this week's rankings despite a favorable matchup against the Carolina Panthers, who allow 266 yards and two-plus touchdowns per game. Stafford has struggled all season long but so has the Panthers pass defense.\n\nFantasy rankings: How players stack up at each position in Week 11\n\nWhile the Lions will continue to focus on their rushing game, Stafford should have enough success through the air to be a worthy streaming option in standard leagues or a QB2 option in two-quarterback leagues.\n\nRB Javorius Allen, Baltimore Ravens\n\nAfter the Ravens added Ty Montgomery to their backfield, Allen\u2019s long-term fantasy value disappeared. However, in the short term, Montgomery is still learning the playbook -- which means Allen will continue to be the Ravens' receiving running back.\n\nThis week, the Ravens play a Cincinnati Bengals run defense that's consistently been among the worst in the league. To pass-catching backs like Allen, the Bengals are allowing six receptions and 58 receiving yards per game, the second most receiving touchdowns, and the fourth-most red-zone targets. This will likely be the last week Allen can be streamed in the 2/3 of leagues in which he\u2019s available.\n\nWR Nelson Agholor, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nDespite adding Golden Tate to the Eagles receiving group, Nelson Agholor had one of his better games last week, hauling in five of seven passes for 83 yards. The Eagles play the New Orleans Saints, who allow the most passing yards and touchdowns per game to wide receivers. With the Saints focused on stopping Alshon Jeffery, Agholor makes for a sneaky WR3 or flex play, especially in PPR leagues.\n\nTE Ricky Seals-Jones, Arizona Cardinals\n\nSeals-Jones was heavily involved in the Cardinals' new-look offense last week as he was targeted a season-high nine times. He should continue playing a large role in the offense this week playing against the Oakland Raiders, who have allowed an average of 99 yards and at least one touchdown to tight ends over their past three games. A top-10 finish at the position would not be a surprise.\n\nNew York Giants defense/special teams\n\nOver their past three games, the Giants have allowed 21 points per game by playing better defensive football overall. The Giants should look like a top-10 unit this week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who make most defenses look good every week. The Bucs are ninth in sacks allowed (2.8/game) and first in interceptions allowed (2.1/game). The Giants defense and special teams is available in almost eight out of every 10 leagues.\n\nJim Saranteas, aka \"The Fantasy Greek,\" is a contributing writer for Ourlads.com, part of the USA TODAY Network."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Big game on any stage: No. 3 Notre Dame vs. No. 12 Syracuse", "description": "Undefeated No. 3 Notre Dame faces No. 12 Syracuse in Yankee Stadium, in contention for College Football Playoff", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/16/big-game-on-any-stage-no-3-notre-dame-vs-no-12-syracuse/38544505/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/292e40276a6b4c2ed7ea1f892c190795cd313b5b/c=0-355-4368-2812/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/865f852af7334fe9a3adbfa3243d3585.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:17:20Z", "content": "FILE - In this Nov. 9, 2018, file photo, Syracuse quarterback Eric Dungey runs with the ball during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Louisville in Syracuse, N.Y.

The marching band performing at Bryant Park and the drummer's circle at Rockefeller Center.\n\nWhen Notre Dame plays in New York City it comes with fanfare and pageantry. This trip hardly needs the frills and extra-curricular activities to be a big deal.\n\nThe third-ranked Fighting Irish (10-0, No. 3 CFP) visit Yankee Stadium in contention for the College Football Playoff to face No. 12 Syracuse, the highest-ranked team the Orange have fielded in 20 years.\n\nNotre Dame is two victories away from an unbeaten regular season and an almost certain spot in the national semifinals for the first time in the five-year history of the four-team playoff. Those games will be played on two coasts as the Irish finish the season next week at rival Southern California.\n\nSince before the season, the late-season travel schedule has been a topic of conversation. Now concern among Notre Dame fans about the long road trips has been exacerbated by the fact that Syracuse (8-2, No. 12 CFP) is the best it has been years.\n\nThe Orange are bowl-eligible for the first time since 2013, have won eight regular-season games for the first time since 2001 and have their best AP Top 25 ranking since 1998. Running coach Dino Baber's fast-paced offense, quarterback Eric Dungey is averaging 288 total yards per game and has accounted for 26 touchdowns (14 passing, 12 rushing). Few teams operate faster than the Orange, and they are more balanced this season, with 32 rushing touchdowns and 216 yards rushing per game.\n\n\"They're still up-tempo, but they can beat you with the quarterback running, the running backs running, but also with passing the ball on the perimeter,\" Notre Dame safety Nick Coleman said.\n\nThe Irish counter with a top-10 defense (4.52 yards per play), led by linebacker Te'von Coney and defensive lineman Jerry Tillery. It is a rangy, athletic and deep unit.\n\n\"They're really, really long and they have a really, really good scheme,\" Babers said. \"It's the main reason why a lot of teams have a lot of difficulty scoring points on those guys.\"\n\nSyracuse has a large following in downstate New York and for years has promoted itself as New York's college team. That might be true during basketball season, but there will be a distinctly partisan crowd in the Bronx. The game is part of Notre Dame's Shamrock Series, so it controls the tickets. With so much at stake for the Irish, the field will be anything but neutral.\n\n\"We may have some fans there,\" Babers said. \"They're the nation's team, I guess you could call it.\"\n\nThings to know about the ninth game between Notre Dame and Syracuse and the first with both teams ranked:\n\nBOOK BACK\n\nNotre Dame quarterback Ian Book is expected to be back in the starting lineup after missing last week's game against Florida State because of a rib injury. The Irish didn't miss him, running all over Florida State for a season-high 365 yards with Brandon Wimbush at quarterback.\n\nBook leads the nation in completion percentage at 74.5 percent, but the plan against Syracuse might be similar to what it was vs. the Seminoles. The Orange defense is so-so and the best part of it is the pass rush (33 sacks) behind defensive ends Alton Robinson and Kendall Coleman.\n\nThe Irish can lean on Dexter Williams (202 yards rushing vs. Florida State) and coach Brian Kelly said they won't avoid getting Book involved in the running game. The junior has 218 yards and four rushing touchdowns.\n\n\"We wouldn't play him if we had to put him in bubble wrap,\" Kelly said.\n\nPINSTRIPES\n\nThe Irish breakout special uniforms for the Shamrock Series games, and this week they are going with a reference to the Yankees, working pinstripes into the uniforms and helmets.\n\nHISTORY\n\nNotre Dame is 16-6-3 all-time at Yankee Stadium, including 1-0 at the newest version. Most of those games came against Army from the late 1920s through 1946. The Irish and Syracuse played at Yankee Stadium in 1963. The then-Orangeman won 14-7 less than a week after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nNotre Dame and Syracuse last played in 2016 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the Giants and Jets. Notre Dame won 50-33.\n\nThe last time two ranked teams played at Yankee Stadium was 1946, when No. 1 Army and No. 2 Notre Dame tied 0-0 in what was dubbed the Game of the Century.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

An MRI Friday, Nov. 16, 2018, revealed a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Left guard Max Garcia showed up at the Denver Broncos' headquarters Friday with a sore left knee, something that initially seemed like a minor annoyance for a team preparing for two big offensive line changes already.\n\nWith right guard Connor McGovern preparing for his first NFL start at center and Elijah Wilkinson set to make his first pro start at right guard, Garcia went for an MRI.\n\nThe result was devastating: a torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nGarcia is the third starting offensive lineman the Broncos have lost this season, joining guard Ronald Leary (Achilles) and center Matt Paradis, who had surgery on his broken right leg earlier this week.\n\n\"It's been a tough year for us O-linemen,\" left tackle Garett Bolles said. \"It's a shame to see three guys that are really close to me go down, but at the same time I know that we have guys behind them that have stepped up to the plate and are going to smack a home run.\"\n\nGarcia's injury further staggered a team that's trying to salvage a season featuring four one-score losses, including to the league's two 9-1 teams the Rams and Chiefs, by a combined seven points.\n\n\"It was really weird, I watched (Thursday's) practice from the last play back to the first play and he didn't miss a down,\" coach Vance Joseph said. \"So, the play he was injured on, I saw it, it was kind of a slip. It was no big deal. He finished up practice.\"\n\nJoseph said Billy Turner, who started four games at right tackle when Jared Veldheer was out with a knee injury, will start at left guard Sunday when the Broncos (3-6) visit the Los Angeles Chargers (7-2).\n\nThis will mark the Broncos' sixth different lineup on the O-line this season, but Joseph said it won't affect the game plan.\n\n\"I thought leaving camp that we had the best line that we've had around here in a while as far as depth and as far as guys who can play\" multiple positions, Joseph said. \"It happens. It's football. We've got Billy Turner playing the left guard with Eli playing the right guard along with Mac playing the center, so I'm comfortable. Let's go play.\"\n\nHe said recently signed seven-year veteran center Gino Gradkowski will be active Sunday along with rookie swing guard Sam Jones.\n\n\"Ain't too many guys left ,\" he said.\n\nThrough every combination the Broncos have run the ball with success as rookies Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman have rushed for 900 yards and seven touchdowns with veteran Devontae Booker adding 144 yards, a touchdown and a team-high 5.8-yard average.\n\nWhat they've had trouble doing is protecting quarterback Case Keenum, who has 11 touchdowns and 11 turnovers and has been sacked two dozen times.\n\nStill, offensive coordinator Billy Musgrave has been reluctant to reduce his use of three-receiver sets that put more pressure on the thinning O-line.\n\nThe turnstile hasn't helped Bolles, a 2017 first-rounder, refine his raw game after playing just one season of major college football.\n\n\"It's been hard having different lineups. I've had five different lineups, so it's been frustrating,\" Bolles said. \"But it doesn't matter who's next to me, they're going to make me better, I'm going to make them better and you've just got to roll with the punches and work out the kinks.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Because there was no collusion.\"\n\nHe did not disclose how he might know of Mueller's plans.\n\nTrump's disclosure marked the latest turn in negotiations that stretch back to late last year, when Mueller's office began seeking testimony from the president.\n\nWhile Trump has refused to sit down with prosecutors for a face-to-face interview, he and his lawyers have worked in recent weeks on written responses to investigators' inquiries.\n\nMueller's office is investigating how Russia sought to influence the 2016 election by hacking Democrats' emails \u2013 and releasing them to the public \u2013 and by pushing negative fake news about Trump opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nProsecutors are also looking into whether Trump sought to obstruct the investigation in various ways, including the 2017 dismissal of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nWhite House officials, various lawyers, and numerous journalists have spent weeks speculating on Mueller's next move, and whether it will be more indictments or a report on his findings.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump unleashed another tweet storm on the Mueller operation, saying that \"the inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess\" and prosecutors \"don't care how many lives\" are ruined.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said he was \"not agitated\" with Mueller, but his investigation is a \"hoax.\"\n\n\"There should have never been any Mueller investigation because there was never anything done wrong,\" he said. \"They've wasted millions and millions of dollars.\"\n\nLawmakers have accused Trump of seeking to undermine the Mueller investigation by poisoning public opinion. They also cited Trump's recent naming of Acting Attorney Matthew Whitaker, who has also publicly criticized the probe and suggested de-funding it.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-California, who is expected to chair the House Intelligence Committee after the Democrats take control of the House next year, said this week on Twitter: \"We will do everything in our power to protect the Mueller investigation, the independence of the Department of Justice, and the rule of law.\"\n\nIn again attacking the Mueller investigation, Trump said he has defended himself aggressively, and will continue to do so.\n\n\"I like to take everything personally, because you do better that way.\"\n\nClaiming, without evidence, that Mueller's team might want to set a perjury trap for him, Trump used weather as an example. \"'Gee, you know, was the weather sunny or was it rainy?'\" Trump said. \"He said it may have been a good day. It was rainy. Therefore he told a lie. He perjured himself, OK?\"\n\nTrump again accused the Democrats and Clinton of exaggerating Russian hacking to explain away their defeat. \"The fact is I was a much better candidate than Hillary Clinton,\" he said. \"I went to the right states; she went to the wrong states.\"\n\nIn denying collusion or obstruction, Trump repeatedly insisted he did the answers himself.\n\n\"They were my answers,\" Trump said. \"I don't need lawyers to do that.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/donald-trump-says-he-has-answered-mueller-questions-hasnt-submitted/2025604002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Hannah Yasharoff, USA TODAY", "title": "Mickey Mouse turns 90: The evolution of the world's most iconic mouse", "description": "Disney is celebrating the 90th anniversary of Mickey Mouse.

He seemed most excited about handing off to fellow rookie Nick Chubb, whose franchise-record 92-yard touchdown run put the Falcons on ice.\n\n\"Looking forward,\" Mayfield said, \"I think it's gonna be a bright future. Just gotta be able to have that mentality to never get too down on things but always gotta work.\"\n\nDespite his somewhat checkered reputation coming out of Oklahoma, the cameras also captured Mayfield's selfless spirit Sunday, when he chased down Atlanta's Vic Beasley between plays to return the mouthpiece the pass rusher had lost on the field.\n\nYet the quarterback's generosity was expressed in far greater terms this week when he launched a partnership with Barstool Sports to sell Mayfield paraphernalia \u2014 notably T-shirts and sweatshirts featuring outlines of his signature five o'clock shadow, eye black and bandana \u2014 with 100 percent of the proceeds ticketed for the Special Olympics in the greater Cleveland area.\n\nWe are teaming up with @bakermayfield to launch a merchandise line with 100% of the net proceeds donated to the @SpecialOlympics.\n\n\n\nBuy here: https://t.co/xfPcRWL4cKpic.twitter.com/kcPGHP9nYv \u2014 Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) November 14, 2018\n\n\"That is my new home, and that is why,\" Mayfield said of the initiative, which also fuels his ongoing desire to help children in need.\n\n\"It comes from my love and passion to try and inspire kids and inspire others, and then also the love for competing. So, for me, there's no better cause than Special Olympics,\" he added. \"Those are people that have not been given the best cards, but they find a way to appreciate everything, find the happiness in all the little things.\"\n\nAnd it's not a novelty for Mayfield, who frequently worked with kids and special needs groups while at OU.\n\n\"I think it comes from how I was, remembering how I was when I was little \u2014 looking up to athletes and looking up to their platform \u2014 and, at the time, not realizing they're just normal people.\n\n\"I think it's a great example to inspire others to never give up \u2014 if they want something bad enough, to put your mind on it, and go do it, go fight for it, believe in it.

(AP Photo/Ben McKeown) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Pittsburgh spoiled a conference rival's special season a year ago. The Panthers don't want Wake Forest to do the same thing to them.\n\nPitt will clinch its first appearance in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game with a win over the Demon Deacons on Saturday.\n\nBut the Panthers (6-4, 5-1) are on spoiler alert.\n\nThey know all too well how dangerous it is to play a road game on the home field of a meandering opponent. A year ago, a sub-.500 Pitt team ruined then-No. 2 Miami's undefeated season with a 24-14 upset and sent the Hurricanes into a late-season nosedive.\n\nCoach Pat Narduzzi's team, picked in the preseason to finish fifth in the Coastal Division, has won three straight and four of five since starting 1-3 and needs to beat either Wake Forest or Miami to wrap up a spot opposite No. 2 Clemson in Charlotte on Dec. 1. The Panthers haven't won four in a row since 2015.\n\n\"When we're going in there to play Wake Forest, it's a one-game season right now. Nothing else matters,\" Narduzzi said. \"Good things can happen we know, and it doesn't matter. If they're worried about that ... your focus has got to be singular right now, and if you're worried about these other things, you just get \u2014 you're wandering off.\"\n\nThe Demon Deacons (5-5, 2-4) already have one upset to their credit: They're coming off a last-minute 27-23 victory at North Carolina State that knocked the Wolfpack out of the national rankings and gave a jolt to their fading bowl hopes. Wake Forest will qualify for its third straight bowl by beating either the Panthers or Duke.\n\nBeating N.C. State \"was an awesome win. It is awesome to think about, but it doesn't mean a whole lot if we don't come out and play this weekend,\" offensive lineman Ryan Anderson said. \"This Pitt game is huge and our confidence level is a little bit higher going into this game. After a huge game like that it always is.\"\n\nKEY STAT\n\nThe Panthers are getting it done on the ground. Pitt ranks second in the ACC in rushing (257 ypg) and has surpassed 400 yards rushing in two of its last three games, including a season-best 492 in a 52-22 rout of Virginia Tech that was punctuated by Qadree Ollison's 97-yard touchdown run. Pitt is 5-1 when it rushes for at least 230 yards. Wake Forest's rejuvenated defense, meanwhile, held N.C. State to 47 yards rushing last week.\n\nBIG PLAYS\n\nPitt shares the FBS lead with Oklahoma and South Florida with 10 plays covering at least 60 yards, and has had four others go for at least 50 yards. Giving up big plays has been a big problem for the Demon Deacons, who have allowed 13 50-yarders \u2014 only three schools have given up more. But there has been improvement: Against N.C. State, they gave up only one play longer than 25 yards.\n\nCONFERENCE HISTORY\n\nPitt can match the school record for conference victories with a win. The Panthers set the mark with five ACC victories in 2015, when they finished second to North Carolina in the Coastal standings, and the longtime Eastern independents never won more than five Big East games in a season from the formation of the conference in 1991 until they departed following the 2012 season.\n\nNEED FOR (LESS) SPEED\n\nNarduzzi was wary of the tempo of Wake Forest's offense, saying the Panthers will \"prepare our tails off for the tempo, the high-speed tempo that we'll have to defend this week.\" But slowing things down actually worked to the Demon Deacons' advantage last week. Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson says they consciously ran fewer offensive plays against N.C. State \u2014 just 71 of them, 14 fewer than their average \u2014 to give their overworked defense a break and make things easier on first-time starting QB Jamie Newman.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Kelly Presnell/Arizona Daily Star via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWashington State has a big game looming against rival No. 17 Washington that could determine the Pac-12 North title and extend the No. 8 Cougars' longshot bid for the College Football Playoff.\n\nBut the Apple Cup is next week. First, there's the matter of Saturday's game against Arizona.\n\n\"There is nothing more important than Arizona,\" coach Mike Leach said. \"Anyone who thinks other than that is wrong.\"\n\nWashington State (9-1, 6-1, No. 8 CFP) is seeking its first Pac-12 North title and needs the win against Arizona to help it get there. A 10th win would also tie the program record for victories in a season. The Cougars also seek to extend a 12-game home winning streak.\n\nThe Cougars have the best record in the Pac-12 and are a potent mix of offense and defense. They own the nation's best passing attack (392 yards per game) and rank 20th in defense (324 yards per game). The Cougars average 470 yards of offense overall behind quarterback Gardner Minshew, while Arizona is yielding 417 yards per game.\n\n\"He (Minshew) has gotten more and more confident throughout the year as he's played,\" said Kevin Sumlin, Arizona's first-year coach. \"He's a leader, a competitor, and you see that in games.\"\n\nArizona (5-5, 4-3) has struggled this season, meanwhile, as has the Wildcats' own star quarterback, Khalil Tate.\n\nTate, who shredded the Cougars in a Wildcats victory last season, suffered an ankle injury during the season opener and the injury has lingered.\n\nRunning back J.J. Taylor has helped carry the load for Arizona. The sophomore ranks fourth in the FBS in rushing with 1,221 yards and he leads all Power Five players in all-purpose yards. He has rushed for 558 yards and three touchdowns in his past three games.\n\nDespite a fine high school career, Taylor had only two Pac-12 offers, from Arizona and Washington State.\n\n\"We felt like he was a good player, an explosive player,\" Leach said. \"He was a talented guy . making a ton of plays.\"\n\nOther things to know heading into Saturday's matchup in Pullman, where temperatures are expected to be in the 20s:\n\nPASSING RECORD: Minshew is threatening to break the Pac-12's season passing record of 4,714 yards held by former Cal QB Jared Goff. Minshew has 3,852 passing yards with at least three games left and is completing nearly 70 percent of his passes. The school has launched a Heisman Trophy campaign for the graduate transfer from East Carolina.\n\nPEYTON'S PLACE: Sixth-year linebacker Peyton Pelluer, who is the fourth generation of his family to play at Washington State, has tied the team record by appearing in 51 games. On Saturday, he will likely break the record he shares with defensive lineman Daniel Ekuale and receiver Gabe Marks.\n\nHELLO COACH: Saturday marks the first time Sumlin and Leach will coach against each other in the Pac-12, but the two have a long history dating to their time in the Big 12. The coaches have \"shared ideas, we've visited with each other and we've just known each other for a long time,\" Sumlin said.\n\nPOSSESSIVE: Washington State leads the Pac-12 in time of possession, averaging 32 minutes, 54 seconds per game. Leach shrugs off that stat. \"The biggest thing is we had more plays,\" he said. \"You want to keep the ball away from them.\" Washington State is tied for second in the country with 20 scoring drives of 10 or more plays.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 South Carolina has been caught napping by an FCS opponent before \u2014 and does not want it to happen again.\n\nThe Gamecocks (5-4) take on Chattanooga (6-4) of the Southern Conference on Saturday with plenty to play for, including to further distance themselves from the embarrassing defeat to The Citadel three years ago.\n\nSouth Carolina is coming off a disappointing fourth-quarter collapse in a 35-31 loss to Florida and has Palmetto State rival in No. 2 Clemson coming up a week after playing the Mocs.\n\nGamecocks coach Will Muschamp said his players will prepare the same as they do each week, focused solely on Chattanooga and not what happened or what's ahead.\n\n\"Our guys understand, it's not really about the opponent and, regardless of who we play, it's about us and our preparation and how we go about our business,\" Muschamp said. \"We can't control who we play or where we play or what time. At the end of the day, we can control what we do.\"\n\nThe Gamecocks can reach six wins and qualify for the postseason \u2014 and the additional practice time that comes with it \u2014 with a victory.\n\nSouth Carolina has been tripped up by an FCS team in the recent past with a 23-22 win by The Citadel in 2015 right before Muschamp's arrival.\n\nThe Gamecocks had seemed to find some footing in recent weeks until squandering a 17-point lead in the final 16 minutes at The Swamp a week ago.\n\nSouth Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley said the team's ability to take a 31-14 lead on the Gators gave them confidence they can play well.\n\n\"At the end of the day we didn't win,\" Bentley said. \"We had the chance to go down the field and score and we didn't. That's the glaring thing for us.\"\n\nSome other Things to watch for when Chattanooga takes on South Carolina:\n\nDECISIONS, DECISIONS\n\nSouth Carolina will honor seniors Saturday and those with eligibility who might not return. Muschamp said offensive line starter Donnell Stanley has not yet decided if he'll be back, although he's taking part in senior ceremonies. Injured linebacker Eldridge Thompson is seeking a sixth year of eligibility, yet will walk with the seniors since his family is coming to the game.\n\nCHATTANOOGA LEGACY\n\nThe Mocs had won three straight Southern Conference titles from 2013-15 and made three NCAA playoff trips from 2014-16. However, they've struggled to gain their footing under second year coach Tom Arth. The team went 3-8 a year ago and will see its season end after facing South Carolina.\n\nArth has seen progress this season . \"We're one possession away in each game from being 10-0. We were in the hunt for the entirety of this season,\" he said.\n\nSTEPPING OUT OF CONFERENCE\n\nThe Gamecocks close with three non-conference opponents after finishing Southeastern Conference play at 4-4. Following the game with Chattanooga, South Carolina plays at Clemson, then returns home Dec. 1 to take on Akron as a makeup game for the contest with Marshall cancelled due to Hurricane Florence two months ago.\n\nTOUGH D\n\nThe Mocs lead the Southern Conference and are ninth in the Football Bowl Subdivision in fewest points allowed per game this season (18.2). They're also 19th in the FCS in passing yards given up at 185.3 per game.\n\nDEFENSIIVE LOSS\n\nThe Gamecocks will again be without linebacker-lineman Bryson Allen-Williams who hurt his ankle in the win at Ole Miss two weeks ago. Allen-Williams had been one of South Carolina's most disruptive defenders this season with team highs with 10 tackles for loss and five quarterback hurries. Muschamp said Allen-Williams, a senior, might return for South Carolina's bowl game.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Jeffrey Collins contributed to this article.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Virginia's last exposure to a running attack like the one Georgia Tech employs could hardly have gone worse. After taking an early 7-0 lead against Navy in last year\u2019s Military Bowl, the Cavaliers gave up 49 unanswered points in a 49-7 defeat. They will try again to shut down the triple option when they play the Yellow Jackets on Saturday, Nov. 17. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Virginia's championship hopes could be dashed before the Cavaliers take the field Saturday.\n\nYet, there isn't time to fret over what-ifs.\n\nThe triple-option demands their full attention.\n\nGeorgia Tech leads the nation in rushing yards with an average of 362.3 per game. The Yellow Jackets have pretty much dropped the forward pass from their repertoire, putting the ball in the air just seven times in the last three contests.\n\n\"It's unique,\" Virginia linebacker Jordan Mack said. \"You've got to abandon everything you know, essentially, and just focus in on the offense.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers (7-3, 4-2 ACC) can't fare much worse than the last time they faced the unique offense. In the 2017 Military Bowl, Virginia scored an early touchdown \u2014 and then watched Navy run up and down the field the rest of the game, piling up 452 yards rushing in a 49-7 blowout .\n\nThe Midshipmen failed to complete their lone passing attempt.\n\nNot that it mattered.\n\n\"It's not scary,\" Mack insisted. \"It's another opportunity to get better. A lot of guys are eager and willing and want to improve and show that we can defend the triple-option.\"\n\nVirginia must win this game to have any shot at winning the Coastal Division, and even then they'll need some help. Pittsburgh, which plays at Wake Forest on Saturday and should be finishing up about the time the Cavaliers kick off, merely needs to win one of its last two games to clinch a spot in the ACC championship game against No. 2 Clemson.\n\nGeorgia Tech's titles hopes faded in the first month of the season. But after a 1-3 start, the Yellow Jackets (6-4, 4-3) have ripped off a three-game winning streak and locked up a bowl berth.\n\n\"You can't quit after three games,\" coach Paul Johnson said. \"This league is so balanced. ... Other than Clemson, everybody is pretty similar.\"\n\nSome other things to watch for when the Yellow Jackets host the Cavaliers on Saturday:\n\nBOWL POSITIONING\n\nWhile Virginia still has hopes of playing for an ACC title, this is also a chance to gain a better position in the league's postseason hierarchy.\n\nThe winner almost surely will land a more prestigious bowl assignment, no matter what happens in the final week of the regular season.\n\n\"We got to a bowl game, but now we have to make it better,\" Georgia Tech receiver Brad Stewart said.\n\nHE'S BACK\n\nGeorgia Tech senior quarterback TaQuon Marshall, who seemed on the verge of losing his starting job to redshirt freshman Tobias Oliver, re-established himself as the clear No. 1 in last week's victory over Miami.\n\nMarshall played nearly the entire game, rushing for 91 yards and two touchdowns to go along with a scoring pass in the 27-21 triumph .\n\nOliver had gotten the bulk of the playing time the previous two games with Marshall nursing an upper-body injury, running for 215 yards in an upset at Virginia Tech and 120 yards in a win over North Carolina. The youngster actually leads the Yellow Jackets in rushing with 781 yards and 12 TDs.\n\nYOUNG LINE\n\nGeorgia Tech will be looking to capitalize on Virginia's youthful defensive line.\n\nTwo true freshmen (Aaron Faumui and Jordan Redmond) have started for Cavaliers, and redshirt freshman Tommy Christ got his first start in last week's victory over Liberty.\n\n\"They're not asking them to do a whole lot,\" Johnson said, \"but they're doing what they ask them to do.\n\nTHIRD DOWN WOES\n\nThe Yellow Jackets' defense must do a better job getting off the field.\n\nOpponents have converted nearly half of their third-down opportunities (51 of 106), a figure that Johnson said is unacceptable.\n\n\"We're been pretty good at not giving up big plays and getting turnovers, but third down is horrendous,\" the coach said.\n\nVIRGINIA'S CATALYST\n\nJunior-college transfer Bryce Perkins has given the Cavaliers' offense a dual threat at quarterback.\n\nPerkins has rushed for more than 100 yards in three games and he's thrown for just under 2,000 yards with 18 touchdowns.\n\n\"He's a dynamic quarterback, as good as anybody in our league,\" Johnson said. \"I think the quarterback kind of transformed their football team.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky's quest for a 10-win regular season has quickly shifted toward halting a losing streak.\n\nThe No. 20 Wildcats (7-3) have been outscored 58-24 in consecutive losses to No. 5 Georgia and Tennessee that wrapped up Southeastern Conference play. Kentucky hopes to get back on track in Saturday's home finale against Middle Tennessee (7-3), which will mean scoring more than the 17 points that seems to be its recent ceiling.\n\nThat output probably won't suffice against a Blue Raiders squad averaging 37 points during their four-game winning streak. While coach Mark Stoops has dismissed suggestions about an offensive overhaul, he acknowledges that something has to give. Coordinator Eddie Gran believes the answer is simply reclaiming the aggression and focus that built a 7-1 start.\n\n\"We've got to play harder, we've got to be more consistent,\" Gran said this week. \"That's the thing, getting back to that physicality of not talking about it, but doing it.\"\n\nKentucky's defense also needs a reboot after falling from its perch two weeks ago atop several national categories.\n\nThe Wildcats have allowed 61 points over that span and been vulnerable to chunk plays. Fatigue has also shown on a unit that has worked hard to provide the offense opportunities and field position.\n\nStoops believes everything is fixable and has reminded Kentucky of what it can achieve if it succeeds. Beating MTSU would give the Wildcats eight wins for the first time since 2007, and nine is still possible if they stay the course.\n\n\"We did a lot of good things to win seven games,\" Stoops said, \"and we plan on trying to get to eight and nine.\"\n\nThe Blue Raiders were at a similar crossroads a month ago before finding the formula that has them chasing their first five-game winning streak since 2013. Conference USA's East Division leaders now aim for a signature win against a SEC school before next week's league showdown against West-leading Alabama-Birmingham.\n\nMTSU coach Rick Stockstill acknowledges that won't be easy against a Wildcats defense allowing 321.8 yards per game. Let alone a team hungry to get back in the win column.\n\n\"When you play teams like this there isn't much margin for error,\" he said. \"We have to make sure we play well in all three phases of the game.\"\n\nOther things to watch in Kentucky's home finale against MTSU:\n\nSO LONG, SENIORS\n\nKentucky will honor 16 seniors on Saturday, a group that includes linebackers Josh Allen and Jordan Jones and tight end C.J. Conrad. The class has helped reverse the program's culture and fortunes to win 26 games and earn consecutive bowl berths, and they hope to win in their third postseason appearance. \"We decided in coming here that we could do something special, and we feel like it has been special,\" Allen said. \"Just to get to the point we are is amazing, and the growth we've made and the progress we're making is unbelievable.\"\n\nSTOCKSTILL'S SURGE\n\nSenior quarterback Brent Stockstill holds every MTSU passing record and is coming off a 352-yard performance last week against UTEP, the 17th of his career. His four touchdown passes in that contest gave him 21 this season and 98 in his career, putting him on the brink of becoming the NCAA's 25th FBS player with 100 TDs.\n\nONE MORE FOR THE RECORD\n\nAllen leads the SEC with 11 sacks, 15.5 tackles for loss and five forced fumbles. He can tie Dennis Johnson's single season school record set in 2001 with his next full sack and break Oliver Barnett's career mark of 26 from 1986-89.\n\nTURNOVER TURNAROUND\n\nTen turnovers and a plus-8 margin the past four games have keyed MTSU's impressive stretch run. The Blue Raiders have scored 50 points off those takeaways and yielded only eight. \"We worked very hard at it last year but the ball didn't bounce our way,\" Rick Stockstill said, lamenting dropped interception chances and a failure to recover fumbles. \"This year, we're taking advantage of them. We're finishing plays better this year than we did last year.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So, you have to be creative as a coach and create some situations that can generate excitement.\"\n\nWard has been encouraged by the response, but the next and most important step for Louisville (2-8, 0-7 Atlantic Coast Conference) is trying to turn intensity into victory on Saturday against North Carolina State (6-3, 3-3). Trying is the operative word, as the Cardinals have looked disinterested while allowing 50-plus points five times this season and going winless against Power Five conference schools.\n\nThose failings resulted in Petrino's dismissal after four-plus seasons in his second coaching stint at Louisville, an expensive move that includes a $14 million buyout of his contract. Also let go were Petrino's son Nick, who coached quarterbacks, and Petrino's sons-in-law Ryan Beard (linebackers) and L.D. Scott (defensive line). Ward, an associate coach who also guided Louisville's safeties, will oversee the D-line with quality control coach J.B. Lageman.\n\nWhether the changes in staff and practice pay off for Louisville over the final two games remains to be seen. N.C. State coach Dave Doeren is preparing his players for more physicality from the Cardinals and has worked to refocus the Wolfpack after being knocked from the Top 25 with a 27-23 loss to Wake Forest on Nov. 8.\n\nN.C. State features the ACC's No. 3 offense (453 yards per game) and its top passer in senior quarterback Ryan Finley (2,864 yards, 17 touchdowns). Those strengths didn't always show against Wake as the Wolfpack rushed for just 47 yards and killed red-zone chances with dropped passes.\n\nDoeren wants to prevent a repeat against a 16 \u00bd-point underdog \u2014 especially one that's eager to see what change brings.\n\n\"It's more about us and being able to get back to running the ball, catching the ball, and making those plays,\" he said. \"All the little things that make you a good football team and have made us win some good games this year.\"\n\nSome other things to watch as N.C. State visits Louisville:\n\nPROTECTING FINLEY\n\nOne key to another impressive season by Ryan Finley has been the superb pass blocking by an offensive line that has allowed a conference-low five sacks this season. That total ranks second nationally behind Army (two), which thrives with the run-based triple option. Finley has been dropped just three times in ACC play and doesn't figure to see much pressure from Louisville, which has managed a conference-worst nine sacks.\n\nCALLING THE SHOTS\n\nLouisville co-offensive coordinator Lonnie Galloway will take over play-calling responsibilities in addition to working with the quarterbacks. First-year defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder will continue in that role, though Grady Brown takes over the secondary.\n\nSIGN OF PROGRESS\n\nCardinals sophomore quarterback Jawon Pass had his most versatile performance this season in last week's 54-23 loss at No. 12 Syracuse . He completed 13 of 25 passes for 196 yards and a touchdown and added career highs of 12 rushes for 80 yards. Despite Louisville's general offensive struggles, Pass ranks ninth among ACC passers at 189.3 yards per contest.\n\nWINLESS IN LOUISVILLE\n\nThe Cardinals lead the series 6-2 and are 3-1 against the Wolfpack since joining the ACC. N.C. State broke through 39-25 last year in Raleigh but is 0-4 in Louisville.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 In Mark Whipple's two stints as the UMass coach covering 11 years and time spent in FCS and FBS, No. 5 Georgia is his pick as the Minutemen's toughest opponent.\n\nWhipple says he didn't even have to pass along that opinion to his players.\n\n\"All they have to do is look at the tape,\" Whipple said. \"You just put the tape on and they've got great players. They're the best team UMass has ever played at any level. They're a really super team. You look at the scoreboard and they do it on offense, they do it on defense and they've got a terrific kicking game.\"\n\nAdded Whipple of the challenge facing UMass (4-7) in Saturday's game: \"We'll give it our best shot.\"\n\nGeorgia (9-1, No. 5 CFP) already has won the Southeastern Conference's Eastern Division and a spot in the Dec. 1 SEC championship game in Atlanta against No. 1 Alabama. The Bulldogs' focus against UMass and in next week's final regular-season game against Georgia Tech is to avoid a misstep that would devastate their chances for a return trip to the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"There's no question we hope they're overlooking us and trying to get ready for Georgia Tech,\" Whipple said.\n\nThe Bulldogs opened as 45-point favorites against UMass. The line dropped to a still-daunting 41 points, a number which reflects the Minutemen's task of containing such playmakers as quarterback Jake Fromm, tailbacks D'Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield, and wide receivers Riley Ridley and Mecole Hardman.\n\n\"They don't have any weaknesses,\" Whipple said. \"They were one play away from winning the national championship game last year and they might have a better team. I think they're deeper.\"\n\nGeorgia coach Kirby Smart is confident his team will avoid looking past UMass, which is 0-8 against SEC teams but lost to Mississippi State and Tennessee by only a combined 15 points last season.\n\nThe talent equalizer for UMass is wide receiver Andy Isabella , who ranks second in the nation with 87 catches for 1,479 yards. Isabella stays busy while lining up in different spots.\n\nSmart said Isabella is \"one of the best receivers in all of college football. Our kids respect him.\"\n\nHere are some other things to know about the UMass-Georgia game:\n\nDON'T BLINK\n\nThe Minutemen can score quickly. They've scored on 12 scoring drives lasting no longer than 60 seconds. They're tied for eighth in the nation on such drives.\n\nACCURACY MATTERS\n\nFromm is challenging Hutson Mason's completion percentage record of 67.9 set in 2014. Fromm has completed 67.5 percent of his passes to rank second in the SEC.\n\nWhipple said he has seen Fromm falter only in Georgia's loss to LSU, when he completed only 16 of 34 passes with two interceptions.\n\n\"Other than that he's been really good,\" Whipple said, adding Fromm is \"a calm and collected guy.\"\n\nPOWER FIVE TEST\n\nUMass lost at Boston College 55-21 on Sept. 1 in its only game this season against a Power Five team. It is coming off a 35-16 home loss to Brigham Young.\n\nOFFENSIVE LINE DRAINED\n\nSmart says Georgia's offensive line no longer boasts the depth it had to open the season. Guards Kendall Baker and Cade Mays could miss Saturday's game. Center Lamont Gaillard guard Ben Cleveland also less than full speed.\n\n\"We've had depth, but it's slowly and surely deteriorated,\" Smart said Tuesday. \"We don't have a lot of depth now. That doesn't just take a toll on your offensive line. It takes a toll on your scout offensive line, which goes against your defensive line, which makes your team better. ... So it takes its toll. Sometimes they all hit in bunches, but we're hoping to try to get some of these guys back.\"\n\nVOTE OF CONFIDENCE\n\nFromm said last week's 27-10 win over Auburn proved the offensive line did its job, even when backups were on the field.\n\n\"Auburn had a Sunday-type caliber defensive line,\" Fromm said. \"Our guys did a really good job with those guys moving them.\"\n\nFromm noted Swift and Holyfield \"had really good performances.\"\n\nSwift ran for a career-high 186 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision.\n\nKelly said White House officials couldn\u2019t say who made the decision or how. The judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case \u2013 which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY \u2013 is argued.\n\n\u201cThis court cannot restore Mr. Acosta\u2019s access to press briefings that have already been held,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nBut Kelly said he hasn\u2019t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights. More arguments are expected Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI trust this litigation will continue at a rapid pace.\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAcosta thanked reporters and news organizations outside the courthouse for their support.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to work,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said the administration is drafting rules and regulations for reporters.\n\n\"People have to behave. We're writing up rules and regulations,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWith the rules and regulations, we will end up back in court and we will win.\"\n\nThe goal of the regulations is to ensure decorum, to prevent a reporter from asking three or four questions then refusing to sit down, Trump said.\n\n\u201cIt's more important to me than anybody would believe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut you have to act with respect when you're at the White house, and when I see the way some of my people get treated at news conferences, it's terrible.\u201d\n\nIn an interview recorded Friday for \"Fox News Sunday,\" Trump called the court opinion and the drafting of rules \"no big deal.\"\n\n\"If he misbehaves we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" Trump said.\n\nSarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Acosta's press badge will be temporarily reinstated.\n\n\"We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAcosta arrived at the White House a little after noon and thanked reporters again for their support.\n\n\u201cMy job is to cover the guy in there,\u201d Acosta said, nodding to the Oval Office.\n\nMuch of the debate in the case focused on a 1977 case at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which CNN said prevented the revocation of credentials \u201cbased on arbitrary or less than compelling reasons.\u201d\n\nBut the Justice Department, defending the White House decision to pull Acosta's pass, countered that the case was narrower than CNN described and focused on a Secret Service denial of access for safety and security reasons.\n\nOther media organizations, including Gannett Co., the parent of USA TODAY, said this week that they planned to file briefs with the court supporting CNN. The White House Correspondents Association filed an argument in the case warning the case could set a \u201cdangerous precedent.\u201d\n\nIf Trump is allowed to deny access to any reporter he considers \u201cbad\u201d or \u201crude\u201d or \u201cfake news,\u201d he would have \u201cunbridled discretion to decide who can report from inside the White House,\u201d according to the WHCA\u2019s argument.\n\n\"The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association welcomes today\u2019s ruling, in which a federal judge made it clear that the White House cannot arbitrarily revoke a White House press pass,\" said Olivier Knox, the group's president.\n\nBut media support for CNN wasn't universal.\n\nOne America News Network, a cable network based in California, filed an argument in the case that said it passionately supported an unfettered free press. But the network said Acosta had been unprofessional repeatedly during briefings and his \"disruptive behavior\" and \"grandstanding\" hindered other reporters from doing their jobs.\n\nThe revocation followed a feisty exchange between Trump and Acosta a day after the midterm election. Acosta pressed Trump on his characterization of the caravan of Central Americans moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border. After several exchanges, Trump accused Acosta of being a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nKelly said he weighed four factors in the case in ordering the White House to at least temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s credential while the case is argued. The factors were: CNN\u2019s likelihood of success, the likelihood of irreparable harm, balancing CNN and government interests, and the public interest.\n\nKelly ruled that Constitutional issues always weigh heavily in the public interest. Acosta is harmed by missing briefings and other events at the White House, even if CNN has dozens of other reporters who could cover them, the judge said.\n\nKelly focused on the Fifth Amendment argument about CNN deserving due process because the written explanation from Sanders came after the suspension. CNN filed a letter Nov. 8 to contest the decision, but Kelly said they deserved the chance to more formally respond to the reasons.\n\n\u201cThe need for the opportunity to be heard seems especially important in this case,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nContributing: David Jackson.\n\nMore: CNN sues Trump administration, demands return of reporter Jim Acosta's White House press credentials\n\nMore: Ted Olson led Republicans to victory in Bush v.

At Reviewed, our shopping and TV experts are tracking prices all month long to bring you the best Black Friday deals. Though there are a couple notable doorbusters on cheap TVs, the great news is the best Black Friday TV deals we've found are all live right now. Here are the ones you should check out:\n\n\n\nThe Best Black Friday 2018 TV deals available now:\n\n1. LG C8 OLED 4K TV\u2014$1,696.99 on Amazon (Save $500): This is the best TV of the year. It usually goes for $2,200, but has been dropping little by little since September, and right now it's at its lowest price we've seen at major retailers (and it's available with Prime shipping). The 65-inch is $300 off right now too, marking its lowest Amazon price of the season.\n\n2. TCL 43-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018)\u2014$279.99 on Amazon (Save $50): This TCL 4K TV is a bit cheaper than the nicer S5 model, which is on sale for $320 (down from $350). The main reason this one's $40 less? Unlike the S5, the S4 doesn't have Dolby Vision and the Roku remote doesn't have a headphone jack for wireless audio, but you can't beat the picture quality for the price.\n\n3. Samsung NU8000 55-In. 8-Series Smart 4K TV\u2014$747.99 on Amazon (Save $150): We were impressed by this TV in our tests, but our main hangup was the high starting price. This deal sorts that out, netting you a very good all-around name-brand TV for an affordable price. You can also get a 65-inch model on sale for $997.99 ($300 off), making it one of the cheaper 65-inch 2018 TVs in this class.\n\n4. TCL 55-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2017)\u2014$349.99 on Amazon (Save $30): With 4K and Roku's streaming platform built in, you really can't find a better deal on an entry-level big screen TV. At this low sale price, we love this 4K TV, especially for secondary viewing areas like bedrooms, kitchens, or playrooms. It usually costs $380, and originally retailed for $450, so it's a great buy on one of last year's best budget TVs.\n\n5. TCL 65-in. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018 6 Series)\u2014$899.99 at Best Buy (Save $70): This is the Best Buy exclusive version of one of our favorite TVs this year, offering awesome picture quality, the Roku smart platform, and pristine HDR in a 65-inch package. The non-Best Buy version goes for $999 regularly, so you're basically saving $100 off the competition here.\n\n6. Samsung 50-in. 6-Series 4K TV (2018)\u2014$327.99 (Save $272): It's not often you can get a 50-inch 4K Samsung TV for under $350, but here we are. This is one of the lower-end 4K TVs Samsung offers, but if you prefer Samsung over budget-conscious brands like Vizio and TCL, this is a great deal.\n\n\n\n7. Sony 65-in. X850F 4K LED TV (2018)\u2014$998 (Save $400): Sony still makes some of the best TVs you can buy, but they're typically priced above what we can regularly recommend. This 65-inch Sony is Amazon's Choice for a high performance TV and this $400 price cut is the cheapest it's been all year and one of the best big-screen deals we've found ahead of Black Friday. The 75-inch version has also seen a $500 price cut (to $1,798), if you want something even bigger.\n\n\n\nHere are some other TV and home theater deals worth checking out, though not nearly as good as the ones above. Most of these are also live now, but some (especially the Roku Ultra, our favorite streaming box) won't go live until Black Friday:\n\n\n\nOther deals that are live now:\n\nBlack Friday deals that are not yet live:\n\n\n\nOver the next week and on Black Friday proper there are a few other deals that may be worth checking out, but most of the Black Friday ads from stores like Wal-mart and Best Buy are out and we feel our top deals here are just better buys. As usual, most of the TVs with the biggest \"discounts\" are not the name-brand, high-quality sets that we would typically recommend. It's really easy to overpay for a TV on Black Friday\u2014even if you think you're scoring a deal\u2014so be sure to follow our coverage in case anything changes.\n\nWe'll update this post as soon as we find any more deals worth highlighting throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it's pretty clear: if you want a deal on a TV this year, we think you're better off just buying one of the above now.\n\n\n\nReviewed.com has you covered through the shopping madness, researching endlessly to find you the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.

While he played more center field than he did in any year since his 2012 rookie campaign, his defensive value plummeted as he notched a -14.4 UZR \u2014 the worst mark among all qualifying Major League outfielders \u2014 and an alarming -26 defensive runs saved (DRS) in 2018.\n\nHarper hit 34 home runs and posted a strong .393 on-base percentage in the campaign, but the defensive metrics were bad enough to suggest something far below a superstar-caliber season in terms of Wins Above Replacement (WAR). By Fangraphs\u2019 version of the stat, Harper finished with 3.5 WAR \u2014 a pretty good but not very good season, 52nd among MLB position players. By baseball-reference.com\u2019s version, he was worth only 1.3 wins above a replacement-level player, or below average by the standards of big-league regulars.\n\nNaysayers crawl out of the woodwork to denigrate WAR as a stat practically anytime it is used, but if there\u2019s a fair criticism of the metric, it\u2019s that it gives a ton of weight to defensive numbers that tend to be extremely finicky. While stats like UZR and DRS (along with the Statcast-driven Outs Above Average, in which Harper was also quite bad) represent the best publicly available methods to quantify a player\u2019s defensive contributions, on a single-season basis they rely on samples far too small to be a definitive indication of a player\u2019s actual defensive ability. Generally, it\u2019s safer to use a three-year sample than any one season to estimate a player\u2019s actual skills in the field, but obviously a lot can change about any player\u2019s defense over the course of a three-year period.\n\nEssentially, the widely accepted advanced defensive stats \u2014 and, by extension, WAR \u2014 do as good a job as any at showing what happened in the course of a season, but the fielding stats are nowhere near as useful as their offensive counterparts for predicting what will happen moving forward. We can feel confident that Harper will remain a very good hitter in 2019 and beyond, as his .889 OPS this past season was more or less in line with his .900 career mark, he\u2019s 26, and his principal offensive skills \u2014 power and patience \u2014 aren\u2019t the type that suddenly disappear.\n\nBut it\u2019s a far, far bigger leap to suggest that Harper will now be one of the worst defensive outfielders in baseball just because the stats showed him to be that in 2018. It\u2019s that sample-size thing. Check it out: Fangraphs player pages include granular defensive data from analytics firm Inside Edge, which rank every defensive opportunity a player gets by the likelihood of the play getting made, separating the impossible (a 0% likelihood), from the remote (1-10%), the unlikely (10-40%), the even (40-60%), the likely (60-90%) and the routine (90-100%).\n\nHarper\u2019s 2018 Inside Edge stats account for all 285 putouts he made in the outfield. He flubbed two of 275 plays considered routine, certainly plays he\u2019d like to have back but nothing to indicate egregious defensive shortcomings. He converted none of six opportunities to make \u201cremote\u201d plays, but Harper has never made a play considered remote by Inside Edge in his entire career \u2014 those are reserved for top-end sprinters like Billy Hamilton or guys with the freakishly good instincts and reaction time of Mookie Betts. If Harper has never made plays like that in the past, he\u2019s unlikely to start doing so with any regularity now, and they\u2019re not enough to make or break him as a defender. Mike Trout has above-average range for a center fielder but has converted only two of 46 remote opportunities since 2014.\n\nTaking out the impossible, the remote and the routine plays leaves only 25 batted balls that tested Harper\u2019s defensive limits in 2018. He made 12 of them, going 1-for-6 on unlikely plays, 1-for-4 on even plays, and 10-for-15 on likely (but not routine) plays. If he could\u2019ve caught all of four more fly balls over the course of the entire season, the figures tracking his range would look a lot different.\n\nAgain: He did not do that, so his defensive stats look bad. But unless your eyeballs are biased by too much time looking at in-season defensive metrics, Harper just does not look the part of an albatross defender. By sprint speed \u2014 which measures players on the basepaths, not in the outfield \u2014 Harper still moves just as well as he did from 2015-2017, when he graded out as a slightly above average defensive right fielder.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to the defensive stats than just how often a player made catches on batted balls hit in his direction, and Harper\u2019s throwing arm also played down in 2018. And maybe there\u2019s an actual explanation for his sudden defensive downturn, like the knee injury suffered on a hit by pitch in early August that forced him out of a game but never landed him on the disabled list.\n\nBut the guess here is that it\u2019s a sample-size fluke, and Harper will return to playing average to above-average defense in right field in 2019 no matter where he lands in free agency.

Indoor walk-throughs, which we\u2019ve had this week, which we\u2019ve also had in the past, are always beneficial to our team. It\u2019s always beneficial to our players. It\u2019s a great teaching and learning environment. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to pull off physically the demands of practice and the overhaul hustle and pursuit of what we have to do during the course of a practice, and our movements. \u2026 Going outside yesterday allowed us to also have the opportunity to focus on our fundamentals, which we needed to do. And take care, to make sure we\u2019re technically sound in some of our footwork. Practicing in some of those conditions, whether it\u2019s mud, snow, loose grass, whatever the case may be, focuses most of the skill players to have to keep their feet underneath them, be able to break with a low center of gravity and play technically sound, which is always good from a fundamental standpoint. It was a good opportunity to get that done.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s the exactly opposite of what his former head coach in New England would do with the media.\n\nHe also said \u201cit was not cold outside,\u201d which seems weird when you consider there was snow on the ground.

Both teams would love for that still to be the case. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMidway through this season, a mid-November matchup between longtime rivals Miami and Virginia Tech seemed likely to have major implications in the ACC's Coastal Division race, if not nationally.\n\nThat will not be the case Saturday.\n\nEight teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference have already qualified for a bowl game, and neither the Hurricanes (5-5, 2-4) nor the Hokies (4-5, 3-3) are among them. Instead of contending for a title, both are hobbling noticeably to the finish.\n\nMiami, once ranked as high as No. 16, has lost four in a row. The Hokies, once No. 12, have lost four of five.\n\n\"Both teams obviously haven't won in a while,\" Hurricanes coach Mark Richt, whose team won the division for the first time last season, said this week. \"Everyone is battling for that victory. I can promise you our guys are battling, our coaches are battling and we're looking forward to another opportunity to play a game.\"\n\nThe Hokies are, too \u2014 perhaps more games than are currently on their schedule.\n\nBecause East Carolina opted not to make the trip to Blacksburg, Virginia, for a game early in the season because of an impending hurricane, the game against Miami and next Friday's traditional Thanksgiving week matchup against Virginia will leave the Hokies with 11 games. If they win them both, they would extend their streak of consecutive seasons ending in a bowl game to 26. If they lose either, they could add a 12th game on Dec. 1.\n\n\"We're continuing to work our way through it,\" coach Justin Fuente said. \"Do we have interest? Sure, we have interest in all the potential scenarios of what could happen and all the moving pieces that could come about that don't have anything to do with the football team but have everything to do with everybody on the outside.\"\n\nFuente, however, also said he's less worried about extending the Hokies' bowl streak than he is about getting them playing better, and with a very young and very banged up defense, that has been increasingly challenging.\n\nIn three of their last four losses, they have allowed at least 45 points. In two, at least 465 rushing yards.\n\n\"They're anxious to prove, as the whole team is, that they can play better football,\" Fuente said.\n\nHere are some things to watch for when Miami visits Virginia Tech:\n\nPASSING FANCY\n\nThe Hokies Ryan Willis ranks fourth in the ACC with 221 passing yards per game and has thrown for 13 touchdowns with just three interceptions since replacing the injured Josh Jackson behind center. The Hurricanes will arrive with the nation's No. 4 overall defense (269 yards per game) and No. 2 passing defense (134 ypg).\n\nCHAIN GANG\n\nThe Hurricanes penchant for creating turnovers gained great notoriety last season when they unveiled the turnover chain worn by any player who came up with a turnover. They have caused 20 turnovers this season, 14th among FBS teams, but have also turned the ball over 19 times. They lead foes in points off turnovers 79-52.\n\nRED ZONE\n\nThe Hurricanes have allowed their opponents just 13 touchdowns in 29 trips inside their 20 yard-line, or 45 percent. The Hokies have converted 20 of 27 trips inside the red zone into touchdowns, or 74 percent.\n\nWHERE'S DAMON?\n\nDamon Hazleton, a transfer WR from Ball State, leads the Hokies with 40 receptions for 687 yards and has made them count. Hazleton leads the ACC with eight touchdown catches. His next touchdown reception will break a tie with Ricky Hall (1998) for most touchdown catches by a Hokies player in his first season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I don't know if it's necessarily anything that a defense is doing to slow him down, because he's still got a lot of production. He's still very dangerous. It's a different team than they had last year. The pieces around him are different, but he's still a great player. He's fun to watch.\"\n\nPenn State moved up to No. 14 in the CFP this week after beating Wisconsin and it might get a New Year's Six game for a third straight season by beating Rutgers and Maryland to close out the season.\n\nIt's been an up-and-down season for Penn State. It won its first four games and is 3-3 in the last six, losing to No. 4 Michigan, No. 8 Ohio State and Michigan State.\n\n\"So I think we're back on that track right now,\" coach James Franklin said. \"I think last week was an example of that. And we need to do that again this week.\"\n\nThings to watch when the Nittany Lions and Scarlet Knights meet at HighPoint.com Stadium.\n\nLINES\n\nPenn State leads the Big Ten in both sacks (3.4) and tackles for loss (7.4) per game, ranking sixth and 19th nationally, respectively. Defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos has at least half a sack in five straight games. Rutgers has allowed 1.20 sacks per game to rank second in the league and 17th nationally.\n\nSENIORS\n\nRutgers will honor seniors DB Blessuan Austin, DL Jon Bateky, OL Tariq Cole, DB Saquan Hampton, OL Zack Heeman, DB Kiy Hester, RB Jonathan Hilliman, P Nick Johnston, LB Trevor Morris, QB Rob Nittolo, QB Giovanni Rescigno, LB Deonte Roberts, DL Muhammad Wainwright, TE Jerome Washington, DB Isaiah Wharton and DL Kevin Wilkins before the game.\n\nRUTGERS RUNNING\n\nHalfback Isiah Pacheco had a career-high 142 yards rushing, including an 80-yard TD run, against No. 4 Michigan last weekend. It was the third highest by a Scarlet Knight against a ranked opponent and the 80-yard TD run was the longest by a freshman in school history. He also had 213 all-purpose yards.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nPenn State has won 11 straight against Rutgers and 26 of 28 in the series. The Nittany Lions won 35-6 last season. The Scarlet Knights last win was in 1988.\n\nNITTANY LIONS RUNNING\n\nMiles Sanders is one of 18 players in FBS to surpass 1,000 yards rushing this season. He hit the milestone last week when he gained 159 yards in the win over Wisconsin. He has carried 166 times for 1,007 yards and nine touchdowns this season.

(Photo: Walmart)\n\nHaving programs and initiatives in place to empower employees isn\u2019t a new concept \u2014 but while plenty of companies have adopted new training practices and added benefits, one retailer has taken investing in people a step further.\n\nNew technology influences not just how people shop, but how stores stock, manage and analyze their products. To stay ahead, Walmart is investing in that tech \u2013 but also in the associates who will be implementing it.\n\nDollar-a-day higher education, VR training and return to work programs are all keeping associates on top of the latest technologies, leading the way for one of the world\u2019s largest employers to make a difference for people. Here\u2019s a look at how Walmart is putting these programs into action.\n\nAccess to higher education\n\nFlexible programs with Guild Education allow Walmart associates to earn a college degree for just a dollar a day. (Photo: Walmart)\n\nWith the cost of a college education clocking in at around $40,000 for a four-year public tuition (and even more for private institutions), advancing your career with a degree can come with years of debt. Walmart recognized both the benefit of growing associates through continued education, and the need to make it more affordable and accessible. The answer? A program that gives Walmart associates access to college degrees for just a dollar a day, while also providing navigation and coaching by Guild Education.\n\n\u201cInvesting in the personal and professional success of our associates is vital to Walmart\u2019s future,\u201d said Greg Foran, CEO of Walmart U.S. \u201cWe know training and learning opportunities empower associates to deliver for customers while growing and advancing in their careers.\u201d\n\n\n\nCourses are designed with schedules and skills that keep the company\u2019s full-time workers in mind, and even offer college credit for classes associates take at Walmart Academies.\n\n\n\nTechnology-driven training\n\nWalmart is using the power of VR technology to train and educate associates. (Photo: Walmart)\n\nAs the saying goes, you learn by doing. So it stands to reason that the best way to train new employees is to put them into the scenarios they\u2019ll be dealing with.\n\nThat\u2019s where VR training comes in. Walmart\u2019s latest training technology offers an opportunity for managers and associates to experience real-life situations in a controlled but realistic environment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe great thing about VR is its ability to make learning experiential,\u201d said Andy Trainor, senior director of Walmart U.S. Academies. \u201cWhen you watch a module through the headset, your brain feels like you actually experienced a situation. We\u2019ve seen that VR training boosts confidence and retention while improving test scores 10 to 15%. Even associates who simply watched others experience the training saw the same retention boosts.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the moment, Walmart Academies use more than 45 different VR training modules developed with software from industry leader STRIVR, all of which help associates learn faster and recall more clearly. By the end of the year, every Walmart store will have headsets, making it easier for associates to hone their skills and deliver consistent customer service to shoppers across the U.S.\n\nPutting the best training technology into the hands of associates who most frequently interact with customers inevitably has a positive impact on shoppers\u2019 experiences. It also makes rolling out new initiatives a more seamless task. VR training was first tested outside of the Academies in 10 stores that were receiving new technology, a Pickup Tower, which allows customers to order general merchandise online and retrieve it from the store using a QR code on their phone. The associates who experienced this training were able to learn the information more quickly and retain it better, which made it easy to roll out the new process efficiently for customers.\n\nSupportive return-to-work services\n\nWalmart\u2019s partnership with the Path Forward program helps support associates returning to work. (Photo: Walmart)\n\nProfessional advancement isn\u2019t the only focus when it comes to empowering employees. The company also recognizes the importance of personal milestones and developments that may cause an associate to take a leave of absence.\n\n\n\nWalmart supports any associate who may need help returning to work through a program managed by Path Forward, a non-profit dedicated to easing this tough transition.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Path Forward program is a win-win for everyone on so many levels,\u201d said Bobbie Grafeld, vice president of people for Walmart Labs. \u201cHelping people restart their careers after caregiving is great for individuals and their families, great for the economy and a great opportunity for Walmart to tap highly-skilled, educated and motivated associates.\u201d\n\nBenefits like these mean higher employee retention and satisfaction, which translates to more productive employees.\n\nInvesting outside of Walmart\n\nWalmart is not only strengthening its own workforce. Through its retail opportunity initiative, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have made a $100 million commitment to improve training and mobility for workers outside of Walmart across retail and adjacent sectors. For example, together with the Rockefeller, Joyce, W.K Kellogg and ECMC Foundations, the Walmart Foundation invested in the Employment Technology Fund (ETF). As technology changes the future of jobs, the ETF will help workers learn new skills and land jobs they might not even have known existed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ETF invests in organizations and companies that have developed technology-enabled solutions that help workers overcome barriers that often hold them back from advancing their skills,\u201d said Yigal Kerszenbaum, the fund\u2019s leader. \u201cThe ETF strives to increase equal opportunities for millions of working adults \u2014 many of whom are women, minorities and immigrants.\u201d\n\nAnother initiative within this commitment is a $1 million grant to edX to support the launch of MicroBachelors\u2122 programs \u2014 a stackable series of courses participants can take to acquire career-relevant knowledge and gain 21st century skills. These programs will remove learning challenges for working adults such as cost, time and previous educational experience, and enable them to advance their careers while also pursuing a bachelor's degree.\n\nAll these initiatives send one clear message: Walmart invests in its people and developing the future of retail.\n\nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/walmart/2018/11/16/vr-training-affordable-higher-education-company-committed-empowering-employees/2025051002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Oklahoma QB Murray preparing for possible final home game", "description": "Oklahoma QB Kyler Murray preparing for possible final home game vs Kansas", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/16/oklahoma-qb-murray-preparing-for-possible-final-home-game/38544057/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:15:36Z", "content": "NORMAN, Okla.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Just like that, Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray already could be preparing for his final home game.\n\nMurray is squarely into the Heisman race in his only season as a starter. While not completely closing the door a return for his senior year, it's unlikely Murray will play in Norman again after Saturday's game against Kansas.\n\n\"Might be my last year, but for me it's really another football game,\" he said. \"I don't like my emotions or whatever getting into the way of how I play. It doesn't affect me too much. I've just got to go out there and play my game and lead the guys to a win.\"\n\nMurray waited behind Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield last season, then won the job in fall camp. Murray's current passing efficiency rating is 212.9, with 32 TDs. He's put together what is projected to be the most efficient passing season in FBS history. It would top the mark Mayfield set last year.\n\nMurray also has rushed for 640 yards this season.\n\n\"The thing with him is, when you play a play right, and you defend everyone down the field, that's usually when he turns on and becomes the best, is when he's out scrambling and extending plays,\" Kansas linebacker Joe Dineen, Jr. said.\n\nMurray wants to help the seniors get another Big 12 title - No. 6 Oklahoma (9-1, 6-1, No. 6 CFP) has won three straight. Beating Kansas (3-7, 1-6) would be a critical step toward clinching.\n\n\"Obviously it's important for the seniors, the guys that have put in the work here, paved the way for us to do what we do, and the young guys,\" Murray said. \"It sets an example for how things are done around here. I think it's obviously an important win for us. It's another game to go to the goal we want to get to. \"\n\nHere are some things to watch when the Sooners face the Jayhawks:\n\nONE-TWO PUNCH\n\nOklahoma running backs Kennedy Brooks and Trey Sermon have developed into a dynamic combination. Brooks, a freshman, is averaging 98.2 yards per game and 11.1 yards per carry in league play. Sermon, a sophomore, is averaging 92.1 yards per game in conference play. Together, they have helped the Sooners lead the Big 12 in rushing yards per game.\n\nPOOKA BOO\n\nKansas freshman Pooka Williams is sixth in the Big 12 with 68.9 yards per game in league play and second in all-purpose yardage with 133.9 yards per game. Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley is concerned about him.\n\n\"The young running back, I think has been a difference maker for them, too,\" Riley said. \"Very elusive, using him a lot in the throw game as well.\"\n\nBALL HAWKS\n\nKansas leads the Big 12 in turnover margin, turnovers gained, interceptions, fumbles recovered and defensive touchdowns.\n\n\"They're doing a tremendous job,\" Riley said. \"Clint (Bowen), their defensive coordinator, always thought schematically, has been one of the top guys out there. He puts those guys in position to play. They do a good job of mixing up looks.\"\n\nOKLAHOMA DEFENSE\n\nThe Sooners look to get back on track after giving up 46 points to Texas Tech and 47 to Oklahoma State. Kansas appears to be just what the doctor ordered. The Jayhawks rank ninth in the Big 12 in total offense and scoring offense.\n\nLOPSIDED SERIES\n\nOklahoma seeks its 14th straight win in the series. All of those wins for the Sooners have been by at least 15 points. The Sooners have outscored the Jayhawks 548-146 the past 13 games. Oklahoma has won the past four by a combined score of 203-20.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Duke won 42-35. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The losses have piled up for North Carolina. At least this week, the Tar Heels are playing a team they know how to beat.\n\nUNC looks to snap its six-game slide Saturday when Western Carolina of the FCS visits in a matchup of teams on long losing streaks.\n\nIt's been a difficult past 24 months for North Carolina (1-8), which has lost 15 of its last 20 games \u2014 a slump that started with a loss at Duke on Nov. 10, 2016 \u2014 and is headed for a second straight last-place finish in the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division.\n\nWe need a win,\" coach Larry Fedora said. \"Everybody knows that, and our guys, they deserve it more than anybody. It's not going to be something that just happens. We're going to have to do a great job of preparing this week and preparing for Western Carolina and we're going to have to outplay them.\"\n\nOf the five teams the Tar Heels have beaten in that stretch, they welcome one of them \u2014 the Catamounts (3-7) \u2014 back to Chapel Hill with an eye on beating them again. UNC routed Western Carolina 65-10 in 2017.\n\nAnd even though the Tar Heels are still stinging from a 42-35 loss to Duke and with a visit from neighborhood rival North Carolina State looming next week, UNC knows it can't afford to take a victory \u2014 any victory \u2014 for granted.\n\n\"I don't worry about it. I don't expect that to happen,\" Fedora said. \"I believe that our leadership will do a great job in that locker room and our guys will be ready to go (during practice) and if we do a great job preparing all week, then there won't be a letdown.\"\n\nTURNOVER TALK\n\nNorth Carolina has forced six turnovers in its last two games \u2014 three against both Georgia Tech and Duke \u2014 but managed to turn them into just 10 total points, and failed to score after any of its takeaways against the Blue Devils. \"That's discouraging, because we're constantly harping on creating takeaways by the defense,\" Fedora said.\n\nOPPONENTS RUNNING WILD\n\nThe Tar Heels have the ACC's second-worst defense against the run, allowing nearly 230 yards per game on the ground. They've given up at least 200 yards rushing in each of their last three games, and while yielding a huge number to option-based Georgia Tech isn't a surprise, they also allowed Virginia to rush for 208 yards and Duke to roll up 268 yards on the ground. Western Carolina ranks third in the Southern Conference with an average of 216 yards rushing. \"We're going to have to do a better job of that and not just talk about stopping the run, we're going to have to do it,\" Fedora said.\n\nSCOUTING THE CATAMOUNTS\n\nWestern Carolina has lost seven straight games, and a loss would give the Catamounts their longest losing streak since they dropped 10 in a row in 2012, the first season under coach Mark Speir. They are 0-54 against FBS opponents and 0-29 against ACC schools.\n\nTHE SERIES\n\nThis is the second meeting between the instate schools. QB Nathan Elliott threw four touchdown passes in the first half of last year's rout, and the Tar Heels scored 21 points in 2-minute, 46-second span.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Jeremy Brevard, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nUnpredictable events are often the norm during the college football season, especially as the playoff chase heats up in the final weeks and the stakes get higher.\n\nThe USA TODAY Sports college football staff \u2014 Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Erick Smith and Eddie Timanus \u2014 weighs in with some bold predictions for the games during Week 12.\n\nJace Evans\n\nFor much of the Southeastern Conference it\u2019s \u201ccupcake\u201d week, but a few of the league\u2019s squads still need to be on upset alert against non-conference foes. No. 21 Kentucky, coming off two consecutive losses, is hosting a Middle Tennessee team with an identical 7-3 record. While the Blue Raiders have been handled pretty thoroughly in their two other contests against SEC teams this year, they can put up points in an attack led by senior QB Brent Stockstill. Kentucky has not scored more than 30 points against FBS competition since the season opener, so if Middle Tennessee can string some drives together, this could be a tough contest for the Wildcats. Meanwhile in College Station, Texas A&M is a 17-point favorite against Alabama-Birmingham, and they\u2019re not even the ranked team in the matchup; indeed UAB comes in with a No. 25 ranking in the Amway Coaches Poll after getting off to a 9-1 start. Bill Clark\u2019s Blazers are flat-out good, and Texas A&M should have all it can handle in what should be a fun one at night at Kyle Field.\n\nPaul Myerberg\n\nThe Citadel knocks off Alabama in the greatest upset since David topped Goliath as a heavy underdog. (Oddsmakers didn\u2019t account for David\u2019s ability to make things happen with his arm.) The Tide will win by whatever score they choose, of course.\n\nBut now that I have your attention: I think Syracuse has the offense and momentum to beat Notre Dame in Yankee Stadium and secure a spot in a New Year\u2019s Six bowl. The loss would likely end the Fighting Irish\u2019s shot at a semifinal but they would likewise land in a premier bowl game.\n\nGeorge Schroeder\n\nIt was odd when last week, as Notre Dame prepared to face Florida State without its starting quarterback, the sentiment went like this: That\u2019s OK, the Irish would be fine \u2013 but they needed Ian Book back THIS week against Syracuse. Strange, but also correct, and not only because Florida State is struggling.\n\nNotre Dame gets a Book return, but Syracuse presents a formidable challenge. The Orange pushed Clemson to the limit last month, and with Dino Babers\u2019 adaptation of the old Baylor spread, have the kind of offense that gives even very good defenses fits. Syracuse upsets Notre Dame, ending the Irish\u2019s bid at an undefeated regular season and scrambling the College Football Playoff picture at least a little.\n\nErick Smith\n\nThe most dangerous animals are the ones that are backed into a corner. That perfectly describes the situations at both Florida State and Virginia Tech, the two schools with the longest current bowl streaks in college football.\n\nThe 4-6 Seminoles have no margin for error in their last two games, starting with a visit from No. 22 Boston College. So if they're going to avoid missing out on the postseason for the first time since their 1981 season, they have to get win Saturday. The situation is favorable with the Eagles off a deflating loss to Clemson and starting quarterback Anthony Brown uncertain due to an abdominal injury.\n\nThe Hokies have a 25-season bowl run on the line and must win at home against both Miami (Fla.) and rival Virginia unless they find an opponent for a 12th game on Dec. 1. The problem for Tech has been its defense. The good news is the Hurricanes have been awful on offense, giving some hope to its beat-up unit.\n\nLook for both these proud programs to find a way to win and make the final weekend of the regular season dramatic.\n\nEddie Timanus\n\nIt would appear to be a drama-free weekend around SEC country, with most league members hosting non-conference opponents to tune up for Rivalry Week.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. One member in such a game will come up short on its home field.\n\nNo, it won\u2019t be Texas A&M, though the Aggies might of bitten off more than they\u2019d thought by inviting Alabama-Birmingham to College Station. The Blazers are the ranked team going into the game but probably won\u2019t stay that way, as the Aggies are in need of a tight effort with a finale against LSU looming.\n\nKentucky, on the other hand, looks more vulnerable. The Wildcats have struggled to put points on the board even when they were winning. They didn\u2019t respond well when their SEC championship aspirations were dashed by Georgia. They dropped their next contest at Tennessee, extending a streak of offensive futility in which they\u2019ve now failed to score more than 17 points for five consecutive games.\n\nEnter Middle Tennessee. The Blue Raiders didn\u2019t fare well against SEC competition earlier this season, but they have a veteran quarterback in Brent Stockstill who could give the Cats trouble if they are slow out of the gate. In the end, it just means more \u2013 to MTSU."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Auburn tries to regroup vs Liberty in between rivalry games", "description": "Just when Auburn's offense needed a pick-me-up, here comes Liberty", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/16/auburn-tries-to-regroup-vs-liberty-in-between-rivalry-games/38544055/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4496f358ad8a7677a6feb2bfe2f88fc891cec3bc/c=0-160-3635-2205/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/596fc5f01e2f4dae8b1ab1bf88b51710.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:11:00Z", "content": "Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn reacts after an Auburn penalty during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Georgia, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Athens, Ga.

(AP) \u2014 Just when Auburn's offense needed a pick-me-up, here comes Liberty.\n\nThe Tigers (6-4) continued to sputter offensively in a loss at No. 5 Georgia. Now, they face Liberty (4-5), which is allowing 39 points and 508.8 yards per game. So it at least shapes up to be a more promising matchup.\n\nAuburn could need a good offensive day to avoid an upset or scare against a team averaging 35 points a game. The Tigers haven't managed 300 total yards in either of their past two games and couldn't generate needed big plays in a 27-10 loss to the Bulldogs .\n\n\"We need to play well,\" Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. \"We need to be better on third downs. You look at the last game, and it all goes to third down. We weren't very good on defense on third down. We weren't very good on offense on third down.\n\n\"I think that's probably the biggest deal. We need to score points.\"\n\nThe Flames have allowed 107 points in back-to-back losses to Virginia and Massachusetts. They've also struggled against the run, where Auburn has been among the least productive offenses in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThe Tigers haven't topped 34 points in any game against an FBS opponent this season. It led to Malzahn already facing questions from reporters about his offense next season, when he vowed it would be better.\n\nNow, it needs to deliver to avoid a potential upset \u2014 or at least a closer-than-expected game \u2014 against Liberty, a four-touchdown underdog. After that, the Tigers visit No. 1 Alabama.\n\nLiberty has already knocked off another Alabama team, Troy. Flames coach Turner Gill says the big question is, \"Can we match that speed?\"\n\nAnd can they avoid mistakes?\n\n\"We cannot have any turnovers,\" Gill said. \"We need to have zero turnovers and we probably need to get about three-plus turnovers to give us a chance to be successful in this ball game.\"\n\nAuburn will be without top pass rusher Nick Coe, who has a wrist injury.\n\nHere are some other things to know about the Liberty-Auburn game:\n\nAUBURN SENIORS\n\nAuburn's 16 seniors will be honored before the game. The group includes H-back Chandler Cox, linebacker Deshaun Davis, wide receiver Ryan Davis and defensive tackle Dontavius Russell.\n\n\"When I think of this group, there's a lot of real classy young men with high character,\" Malzahn said. \"They've done a good job with their leadership this year. Everything hasn't gone as well as planned, as you know, but they've really done a super job from the leadership standpoint. I really feel strong that we need to come out and play good football for those guys in their last home game being Senior Day.\"\n\nFIRST-TIMERS\n\nLiberty marks the third team Auburn has faced for the first time this season, including Washington and Alabama State. Liberty is the 83rd team among the 129 FBS members that Auburn has played. The Flames have never played an SEC team.\n\nRED ZONE D\n\nAuburn's defense has allowed a touchdown on just 29 percent (9 of 31) of opponents' trips inside the 20, which leads the nation.\n\nLIBERTY'S OFFENSE\n\nLiberty is averaging 35.4 points per game while topping 40 five times this season. Tennessee is the only team to score 30 against the Tigers, who are allowing 18.3 points on average.\n\nPROLIFIC RECEIVERS\n\nLiberty receiver Antonio Gandy-Golden has four 100-yard games this season and needs 118 receiving yards to reach 1,000 for the second straight season. Auburn's Ryan Davis hasn't had a big season but became the program's career leader with 165 receptions after collecting 13 catches for 72 yards against Georgia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Blazers have won a school-record eight straight games and clinched their first C-USA West Division title with an overtime win against Southern Miss last week.\n\nTexas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher knows the Aggies can't take this game lightly because of the resurgence of UAB, which shut down its football program for six months after the 2014 season for financial reasons.\n\n\"This is a great football team,\" he said. \"They can flat-out play.\"\n\nUAB coach Bill Clark took a little time to appreciate the accomplishment his team made in winning the division title, but soon shifted his focus to the Aggies.\n\n\"It really is that sweet. It really is that good,\" he said. \"Of course, it doesn't slow us down from how hard we're going to work. We know what is in front of us.\"\n\nUAB linebacker Fitzgerald Mofor agreed with his coach and shared the team's mindset after winning eight games in a row.\n\n\"There's never a feeling that we are complacent or that we have arrived,\" he said. \"There's never that feeling because we still have three games left. The plan is always to win as many games as we can. We never feel like we've arrived.\"\n\nThe Aggies (6-4) scored their most points in conference play this season in a 38-24 win over Mississippi last week to snap a two-game skid. Trayveon Williams ran for 228 yards and Kellen Mond threw for three touchdowns and ran for a fourth to lead Texas A&M.\n\nNow A&M will face a UAB defense that ranks in the top five in the nation in several defense categories. The Blazers lead the country with a school-record 38 sacks, rank third in total defense (260.7 yards a game) and fourth in both scoring defense (13.2 points) and yards passing allowed (153.8).\n\n\"When you take all the things together on defense they may be the best defense in the country,\" Fisher said. \"They're coming in here with a very, very good defensive football team.\"\n\nSome things to know about UAB's visit to Texas A&M.\n\nNEARLY RANKED\n\nUAB keeps inching closer to a ranking in the AP poll. The Blazers haven't been ranked since debuting at No. 24 in the initial BCS rankings on Oct. 16, 2004.\n\nRUNNING WILD\n\nWilliams has a career-high 1,159 yards rushing which leads the SEC. Williams, who is second in the SEC with 11 rushing touchdowns, had his second 200-yard rushing game this season last week and has accumulated 3,014 yards rushing in three seasons with the Aggies. Fisher shared what he believes makes Williams special. \"His competitive nature. His ability to want to lead and be great,\" Fisher said. \"I think he has a drive inside of him. You can see it when he runs.\"\n\nUAB QUARTERBACKS\n\nIt's unclear who will start at quarterback for UAB on Saturday. Redshirt freshman Tyler Johnston has started the past two games and topped 200 passing yards in both. A.J. Erdely has been out with a shoulder injury sustained against UTEP.

(Photo: Elise Amendola, AP)\n\nA USA Gymnastics executive who helped provide a cover story for Larry Nassar has stepped down.\n\nRon Galimore was chief operating officer, the second-highest ranking official at USA Gymnastics. His departure, announced Friday, comes as the U.S. Olympic Committee tries to strip USA Gymnastics of its national governing body status in the wake of the Nassar crisis.\n\nNassar, the longtime team physician for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State, is serving an effective life sentence after being convicted of federal child pornography and state sexual abuse charges. More than 350 young women and girls have said Nassar abused them under the guise of medical treatment.\n\nUSA Gymnastics said Galimore resigned voluntarily, but did not give any further explanation. Its board currently is weighing whether to give up its governing body status voluntarily or try to prove to the USOC that it can move past the Nassar scandal, with people and policies that make athlete protection guiding the organization.\n\n\"Gymnastics has been the center of my life since I was a kid.\" Galimore, a member of the 1980 Olympic team, said in a statement provided to USA TODAY Sports late Friday. \"I resigned from my position with both a degree of sadness but also the hope that my departure may aid USA Gymnastics in pursuing its vision for a new beginning as it undergoes restructuring with a renewed sense of focus on creating a safe place for children to learn gymnastics.\"\n\nThat Galimore remained with USA Gymnastics until now was a source of anger and frustration for the survivors of Nassar\u2019s abuse, who said it showed the federation was not sincere about changing a culture that allowed a sexual predator to thrive.\n\nIn May, The Indianapolis Star reported that Galimore was involved in coordinated efforts by Nassar and USA Gymnastics to conceal his dismissal by the federation.\n\nMORE: Ex-USA Gymnastics national team member alleges that Larry Nassar abused her\n\nSarah Jantzi, the coach of Maggie Nichols, reported Nassar to USA Gymnastics in June 2015 after overhearing Nichols and another gymnast talking about Nassar\u2019s \u201ctreatments.\u201d USA Gymnastics waited more than a month while it did its own investigation before alerting the FBI. It barred Nassar from attending the U.S. Classic and the national championships during that time.\n\nIn the emails obtained by IndyStar, a member of the USA TODAY Network, then-USA Gymnastics attorney Scott D. Himsel told Nassar that Galimore would explain Nassar\u2019s absences to the medical staff, using their agreed-upon stories.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let Ron know to advise people that you weren't feeling well and decided to stay home,\" Himsel told Nassar before the Classic.\n\nA few weeks later, Himsel wrote that Galimore would again tell the medical staff that Nassar would not be attending the national championships, suggesting it be for personal reasons. Nassar asked that it instead be attributed to the demands of his clinical practice.\n\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Himsel responded, \"Ron will proceed accordingly. USAG will be back in touch when it reaches the appropriate point in its review.\"\n\nGalimore did not address the emails directly Friday, but said he has met with investigators. Boston law firm Ropes & Gray is investigating USA Gymnastics' and the U.S. Olympic Committee's handling of the Nassar abuse allegations.\n\n\"I want to be clear that my resignation was not associated in any manner with the online discourse and media reports that have tried to link me to an effort to shield Nassar from scrutiny,\" Galimore said in his statement. \"I have spoken with investigators and been deposed concerning these matters, and am confident that I have always acted responsibly and with the best interests of athletes in mind.\"\n\nThough Galimore has kept a lower profile in recent months, he maintained his seat on the International Gymnastics Federation\u2019s executive committee, a powerful role in the sport. He is the only American on the seven-person committee and, in that capacity, awarded some of the medals at the world championships earlier this month.\n\nThe FIG did not respond to an email from USA TODAY Sports on Friday seeking comment on Galimore's status with the international federation."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Nicole Gaudiano and Eliza Collins, USA TODAY", "title": "'Awakening': Abigail Spanberger's House win illustrates the shift of US politics in 'year of the badass woman'", "description": "'Awakening': Va. win symbolic of US political shift", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/midterm-elections-2018-spanberger-win-shows-last-decade-politics/1999019002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/61aed024-4893-41a1-8aa3-cd1270187343/61aed024-4893-41a1-8aa3-cd1270187343_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:02:43Z", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Even when analysts called her race a \u201ctoss-up,\u201d Abigail Spanberger said she never doubted she would win her bid to represent Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District.

But to Spanberger, who grew up there, it felt as though there had been \u201can awakening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this ever-sort-of-unfolding thing,\u201d she told USA TODAY. \u201cThere were protests, there were vigils. When the travel ban came out, there were people in the street.\n\n\u201cI participated in everything,\u201d she said at a coffee shop in Washington, D.C., during a break in new-member orientation.\n\nSpanberger beat the incumbent Rep. Dave Brat by 2 percentage points. In hindsight, her win makes sense, given the dynamics of this election.\n\nWell over half of the winners in House districts the Democrats flipped were women. Democrats like Spanberger made inroads with women and wealthy voters in the suburbs with a campaign message that was laser-focused on affordable health care. And several like Spanberger \u2013 a former undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative \u2013 ran on their military and national security backgrounds.\n\nSpanberger may have been helped in part by some factors specific to her race. Redistricting in 2016 brought some different voters into the district, and the GOP candidate at the top of the ticket \u2013 Senate hopeful Corey Stewart \u2013 could have been a drag on down-ballot contests.\n\nBut on the whole, what happened in her district is not only emblematic of this election but of political shifts across the USA for the last decade, leading up to the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIn this district, the tea party ousted the Republican establishment,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant who grew up in the district. \u201cThen Trump took over the Republican Party, and now the suburbs have thrown Trump\u2019s \u2018yes men\u2019 out. It\u2019s the story of the last decade in politics that can be seen in Richmond.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Spanberger\u2019s victory reflects those dynamics:\n\n\u2018Laws of political gravity\u2019\n\nFor more than a dozen years, the GOP\u2019s Eric Cantor represented the district, winning re-election with ease. He rose to become the House Majority Leader in 2011 after helping engineer the Republican takeover of the House.\n\nBut shortly after the tea party revolution helped flip control of the House, it became a force in the district\u2019s 2014 GOP primary, with former economics professor Dave Brat ousting the more mainstream Cantor in a stunning upset.\n\nFormer House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., speaks during a news conference June 11, 2014, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Cantor lost a primary challenge from tea party candidate Dave Brat in 2014. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\nBrat joined the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus and spent much of his time in the chamber trying to pull legislation farther right, even when that conflicted with GOP leadership's goals. Brat declined multiple requests to comment for this story.\n\nMo Elleithee, founding executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said Brat \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be sustainable\u201d in office.\n\n\u201cThe laws of political gravity were going to pull him down at some point. The question was just, when? And it turns out the political winds along with a very disciplined candidate in Spanberger were able to tap into that,\u201d said Elleithee, a longtime Democratic strategist who worked on multiple statewide Virginia races.\n\nThe district is conservative, reliably voting for GOP presidential candidates, including Trump. Republicans should have never lost, but in this election, most of the \u201cbetter\u201d Republican incumbents \u201csurvived the landslide and the worst candidates did not,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster.\n\n\u201c(Brat) defeated a very popular incumbent, and there were Republicans who were never really happy with that,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster. \u201cAnd he never really worked the district as well as he could have. ... That\u2019s one of the seats that the GOP will target in 2020 to win back.\u201d\n\nRep. Dave Brat, R-Va., gestures during a debate with Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger at Germanna Community College in Culpeper, Virginia, on Oct. 15, 2018. Spanberger beat Brat on Election Day. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)\n\n\u2018Women are in my grill\u2019\n\nAfter a couple of contentious town halls turned rowdy, Brat\u2019s team \u2013 and other Republicans across the country \u2013 eventually decided to stop hosting them altogether. Instead, Brat focused on smaller more controlled events and meetings, but he was still frustrated by what had happened.\n\n\u201cSince Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,\u201d Brat was caught on tape saying in early 2017.\n\nWelcome to the \u201cyear of the woman.\u201d Wait, that was 1992, when a then-record 47 women were elected to the House. This may be the \"year of the badass woman.\" You know, those who sling credentials such as former military helicopter pilot or rock climber or, in Spanberger's case, former undercover CIA operative who happens to also be a mom and activist.\n\nSpanberger was one of the suburban moms who had been at the town halls. She was upset with Brat\u2019s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt was among the many reasons that motivated a record number of women to run for office this year, resulting in more women lawmakers who will serve next Congress than ever before.\n\nNewly elected Democratic members of the House of Representatives Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, center, Mikie Sherrill, left, of New Jersey and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania take a selfie in front of the U.S. Capitol following an official class picture of new representatives on Nov. 14, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)\n\nOf the 88 newcomers to the House, 35 are women and all but one of those women is a Democrat. In Virginia, all three of the districts that flipped from red to blue were won by women.\n\n\u201cFor many of them, I think there was an effort to have a really personal connection with voters,\u201d Spanberger said.\n\nWomen notably brought all aspects of their lives to the campaign trail, including their children. Spanberger did that, but not without hesitation. She didn\u2019t want to be \u201ctoo much of a mom\u201d on the campaign trail, worrying that she\u2019d have to justify the balancing act to voters. She also didn\u2019t want to take away their privacy too early.\n\nBut as the campaign went on, she began including her children in conversations with voters. And it was an asset.\n\n\u201cI started hearing people say, \u2018I love that you have this experience and that you\u2019re so passionate \u2013 and that you\u2019re a mom,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I heard it from men and women.\u201d\n\nHealth care front and center\n\nSpanberger didn\u2019t hesitate when asked what was important to voters this election: health care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the number one,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, after spending the last eight years running from the issue, Democrats ran on it this election, forcefully. They capitalized on Republicans\u2019 failed efforts to pass legislation last year that would have unraveled many of Obamacare\u2019s popular consumer protections, done away with the individual mandate and overhauled the insurance market.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like the cost of Obamacare or the instability that it created, but because Republicans were so public about it, the Republicans came to own the issue,\u201d said Luntz, the GOP strategist and pollster. \u201cI think it\u2019s not something they expected at the time.\u201d\n\nOverturning the 2010 law had been a potent campaign issue for Republicans \u2013 including Brat \u2013 until this election. A major pillar of his 2014 campaign was the promise to repeal the health care law \u2013 and it was critical to his undoing.\n\nSpanberger had been considering a run but made her decision the day of the House vote. She remained almost singularly focused on the topic during her campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople in this district were far less interested in Donald Trump\u2019s latest conspiracy theory than they were with protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And that\u2019s what you saw in suburban districts all across the country,\u201d said Ferguson, the Democratic strategist.\n\nMore: Midterm results 2018: How Trump\u2019s 2016 election set the stage for the female wave\n\nMore: Wealthy suburban voters, women: How Democrats captured the House in the 2018 midterms\n\nSuburban backlash\n\nSpanberger\u2019s support in a swanky part of the Richmond suburbs seemed to catch people by surprise, she noticed.\n\n\u201cPeople would say, \u2018Oh my Goodness, I\u2019ve seen your signs on River Road,\u2019\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cThere\u2019s that level of \u2018Who would have thought?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn another era, those signs likely would have boosted a Republican. But the suburbs are changing.\n\nWhen he was Virginia\u2019s governor from 2006 to 2010, Tim Kaine said, the 7th District was the most Republican and had the highest turnout in congressional races. But he wasn\u2019t surprised when Spanberger won.\n\n\u201cThe suburbs are growing faster than the rural parts of the district, and suburban voters are more and more likely to go Dem,\u201d said Kaine, now a Democratic U.S. senator representing the state.\n\nDemocratic candidate to represent Virginia's seventh Congressional district in the US House of Representatives Abigail Spanbergerposes for a picture with supporters after declaring victory over Republican incumbent Representative Dave Brat, at an election night watch party in Richmond, Va.

(Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA-EFE)\n\nHere's a fun fact about those suburbs: The majority of the House seats that flipped from Republicans to Democrats this election cycle contain a Whole Foods Market, notes Dave Wasserman, the U.S. House editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The store caters to female, well-educated, upper-class shoppers \u2013 the exact demographic a USA TODAY analysis found propelled Democratic wins across the country.\n\nSuburban areas are drawing more college-educated professionals who may be fiscally conservative but are socially liberal, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. The party of Donald Trump isn\u2019t a fit for many of these voters, he said.\n\n\u201cInstead of a polished, well-educated fiscal conservative party, they\u2019re faced with an in-your-face, rude and offensive party and that\u2019s quite a contrast,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s caused people to rethink their affiliations. That\u2019s not the (way of the) suburbs.\u201d\n\nAs Trump took hold of the party, suburban voters walked away, Ferguson said.\n\n\u201cEveryone who was looking for a blue wave or red wave \u2013 a lot of what we saw was a suburban tsunami,\u201d he said. \u201cThis district was a big part of that.\u201d\n\nContributing: Matt Wynn\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/midterm-elections-2018-spanberger-win-shows-last-decade-politics/1999019002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY 10Best, 10Best Editors, USA TODAY 10Best", "title": "This resort is saving the world with seawater", "description": "The Brando luxury resort in French Polynesia takes environmental stewardship seriously.

Dillon is among the top running backs in the country and has been the driving force in Boston College's success this season. The only thing that has slowed down the sophomore has been an injured ankle.\n\nDillon, a 240-pound sophomore, has run for 936 yards and eight touchdowns in just eight games. He missed two games in October due to the ankle injury but averages 5.3 yards per carry.\n\n\"He has good vision and feet,\" first-year FSU defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett said. \"He's very nimble to be so big. I think those are great qualities of a good running back. He's not a slow, big guy. He can run.\"\n\nFlorida State couldn't stop Dillon in 2017. As a freshman, Dillon ran for 149 yards and a touchdown in BC's 35-3 rout of the Seminoles. Now Florida State (4-6, 2-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) must minimize the damage that Dillon inflicts if they hope to defeat No. 22 BC (7-3, 4-2) and keep the Seminoles' bowl hopes alive.\n\nDillon is ranked 25th in the FBS in rushing yards despite missing two games. And he is ninth in rushing yards per game (117.0).\n\nBC coach Steve Addazio said that Dillon practiced more this week than usual. Dillon often rests his ankle in practices early in the week but was a full participant on Wednesday, Addazio said.\n\n\"Those are all positive things,\" Addazio said. \"He's not completely healed yet. But we'll take the improvement and the opportunity to get him back on the practice field.\"\n\nSince returning from injury, in which BC lost at NC State and defeated Louisville, Dillon ran for 149 yards in the win over Miami on Oct. 26 and 96 yards in a victory over Virginia Tech. He re-injured the ankle in the fourth quarter of Saturday's loss to Clemson after rushing for just 39 yards on 16 carries.\n\nDillon will be quite a handful for the Seminoles. Florida State has allowed 122, 177 and 365 rushing yards in consecutive losses to Clemson, NC State and Notre Dame.\n\nTaggart said for Florida State it's a \"want to\" stop Dillon.\n\n\"Our guys see it, they watch the same film,\" Taggart said. \"You know going in it's going to be a physical ball game, you can't bow down to that physicality you got to face physicality with physicality.\"\n\nSome other things to look for when Florida State hosts No. 22 Boston College:\n\nQUICK RETURN\n\nBC quarterback Anthony Brown suffered an abdominal injury when he was tackled by Clemson defensive lineman Christian Wilkins in Saturday's game. Brown had initially been considered day-to-day but has practiced for the Eagles leading up to the matchup with the Seminoles.\n\n\"Anthony Brown is doing great. Had a great day of practice (Wednesday) and looks terrific,\" Addazio said. \"A tough guy.\"\n\nNO DOUBT ABOUT FRANCOIS\n\nDeondre Francois will be Florida State's starting quarterback \"unless something dramatic happens,\" Taggart said.\n\nFrancois completed 23 of 47 passes for 216 yards and an interception in the 42-13 loss at Notre Dame on Saturday. Francois has played well at times this season, throwing for 300 or more yards in wins over Samford, Northern Illinois and Wake Forest. But he completed just 47.2 percent of his passes against Clemson and 48.9 percent of his passes at Notre Dame.\n\n\"I don't see a reason for him not to be our starter right now,\" Taggart said. \"Deondre is not the issue with our football team. There's a lot of other issues. He can't block for himself, he can't go and catch the ball, he can't play special teams, he can't tackle. If Deondre was an issue, we would do something about it.\"\n\nBANGED-UP LINE\n\nFlorida State started a ninth different offensive line combination in 10 games this season, which is the most of any Power 5 team. Landon Dickerson, considered the team's top lineman, has played in just two games this year due to an ankle injury and Taggart said there is no timetable for him to return to practice. Guard Cole Minshew (neck stinger) could miss his second straight game. Redshirt freshman Brady Scott had started six straight games before the coaches opted not to play him at Notre Dame. It's not clear if Scott will play vs. BC.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They're going to have more guys with stars by their name in terms of recruiting rankings,\" Bloomgren said. \"But every week in college football, you see a team go into one of those places and you see the score on your phone and you go, 'Wow, those dudes beat them?'\"\n\nSome other prominent story lines in the Rice-LSU meeting:\n\nBALL HAWKS\n\nBoth teams' defensive backfields have had highlights this season. LSU's defense has 16 interceptions, which leads the SEC and ranks second in the nation. Tigers safety Grant Delpit has intercepted five passes in his sophomore season. Rice true freshman Prudy Calderon has started the last six games and has intercepted four passes, including two last week at Louisiana Tech.\n\nBALL SECURITY\n\nWhile the Tigers have been relatively good at protecting the football, it's been a problem for Rice. LSU still is in single digits in lost turnovers through 10 games. Quarterback Joe Burrow has been intercepted just four times and the Tigers have lost five total fumbles. By contrast, Rice QB Shawn Stankavage threw three interceptions last week alone, bringing his total to 10 for the season. In total, Rice has turned the ball over 23 times on 16 interceptions and seven lost fumbles. \"We're trying to grow. We're trying to stay in a world of ball security,\" Bloomgren said.\n\nDEATH VALLEY DREAMING\n\nLSU rarely loses night games at 102,000-seat Tiger Stadium, known to be as loud and difficult a road an environment as there is in college football \u2014 not that Bloomgren seems too worried. Quite the contrary.\n\n\"Everyone has dreamed about it. I dreamed about it as a kid, getting the chance to go in there and play. It's going to be a ton of fun,\" Bloomgren asserted. \"We can't come out of the tunnel and let Death Valley or Mike the Tiger score points for them. We've got to make them line up across from us, go toe-to-toe and earn everything they get. And we've got to give it back to them. That's what I expect.\"\n\nKICKING IT\n\nLSU kicker Cole Tracy, a graduate transfer from Division II Assumption College, ranks first among all active collegiate kickers with 90 career field goals. Tracy arrived at LSU with 68 made field goals in his career and has added 22 at LSU, which leads the SEC and ranks No. 2 in the nation.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Officials in the Donald Trump administration have now learned the lesson taught many of their predecessors.\n\nBeware the power of the first lady.\n\nMelania Trump basically forced out a top national security official this week, a reminder to many that first ladies wield a unique kind of power.\n\n\"It is really surprising to see that anybody at the White House would take on the first lady so directly,\" said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush.\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday that deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel will be moved to another job, a day after Mrs. Trump took the extraordinary step of publicly calling for her removal.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" the Tuesday statement from that office said.\n\nPrevious first ladies have weighed in on policy and personnel \u2013 Nancy Reagan famously got rid of White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan in 1987 \u2013 but they usually act behind the scenes, speaking with reporters on background.\n\nMelania Trump's public statement about Mira Ricardel appears to be unprecedented.\n\nThis even though the two have never met.\n\nMost of it stems from a dispute between Ricardel and Mrs. Trump's staff over the first lady's trip to Africa last month, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in recent days to discuss a sensitive issue that has left bruised feelings in both the West Wing and the East Wing.\n\nRicardel wanted seats aboard the first lady's plane for her and an aide, officials said. Mrs. Trump's staff said there was no room and that aides from throughout the government had been left off the manifest because of limited space.\n\nWhen aides suggested that Ricardel and others fly ahead and meet Mrs. Trump in Africa, she reacted angrily (and did not make the trip).\n\nSome officials accused Ricardel of leaking false stories and spreading rumors about the first lady's spending habits, though other officials dispute that.\n\nOfficials did not dispute that other people, beyond the first lady's office, have complained about what they consider to be Ricardel's abrasive, yelling manner.\n\nDefenders of Ricardel said she may be a tough administrator, but she is a top-notch planning and policy person who will serve the president well wherever she winds up. These officials said Mrs. Trump's statement blindsided many people on Trump's staff and was unfair in general.\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton, who hired Ricardel in April, is in Asia this week, traveling with Vice President Mike Pence. From a distance, he tried to save Ricardel's job, but Trump opted to transfer her out and try to provide a smooth landing.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Ricardel \"will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nSanders added that Trump \"is grateful for Ms. Ricardel\u2019s continued service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities.\"\n\nAsked in Asia about the Ricardel incident, Pence said he has \u201cgreat respect for her and her role. I look forward to her new role in another part of the administration.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Ricardel and Melania Trump's staff is only the latest installment in first lady lore.\n\nDuring the last administration, aides to Michelle Obama fought with press secretary Robert Gibbs over the handling of a disputed media report about Mrs. Obama supposedly telling French counterpart Carla Bruni that living in the White House was \"hell.\" (Mrs. Obama and Bruni said the comment was never made.)\n\nIn 1987, Nancy Reagan believed Chief of Staff Regan was out for himself, not the president.\n\nThe last straw for that first lady: The chief of staff hung up on her during an angry phone call. Regan, however, eventually got some revenge: He used his memoir to talk about how Mrs. Reagan used an astrologer to help set the president's schedule.\n\nMcBride, executive in residence with the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said most White House employees know \u2013 or should know \u2013 the power and authority of first ladies.\n\nIf they didn't, she said, \"they certainly learned through this.\"\n\nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/15/donald-trumps-team-learns-old-lesson-careful-first-lady/2011372002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Mike Snider, USA TODAY", "title": "Sony pulls out of E3 video game show as rumors of 2020 PlayStation 5 launch grow", "description": "Sony will not take part in the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June.

(Photo: CHRISTIAN PETERSEN, Getty Images)\n\nSony's decision to pull out of the 2019 Electronic Entertainment Expo has kicked off discussions not only about what it all means for the video game industry's annual shindig, but also for the PlayStation maker's console plans.\n\nThe company's announcement Thursday that it will skip next year's confab, held June 11-13, 2019, in Los Angeles, will make it the first time Sony has not participated in E3 in the show's 24 years. Traditionally, Sony has held an onsite press conference prior to the show's opening and operated a massive booth within the L.A. Convention Center.\n\n\u201cWe have decided not to participate in E3 in 2019,\" the company said in its statement. \"We are exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community in 2019 and can\u2019t wait to share our plans with you.\"\n\n\n\nSony's exodus from E3 led many industry observers to predict something similar next year for a PS4 successor. Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said recently the electronics giant is working on a new console but offered no specifics on a timeline for its market release.\n\nAs development continues on a new console, Sony could be preparing for \"a drop in current-gen development internally and perhaps a decision to hold their cards back for a major reveal event outside of E3, when the news can get all of the attention,\" Variety's Brian Crecente wrote.\n\nNerdist News' Jessica Chobot theorized on Twitter that Sony could try to steal \"all the E3 thunder\" with its own concurrent console announcement or hold its news for a special event.\n\nDamn.\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f.

That's more than the PS3, which sold about 83.8 million, according to GameSpot. The original PlayStation, launched in Japan in 1994 and the U.S. in 1995, sold 102.4 million.\n\nSony will be bringing back the original PlayStation as the \"PlayStation Classic\" in December, selling a slightly modernized version of the vintage system with 20 games for $99.99.\n\nSony isn't the first defection E3 has had to withstand. Nintendo has not held a pre-E3 press conference for several years but has continued to have a major presence on the conference floor.\n\nAnd E3 has also changed by selling tickets to the public beginning two years ago.\n\nNintendo and Microsoft reiterated their support for E3 Thursday after Sony's announcement. \u201cE3 is an outstanding opportunity for us to share new games and experiences with fans and business partners from across the globe,\u201d Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said in a statement.\n\nSaid Microsoft's executive vice president of gaming Phil Spencer: \u201cE3 is an incredible platform to showcase the vibrancy and creativity of the video game industry.

If you frequently hunt down bargains of the same variety, like gas or online purchases, try to find a card that rewards those purchase types most.\n\nA credit card that provides bargains on purchases you don\u2019t make won\u2019t do you any good. Choose the card that rewards the deals you love to find.\n\nWhat is required to get a card for bargains?\n\nCards that bestow rewards upon deal lovers may require good to excellent credit. As a savvy shopper, you should know where your credit stands before you apply. A hard inquiry from a credit card application can cause your credit score to dip a few points.

(AP) \u2014 Florida's postseason possibilities are promising, especially after finishing 4-7 last year, losing consecutive games by a combined 40 points in the last month and needing two of the largest comebacks in school history to beat Vanderbilt and South Carolina.\n\nThe 15th-ranked Gators likely would land a spot in a New Year's Six bowl with victories against Idaho and rival Florida State.\n\nThe first part of Florida's path comes Saturday in the Swamp, when the Gators (7-3, No. 13 CFP) host seemingly overmatched Idaho (4-6) of the Football Championship Subdivision.\n\n\"To be right there, we got to find a way to win the next two weeks and keep that a possibility for us and keep us in that discussion to be one of the top 12 teams in America,\" Florida coach Dan Mullen said. \"Everyone wants to be in the top four to get to the playoffs. If you're not going to make that, you have the opportunity to go to one of the New Year's Six bowls, it's the next best thing and it kind of signifies a great season.\"\n\nThe Gators haven't looked like a great team by any means.\n\nThey had to erase an 18-point deficit to beat the Commodores on the road last month, dropped back-to-back games to Georgia and Missouri in lopsided fashion and then had to rally from 17 down to knock off the Gamecocks last week.\n\nSo Florida could be dealing with a four-game losing streak. Instead, they're on the verge of potentially playing in the Peach Bowl or the Fiesta Bowl.\n\n\"I think it'd be huge, obviously,\" Mullen said. \"There's an awful lot of football to be played. All we can do is try to take care of our business this week and next week. And then it's kind of out of our hands at that point. Obviously, that's a huge honor.\"\n\nThe Gators expect to have a size, speed and talent advantage over the Vandals, who are finishing their season on the road.\n\n\"You've got to come up with everything you can to give your guys the best chance they got,\" Idaho coach Paul Petrino said.\n\nHere are some other things to know about Idaho and Florida:\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nIdaho and Florida are playing more than four years after their first game barely got started and never finished.\n\nThe Vandals kicked off on Aug. 30, 2014, following a three-hour lightning delay. It was the game's only play. More lightning struck, prompting the game to be delayed again. It was declared a no contest around midnight.\n\nFlorida agreed to pay Idaho the full $975,000 for the game.\n\nSENIOR DAY\n\nTwenty Florida players will take part in \"senior day\" festivities before the game.\n\nThe class has been a part of two SEC Eastern Division titles and compiled a 30-18 record, including 21-11 in Southeastern Conference play.\n\n\"Overflow of tears,\" senior defensive end CeCe Jefferson said. \"I'm not even going to try and hold it back. I love this place, you know what I mean? I grew up an hour away from here and everything about me is being a Florida Gator.\n\n\"Will you have me some tissue if you're on the side? Some Kleenex because I'm going to get pretty messy. I might just leave my helmet and run down with my head down, but yeah, lots of tears Saturday.\"\n\nFIRST-TIMERS\n\nFlorida has won 18 consecutive games against first-time opponents.

(AP Photo/Darko Bandic) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 The hype surrounding Luis Enrique and his Spain team didn't last very long.\n\nDisappointing performances in the UEFA Nations League have left \"La Roja\" under scrutiny after what had been a promising start under the new coach.\n\nLuis Enrique was hired to revamp the national team following its early World Cup elimination. He led Spain to impressive victories, including a 2-1 victory over England at Wembley Stadium, a 6-0 win against World Cup-finalist Croatia and a 4-1 victory over Wales in a friendly in Cardiff.\n\nBoth in attack and defense, the team was playing well again. And the solid performances got fans excited about the team's future.\n\nBut the great start was followed by two straight losses: 3-2 to England in Spain's first home defeat in 15 years, and 3-2 at Croatia on Thursday after conceding in stoppage time. The results left Spain having to hope for a draw between England and Croatia at Wembley on Sunday to be able to advance to the final four of Europe's newest competition.\n\n\"The results are what they are,\" Luis Enrique said. \"The group was very difficult, with two of the best national teams in the world. We were less favorites but the first two matches went really well. I'm happy with how we played even though there are things to improve.\"\n\nLuis Enrique implemented some promising changes in his first two matches in charge, making Spain press high and play a more aggressive style. The \"tiki-taka\" passing game was gone, and the focus turned to a more vertical approach in attack.\n\nBut the high defensive line that worked well in the first two games, allowing the team to play aggressively, made Spain become more vulnerable on defense. The team conceded six goals in its last two matches after outscoring opponents 12-2 in the first matches under Luis Enrique.\n\nThe former Barcelona coach said this inconsistency was expected considering Spain is still in the process of replacing the golden generation which helped Spain win two European Championships and a World Cup.\n\n\"We already knew the situation with a change in generation and we are trying to create a team,\" Luis Enrique said. \"There are young players who need confidence and there is a lot of room for improvement.\"\n\nLuis Enrique is not able to count on the likes of Andres Iniesta, David Silva and Gerard Pique, who retired from the national team after the World Cup. He has been gradually experimenting with youngsters.\n\nHe will have a chance to get Spain back on track in a friendly against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday in Las Palmas, the team's final match of the year. The hosts will be without defender Sergio Ramos, who will be rested because of a muscle ailment.\n\nLuis Enrique said he is already planning on getting the team ready for Euro 2020 qualifying, which begins next year.\n\n\"I'm optimistic,\" Luis Enrique said. \"I'd love to see England and Croatia draw so we could play in the final four (of the Nations League), but our goal is the European Championship and to qualify for the tournament with a group of young players.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I need you to reframe your work to include sexual violence. That\u2019s how we take back the narrative. Stop giving your power away to white folks.\"\n\nMore: Election was slam dunk for women in Michigan\n\nMore: Woman wonders why others report #MeToo moments\n\nBurke said she will not let her movement that she founded in 2006 and that has resulted in her getting death threats and having to challenge black leaders to support it, be co-opted by pretty girls and Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThis is not about awareness.

Some began crediting Milano, an actress and activist, with founding the movement.\n\nBurke said last Saturday that she wants people to change the way they view sexual assault and harassment, to stop working in silos as if sexual misconduct isn\u2019t a part of every social justice effort.\n\nShe recalled trying to get community attention focused on helping junior high girls whose stories fueled her work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at the junior high school and I have sixth, seventh and eighth grade girls and more than half of these girls\u2019 lives have been touched by sexual violence,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what we heard back was they need more guidance counselors.\n\n\u201cWe heard every manner of excuse \u2018It\u2019s really about white supremacy because our folks don\u2019t have a history of that kind of thing back in Africa\u2019 or \u2018the real issue isn\u2019t sexual violence, it\u2019s false accusations against black men\u2019 or my personal favorite \u2018This is not a social justice issue; this is a social work issue.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe cited statistic after statistic about women who aren\u2019t famous but attacked because of their gender identity or economic powerlessness. But the worst, she said, was the fate of indigenous and Native American women \u201cthe group we talk about the least,\u201d she said.\n\nShe cited a Justice Department study that found that an estimated one in three Native American women will be assaulted in their lifetimes, that 92 percent of Native American girls reported having been forced to have sex against their will \u2014 and that nine of 10 Native American women and girls who survived rape or sexual assault were attacked by assailants of a different color, most of them white.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a racial justice issue,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, at the end of the day, it\u2019s a human rights issue.\u201d\n\nContact Rochelle Riley: rriley99@freepress.com.

He was not only a successful film writer but a top script doctor, the industry title for an uncredited writer brought in to improve or \u201cpunch up\u201d weak screenplays.\n\nGoldman's \"The Princess Bride\" helped put future \"House of Cards\" actress Robin Wright on the map, along with co-stars Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin. (Photo: NONE, 20th Century Fox/The Kobal Colle)\n\nGoldman also made political history by coining the phrase \u201cfollow the money\u201d in his script for \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d adapted from the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate political scandal. The film starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Standing in the shadows, Hal Holbrook was the mystery man code-named Deep Throat who helped the reporters pursue the evidence. His advice, \u201cFollow the money,\u201d became so widely quoted that few people realized it was never said during the actual scandal.\n\nRobert Redford, left, and Dustin Hoffman brought \"All the President's Men\" to life onscreen as Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. (Photo: GPN)\n\nA confirmed New Yorker, Goldman declined to work in Hollywood. Instead, he would fly to Los Angeles for two-day conferences with directors and producers, then return home to fashion a script, which he did with amazing speed. In his 1985 book, \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade,\u201d he expressed disdain for an industry that elaborately produced and tested a movie, only to see it dismissed by the public during its first weekend in theaters.\n\n\u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d he remarked.\n\nScreenwriter and filmmaker Aaron Sorkin called Goldman a mentor.\n\n\u201cHe was the dean of American screenwriters and generations of filmmakers will continue to walk in the footprints he laid,\u201d Sorkin said in a statement. \u201cHe wrote so many unforgettable movies, so many thunderous novels and works of non-fiction, and while I\u2019ll always wish he\u2019d written one more, I\u2019ll always be grateful for what he\u2019s left us.\u201d\n\nGoldman launched his writing career after receiving a master\u2019s degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. Weary of academia, he declined the chance to earn a Ph.D., choosing instead to write the novel \u201cThe Temple of Gold\u201d in 10 days. Knopf agreed to publish it.\n\n\u201cIf the book had not been taken,\u201d he told an interviewer, \u201cI would have gone into advertising \u2026 or something.\u201d\n\nInstead, he wrote other novels, including \u201cSoldier in the Rain,\u201d which became a movie starring Steve McQueen. Goldman also co-authored a play and a musical with his older brother, James, but both failed on Broadway.\n\nJames Goldman would later write the historical play \u201cThe Lion in Winter,\u201d which he converted to film, winning the 1968 Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nWilliam Goldman had come to screenwriting by accident after actor Cliff Robertson read one of his books, \u201cNo Way to Treat a Lady,\u201d and thought it was a film treatment. After he hired the young writer to fashion a script from a short story, Goldman rushed out to buy a book on screenwriting. Robertson rejected the script but found Goldman a job working on a screenplay for a British thriller.

The couple divorced in 1991.\n\nBorn in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, Goldman grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1952 and served two years in the Army.\n\nDespite all his success as a screenwriter, Goldman always considered himself a novelist and didn\u2019t rate his scripts as great artistic achievements.\n\n\u201cA screenplay is a piece of carpentry,\u201d he once said. \u201cAnd except in the case of Ingmar Bergman, it\u2019s not an art, it\u2019s a craft.\u201d\n\nOscar-winning director Ron Howard called Goldman, \"one of the greatest most successful screenwriters ever,\" adding, \"I was lucky as hell to count Bill as a mentor and a friend.\"\n\nThe \"Apollo 13\" director also advised followers to \"check his credits & see a William Goldman movie or read a Goldman book over the holiday & give thanks that we had his voice in our world.\"\n\nRIP #WilliamGoldman.

I think you and I might be sisters.' I definitely remember she had 'OMG' in there.\"\n\nThe woman who had written that message, Janine Dzyubanny, also was on vacation when she got the notification from 23andMe that a close relative matched her DNA on the website. She sent a message to Jen right away.\n\n\"I didn't know what to say,\" Dzyubanny said. \"I didn't want to scare her away. This was 42 years into my life and I find out I have a sister. It's kind of startling to people.\"\n\nFrantz, 43, grew up with four older brothers in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"I look nothing like my family, so it was something I've always known,\" she said.\n\nShe was born with the name Mi Kyung Han in Seoul, South Korea. Frantz was adopted in the United States when she was 1 year old, and by her account she has had a great American life.\n\nJennifer Frantz as a kid.

She was born Mi Sun Han in South Korea and was adopted when she was 5 months old, growing up with three older brothers.\n\nJanine Dzyubanny as a kid. (Photo: Janine Dzyubanny)\n\nBoth women took DNA tests to learn more about their family medical history, because they didn't have any information about what traits may run in their biological family.\n\nWhat they each found was a stranger who shared 47.9% of her DNA. Siblings who have the same mother and father typically share about half of the same DNA. Once they made the discovery, they began sending several messages back and forth.\n\nThey soon discovered how much they share in common beyond the DNA. They both played softball when they were younger. They both love Labradors, and they're both preschool teachers.\n\nThen came the biggest shock yet. After being born on the other side of the world and growing up in two different states, they now lived just 30 minutes away from each other.\n\nThey decided they must meet.\n\n\"We saw each other and we hugged each other, and it was very emotional,\" Frantz said. \"Very exciting and very surreal, just awesome, all at the same time.\"\n\nThe sisters make sure they get together at least once a week.\n\n\"We both feel like we've missed out on the first 42, 43 years of our lives together,\" Frantz said. \"We're just trying to spend every waking moment together and just kind of make up for all that time.\"\n\nSince then, they've realized that their lives had criss-crossed a few times before they met. They were both adopted through the same U.S. agency when they were young. As adults, they share some of the same acquaintances.\n\nJanine (left) and Jen (right) grew up in different families not knowing about one another. A DNA test proved they are sisters.

Shared DNA aside, the two don't think they look that much alike.\n\n\"Makes me wonder: Does she look more like our father? And do I look more like our mother, or vice versa?\" Dzyubanny said.\n\nThey also want to pass along a message of thanks to their shared mother.\n\n\"Being a mother myself and having two kids, I can only imagine she thinks of us every day and worries about us,\" Frantz said. \"And we know that she loved us because she left us on a police station steps to be found. So to let her know that a) we're OK; and b) we found each other.\"\n\nIn the meantime, they're happy to have each other.\n\n\"I've only known Janine since June, but I already feel like I've known her my whole life,\" Frantz said. \"I just feel like there was an instant connection, and yes, we're still trying to get to know each other, but sometimes I just feel like I've known her forever.

(Photo: Bob Brown, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Even when analysts called her race a \u201ctoss-up,\u201d Abigail Spanberger said she never doubted she would win her bid to represent Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District.\n\nSure, no woman had ever served the central Virginia district, and it\u2019s been in Republican hands since 1971. But to Spanberger, who grew up there, it felt as though there had been \u201can awakening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this ever-sort-of-unfolding thing,\u201d she told USA TODAY. \u201cThere were protests, there were vigils. When the travel ban came out, there were people in the street.\n\n\u201cI participated in everything,\u201d she said at a coffee shop in Washington, D.C., during a break in new-member orientation.\n\nSpanberger beat the incumbent Rep. Dave Brat by 2 percentage points. In hindsight, her win makes sense, given the dynamics of this election.\n\nWell over half of the winners in House districts the Democrats flipped were women. Democrats like Spanberger made inroads with women and wealthy voters in the suburbs with a campaign message that was laser-focused on affordable health care. And several like Spanberger \u2013 a former undercover Central Intelligence Agency operative \u2013 ran on their military and national security backgrounds.\n\nSpanberger may have been helped in part by some factors specific to her race. Redistricting in 2016 brought some different voters into the district, and the GOP candidate at the top of the ticket \u2013 Senate hopeful Corey Stewart \u2013 could have been a drag on down-ballot contests.\n\nBut on the whole, what happened in her district is not only emblematic of this election but of political shifts across the USA for the last decade, leading up to the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIn this district, the tea party ousted the Republican establishment,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant who grew up in the district. \u201cThen Trump took over the Republican Party, and now the suburbs have thrown Trump\u2019s \u2018yes men\u2019 out. It\u2019s the story of the last decade in politics that can be seen in Richmond.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Spanberger\u2019s victory reflects those dynamics:\n\n\u2018Laws of political gravity\u2019\n\nFor more than a dozen years, the GOP\u2019s Eric Cantor represented the district, winning re-election with ease. He rose to become the House Majority Leader in 2011 after helping engineer the Republican takeover of the House.\n\nBut shortly after the tea party revolution helped flip control of the House, it became a force in the district\u2019s 2014 GOP primary, with former economics professor Dave Brat ousting the more mainstream Cantor in a stunning upset.\n\nFormer House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., speaks during a news conference June 11, 2014, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Cantor lost a primary challenge from tea party candidate Dave Brat in 2014. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\nBrat joined the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus and spent much of his time in the chamber trying to pull legislation farther right, even when that conflicted with GOP leadership's goals. Brat declined multiple requests to comment for this story.\n\nMo Elleithee, founding executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said Brat \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be sustainable\u201d in office.\n\n\u201cThe laws of political gravity were going to pull him down at some point. The question was just, when? And it turns out the political winds along with a very disciplined candidate in Spanberger were able to tap into that,\u201d said Elleithee, a longtime Democratic strategist who worked on multiple statewide Virginia races.\n\nThe district is conservative, reliably voting for GOP presidential candidates, including Trump. Republicans should have never lost, but in this election, most of the \u201cbetter\u201d Republican incumbents \u201csurvived the landslide and the worst candidates did not,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster.\n\n\u201c(Brat) defeated a very popular incumbent, and there were Republicans who were never really happy with that,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster. \u201cAnd he never really worked the district as well as he could have. ... That\u2019s one of the seats that the GOP will target in 2020 to win back.\u201d\n\nRep. Dave Brat, R-Va., gestures during a debate with Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger at Germanna Community College in Culpeper, Virginia, on Oct. 15, 2018. Spanberger beat Brat on Election Day. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)\n\n\u2018Women are in my grill\u2019\n\nAfter a couple of contentious town halls turned rowdy, Brat\u2019s team \u2013 and other Republicans across the country \u2013 eventually decided to stop hosting them altogether. Instead, Brat focused on smaller more controlled events and meetings, but he was still frustrated by what had happened.\n\n\u201cSince Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,\u201d Brat was caught on tape saying in early 2017.\n\nWelcome to the \u201cyear of the woman.\u201d Wait, that was 1992, when a then-record 47 women were elected to the House. This may be the \"year of the badass woman.\" You know, those who sling credentials such as former military helicopter pilot or rock climber or, in Spanberger's case, former undercover CIA operative who happens to also be a mom and activist.\n\nSpanberger was one of the suburban moms who had been at the town halls. She was upset with Brat\u2019s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt was among the many reasons that motivated a record number of women to run for office this year, resulting in more women lawmakers who will serve next Congress than ever before.\n\nNewly elected Democratic members of the House of Representatives Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, center, Mikie Sherrill, left, of New Jersey and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania take a selfie in front of the U.S. Capitol following an official class picture of new representatives on Nov. 14, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)\n\nOf the 88 newcomers to the House, 35 are women and all but one of those women is a Democrat. In Virginia, all three of the districts that flipped from red to blue were won by women.\n\n\u201cFor many of them, I think there was an effort to have a really personal connection with voters,\u201d Spanberger said.\n\nWomen notably brought all aspects of their lives to the campaign trail, including their children. Spanberger did that, but not without hesitation. She didn\u2019t want to be \u201ctoo much of a mom\u201d on the campaign trail, worrying that she\u2019d have to justify the balancing act to voters. She also didn\u2019t want to take away their privacy too early.\n\nBut as the campaign went on, she began including her children in conversations with voters. And it was an asset.\n\n\u201cI started hearing people say, \u2018I love that you have this experience and that you\u2019re so passionate \u2013 and that you\u2019re a mom,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I heard it from men and women.\u201d\n\nHealth care front and center\n\nSpanberger didn\u2019t hesitate when asked what was important to voters this election: health care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the number one,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, after spending the last eight years running from the issue, Democrats ran on it this election, forcefully. They capitalized on Republicans\u2019 failed efforts to pass legislation last year that would have unraveled many of Obamacare\u2019s popular consumer protections, done away with the individual mandate and overhauled the insurance market.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like the cost of Obamacare or the instability that it created, but because Republicans were so public about it, the Republicans came to own the issue,\u201d said Luntz, the GOP strategist and pollster. \u201cI think it\u2019s not something they expected at the time.\u201d\n\nOverturning the 2010 law had been a potent campaign issue for Republicans \u2013 including Brat \u2013 until this election. A major pillar of his 2014 campaign was the promise to repeal the health care law \u2013 and it was critical to his undoing.\n\nSpanberger had been considering a run but made her decision the day of the House vote. She remained almost singularly focused on the topic during her campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople in this district were far less interested in Donald Trump\u2019s latest conspiracy theory than they were with protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And that\u2019s what you saw in suburban districts all across the country,\u201d said Ferguson, the Democratic strategist.\n\nMore: Midterm results 2018: How Trump\u2019s 2016 election set the stage for the female wave\n\nMore: Wealthy suburban voters, women: How Democrats captured the House in the 2018 midterms\n\nSuburban backlash\n\nSpanberger\u2019s support in a swanky part of the Richmond suburbs seemed to catch people by surprise, she noticed.\n\n\u201cPeople would say, \u2018Oh my Goodness, I\u2019ve seen your signs on River Road,\u2019\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cThere\u2019s that level of \u2018Who would have thought?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn another era, those signs likely would have boosted a Republican. But the suburbs are changing.\n\nWhen he was Virginia\u2019s governor from 2006 to 2010, Tim Kaine said, the 7th District was the most Republican and had the highest turnout in congressional races. But he wasn\u2019t surprised when Spanberger won.\n\n\u201cThe suburbs are growing faster than the rural parts of the district, and suburban voters are more and more likely to go Dem,\u201d said Kaine, now a Democratic U.S. senator representing the state.\n\nDemocratic candidate to represent Virginia's seventh Congressional district in the US House of Representatives Abigail Spanbergerposes for a picture with supporters after declaring victory over Republican incumbent Representative Dave Brat, at an election night watch party in Richmond, Va.

The store caters to female, well-educated, upper-class shoppers \u2013 the exact demographic a USA TODAY analysis found propelled Democratic wins across the country.\n\nSuburban areas are drawing more college-educated professionals who may be fiscally conservative but are socially liberal, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.

By the end of the day, he was in jail facing 99 years in prison.\n\nA former girlfriend said that two days earlier, he had broken into her home and sliced an \"X\" into her chest with a box cutter.\n\nThe two dated several years earlier, but Precopia couldn't remember the last time the two had contact.\n\nNow he was facing a felony charge: burglary of a habitation with the intent to commit other crimes.\n\n\"I had no idea why everything was happening, and I was lost,\" he said.\n\nPrecopia was taken to the Williamson County Jail, where his parents posted a $150,000 bond. Then they began fighting to prove his innocence.\n\nThe selfie that saved him\n\nOn the night of the alleged attack, Precopia was with his mother, Erin, at a Northwest Austin hotel about 65 miles from the accuser's home.\n\n\"I'm thinking, 'this is awesome. By the grace of God, she said it happened on the day when I can say totally, 100 percent, where he was at,\" Erin Precopia said.\n\nThere were sworn affidavits from several people who were with him that evening, as well as photos posted on Facebook. Those photos were timestamped and geo-located.\n\n\"Most of the time, we deal with gray matters,\" attorney Rick Flores said. \"It's not normally black or white. But this is one of those cases where I could definitely prove he did not commit this offense.\"\n\nGuilty until proven innocent?\n\nPolice experts say in most cases, investigators should try to interview a suspect before filing charges to determine if they have a possible alibi. In Precopia's case, police reports show he returned a phone call to police and left a message before they moved to arrest him.\n\n\"You may not get any more information than you had, but it gives you an opportunity for the suspect to react, respond, deny,\" Bruce Mills, a former Austin assistant police chief and policing consultant, said. \"Certainly a case where the suspect appeared to be available, it would be more step you could take.\"\n\nNine months after Precopia's arrest, Flores said he took the evidence of an alibi to Bell County prosecutors, who dropped the charge \"in the interest of justice.\"\n\nTemple Police wouldn't talk about their handling of the case. Bell County District Attorney Henry Garza said, \"We are always willing to listen and examine new information, and that's exactly what we did in this case.\"\n\nPrecopia's accuser told police that the two had a troubled relationship when they dated in high school several years ago, and she cited that as a reason she reported that he assaulted her.\n\nMore than a year later, Precopia is ready to move forward.\n\n\"I'm ready to actually live my life, the way I want to, without having any kind of worry that this can come back and hurt me,\" he said.\n\nEditor's note: KVUE is not identifying Precopia's accuser because she hasn't been charged with a crime.\n\nMore:\n\nMore: More than 250 have people died while trying to take selfies, study finds\n\nMore: NASA Curiosity rover snaps eye-catching selfie on Mars\n\nMore: 16 iconic celebrity selfies to celebrate National Selfie Day\n\nCLOSE People are literally risking their lives for the \u201cgram.\u201d So what could be so worth it to risk it all for a sensational self-portrait?

(Photo: Family photo)\n\nOAKTON, Va. \u2013 The last time lawyer Erika Byrd talked her way out of an alcohol rehab center, her father took her to lunch.\n\n\"Dad, I know what alcohol has done to me,\" she told him that day in January 2011. \"I know what it has made me do to you and mom. But that wasn\u2019t me.\"\n\nBy the time she died three months later, Byrd had blocked her parents' calls because they kept having her involuntarily committed. They once had a magistrate judge hold a hearing at her hospital bed. He ordered herto undergo a month of in-patient treatment.\n\nByrd, who died in April 2011 at the age of 42, is among the rising number of people in the United States who have been killed by alcohol in the last decade.\n\nIt's an increase that has been obscured by the opioid epidemic. But alcohol kills more people each year than overdoses \u2013 through cancer, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis and suicide, among other ways.\n\nMore: My 'bottom' was being drunk on TV.

The death rate rose 24 percent.\n\nOne alarming statistic: Deaths among women rose 85 percent. Women once drank far less than men, and their more moderate drinking helped prevent heart disease, offsetting some of the harm.\n\nDeaths among men rose 29 percent.\n\nWhile teen deaths from drinking were down about 16 percent during the same period, deaths among people aged 45 to 64 rose by about a quarter.\n\nPeople's risk of dying, of course, increases as they age. What's new is that alcohol is increasingly the cause.\n\n\"The story is that no one has noticed this,\" says Max Griswold, who helped develop the alcohol estimates for the institute. \"It hasn't really been researched before.\"\n\nThe District of Columbia, less than 10 miles away from the Venable law office where Byrd was a partner, had the highest rate of death from alcohol in the country, according to the institute's analysis. Georgia and Alabama came in second and third.\n\nAlabama, in fact, ranked third among states with the strongest alcohol control policies, as rated by medical researchers in a 2014 report published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\nStates can influence drinking \u2013 especially dangerous binge drinking \u2013 with policies such as taxes on alcohol and restrictions on where and when it can be sold.\n\nPsychologist Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer at the nonprofit Well Being Trust, says the larger health challenges in the South are to blame for high alcohol death rates. Southern states typically rank near the bottom in national rankings in cancer, cardiovascular disease and overall health.\n\nOklahoma, Utah, Kansas and Tennessee rounded out the five states with the strongest alcohol control policies, the researchers reported. States with more stringent alcohol control policies had lower rates of binge drinking, they found.\n\nNevada, South Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming and Wisconsin had the weakest alcohol control policies.\n\nDavid Jernigan, a professor at Boston University's school of public health who has specialized in alcohol research for 30 years, notes that the beer industry holds considerable sway in Wisconsin.\n\nAmy Durham, 46, suffered triple organ failure after she stopped drinking six years ago. She was in a coma for 10 days. (Photo: Caron Treatment Centers)\n\nBinge drinking is sending far more people to the emergency room, a separate team of researchers reported in the February 2018 issue of the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.\n\nThe researchers, who looked at ER visits from 2006 to 2014,found the largest increases were among the middle aged \u2013 especially women. The number of teenage binge drinkers landing in the ER during that time actually declined.\n\nOlder, often lifelong drinkers don't need only to have their stomachs pumped. They frequently have multiple complications from their drinking.\n\nTheir often bulbous bellies need to be drained of fluid, which builds up from liver cirrhosis, and their lungs cleared of aspirated vomit, says Dr. Anthony Marchetti, an emergency room doctor at Upson Regional Medical Center in Thomaston, Georgia.\n\nThey might also have brain hemorrhages or internal bleeding, because booze prevents their blood from clotting properly.\n\nBy middle age, Marchetti says, long-term drinking can also lead to heart failure, infections due to immune suppression, a type of dementia from alcohol-induced brain damage, stomach ulcers and a much higher risk of cancer.\n\nAs opioid overdoses, which kill about 72,000 people a year, grabbed America's attention, the slower moving epidemic of alcohol accelerated, especially in Southern states and the nation's capital. About 88,000 people die each year from alcohol.\n\nMaking matters worse, alcoholism is trickier to treat \u2013 and criticize \u2013 than opioid addiction.\n\n\"Culturally, we\u2019ve made it acceptable to drink but not to go out and shoot up heroin,\" Miller says. \"A lot of people will read this and say 'What's the problem?' \"\n\nBenjamin Miller is a psychologist and the chief strategy officer at the non profit Well Being Trust. (Photo: Well Being Trust)\n\nIt might be a more socially acceptable addiction, but alcoholism is at least three times costlier to treat than opioid addiction, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it's a far more complicated midlife crisis to address.\n\nThe proven approaches \u2013 taxes on alcohol and limits on where and when alcohol is sold \u2013 are often rejected because the liquor industry has considerable clout with policymakers.\n\nRon Byrd says his daughter Erika was \"beautiful inside and out.\"\n\nTo him, there's no question about what caused her death.\n\nThat's despite the fact there was no alcohol in her system when she was found dead at home. She was so sick, Byrd says, she hadn't been able to eat or drink for days.\n\n\"The death certificate never says alcoholism,\" he says. \"It said heart arrhythmia and heart valve disease. But nobody in our family had heart problems.\"\n\nAttorney Lisa Smith has been in recovery from alcohol and cocaine addiction for a decade.

(Photo: Courtesy of Lisa Smith)\n\nSmithspeaks at legal conferences and law firms such as Byrd's about the hazards of lawyers' high-stress days and booze-fueled dinners with clients. But she's fighting forces far larger than her profession.\n\n\"It is poison, and we\u2019re treating it like it's something other than that because there\u2018s big corporate money behind it,\" she says. \"A lot of people are getting really rich on something that is toxic to us.\"\n\nDeaths of despair\n\nIn its Pain in the Nation report this year, the Well Being Trust called losses from drugs, alcohol and suicide \"despair deaths.\"\n\nThe three are closely related. Suicide is the third leading cause of death from alcohol, after cancers anddigestive diseases. One in five individuals who die from opioid overdoses have alcohol in their system at the time of their death.\n\nDrinking can lead to cancers all along the digestive tract, from the mouth to the colon. About 15 percent of U.S. breast cancer cases are considered to be caused by alcohol. A third of those cases affected women who drank 1.5 drinks or less a week, according to a 2013 report in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nThe \"direct toxicity\" of alcohol damages the nervous system from the brain down to the spinal cord and to peripheral nerves, says Marchetti, the Georgia emergency physician. It's common for people in the late stages of alcoholism to have numbness in their feet and legs, which makes walking difficult even when they aren't impaired.\n\nEmergency rooms are the most expensive place to treat problems. Between 2008 and 2014, the rate of ER visits involving acute alcohol consumption rose nearly 40 percent, according to the study in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. For chronic alcohol use, the rate rose nearly 60 percent.\n\nThe increases for acute and chronic alcohol use were larger for women.\n\nPeople who drink throughout their lifetime develop a tolerance for alcohol. But as they age, they lose muscle and gain fat and become less tolerant.\n\nThat leads to increased injuries and illnesses, says Rick Grucza, an associate professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis and lead author of the Alcoholism study.\n\nBut why are so many people drowning so many sorrows?\n\nAshley Marie Hartshorn began drinking heavily after the birth of her third child and a murder committed by her stepfather. (Photo: Family photo)\n\nBrenda Padgett believes it was postpartum depression that led her daughter to take up the heavy drinking that ultimately killed her last year.\n\nAshley Hartshorn, who lived in Hendersonville, North Carolina, had already suffered the trauma of hearing her stepfather kill his girlfriend while she was on the phone.\n\nThen Hartshorn testified against him in court, which helped send him to prison for life.\n\nThe depression came after the birth of her third child in February 2012.\n\n\"She wanted so badly to quit drinking, but the shame and the fear kept her from being able to allow herself to reach out for help,\" Padgett says. \"Like many, we were ignorant to the effects that alcohol has on the body. I thought she had time, time to hit rock bottom and time to seek help.\n\n\"I never knew that only five years of alcohol abuse could take the life of someone so young.\"\n\nNeither did Nancy Juracka. Her son Lance died in 2006 after just three years of heavy drinking. He was 36.\n\nLance Juracka, who grew up in Hermosa Beach, California, was intimately familiar with the scourge of alcoholism: He knew an uncle and aunt had drunk themselves to death before he was born. He even produced a short documentary about alcohol abuse while at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nHe started drinking when he got a job in Las Vegas reviewing shows \u2013 and was continually offered free drinks.\n\n\"Once he got a taste for alcohol, it really did him in fast,\" his mother says. \"I don\u2019t understand how Lance\u2019s liver went so quick.\"\n\nHe headed back to California and ultimately moved back in with his mother.\n\nHe started a painting business. But his workers told Juracka he would just drink vodka or sleep.\n\n\"I thought I was going to lose my mind, I was so frantic,\" she says. \"I would sit up all night with him so he wouldn\u2019t choke on this vomit.\"\n\nJoseph Garbely, an internal and addiction medicine physician at Caron Treatment Centers in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, says research shows that 10 percent of parents think having two or more alcoholic drinks a day is reasonable to reduce their stress.\n\nBut why? It's not as if liquor is becoming more accepted.\n\nConsider, however, the lack of public service announcements about the effect excessive alcohol has on health or families.\n\nAli Mokdad is a professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. He notes that alcohol-related education focuses on drunk driving.\n\nMiller and others point to the high level of workplace stress that began accelerating during the recession, loneliness linked to social media and increasing pressures on working mothers.\n\nIn fact, social isolation can be both a cause and the result of excessive drinking. Parents whose children drank themselves to death in their 20s and 30s often describe the drinking in isolation seen in elderly alcoholics.\n\nFew who drink excessively while young will become alcoholics, much less drink themselves to death. Those who are in recovery for alcoholism say people who turn high school or college binge drinking into a nightly coping ritual are at the most risk.\n\nAmy Durham came close to dying from alcohol six years ago, when she was 40. And she barely drank until she was in her 30s.\n\nThe child of an alcoholic father, Durham never thought she could or would lose control.\n\n\"I didn't even know what was happening to me,\" she says.\n\nShe attributes her plunge into alcoholism to unresolved trauma from growing up in an alcoholic home, the stress of her work as a school principal, a \"toxic\" romantic relationship and grief over an inability to get pregnant.\n\n\"I just needed to be numb,\" she says.\n\nRon and June Byrd lost their daughter, Erika, to complications from chronic alcohol abuse in 2011. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY)\n\nRon Byrd says Erika, too, dreamed of having children. After two divorces and stage 3b breast cancer, however, the chance was slipping away.\n\n\"She wanted so desperately to have a baby,\" Byrd says.\n\nDurham is now corporate director of alumni relations at Pennsylvania-based Caron Treatment Centers, where she was treated.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t able to see that my drinking was a problem until it was almost too late,\" she says. \"I put limits on myself and would say that i'd only drink two glasses of wine in a social setting and then go home and drink a lot in isolation.\"\n\nWhen her father died in July 2012 of esophageal cancer, Durham says, she began a \"very bad downward spiral.\"\n\nShe remembers his funeral.\n\n\"i was trying to be nothing like my father, but I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of that church and drink,\" she says. \"The shame of what was happening to me was more than I could bear.\"\n\nLike Hartshorn and Byrd, Durham started with white wine. But she ended up drinking copious amounts of vodka.\n\nAmy Durham, now director of alumni relations at Caron Treatment Centers, is shown with Caron's Dr. Joseph Garbely, who helped save her after alcohol nearly killed her. (Photo: Caron Treatment Centers)\n\nBy the time her family got her to a hospital, Durham was in triple organ failure and wound up in a coma for 10 days.\n\nThat was followed by six weeks of dialysis.\n\nWhen she arrived at in-patient rehab after the dialysis, Durham says, her body and eyes were still yellow and she was carrying 100 extra pounds of fluid \u2013 half of it in her legs.\n\nShe says fellow rehab residents \u2013 no strangers to the telltale signs of addiction \u2013 quickly looked away as she passed.\n\nMen vs. women drinkers\n\nWhen men crash and burn from alcohol, Mokdad says, the spectacle is often public. They get into bar fights, get cited by police for drunk driving or lose heir jobs.\n\nA more typical trajectory for women starts with evening wine as a way to de-stress from the work day \u2013 either in a professional setting, or home with young children.\n\nAuthor and podcast co-host Stefanie Wilder-Taylor, writer of \"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay,\" believes this stems from stubborn gender roles and norms surrounding stress.\n\n\"Moms just aren't going to call home and say they're stopping for a couple drinks after work with friends or going to the gym to unwind,\" the Los Angeles woman says\n\nOtherwise, they might feel like parenting failures as they compare themselves to other moms. So they drink wine while they make dinner, which can lead to a nightly pattern of excessive drinking.\n\nAuthor Stefanie Wilder-Taylor co-hosts the podcast For Crying Out Loud and is in recovery from alcohol addiction. (Photo: Courtesy of Stefanie Wilder-Taylor)\n\nThat describes nurse practitioner Eileen O'Grady, who quit drinking 12 years ago.\n\nO'Grady, who lives in McLean, Virginia, says her two sons, now in college, never really saw her drunk. But she couldn't bear the thought of continuing her destructive double life. She would drink continually from dinner until she went to sleep, she says, and then start again the next evening.\n\nFor O'Grady, the last straw came after a night of especially hard drinking with another mom in her neighborhood.\n\nThe other woman, a schoolteacher, vomited in O'Grady's car. She returned the next day to clean it up.\n\nO'Grady hasn't taken another drink.\n\n\"I could see my life if I kept going,\" O'Grady says. She is now active in her local recovery community and working as a wellness coach.\n\nHer schoolteacher friend taught classes until last fall. Within days of leaving the classroom, she was in a hospital with end-stage liver disease.\n\nShe died in hospice on Jan. 3.\n\nAt least 15 people at the woman's memorial service asked O'Grady how her friend had died. They were stunned to learn alcohol was the cause.\n\nThe woman was poisoning herself with a half-gallon of vodka a day, O'Grady says, yet no one knew beyond her immediate family, O'Grady and a mutual friend in the neighborhood.\n\n\"We're closeted,\" O'Grady says. \"We're not in bars getting in fights.\"\n\nEileen O'Grady is a nurse practitioner and wellness coach who has been in recovery from alcohol for 12 years.

(AP) \u2014 Christopher Bell's last race could prove more daunting than his next one.\n\nBell faced a must-win scenario in the semifinal round of the Xfinity Series playoffs at Phoenix last week, needing to beat 39 other drivers to earn the fourth and final spot in the championship field at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nHe started near the back, drove through the field and led the final 93 laps to notch his seventh victory of the season.\n\nNow, he's the favorite to win it all in the finale Saturday.\n\n\"This week, I only have to beat three, so I'm feeling really good,\" Bell said.\n\nHere's a look at the four contenders:\n\nCHRISTOPHER BELL\n\nThe 23-year-old Bell, who grew up racing on dirt tracks in Oklahoma, has three playoff victories that make him the one to beat.\n\n\"We're only racing three cars,\" said Bell, who won the Truck Series championship with Kyle Busch Motorsports in 2017. \"Instead of trying to go out there and win the race, all I have to do is beat three competitors. Whether that means running 20th or winning the race, that's going to be our goal: Just to beat three guys.\"\n\nBell seems like a lock to land a Cup ride soon. But Joe Gibbs Racing has no openings for its rising star in 2019, so Bell appears destined to return to Xfinity for another year.\n\nCOLE CUSTER\n\nThe 20-year-old Custer won at Homestead last year in dominating fashion. He led 182 of 200 laps and had a half-lap advantage at times. But he has won just once since, at Texas two weeks ago, to notch a spot in the final four.\n\nStill, the Stewart-Haas Racing driver has been one of the series' most consistent in 2017. He has a series-leading 25 top 10s to go with 13 top-fives. He hasn't had as much speed as Bell throughout the year, but Custer believes his team is starting to put it all together and capable of repeating at Homestead.\n\n\"Do we have a ton of confidence that we're just going to be faster than everybody? No,\" Custer said. \"I think everybody's fast. But I think we'll be right there with everybody, and I think it's a track we can compete and win.\"\n\nCuster is bound to land a Cup ride with SHR, which has a seat opening up with Kurt Busch's departure. But that ride could go to Daniel Suarez, which would seemingly leave Custer in the second-tier series for a third straight season.\n\nDANIEL HEMRIC\n\nHemric is the only championship contender without a win in the last two years. That makes him the long shot. He advanced to the finale in 2017, but finished second in the race and fourth in the standings.\n\nNo one should count Hemric out. The 27-year-old Richard Childress Racing driver has been stout in the playoffs, with six top-10s and three top-fives in six races.\n\nMistakes and misfortune have prevented him from landing in victory lane. But he's been at his best on mile-and-a-half courses like Homestead.\n\n\"I think just for the nay-sayers, it would be nice to prove to everybody that I can be successful and this group of guys can be successful because we have fallen short the past two years,\" said Hemric, who is headed to a Cup ride in 2019, replacing Ryan Newman.\n\nTYLER REDDICK\n\nReddick won the season opener at Daytona, edging JR Motorsports teammate Elliott Sadler in the closest finish in NASCAR history. He finished 20th or lower eight times in 22 races that followed, pushing him to the edge of the playoff picture.\n\nThe 22-year-old Reddick rallied down the stretch, with seven top-10s and four top-fives in the last nine races. His late push moved him past Justin Allgaier and Sadler for one of the championship spots.\n\n\"This year didn't really go as planned, as we wanted it to,\" said Reddick, who is moving to RCR's Xfinity team next year. \"We had speed most of the year at certain race tracks, just didn't capitalize on the moments we really should have. This playoff system and format has been really nice for us. We were able to kind of reset.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Tim Ireland) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 After reaching the last four at the ATP Finals for the first time, Alexander Zverev isn't satisfied.\n\nHe set up a semifinal with six-time champion Roger Federer by defeating John Isner 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Friday.\n\nZverev is the youngest player at 21 to reach the semifinals since 2009 and the first from Germany since 2003.\n\n\"The tournament isn't over,\" Zverev said. \"I don't want to really be thinking 'I'm in the semifinals now, I'm satisfied.' That's not how I work.\"\n\nIsner and Marin Cilic, who later lost 7-6 (7), 6-2 in a dead rubber against group winner Novak Djokovic, were eliminated by the result.\n\nFive-time champion Djokovic will face debutant Kevin Anderson in the other semifinal on Saturday.\n\nIsner needed to win in straight sets to have any chance of advancing and almost took the lead when he held a set point in the 12th game of the opener. Zverev saved it with an ace and played a faultless tiebreaker to eliminate the American.\n\n\"You make this tournament, you want to do a little bit better,\" said Isner, who lost all three of his matches. \"But at the same time this is no normal event. You're up against the absolute best in the world.\"\n\nIn the second set, Zverev converted his only break point of the match to lead 5-3, before calmly closing out the contest at the O2 Arena.\n\nReaching the last four in London is the latest achievement in a career-best season for Zverev, whose victory over Isner took him beyond the 55 wins he posted last year.\n\nBoth players utilized powerful serves to hold comfortably but Isner came up with a crushing forehand return winner to bring up the first break point at 5-6.\n\nHaving forced a tiebreaker, Zverev produced perhaps the most important shot of the match to dig out a deep Isner return and force a volley error to ensure it was he and not the American who earned set point. \"A remarkable shot,\" Isner said.\n\nIsner netted a forehand and, with his chance of qualification gone, wilted in the second set as quality Zverev returns secured the only break of the match.\n\nThe 37-year-old Federer holds a 3-2 career record over Zverev, with the most recent meeting between the oldest and youngest player in the tournament having been a three-set victory for the Swiss at last year's ATP Finals.\n\n\"It's going to be a very difficult match,\" Zverev said. \"I mean, him on this surface, indoor court, he's an unbelievable player.\"\n\nThe top-ranked Djokovic ensured he will be the only unbeaten semifinalist. Despite having already secured an eighth semifinal appearance with his previous victory, the Serb showed no signs of complacency as he lost just five points on his serve against Cilic.\n\nDjokovic won 31 straight service points from the third game of the first set through to the fourth game of the second, but he did have to save a Cilic set point on his way to winning a closely fought tiebreaker.\n\n\"It wasn't easy to approach this match with 100 percent willingness to win it,\" Djokovic said.\n\nCilic, who has failed to advance from the round robin stage in four appearances, was unable to maintain his level of performance in the second set and allowed Djokovic to break twice.\n\nDjokovic ended a two-year Grand Slam title drought by defeating Anderson in the Wimbledon final, before going on to claim his 14th major title at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"He's playing well, serving well, very aggressive,\" Djokovic said of Anderson. \"So I know what to expect.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Wallace was at 11-under 133 overall in the season-ending championship of the European Tour.\n\n\"I've expected higher from myself and that's just killed me,\" Wallace said. \"So, I'm playing with freedom now and trying to place myself as high as I possibly can come the back nine holes on Sunday. That's when I normally try and kick in and want to win a tournament.\"\n\nWallace, the most successful player on the European Tour this year with three titles, won six lower-tier Alps Tour titles in 2016 before moving onto the main tour early in 2017 by winning the Open de Portugal. This year, he has won the Hero Indian Open, the BMW International Open and Made in Denmark.\n\nFrancesco Molinari (73) dropped outside the top 25 with three bogeys in his last six holes, giving Tommy Fleetwood a chance in the Race to Dubai for the European No. 1 title.\n\nMolinari was tied for 27th at 3 under, while Fleetwood (67) was at 8 under and tied for sixth. To successfully defend his Race to Dubai title, Fleetwood needs to win the tournament and hope Molinari finishes low enough.\n\n\"Sometimes you just need to do a little bit of work,\" Fleetwood said. \"Felt like I hit it on range this morning with a decent understanding of what I needed to do, and a couple of good swing thoughts, and I was a lot more consistent today.\n\n\"It (catching Molinari) is still a very difficult task. I've only won once this year. It's not like I'm a prolific winner this year.\"\n\nPatrick Reed, playing alongside Rory McIlroy, shot a 66 and improved to fifth place at 9 under. McIlroy shot a 67 and was tied for sixth alongside Fleetwood, Kiradech Aphibarnrat (66) and Dean Burmester (65).\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A court order restored the pass, but the case is moving forward. Have presidents tried this before? USA TODAY\n\nPresident Donald Trump argues with CNN's Jim Acosta. (Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision.\n\nKelly said White House officials couldn\u2019t say who made the decision or how. The judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case \u2013 which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY \u2013 is argued.\n\n\u201cThis court cannot restore Mr. Acosta\u2019s access to press briefings that have already been held,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nBut Kelly said he hasn\u2019t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights. More arguments are expected Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI trust this litigation will continue at a rapid pace.\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAcosta thanked reporters and news organizations outside the courthouse for their support.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to work,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said the administration is drafting rules and regulations for reporters.\n\n\"People have to behave. We're writing up rules and regulations,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWith the rules and regulations, we will end up back in court and we will win.\"\n\nThe goal of the regulations is to ensure decorum, to prevent a reporter from asking three or four questions then refusing to sit down, Trump said.\n\n\u201cIt's more important to me than anybody would believe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut you have to act with respect when you're at the White house, and when I see the way some of my people get treated at news conferences, it's terrible.\u201d\n\nIn an interview recorded Friday for \"Fox News Sunday,\" Trump called the court opinion and the drafting of rules \"no big deal.\"\n\n\"If he misbehaves we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" Trump said.\n\nSarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Acosta's press badge will be temporarily reinstated.\n\n\"We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAcosta arrived at the White House a little after noon and thanked reporters again for their support.\n\n\u201cMy job is to cover the guy in there,\u201d Acosta said, nodding to the Oval Office.\n\nMuch of the debate in the case focused on a 1977 case at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which CNN said prevented the revocation of credentials \u201cbased on arbitrary or less than compelling reasons.\u201d\n\nBut the Justice Department, defending the White House decision to pull Acosta's pass, countered that the case was narrower than CNN described and focused on a Secret Service denial of access for safety and security reasons.\n\nOther media organizations, including Gannett Co., the parent of USA TODAY, said this week that they planned to file briefs with the court supporting CNN. The White House Correspondents Association filed an argument in the case warning the case could set a \u201cdangerous precedent.\u201d\n\nIf Trump is allowed to deny access to any reporter he considers \u201cbad\u201d or \u201crude\u201d or \u201cfake news,\u201d he would have \u201cunbridled discretion to decide who can report from inside the White House,\u201d according to the WHCA\u2019s argument.\n\n\"The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association welcomes today\u2019s ruling, in which a federal judge made it clear that the White House cannot arbitrarily revoke a White House press pass,\" said Olivier Knox, the group's president.\n\nBut media support for CNN wasn't universal.\n\nOne America News Network, a cable network based in California, filed an argument in the case that said it passionately supported an unfettered free press. But the network said Acosta had been unprofessional repeatedly during briefings and his \"disruptive behavior\" and \"grandstanding\" hindered other reporters from doing their jobs.\n\nThe revocation followed a feisty exchange between Trump and Acosta a day after the midterm election. Acosta pressed Trump on his characterization of the caravan of Central Americans moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border. After several exchanges, Trump accused Acosta of being a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nKelly said he weighed four factors in the case in ordering the White House to at least temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s credential while the case is argued. The factors were: CNN\u2019s likelihood of success, the likelihood of irreparable harm, balancing CNN and government interests, and the public interest.\n\nKelly ruled that Constitutional issues always weigh heavily in the public interest. Acosta is harmed by missing briefings and other events at the White House, even if CNN has dozens of other reporters who could cover them, the judge said.\n\nKelly focused on the Fifth Amendment argument about CNN deserving due process because the written explanation from Sanders came after the suspension. CNN filed a letter Nov. 8 to contest the decision, but Kelly said they deserved the chance to more formally respond to the reasons.\n\n\u201cThe need for the opportunity to be heard seems especially important in this case,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nContributing: David Jackson.\n\nMore: CNN sues Trump administration, demands return of reporter Jim Acosta's White House press credentials\n\nMore: Ted Olson led Republicans to victory in Bush v.

(AP Photo/Jack Dempsey, FIle) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWhen things go sour, an NFL team's fan base often points to two people: the guy calling plays on the sideline, and the man behind center trying to execute them.\n\nAs we get deeper into the 2018 schedule, the futures of some coaches could be tied to how their quarterbacks have struggled \u2014 or outright flopped.\n\nDoug Marrone and Blake Bortles in Jacksonville? Perhaps.\n\nVance Joseph and Case Keenum in Denver? Possibly.\n\nJohn Harbaugh and Joe Flacco? Could be.\n\nThen again, each of those coaches could keep their jobs and have new QBs in 2019. And we know Jon Gruden isn't going anywhere in Oakland, though Derek Carr might head elsewhere.\n\nNor is Pat Shurmur, despite a discouraging first year in the Jersey Meadowlands, likely to leave the Big Apple. But the status of a 37-year-old Eli Manning is in more doubt.\n\nIt would be a surprise to see Adam Gase out in Miami. Considering how much he has been out of the lineup in his seven-year career, it would not be a stunner to see Ryan Tannehill depart the Dolphins.\n\nLet's take a look:\n\nNEW YORK\n\nManning is not a washed-up has-been. His arm remains strong, his knowledge of the game is irreplaceable and he has three enviable options in Odell Beckham Jr., Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram.\n\nWhat he doesn't have is anyone who can block with any regularity. Manning is about as mobile as Shurmur, maybe less so, and when he doesn't get the necessary time to set himself, he's not likely to find a comfortable place to throw.\n\nYes, it's time for the Giants to look for a replacement, but not necessarily someone to take over next year. How about finally improving perhaps the worst offensive line in the league and seeing what Manning can do behind it?\n\nOtherwise, Carr could wind up an option as Gruden keeps wheeling and dealing.\n\nDENVER\n\nKeenum has another year to go on the deal he parlayed his best career season (in Minnesota) to get with QB-desperate Denver. Cutting him will cost a $10 million cap hit, so unless John Elway can work a trade for that prohibitive contract, Keenum figures to be back with the Broncos.\n\nThe cupboard is bare behind him, especially after Chad Kelly got himself arrested and then released. Plus, Keenum once again has had to learn a new offense, and he's had some knee issues.\n\nElway could be enticed to add a veteran who has won a Super Bowl, as he did with Peyton Manning (did someone say Flacco?), but only if he can deal Keenum.\n\nBALTIMORE\n\nFlacco, who's had a better (but not great) season than in recent years, is bothered by a hip injury. And his eventual replacement, Lamar Jackson, was chosen in the first round of April's draft.\n\nThe massive contract Flacco earned after winning the 2012 championship as Super Bowl MVP was extended in 2016 and he is signed through 2021. But the Ravens can open up $10.5 million in salary cap space by releasing Flacco, 33, after the season, with a potential savings of $18.5 million if they designate him as cut after June 1, which would damage his value elsewhere.\n\nHe won't command the same kind of money on the open market, but he will command attention for his strong arm, solid leadership, willingness to play hurt, and, well, a pedigree that rarely reaches free agency with a few good years left.\n\nGase in Miami certainly would like a QB who can get on the field regularly.\n\nMIAMI\n\nBrock Osweiler is the 19th starter since Dan Marino ended his Hall of Fame career. None has been a star, though Chad Pennington could have been had his shoulder not been so brittle.\n\nGase would seem to be tied to Tannehill, who has played in five games this year, none last season, because of injuries. When healthy, Tannehill helped get the Dolphins to the playoffs as a wild card in 2016, Gase's first year in Miami. Then he was hurt for the postseason.\n\nGase has been something of a QB guru in other stops, so a young guy who can stay in the lineup might be appealing. Or maybe a 20-something needing a change of scenery such as Jameis Winston or Bortles.\n\nTAMPA BAY\n\nPerhaps the most puzzling case of all because Winston, the top pick in the 2015 draft, should be a slam dunk as the future. He isn't.\n\nWinston is due $20.9 million next season, the final year of his rookie deal. That's way more than he is worth, and though the Bucs picked up his fifth-year option, they could release him in '19 and not owe him anything; 2019 is guaranteed only in case of injury, which is why some speculate Winston may not play again this year.\n\nHe comes with lots of talent, but still lacks maturity. He has had off-field issues and was suspended for the first three games this season.\n\nDo the Bucs want to start over at the position, knowing Winston's potential remains sky high?\n\nJACKSONVILLE\n\nConvinced after coming oh-so-close to making the Super Bowl that Bortles could be their franchise guy, the Jaguars signed him to a three-year, $54 million contract that includes a $16 million salary in 2019. So there would be $16.5 million in dead money if he is cut.\n\nAnd, like Keenum, the numbers for a trade likely are prohibitive.\n\nBut folks in Jacksonville believe, despite the current 3-6 mark, that the Jags are built to win soon. Maybe not with the struggling Bortles, however.\n\nThis history team boss Tom Coughlin has with Manning adds some intrigue, but a move for a veteran to replace Bortles might target someone younger and more mobile.\n\nOAKLAND\n\nGruden has publicly backed Carr, but it's difficult to gauge if that support is strong or even real. Given his maneuvers to redo the Raiders, it appears with Gruden no one is safe.\n\nGruden would love to find a Rich Gannon clone, maybe a Flacco or even a Nick Foles. And cutting Carr would create only $7.5 million in dead money, hardly prohibitive.\n\nThen again, Gruden has three first-round selections in the 2019 draft. Using one on a quarterback makes a lot of sense.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Josh Dubow and Arnie Stapleton, and Sports Writers Tom Canavan, Steven Wine, Mark Long, Fred Goodall and David Ginsburg contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But it will be senior day and that could alter the equation.\n\n\"They will be emotional,\" Wells said. \"It's a team that has a lot of talent and can rally together.\"\n\nThe Rams haven't knocked off a ranked squad since 2002, when they beat Colorado. They're 13-33 since 1993 against teams in the polls.\n\n\"I don't think you're going to stone-cold stop this offense. They're balanced and play extremely well,\" Colorado State coach Mike Bobo said. \"It comes down to getting guys on the ground.\"\n\nThat's proven easier said than accomplished. Leading the way for the Aggies will be sophomore quarterback Jordan Love , who was named the Mountain West offensive player of the week for a fifth time this season. He's coming off a game against San Jose State in which he threw for 491 yards and five TDs.\n\nHis teammates describe Love as mellow and fun-loving, but always pushing for more points and more yards.\n\n\"He's competitive. Every time we go out for a drive, he rallies us and says, 'We're going to go down and score,' or, 'Let's get this first down,'\" tight end Dax Raymond said. \"I don't think I've ever seen him anxious, angry, happy or sad. He's just mellow, perfect, which is what you need from a QB.\"\n\nHere are things to know in a series that Colorado State leads 39-33-2:\n\nTORRID START: This is Utah State's second-best start in program history, trailing only the 1961 squad led by Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen that began 9-0-1. That team went on to finish 9-1-1.\n\nSCORING IN ABUNDANCE: The Aggies have already established team records with 66 touchdowns and 513 points. The previous best was 60 TDs in 2011 and 454 points in '12. \"It's just fun,\" Raymond said. \"If you blink, you miss something.\"\n\nHIGH PRAISE: Colorado State junior wideout Preston Williams has 78 catches for 1,020 yards this season. His 78 receptions are already the fourth-most in team history. The record is 100 set in 2017 by Michael Gallup, who now plays for the Dallas Cowboys. Wells said of Williams: \"He's a very talented young man who we better know where he is on the field every single snap.\"\n\nBALANCING ACT: Bobo walks a delicate line in deciding between playing the upperclassmen or giving the younger ones some reps with an eye toward next year. \"I owe it to everyone on the football team that the best guy plays,\" Bobo said. \"Regardless of age or looking forward, we still want to put our best foot forward to win the ball game.\"\n\nPOLL DECISIONS: Despite a high ranking in other polls, the Aggies checked in at No. 23 for the recent College Football Playoff rankings. \"A lot of that has to do for Group of Five, is what you've done the year before and how many years you can stack on consecutively of being very good to get you consideration to be ranked high,\" Bobo said. \"It will all play out at the end.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 California coach Justin Wilcox has always emphasized to his players the importance of keeping an even-keel approach every week.\n\nWith a pivotal Pac-12 game against rival Stanford coming up, Wilcox is relaxing his approach a little.\n\n\"It's one of the greatest rivalries in college football,\" Wilcox said. \"I want them to enjoy that and appreciate it and how much energy it brings. They all feel it and know it. You can walk around campus and tell. It's a good thing.\"\n\nThe 121st Big Game on Saturday definitely has a different feel to it this year with both teams bowl eligible for the first time since 2015.\n\nCal secured its shot by rallying to beat USC 15-14 last week, ending a 14-game losing streak to the Trojans, while Stanford (6-4, 4-3) bounced back from consecutive losses with a 48-17 blowout of Oregon State.\n\nAs big as beating USC was for Cal (6-4, 3-4), a win over Stanford would be even more so. The Cardinal have won eight straight against the Golden Bears, many of them lopsided victories.\n\nGetting the Axe back to Berkeley has been a major focus for Cal.\n\n\"It's our rival,\" Bears linebacker Jordan Kunaszyk said. \"It's one of the teams I haven't beaten in the Pac-12 since I've been here.\"\n\nCal's last win in the series was in 2009 when the Bears upset then-No. 14 Stanford 34-28.\n\nThe Cardinal have been stout this season despite being in the middle of the Pac-12 most of the year. All four of Stanford's losses have come against teams that are currently ranked \u2014 No. 3 Notre Dame, No. 8 Washington State, No. 17 Washington and No. 21 Utah.\n\nWhile both teams can enhance their bowl prospects with a win this week, Cardinal coach David Shaw is following Wilcox's lead and wants his players to embrace the feeling of rivalry week.\n\n\"This game, for me, is in a different category,\" Shaw said. \"There's something about holding the Axe after the game, more so than beating the No. 1 team in the nation. It's special. It's different.\"\n\nHere are other things to keep an eye on when California hosts Stanford at Memorial Stadium on Saturday:\n\nSTINGY D: The game very well could be decided by which offense can score in the second half, something that opponents of both teams have struggled to do. Cal allowed only 40 yards after intermission in its win over USC while Stanford has given up 25 points in the third quarter all season.\n\nFEEL IT IN THE AIR: Cardinal quarterback K.J. Costello is ranked in the top 20 nationally in numerous passing categories, including completion percentage, passing yards and passing touchdowns. He also leads the Pac-12 in passing efficiency. The Golden Bears counter with a pass defense that is tops in the conference, allowing 183.8 yards a game. With Stanford having some of the tallest receivers in the Pac-12, the matchup figures to be a pivotal one.\n\nWHERE'S THE LOVE: Stanford running back Bryce Love was a Heisman Trophy finalist last year and was considered a leading contender for the award this season before injuries and a change in offensive philosophy derailed that. A year after rushing for 2,118 yards and 19 touchdowns, Love has been limited to 580 yards rushing and eight scores. Love has been nursing a sore left ankle since late September, the same injury he played through in 2017, but is expected to play against Cal. \"Bryce is feeling fine,\" Shaw said.\n\nFROM QB TO WR: Cal's Brandon McIlwain has shared time at quarterback with Chase Garbers for much of this season and threw a costly interception near the end zone late in the fourth quarter of a 19-13 loss to Washington State two weeks ago. With the Bears receiving corps banged up, McIlwain has been getting a look at wide receiver in practice this week and could line up there against Stanford.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Simpson breaking the NCAA record for rushing yards in a season, and baseball announcing plans for to decide the pennants with its first five-game playoffs. In basketball, UCLA was a unanimous pick as preseason No. 1 in what was then The Associated Press Top 10; Lew Alcindor \u2014 not yet Kareem Abdul-Jabbar \u2014 and John Wooden would lead the Bruins to the third of what would become seven straight NCAA titles.\n\nThe golden age of sports coincided with a tumultuous time across the country, from the rioting at the Democratic National Convention, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. On the Harvard and Yale campuses, some students protested the Vietnam War; others, including Crimson safety Pat Conway, had fought in it.\n\nFifty years later, the schools meet for the 135th time this Saturday at Fenway Park \u2014 their first neutral site since 1894.\n\nHere is the story that the AP sent to its member newspapers from The Game on Nov. 23, 1968:\n\n___\n\nHarvard Rallies To Tie Yale 29 To 29\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Second-string quarterback Frank Champi threw two touchdown strikes in the final 42 seconds and then passed for a two-point conversion with no time left to give Harvard a 29-29 tie with Yale Saturday.\n\nThe ancient rivals finished their seasons with 8-0-1 records and now share the Ivy and Big Three titles.\n\nChampi, a junior, came off the bench to replace George Lalich with five minutes left in the first half. He passed 15 yards to Bruce Freeman for Harvard's first touchdown and the first of Champi's three scoring passes, 39 seconds before half time.\n\nHe threw another 15-yarder to Freeman with 42 seconds left and capped his afternoon's work with a scrambling eight-yard pitch to Vic Gatto and a two-point conversion toss to Pete Varney after the final gun.\n\nHarvard scored its tying points after Yale's Brad Lee fumbled an on-side kickoff and Bill Kelly recovered at the Bulldog's 49.\n\nChampi then ran for 14 yards and a face-mask penalty against Yale put the ball on the 20. Two passes fell incomplete but fullback Gus Crim crashed 14 yards to the six with 14 seconds left. The clock ran for 11 yards as Champi was unable to find a receiver and lost two yards.\n\nWith three seconds left he ran from side to side looking to pass and finally spotted Gatto in the end zone.\n\nUntil Harvard's magnificent rally Yale's Brian Dowling had turned the game into his own personal plaything, sparking the Bulldogs to a 22-0 lead in the first 22\u00bd minutes. The senior quarterback, playing his final varsity game, scored Yale's first and last touchdowns, passed for the other two and seemingly iced the game by scoring from five yards out with 10:44 remaining to play.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nSource: AP via Aberdeen (South Dakota) Daily News.\n\n___\n\nThe AP Corporate Archives contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

We\u2019ve seen him. So you just end up going to plays, we\u2019ll do our thing.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs saw a different Peters than the version playing for Los Angeles.\n\nWith Kansas City, Peters recorded 151 tackles, 19 interceptions, and five forced and recovered fumbles in three seasons. He scored two touchdowns off interceptions and a third off a fumble. No player in the league intercepted more balls in the stretch.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Peters again flashed the playmaking threat with a 50-yard pick-six against the Raiders in Week 1. He has since struggled, with quarterbacks recording a 145.2 passer rating against him through nine weeks, up from 66.0 in 2017.

Without raising additional capital, MoviePass has \"substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern through November 15, 2019,\" the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday.\n\nMoviePass did not spell out the size of the \"significant decline\" in subscribers. The service had amassed about 3.2 million subscribers as of Aug. 10, 2018, parent company Helios & Matheson Analytics said in an earlier SEC filing.\n\nMoviePass generated $79.9 million in the third quarter, about 10 percent more than in the April-June period.\n\nBut Helios & Matheson Analytics posted a net loss of $130 million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss of $43.5 million in the same period a year ago. The net loss is primarily due to MoviePass expenses and the acquisition of Moviefone in April, the company said.\n\nHelios & Matheson Analytics took a $39 million impairment during the quarter to offset MoviePass subscriber declines.\n\nMoviePass subscribers departed after the company ran out of cash in July, which kept subscribers from getting movie tickets. Others left the service after it reduced the number of movies a subscriber could see from one daily (for the $9.95 monthly fee) to just three movies per month for the same fee.\n\nThe average MoviePass subscriber saw an average of 0.77 movies in September, down from 2.2 movies monthly in April, the company says.\n\nThe financing woes add to mounting troubles at MoviePass. Last month, Helios & Matheson Analytics said it was \"fully cooperating\" with New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood's probe into whether it misled investors about its finances.\n\nHelios & Matheson Analytics also faces potential delisting on the Nasdaq if it fails to build its stock price to $1. The company had sought a 1-for-500 reverse stock split to give the company a boost, but backed off when it did not have adequate shareholder support.\n\nShares of Helios & Matheson Analytics (HMNY) were up 0.6 percent Friday but still remained at less than two cents per share.\n\nHelios & Matheson Analytics is looking to spin off MoviePass into a separate entity, a topic expected to be addressed at the company's shareholder meeting next month.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/11/16/moviepass-loses-subscribers-faces-potentially-fatal-funding-deficit/2023275002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "How 'Bout Them Cowboys?

They'll be on the field as players together for the first time when Cooper and the Dallas Cowboys visit the Atlanta Falcons and the veteran/rookie duo of Jones and Ridley. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGary Myers has covered Jerry Jones longer than any pro football writer, so it seemed logical and natural to write a book about the owner of the most valuable franchise in the world.\n\n\"How 'Bout Them Cowboys?\" (Grand Central Publishing) is an in-depth look at America's Team, still the most popular in the NFL even though it hasn't reached a Super Bowl in 23 years and isn't likely to this season.\n\nMyers was with the Dallas Morning News when Jones bought the team in 1989 and cleaned house. Now a radio host at WFAN in New York, Myers remembers it well \u2014 and tells it entertainingly and informatively in his book.\n\n\"I was taken aback when he got weepy \u2014real tears \u2014 when he started talking about how he put himself at risk financially to buy the Cowboys in 1989,\" Myers says. \"He said he asked his doctor why recalling that period of his life made him so emotional and was told it was a traumatic experience for him. Even so, seeing this multi-billionaire in tears caught me by surprise, to say the least.\"\n\nThere's a lot in Myers' book that could catch readers by surprise. Such as:\n\n\u2014Jones admits he's still bitter about the circumstances that led to his divorce with Jimmy Johnson, who coached the Cowboys to the 1992 and '93 NFL titles. And Myers reveals \"Troy Aikman has still not forgiven Johnson for leaving him. A few years ago, they were having a beer together, when Aikman said to Johnson, 'We could have been Brady and Belichick.'\"\n\n\u2014The Hall of Fame party Jones threw for himself in Canton, Ohio in 2017 cost $8 million and included a two-hour concert by Justin Timberlake. One of the invited guests was Roger Goodell.\n\n\"I have a picture in my book of Jones having a drink with Goodell and Jon Bon Jovi at the party,\" Myers says. \"Five days later, Goodell called Jones to tell him he was suspending Ezekiel Elliott for six games. Jones is convinced Goodell showed up at the party knowing he was going to suspend Elliott (who was also at the party), but did not want to ruin Jones' weekend. Instead, he ruined his season.\"\n\nJones has said Goodell previously told him he would not suspend Elliott and to this day he feels betrayed. Goodell has emphatically said he did not tell Jones that.\n\nThere are dozens more such intriguing and often-unrevealed stories in \"How 'Bout Them Cowboys?\" Myers had five hours of one-on-one interviews with Jones and, he jokes, actually got in at least seven questions.\n\nALABAMA REUNION\n\nJulio Jones, Amari Cooper and Calvin Ridley cover most of a decade's worth of leading receivers at Alabama. They'll be on the field as players together for the first time when Cooper and the Dallas Cowboys visit the Atlanta Falcons and the veteran/rookie duo of Jones and Ridley.\n\nJones is a two-time All-Pro, Cooper made the Pro Bowl his first two seasons, and Ridley leads all rookies with 500 yards receiving. Oh, and they each won a national championship at Alabama. In fact, Ridley won two.\n\n\"A lot to like about them,\" Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \"Certainly they were trained very well at Alabama, probably really good players going there, developed to become great players coming out of there. And they've definitely shown that at this level.\"\n\nCooper wasn't supposed to make this Alabama connection when the season started: Oakland wasn't on Atlanta's schedule. But the Cowboys traded next year's first-round draft pick for him in hopes of having a new No. 1 receiver after letting Dez Bryant go in a cost-cutting move during the offseason.\n\n\"I'm cool with both of those guys,\" Cooper said. \"None of us played together, so none of us have been on the field together. So that'll be really cool to go out there and be on the same field.\"\n\nCAM'S WINE\n\nPanthers quarterback Cam Newton said if wasn't an NFL quarterback he'd want to be a sommelier. Newton has recently developed a love for wine\u2014 and cigars \u2014 although he said his recognition of most wines is \"terrible.\"\n\n\"I picked up a hobby that I really enjoy,\" said Newton. \"I think I'm on sauvignon blanc right now, really light wine, and a good mild smoke.\"\n\nRudy Patino, who works as a food service provider for the Panthers, is a resident wine expert and Newton said he's learned some things from him about the hobby.\n\n\"I feel like if I had a gift of a hidden talent, outside of playing an instrument, I would want to be a sommelier,\" Newton said. \"Those senses that you have. ... For those who don't know it, it's being able to distinctively tell what type of wine it is, where it's from and everything about wine by just the taste, the look and pretty much the feel of the wine. It's just pretty cool to come across a person on a day-to-day basis that knows what they're talking about. It's just like playing football. It's an ongoing thing that you have to constantly keep taking your nose and taste buds through.\"\n\nNewton said he if was to create his own wine he would call it \"Boogie Down.\"\n\n\"As in boogie down your esophagus,\" Newton said with a smile.\n\nBRITISH TRAINING\n\nUSA Football will lead the training of more than 1,000 football coaches across Britain in 2019. USA Football, a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the sport's national governing body, will drive education for British American Football Coaches Association members, spanning school-based to adult programs.\n\nBritish coaches will receive USA Football in-person training and online course work. More than 10,000 U.S. school districts and youth programs combined enrolled in USA Football-developed coach education this season, including nine of the country's 10 largest school districts.\n\n\"Our sport's community is truly a global family,\" said BAFCA President Wayne Hill of Birmingham, England. \"We love the game as much as Americans do, and teaming up with USA Football is a historic point for the sport here. Much like in the States, what's taught and played today is not your father's gridiron \u2014 it's done a lot smarter, but is just as much fun. This partnership enables us to deliver a smarter, safer game for our athletes through coach education.\"\n\nOrganized football is played on six continents spanning approximately 70 countries, a figure that has nearly doubled in the past 10 years.\n\nGREEN EAGLES IN BIG EASY\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will be wearing their home green jerseys at New Orleans on Sunday. What's that all about?\n\nA bet.\n\nIn March, coaches Doug Pederson of the Super Bowl champion Eagles and Sean Payton of the Saints made the wager, which was revealed during the summer for the American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament at Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Pederson has a much better golf game than Payton and finished 32nd at the tournament, while Payton was 77th. Pederson had offered strokes or points in the Modified Stableford scoring format, but Payton turned them down.\n\nPayton made a $5,000 donation to Autism Challenge in Philadelphia as part of the bet.\n\n\"Well, it is our home jersey. It is our home color,\" Pederson says. \"And so we are excited to wear that. We've done it a lot this year on the road, wearing our home greens on the road. So you know it's something that our guys enjoy.\"\n\nWhen Pederson made that bet, did Payton say the Saints would go with their color rush, or a white jersey?\n\n\"He didn't say one way or the other,\" Pederson adds. \"I would imagine it would be the whites, but he did not say.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Barry Wilner, Schuyler Dixon and Rob Maaddi, and Sports Writers Brett Martel and Steve Reed contributed.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Alabama has brushed off two ranked division rivals without allowing a point.\n\nOn Saturday, the top-ranked Crimson Tide defense faces an entirely different challenge: The Citadel (4-5) and its triple option offense. All that preparation for Southeastern Conference offenses, including Mississippi State and No. 10 LSU, provides scant help in this one for 'Bama (10-0, No. 1 CFP).\n\n\"This is a totally different challenge in terms of how you have to try to defend it and what you have to do,\" Alabama coach Nick Saban said.\n\nOf course, it's still the nation's top-ranked team facing an FCS opponent even with the potential distraction of upcoming games against rival Auburn and, in the Southeastern Conference championship game, No. 5 Georgia.\n\nCitadel coach Brent Thompson wants his team to \"compete our butts off as much as we possibly can on such a big and grand stage.\"\n\nHe calls Alabama the \"best we've probably ever seen.\"\n\nThe big question facing Alabama is how much Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will play on a right knee that has been bothering him. Saban bristles at any suggestion that he'd sit out Tagovailoa or another banged up starter based on assumptions about the opponent.\n\n\"That can't be your mindset,\" Saban said. \"That's not our mindset, that's not going to be the mindset of our players.\"\n\nHis approach has worked to the tune of 80 consecutive wins over unranked teams.\n\nDefensively, Alabama faces Citadel quarterback Brandon Rainey, who has run for 405 yards in the past two games, his only starts.\n\nThe Bulldogs are averaging 291.9 rushing yards with 28 touchdowns on the ground. Alabama ranks seventh nationally in defending the run, giving up 96.3 yards a game.\n\n\"It may be nerve-wracking for the coaches trying to come up with play-calling and stuff, but I am excited,\" Tide linebacker Dylan Moses said. \"They'll be running the ball the whole time. That's what I live for. I am ready to run guys down, make tackles and celebrate with my teammates.\"\n\nHere are some other things to watch for in the Citadel-Alabama game:\n\nPROTECTING TUA\n\nThe truth is, Alabama would almost certainly hope to limit the playing time for Tagovailoa, who was sacked four times against Mississippi State and sat out the fourth quarter. The question is, can backup Jalen Hurts play after missing the past two games with an ankle injury. Third-teamer Mac Jones could get significant time on the field if the game goes as expected.\n\nSHUTOUT QUARTERS\n\nAlabama is coming off shutout wins over Mississippi State and LSU \u2014 by a total of 53-0 \u2014 and hasn't allowed a point in nine-plus quarters.\n\nHOME WIN STREAK\n\nAlabama could break the school record of 24 consecutive wins at home. The Tide matched the record set from 1971-74 last week against Mississippi State.\n\nSECOND HALF SCORING\n\nThe Citadel has dominated the second half in its past two games, outscoring Samford and Western Carolina 63-3 and producing eight rushing touchdowns.\n\nREMEMBERING GEORGIA SOUTHERN\n\nSaban has made sure his players know about the 2011 game with Georgia Southern, which lost 45-21 but produced a whopping 302 rushing yards against Alabama's defense.\n\n\"He kept going back to that,\" Moses said. \"He said we have to play hard and stick together when we're playing and take this game seriously because we don't want that to happen.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

People post daily sightings and news stories about village's mostly adored \"mayor.\"\n\nOthers aren't as pleased. His detractors think he'sa nuisance who blocks traffic, can be aggressive and is ruining their yards. Some people have posted pleas for residents to stop feeding the turkey.\n\nFor a while there were signs in the neighborhood telling people to stop feeding him.\n\nKeith Panuc, for one, doesn't mind the turkey but still wishes people would stop feeding him.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday, a gobble from above announced Smoke's presence on on top of his house.\n\nThe turkey usually roosts in a stand of trees across the road, Panuc said.\n\nThat homeowner declined to talk turkey.\n\nLast of his flock\n\nSmoke appears to be the last of a flock of turkeys that took up residence in spring, said Ashwaubenon Public Safety Capt. Jody Crocker.\n\nThe lone turkey is not as bothersome as the larger group was during mating season, he said.\n\n\u201cIn the spring time, when we had a bigger problem with all the turkeys, they were teaming up and terrorizing people,\u201d he said.\n\nSmoke tends to stick to the neighborhood near the Park Place Business District up to area around Morris Avenue and Hilltop Drive. Unfortunately for Smoke, Interstate 41 runs right by his suburban habitat.\n\nHe has already been seen strolling under the bridge and law enforcement has fielded calls about him blocking the intersection at I-41 and Lombardi Avenue during a recent Packers game, Crocker said. Officers had to shoo the bird away.\n\nIf Smoke ends up on the highway he's a \"dead bird\" because he will most likely be killed in traffic, Crocker said. There are no plans to relocate the turkey.\n\nCrocker theorizes easy access to food that caused Smoke to take up residence in the neighborhood.\n\nFeeding turkeys and deer within village limits could net you $187 fine, he said. Actually issuing a citation is at the discretion of each officer.\n\nStuffing the turkey\n\nSome of Smoke's food comes from acorns but other times he is eating from bird feeders or food specifically put out for him.\n\nSmoke is an almost thrice-daily visitor to the Dental Wellness Center, said Julie Anne Sevenich, co-owner of the center. He eats from the bird feeder and prefers sunflower seeds.\n\nCo-owner Dr. Stephen Sevenich joked Smoke, who they call Tommy Boy, was like having a child who only shows up at mealtimes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really nice and tame. You can get within a foot or two of him. He\u2019s not threatening at all,\u201d Stephen Sevenich said.\n\nCrocker emphasizes people are not doing Smoke any favors by feeding him.\n\n\u201cBetter for him to move on to an area where there are other turkeys,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for Moore, she hopes the neighborhood turkey stays awhile. Her sister is coming to visit and she wants to see Smoke.\n\n\"Tell them 'Don't bother the turkey. Leave that turkey alone,'\" she said.\n\nTrent Tetzlaff contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/16/smoke-ashwaubenon-wisconsin-turkey-cute-celebrity-nuisance/2023198002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Seniors, No. 2 Clemson seeking more milestones against Duke", "description": "The seniors for No. 2 Clemson have accomplished plenty in their four years", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/16/seniors-no-2-clemson-seeking-more-milestones-against-duke/38542863/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ace586566c9826f1252685dd1913a820c70f94a2/c=0-277-3382-2179/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/c109791af3f14dd0b7f1d072c75c6623.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:08:00Z", "content": "Clemson defensive lineman Christian Wilkins (42) pursues during a play against Boston College in the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Boston.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 While Clemson coach Dabo Swinney feels like this season has gone by quickly, his time with his record-setting seniors probably has slipped by even faster.\n\nClemson (10-0, 7-0 ACC) looks to complete a perfect run through the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season when it faces Duke (7-3, 3-3) on Saturday night.\n\nThe Tiger seniors are 50-4 since arriving at Clemson and have a chance to set an ACC mark with their 51st victory, not to mention their three previous ACC championships and the 2016 national title they picked up during their time.\n\nThe 33 seniors are led by familiar names like defensive linemen Christian Wilkins and Austin Bryant, receiver Hunter Renfrow and linebacker Kendall Joseph that Swinney \u2014 or Tiger fans \u2014 won't soon forget.\n\n\"It's sad because you know they have to go,\" Swinney said. \"It's going to be my last Thanksgiving with these guys. It's also comforting to know that they've prepared and they'll do great in life. They've just brought me a lot of joy.\"\n\nEach one will get to feel that at Death Valley a final time before the game when, as is Clemson tradition, they'll make a solo run down the hill onto the field in front of a packed house.\n\nClemson offensive coordinator said Wilkins has been a difference maker since stepping on campus. Big things were expected and Wilkins delivered, Venables said.\n\n\"We knew that if he came that he would make everyone around him better and enhance the locker room,\" Venables said. \"He has done that and then some.\"\n\nOf course, all the Tigers understand there's work ahead for them to finish things off in the best way possible. They're looking to stay on track for an undefeated season and stay sharp for an ACC championship game and College Football Playoff run next month.\n\nDuke coach David Cutcliffe believes Clemson may be as challenging an opponent as he's faced the last few decades. \"We prepared for a lot of great football teams over 30 plus years but this team is complete,\" he said.\n\nSome other things to watch when Duke visits No. 2 Clemson on Saturday night:\n\nHEY, AREN'T YOU?\n\nThese teams from different ACC divisions have not played each other since Clemson's 56-20 win at Duke in 2012. The Tigers have won four straight in the series. Duke's last win came at home in 2004.\n\nHYATT'S HEALTH\n\nClemson left tackle Mitch Hyatt, who holds the school mark for most snaps played, came out of last week's win over Boston College after what coach Dabo Swinney called \"a couple of stingers.\"\n\nBut Swinney said Hyatt had improved and was expected to play.\n\nDUAL THREAT\n\nDuke quarterback Daniel Jones passed for more than 300 yards and ran for more than 100 in last week's win over North Carolina. It's the second time he's done that, giving him two of Duke's three games all times with such numbers. Jones also joined Clemson quarterback Tajh Boyd and Louisville's Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson as the only ACC passers with multiple 300-100 games.\n\nJones said facing Clemson is a big opportunity \"and we're confident that we'll make the most of it.\"\n\nTHE WAIT IS ON\n\nClemson has plenty of talented seniors like Wilkins and linebacker Kendall Joseph who'll be drafted by the NFL next spring. A couple of draft-eligible Tigers are taking a wait-and-see approach to the next level. Defensive end Clelin Ferrell and tackle Dexter Lawrence are both juniors not ready to commit to leaving. Both have said they'll decide sometime after the season.\n\nLANDMARK SEASON\n\nClemson is looking for its fourth-ever 11-0 start, joining teams in 1948, 1981 and 2015 who've accomplished the feat. The 1981 group finished 12-0 and earned the school's first national title. In 2015, the Tigers started 14-0 before falling to Alabama in the national title game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Buzz60\n\nMoviePass card and smartphone app. (Photo: MoviePass)\n\nThe clock is apparently ticking at MoviePass.\n\nThe embattled discount movie ticket subscription service saw a significant decline in subscribers between July and September, a period during which MoviePass saw its app crash when the company ran out of money and it cut subscriber benefits.\n\nThe repercussions could drive MoviePass out of business. Without raising additional capital, MoviePass has \"substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern through November 15, 2019,\" the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday.\n\nMoviePass did not spell out the size of the \"significant decline\" in subscribers. The service had amassed about 3.2 million subscribers as of Aug. 10, 2018, parent company Helios & Matheson Analytics said in an earlier SEC filing.\n\nMoviePass generated $79.9 million in the third quarter, about 10 percent more than in the April-June period.\n\nBut Helios & Matheson Analytics posted a net loss of $130 million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss of $43.5 million in the same period a year ago. The net loss is primarily due to MoviePass expenses and the acquisition of Moviefone in April, the company said.\n\nHelios & Matheson Analytics took a $39 million impairment during the quarter to offset MoviePass subscriber declines.\n\nMoviePass subscribers departed after the company ran out of cash in July, which kept subscribers from getting movie tickets. Others left the service after it reduced the number of movies a subscriber could see from one daily (for the $9.95 monthly fee) to just three movies per month for the same fee.\n\nThe average MoviePass subscriber saw an average of 0.77 movies in September, down from 2.2 movies monthly in April, the company says.\n\nThe financing woes add to mounting troubles at MoviePass. Last month, Helios & Matheson Analytics said it was \"fully cooperating\" with New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood's probe into whether it misled investors about its finances.\n\nHelios & Matheson Analytics also faces potential delisting on the Nasdaq if it fails to build its stock price to $1. The company had sought a 1-for-500 reverse stock split to give the company a boost, but backed off when it did not have adequate shareholder support.\n\nShares of Helios & Matheson Analytics (HMNY) were up 0.6 percent Friday but still remained at less than two cents per share.\n\nHelios & Matheson Analytics is looking to spin off MoviePass into a separate entity, a topic expected to be addressed at the company's shareholder meeting next month.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/11/16/moviepass-loses-subscribers-faces-potentially-fatal-funding-deficit/2023275002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Maeve McDermott, USA TODAY", "title": "Ariana Grande's ponytail is gone as she debuts shorter hairstyle", "description": "Ariana Grande said 'Thank U, Next' to her iconic ponytail and debuted noticeably shorter hair.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/16/ariana-grande-iconic-ponytail-debuts-shorter-hairstyle/2023614002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/10/14/USAT/48ea6cf0-ce68-4ca1-8ffc-bacece05eb92-GTY_966544726.JPG?crop=2999,1680,x0,y119&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:04:54Z", "content": "Ariana Grande became a meme and instead of ignoring it, she laughed with her fans.

His mission: to infiltrate a Palestinian terrorist cell by impersonating a young revolutionary named Michel, with Charlie playing the role of his girlfriend.\n\nInching closer to their target Khalil (Charif Ghattas), the terrorists' evasive ringleader, Charlie is trained to be a bomber and taken to a Palestinian refugee camp, where her eyes are opened to the other side's plight and she begins to question her allegiance.\n\nMore: Review: AMC's 'The Little Drummer Girl' is a gorgeous spy thriller\n\nIf you're already confused, there's no reason to fret: \"The most important thing about this series is that it's supposed to be complicated,\" Pugh says. \"It's supposed to be a world that we don't know, so I hope people give it time.\"\n\nPugh, 22, and Skarsgard, 42, share more intel on what to expect from the 1970s drama:\n\nQuestion: How familiar were you with John le Carre's work before signing on?\n\nAlexander Skarsgard: My dad loved \u201cThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold.\u201d That was basically his introduction to literature when he was a teenager, and so he passed that along to me when I was a teenager. It was the first espionage novel I ever read, and I thought it was amazing. I read a couple of other John le Carre novels, like \"A Perfect Spy,\" but I had not read \"The Little Drummer Girl.\"\n\nReal-life romance between Becker (Alexander Skarsgard, left) and Charlie (Florence Pugh) gets complicated when he poses as the deceased younger brother of a Palestinian terrorist mastermind. (Photo: Jonathan Olley/AMC/Ink Factory)\n\nQ: What specific qualities drew you to your characters?\n\nFlorence Pugh: I liked the fact that she is like everyone I know. We're at a time right now where pretty much every female character you read is magnificent in some way, and I found it quite interesting that she was a very normal human being in this totally surreal world. That was the thing that drew me in, really, and was quite interesting to play.\n\nSkarsgard: (Becker) is very enigmatic, and it creates a certain moral ambiguity, because part of his job is coaching Charlie. He has to play the part of Michel, so when they're creating this fictional love story to keep Charlie safe, she has to really fall in love with Michel. In doing that, Becker has to really convey Michel and make her understand the suffering of (the Palestinian) people. He gets conflicted, because he himself was an Israeli soldier and is forced to walk in the shoes of someone he doesn't understand, but slowly starts to. It blurs the line between good and evil.\n\nQ: How does Charlie's dynamic with Becker shift once she realizes he's recruited her to go undercover?\n\nPugh: The whole play between him and her is complicated. We're scared for her because she's obviously being played, but the whole point of the storyline is you don't know what's truth and what\u2019s lies. Ultimately, Charlie represents the complexity of that situation, and how someone feels once they\u2019ve discovered or been educated about a certain side (of a political conflict). That's where the relationship gets confused.\n\nCharlie (Florence Pugh, left) and Becker (Alexander Skarsgard) share a moonlight kiss at the ancient Acropolis in Greece. (Photo: Jonathan Olley/AMC/Ink Factory)\n\nQ: What was it like getting to shoot at the actual Acropolis in Athens, where Becker and Charlie go on a late-night date in the first episode?\n\nSkarsgard: No one has gotten a permit to shoot up there in 80 years, so reading the script, I just assumed we'd be shooting (that scene) on a little hill somewhere with a green screen. It was not lost on us how privileged we were, to be there on our own(and) not surrounded by thousands of tourists. I'll never forget, toward the end of the night we did our last couple of shots: Flo and I were sitting and talking, and we have our first kiss as the sun was rising. We could see it come up over the mountains and light up the Acropolis in gold. It was the most magical thing I've ever seen.\n\nQ: How do you feel you'd personally fare as a double agent?\n\nPugh: Oh, God, I'd be the worst spy ever. I'd just feel too guilty that I was lying to everyone.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/16/alexander-skarsgard-spy-who-snagged-me-little-drummer-girl-john-le-carre/2007725002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposes overhaul to campus sexual misconduct rules, narrowing definition of sexual harassment", "description": "DeVos proposes overhaul to campus sexual misconduct rules", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/16/betsy-devos-proposes-changes-campus-sexual-misconduct-rules/2023775002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/5bbdb18c-e5ca-412c-82c1-332dd48df9f9/5bbdb18c-e5ca-412c-82c1-332dd48df9f9_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:02:17Z", "content": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is proposing a major overhaul to the way colleges handle complaints of sexual misconduct.

(Sept. 7) AP\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos (Photo: Jasper Colt/USA TODAY)\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos released a controversial proposal Friday to overhaul how schools across the country address sexual misconduct complaints, narrowing the definition of what sexual harassment is on campus and reinforcing \"due process\" rights for students accused.\n\nThe rule creates three categories for harassment, including \"Unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school\u2019s education program or activity;\" \"quid pro quo harassment,\" like a school employee \"conditioning an educational benefit\" on a person's sexual conduct; and sexual assault.\n\nUnder Obama-era guidelines, sexual harassment was defined more loosely as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\"\n\nThe proposal legally requires schools to respond to complaints when they are filed with Title IX coordinators at schools or an official authorized to take action. Schools are only legally required to respond if the alleged incident occurred on campus or on areas overseen by the school, leaving out, for example, study abroad programs.\n\nOne of the most striking changes would allow for the accused to cross-examine accusers during sexual misconduct hearings, although it would be carried out through a representative to avoid confrontation between students.\n\nThe proposed guidelines also dictate \"the importance of supportive measures\" for the accused and the accuser. This can include academic course adjustments, counseling, no-contact orders, dorm room reassignment, leaves of absence and class schedule changes for the accused or the accuser, according to the Department of Education.\n\nAccused students would be presumed innocent during the disciplinary process and given the right to review all evidence a school collects.\n\nDeVos said the overhaul would make Title IX grievance complaints more transparent and reliable for all parties. \"Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\" DeVos said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe Department of Education's plans have already drawn criticism from lawmakers and organizations that advocate on behalf of sexual assault survivors.\n\nRep. Joe Kennedy, (D-Mass.) slammed the cross-examination provision of the guidelines in a tweet Thursday. \"No survivor should be cross-examined by his or her accused rapist,\" Kennedy said.\n\nNo survivor should be cross-examined by his or her accused rapist. Ever. Full stop. https://t.co/DZgvEuZKi6 \u2014 Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) November 15, 2018\n\nThe National Women's Law Center also called the rules \"potentially devastating,\" because the organization says it would \"undermine many of Title IX's essential protections.\"\n\nBREAKING: Betsy DeVos\u2019 Department of Education just released a set of potentially devastating draft rules.

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) applauded it for bringing \"much needed clarity\" to the federal rules governing sexual misconduct on campuses.\n\n\"The Department\u2019s approach seems to balance fairness and support for survivors,\" Alexander said in a statement.\n\nThe proposed rules will be subject to public comment for 60 days prior to being finalized.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/16/betsy-devos-proposes-changes-campus-sexual-misconduct-rules/2023775002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Georgia's governor race could be decided soon", "description": "More than a week after the midterms, all Georgia counties have certified their election results in the tight race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/elections/2018/11/16/georgias-governor-race-could-decided-soon/2023847002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/405772c8-598b-480e-bb50-deddd1f8016d-VPC_KEMP_ABRAMS_DECISION_SOON_THUMB.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:02:02Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "How a selfie saved a Texas man from 99 years in prison", "description": "In 2017, Christopher Precopia was charged with a felony he knew he hadn't committed.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/16/how-selfie-saved-texas-man-99-years-prison/2023822002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/9f15f529-01c5-4123-9ae6-efb12264eb0c-selfie.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:55:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Mom helps son escape from jail, both later caught at IHOP", "description": "A Georgia inmate escaped for some crepes after his mom helped spring-him from jail and they were later caught at an IHOP.

Barnum (Hugh Jackman) created the Barnum & Bailey Circus in the late 1800s. But the glossy PG-rated movie musical managed to overcome middling reviews (55% positive on Rotten Tomatoes) to become a sleeper box-office smash, earning more than $400 million worldwide.\n\nP.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman, center) creates a family of circus stars out of society's outcasts in the musical 'The Greatest Showman.' (Photo: Niko Tavernise)\n\nIts original soundtrack was a similar slow-burn success in January, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart in its fourth week of release and dominating Spotify's U.S. viral chart with earwormy singles including \"Never Enough\" and \"This Is Me,\" its Oscar-nominated empowerment anthem. Since then, the album has sold more copies than any album this year in the U.S. (1.3 million), according to Nielsen Music, and shattered multiple records across the pond, where it's matched the U.K. chart runs of Adele's \"21\" and The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"\n\nNow, the album is getting a star-studded facelift with \"The Greatest Showman: Reimagined,\" out Friday, which contains 13 covers by mainstream acts including Kesha, Missy Elliott, Sara Bareilles, Zac Brown Band, Ty Dolla $ign and Panic! at the Disco.\n\nInitially, a deluxe edition of the soundtrack was planned for release timed to Mother's Day, featuring two to three covers by well-known singers as bonus tracks. But coming off the success of the celebrity-fillled \"The Hamilton Mixtape\" in late 2016, Atlantic Records' president Kevin Weaver saw more lucrative prospects in a full album.\n\n\"Showman\" trails only Drake's \"Scorpion\" and Post Malone\u2019s \u201cBeerbongs & Bentleys\u201d in terms of total album consumption (sales and streams) in 2018, so \"my expectations are very high for this,\" Weaver says. \"With such a strong brand and amazing new renditions of the songs, I anticipate this will have a huge life of its own. I also expect it continue to be a feeder into the original cast album, and for this to be a really special release around the holidays\" for families, in particular.\n\n\"Reimagined\"'s A-list roster was culled in part from social media, where pop superstars Pink and Kelly Clarkson have expressed their adoration for the film. Atlantic reached out to both women about contributing and let them have their picks of songs.\n\nClarkson, who posted a teary video of herself in bed watching \"Showman\" in March, chose to tackle \"Never Enough\" and (unsurprisingly) blew the roof off with her signature belt.\n\n\"There are only a handful of artists who can pull that off vocally and she's among the best vocalists in pop music right now,\" Pasek says. \"That was really, really thrilling to get to hear her vocals on that song.\"\n\nPink, meanwhile, opted for hopeful showstopper \"A Million Dreams,\" with one special request: that her 7-year-old daughter, Willow Sage Hart, could sing the reprise.\n\nIt was Willow's first time recording in a studio, \"and it was overwhelming watching (Pink) teach her how to adjust the levels and sing into the microphone properly,\" Paul says. \"It was like, 'Welcome to the world of Mama. This is what I do every day.' She coached her through the entire thing and it meant the world to her.\"\n\nBeforehand, \"Pink said, 'Look, I'd love for you guys to record my daughter doing it and that's enough. You don't have to put it on the album or anything,' \" Paul continues. \"And we were like, 'Are you kidding me? She sounds amazing and this is such a special moment. We have to let the world get to share in it as well.' \"\n\nLike many of the album's other often-treacly cuts, \"Million Dreams\" brims with optimism and imagines the ways in which ordinary people can make a better, brighter world. It's this precise lack of cynicism that its authors believe have made \"Showman's\" music such an unlikely phenomenon in divisive times.\n\n\"There was an article in Variety that talked about how 'Greatest Showman' was uncool in an appealing way and I think that's true,\" Pasek says. \"Ten years ago, everything was sort of ironic and snarky, and there are definitely people who will approach this material (that way). But I think the reason that it's resonated is that it isn't trying to be anything other than open-hearted, fun and uplifting.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/16/greatest-showman-how-pop-culture-punchline-became-years-best-selling-album/1979552002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "On Mars, overflowing lakes carved out canyons in just weeks", "description": "Raging rivers and lakes once flowed over Mars that formed craters that burst and carved out canyons in just weeks.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/world/2018/11/16/-mars-overflowing-lakes-carved-out-canyons-just-weeks/38542409/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5967904671001_5967901946001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:47:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Chocolate ornaments from Trader Joe's are almost too cute to eat", "description": "Ever seen an ornament so cute you wanted to eat it?

Irianto, the father of Dr. Rio Nanda Pratama.\n\nPratama, who had been attending a medical conference in Jakarta, took Lion Air Flight JT 610 home to prepare for his wedding to Intan Syari, scheduled for Nov. 11. Instead, his loved ones gathered for his funeral on Nov. 6.\n\nPratama died along with 188 others when the two-month-old Lion Air Boeing 737-Max 8 crashed into the Java Sea at high speed shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on Oct. 29. Moments before, the pilot had requested permission to return to Jakarta because of a problem controlling the aircraft.\n\nFlight recorder data later revealed the doomed plane's airspeed sensor had malfunctioned four times.\n\nA week after the crash, both Boeing and the FAA issued bulletins to pilots warning of an issue with a stall-prevention feature intended to help them avoid raising a plane's nose dangerously high. But if the command receives faulty airspeed sensor data, as investigators believe happened with the Lion Air jet, it can instead trigger a dive that pilots may not be able to manually correct in time to avoid a crash.\n\n\"At no relevant time prior to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 into the Java Sea did Boeing adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of the unsafe condition caused by the new 'auto-diving' design of the 737 MAX 8 flight system,\" Irianto's suit alleged.\n\nThe suit claims that Boeing's directive, which included new instructions on how to recognize and compensate for the issue, was issued too late.\n\nThe suit also cited reports from a number of U.S. pilots who said the issue was not covered in Boeing's training or documentation, noting, \"It was surprising to hear from safety experts and the heads of pilots' unions that Boeing failed to warn its customers and the pilots of its new 737 Max aircraft about this significant change in the flight-control systems.\"\n\nTwo U.S. airlines fly the Boeing 737 Max 8. Southwest has 26 while American Airlines has 16. Combined, the airlines have hundreds more on order.\n\nUnited Airlines flies another variant, the 737 Max 9, which also is covered by Boeing's bulletin. None of those U.S. airlines have reported the issue covered by Boeing\u2019s bulletin regarding its 737 Max aircraft.\n\nA Boeing 737 Max 9 rolls out of the aircraft manufacturer's factory in Renton, Washington on March 7, 2017.

One thing is for sure, LSU's ranking is head scratching. USA TODAY\n\nAlabama running back Damien Harris was at the center of a controversy against Mississippi State for an apparent fumble that was ruled down. (Photo: John David Mercer, USA TODAY Spor)\n\nSorry to disappoint you, ladies and gentlemen (and particularly James Carville), but there is no Deep State within the Southeastern Conference office boosting Alabama through questionable officiating.\n\nIf there were one, though, it wouldn\u2019t look much different from what\u2019s happened during the 2018 season.\n\nIt\u2019s apparently not enough for Alabama to be the best team in college football this year; it\u2019s also the recipient of some significant help it probably did not need in the last two games against LSU and Mississippi State.\n\nThough it\u2019s a decades-old SEC tradition for fans of opposing schools to cry about conference office favoritism every time a controversial call goes in Alabama\u2019s favor, that tinder box has been lit the last couple weeks thanks to slow-motion video revealing referee incompetence and a social media environment turning coincidence into conspiracy.\n\nBut it also highlights something very real in the SEC: the deep frustration of what increasingly seems like a hopeless quest to make Alabama appear mortal.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately what we preach to our players, and hopefully it's a thought process we subscribe to as a staff, is we have to control the controllables,\u201d Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said. \"And the calls that are made are out of our hands. Obviously in a game of that magnitude, you're looking for a glimmer of hope. You don\u2019t need to play a perfect game, but you need to play a near-perfect game for us to beat them.\u201d\n\nBut Mississippi State fans left Saturday feeling like a lack of perfection \u2014 or even competence \u2014 from the officiating crew was an even a bigger story than how their team played.\n\nThe first bad call occurred on Alabama\u2019s opening drive when running back Damien Harris\u2019 knee was ruled down before fumbling the ball when replay clearly showed that possession should have gone to Mississippi State. Though Moorhead had an opportunity to challenge the play and didn\u2019t, the replay booth also made an error by failing to call down to the field and saying it wanted to review the fumble.\n\nThen right before halftime, Mississippi State scored an apparent touchdown that would have brought the score within 21-7, only to see it wiped off the board because of a truly phantom block in the back call. The Bulldogs ended up losing 24-0. Alabama was flagged for exactly zero penalties, and Twitter was awash with accusations that something fishy was going on.\n\nThough Alabama seems poised to roll through the rest of the season and into the College Football Playoff, this is undoubtedly a sensitive spot for the SEC.\n\nJust one week earlier, LSU fans cried foul over a highly questionable targeting call against linebacker Devin White, its best defensive player, who was forced to miss the first half of the Alabama game.\n\nIn the buildup to that game, LSU athletics director Joe Alleva publicly argued that the SEC should overturn the penalty, which is not only impossible (targeting is an NCAA rule, thus there's no conference office appeal process) but would have set a terrible precedent. But the narrative that the SEC had wronged LSU was already set by then, and it took on a life of its own when Carville, the well-known political commentator, accused both the SEC and commissioner Greg Sankey personally of helping Alabama.\n\nThough Carville\u2019s criticsm was way over the top and his appearance on ESPN\u2019s College GameDay caused the network to apologize to the SEC, he hit a sore spot.\n\nConspiracy theories in sports are almost always ridiculous, but how do you push back when real life events feed into them?\n\nThat\u2019s particularly true for the have-nots in any sport trying to take down a dynasty. Whether you\u2019re the Atlanta Hawks trying to beat LeBron James or the Jacksonville Jaguars trying to take out Tom Brady, any questionable call that goes against you can feel like something more sinister than a split-second judgment.\n\n\"When you\u2019re really battling and fighting and you know a certain particular call can swing a game one way or the other, it's human nature to feel that way,\u201d Kentucky coach Mark Stoops said. \u201cWhen you're elite you can overcome (bad) calls because you\u2019re better and the margin for error is larger so it\u2019s natural to feel that way. I certainly try to fight that and just overcome whatever the situation is in games.\"\n\nThe reality is, there\u2019s no Alabama conspiracy. The SEC has some officials who are better than others, but on balance, the consensus in the sport is that the SEC has the cream of the crop. While high-profile mistakes may feed into the myth that there are people sitting around league headquarters in Birmingham yelling \u201cRoll Tide,\u201d some kind of plot to advantage Alabama would be far too complex to pull off and yield so little return on the risk that it doesn\u2019t even rise to the level of possibility.\n\nAnd even if you want to believe the Crimson Tide consistently gets the benefit of the doubt, it's really no different than what ACC fans have said for years about Duke basketball or what NBA fans are now saying about the Golden State Warriors.\n\nIt would certainly be better for SEC officials if these old conspiracies hadn't been inflamed during a season in which Alabama appears poised to rip through the league unbeaten. Unfortunately for them, getting rid of human error might be the only way to make it stop."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Maeve McDermott, USA TODAY", "title": "Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cCaution\u201d: The best diva moments from her new album", "description": "Out Friday, \u201cCaution\u201d is the fifteenth studio album from the singer.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/16/mariah-careys-caution-best-diva-moments-her-new-album/2003538002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/079dc4da5291a55a4da47d0c964cb6227e49f91a/c=0-135-2997-1828/local/-/media/2018/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636732195326474702-DIC001.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:21:20Z", "content": "After her disastrous New Year's Eve performance last year, Mariah Carey braved the cold to usher in 2018 by returning to New York's annual \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" but lamented the lack of hot tea.

(Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)\n\nEvery year, The changing of the seasons from fall to winter comes with its constants, as the air grows colder, the nights get longer, the trees lose their leaves \u2013 and Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d returns to the charts, an event that has become as inevitable as the winter solstice.\n\nThis year, Carey\u2019s early holiday gift to fans doubles as a reminder that, in addition to her Christmas-music reign and her general existence as one of pop\u2019s most consistently entertaining figures, she also still makes new music. Out Friday, \u201cCaution\u201d is the 15th studio album from the singer. Plenty of her contemporaries \u2013 as well as the younger generation of pop stars raised on her music \u2013 are making music similar to the slick R&B heard on Carey\u2019s new album, featuring the same kinds of omnipresent producers and buzzy featured artists (in her case, DJ Mustard and Gunna, respectively).\n\nBut in Carey\u2019s case, her personality is so singular, her diva presence so imbued in every big note she hits and fabulously worded lyric she seductively slurs through, that she stands alone. Listening to her is an unmistakable experience. And while many may sound like her, few will have the iconic voice \u2013 and equally iconic ego \u2013 it takes to be Mariah, who may as well have just dropped her last name at this point, Madonna-style.\n\nBecause half the fun of \u201cCaution\u201d is listening to Carey navigate the life of a diva, here are the four best songs where she\u2019s most famously, deliciously extra.\n\nMore: Mariah Carey announces 2019 Caution World Tour, her 'most intimate tour yet'\n\n\"GTFO\"\n\nThe absolute best song she could\u2019ve released as one of the introductory single to her new album, \u201cGTFO\u201d is everything that makes 2010s-era Carey great. What she lacks in the vocal-somersaulting powers of her early days she makes up for with the towering melodramatics she has cultivated over decades of being a star, which play out amazingly here as she drops maybe the year\u2019s best f-bomb in the vicious sweetly sung chorus \u201cHow \u2018bout you get the (expletive) out.\u201d\n\n\"One Mo\u2019 Gan\"\n\nWho cares that soul genius D\u2019Angelo already released a near-perfect, achingly sentimental song of the same name? Carey swipes the title and makes it unabashedly horny, because she\u2019s Mariah Carey and she can. After all, the song\u2019s not a cover, and while D\u2019Angelo sang about wishing to hold a lost love one last time, Carey goes for a more carnal interpretation of the phrase, with the hilariously straightforward \u201cCan we just get it in one mo\u2019 gan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Distance\u201d\n\nA feature from Ty Dolla $ign, rap\u2019s MVP guest vocalist, almost never makes a song worse.

USA TODAY\n\nElisa Del Genio and Ludovica Nasti in \"My Brilliant Friend.\" (Photo: Eduardo Castaldo/HBO)\n\nIn the second episode of HBO's new series \"My Brilliant Friend,\" two precocious young girls reverently recite passages from \"Little Women,\" garnering hope and strength and inspiration from Louisa May Alcott's words.\n\nAuthor Elena Ferrante's \"My Brilliant Friend\" book series is regarded with similar reverence, around the world but especially in her home country, Italy, the setting of the coming-of-age epics about two girls growing up in post-World War II Naples. As with so many book-to-screen adaptations, from \"Harry Potter\" to \"Gone Girl,\" bringing Ferrante's words to the screen required extreme care, so as to not upset the legions of fans for whom the books have meant so much.\n\nHBO's version of \"Friend\" (Sunday and Monday, 9 EST/PST, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four) keeps the story of little Elena (Elisa Del Genio as a young girl, and Margherita Mazzucco as a teenager) and her brilliant friend Raffaella (Ludovica Nasti and Gaia Girace, respectively) in the language it was written with English subtitles, in part for authenticity and in part because it's an Italian co-production. Whatever the motives, it was the right decision for this beautiful, buoyant story of friendship, survival and growing up. \"Friend\" is, for lack of a better word, quite brilliant.\n\nMore: HBO speaks Italian with Elena Ferrante's 'My Brilliant Friend'\n\nThe eight-episode series lives in the gray, dirty and beat-down neighborhood of Elena (nicknamed Lenu) and Raffaella (who's always referred to as Lila), where crime bosses rule the streets and gossip spreads from one apartment window to the next. In this world of poverty and violence, Lenu and Lila are oddities that don't fit in. Lenu is reserved and accommodating, and Lila is her outspoken and daring foil. Lenu is smart, but Lila is practically a prodigy. Both want to continue their studies in middle school, when most girls quit education after grade school to start work.\n\nMargherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace in \"My Brilliant Friend.\" (Photo: Eduardo Castaldo/HBO)\n\nLenu's father allows her to continue her studies, while Lila is forced to drop out, but continues fervently (and furtively) reading and teaching herself. The girls are bound by their friendship even as their lives diverge. Their bond is all consuming, full of love and competition in equal measure, as complex and deep as any romance.\n\nThere is not enough praise for the four young actresses who take on the iconic roles, especially the younger set. Girace is a tiny fireball of an actress, with a talent as special as Lila's. The show is so focused on its two leads that not many other characters stand out, but it doesn't matter, because the girls are mesmerizing to watch.\n\nElisa Del Genio and Ludovica Nasti in \"My Brilliant Friend.\" (Photo: Eduardo Castaldo/HBO)\n\nThe Neapolitan setting is realized in beautifully dreary detail, as meticulously crafted as anything in Westeros on \"Game of Thrones.\" \"Thrones\" is an apt if surprising comparison for \"Friend:\" The Ferrante novels have as energetic a fan base as George R.R. Martin's \"Song of Ice and Fire\" novels. \"Friend\" hews as closely to its source material as \"Thrones,\" with similar pitfalls in its adaptation. \"Friend\" retains the novel's framing device: Lenu as an old woman writes about Lila after she goes missing. But her narration comes and goes at such odd intervals that it's easy to forget who's talking. And at times the politics of the neighborhood aren't adequately explained as in long, descriptive paragraphs.\n\nBut those are minor quibbles. Nearly all of the time, \"Friend\" is wholly immersive. The series fully transports viewers to this place and time. Had HBO decided to film the adaptation in English, what it gained in accessibility it would have lost in atmosphere. And that atmosphere is essential. The series portrays the lives of two poor young girls, that so many of their contemporaries might deem insignificant, as important and enthralling as anything else onscreen.\n\nAnd really, that's worth reading some subtitles.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/16/my-brilliant-friend-review-hbos-ferrante-adaptation-soars-italian/1988122002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Exploit the Buccaneers defense in daily fantasy", "description": "SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner gives you all the information you need to set the perfect daily fantasy football lineup for Week 11 in the NFL.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nfl/2018/11/16/exploit-buccaneers-defense-daily-fantasy/2023418002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/8141b305-cc92-44fa-af84-e64422aea9c9-GettyImages-1052699028.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:56:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY", "title": "Nutella Cafe New York opens its doors to hazelnut spread lovers", "description": "The new Nutella Caf\u00e9 in Manhattan features pastries, breads, breakfast specials and gelato \u2013 all incorporating Nutella.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2018/11/16/nutella-cafe-new-york-manhattan/2021796002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ccaf7d603b02f8bae11966da79b60c333b77ac92/c=0-3-1381-783/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636779190468096012-180620-Hazelnut-Blondie-0953.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:55:39Z", "content": "Last Slide Next Slide The new Nutella Cafe New York serves dishes like breads, pastries, breakfast specials and gelato - all incorporating Nutella hazelnut spread.

Not only did their volume stay within the recommended levels (85 dB) for safe listening, but they were among the only pairs that managed to do so while connected to an iPhone. By the way, they're even able to connect wirelessly, so you don't have to worry about tangles or clutter. They also offered the best comfort, making them perfect for long road trips, and they come in four colors (pictured above) and include a hard-shell carrying case.\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

I\u2019m not gonna panic.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated The grueling life of a NASCAR pit crew member\n\nGetting hit by your own driver\n\nCompeting for the fastest pit stop, drivers will enter pit road pushing the speed limit, while crews can get ahead of themselves. The result is crew members sometimes getting taken out by their own race cars. It\u2019s especially dangerous for the jackmen, who jump out in front of the car barreling down pit road to lift the right side of the car first.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Kyle Tudor, the jackman for Jimmie Johnson and the No. 48 Chevrolet who was pitting Justin Allgaier\u2019s No. 7 Chevrolet in the XFINITY Series at the 2017 Indianapolis Motor Speedway race.\n\n\u201cJustin Allgaier is a great person \u2014 I want to say that first and foremost,\u201d Tudor said preemptively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s out of his control really. He was getting pushed from behind, and as a jackman, you have a line where you can\u2019t jump until he crosses that line. So with the speeds they\u2019re going, you have to commit. So I committed, jumped off the wall, and at that point, you could tell his car was wider than you would like. And I had the jack in my hand, and by the time I could react, he was already on top of me.\u201d\n\nTudor said he had no time to adjust with his momentum going forward, plus the 35-pound jack in his hands. And he couldn\u2019t go out too far into pit road because it\u2019s so narrow and he could have gotten hit by another car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like pick your poison,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo at the last minute, I jumped a little bit, so he didn\u2019t clip my feet, which was good, but it threw me into his windshield, and I basically did a front flip over the top of his car. It\u2019s not ideal, but when you jump in front of a car more than 100 times a year, that\u2019s something that comes with the territory.\u201d\n\nGetting hit by another team\u2019s driver\n\nWhile the cars must stay inside their own pit box to avoid penalties, sometimes the pit crew members push the outlined edges. And if they\u2019re too close to the edge as another car flies out of a neighboring pit box, it can get a little wild.\n\n\u201cMy craziest story was when I was jacking, and I was out there on pit road and had a car come around me and hit the back of my heel,\u201d said John Gianninoto, who\u2019s now the fueler for Chase Elliott\u2019s No. 9 Chevrolet. \u201cAnd it actually grabbed me and dragged me a little bit down, and I had to jump back up, pull out the tire and finish up the stop.\n\n\u201cMy foot got caught a little underneath the side skirt and he dragged me for about 10 or so feet and really knocked me down. Luckily, I was all right.\u201d\n\nAnd even if they\u2019re not physically hit by another car, tires and air guns can get ripped out of their hands.\n\n\u201cKevin Harvick actually hit me (at Bristol in April), said Rowdy Harrell, the tire carrier for Alex Bowman and the No. 88 Chevrolet team.\n\n\u201cHe hit me from behind as we were leaving the right side of the car. I had one tire in my right hand, and I bent over to pick up one that flopped over \u2014 so I couldn\u2019t roll it, I had to pick it up \u2014 and as soon as I bent over and stuck my (other) tire out a little bit, he came over and hit my tire, threw it all the way over into their pit stall. It was just chaos. Bristol is such a small place that it happens.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what fuel in your eye feels like\u2026\n\nKellen Mills can explain. He was the gasman for for Joey Logano and the No. 22 Ford team from 2014 through part of the 2018 season, and he detailed how once during a race, he picked up one of the filled 95-pound gascans anticipating a pit stop.\n\nThe cap to the can was on but it wasn\u2019t on tight enough, and because his team wasn\u2019t quite ready to pit, he said he hadn\u2019t pulled his visor down yet. He gently bounced the gascan on his shoulder as he adjusted his balance, and that\u2019s when the cap came off.\n\n\u201cThe cap hit my arm, and fuel started splashing back in my face, and I got a ton of it in my eyes,\u201d Mills said. \u201cSo as I\u2019m blinking, I can feel layers of my eye wiping off, and I was like, \u2018This is not good.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t want to go blind right now.\u2019 So I took everything I had on off and then they took me to the infield care center. They took a hose for a nose (airway), and they flipped it inside out and they had an IV drip. They put it on the bridge of your nose, and it drips saline water into your eyes to flush it all out.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "America's Islamic Heritage Museum gives 'untold history'", "description": "America's Islamic Heritage Museum begins in the 1500s and explores the contributions of American Muslims through the 21st century.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/16/americas-islamic-heritage-museum-gives-untold-history/2023279002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/28911775001/28911775001_5967893873001_5967889496001-vs.jpg?pubId=28911775001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:38:43Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press, Associated Press", "title": "Stacey Abrams prepares push for new Georgia governor vote", "description": "Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign and legal team is preparing an unprecedented legal challenge in the unresolved Georgia governor\u2019s race that could leave the state\u2019s Supreme Court deciding whether to force another round of voting.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/16/stacey-abrams-push-new-georgia-governor-vote-race-brian-kemp/2023277002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/12/USAT/fd9dbc9f-ea59-4ab0-b3ad-8d8e44887f39-VPC_ABRAMS_KEMP_LAWSUIT_THUMB.jpg?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:31:33Z", "content": "Stacey Abrams files suit, delays Georgia election certificate date (Photo: 11ALIVE) ATLANTA Stacey Abrams campaign and legal team is preparing an unprecedented legal challenge in the unresolved Georgia governors race that could leave the states Supreme Court \u2026 [+6737 chars]", "fulltext": "CLOSE Democrat Stacey Abrams says she isn't conceding, but she isn't going to drag on the Georgia governor's race any longer. USA TODAY\n\nStacey Abrams files suit, delays Georgia election certificate date (Photo: 11ALIVE)\n\nATLANTA \u2013 Democrat Stacey Abrams, trailing Republican Brian Kemp in the race for Georgia governor, said Friday she was dropping plans to challenge the results of what she described as a flawed election.\n\nIn a pointed address to supporters \u2013 her first since Election Night \u2013 she acknowledged that the state was poised to certify Kemp the winner, and she did not want to \"scheme\" her way into office.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, this is not a speech of concession, because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper,\" Abrams said in her first public remarks since Election Night. \u201cAs a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that. But my assessment is the law currently allows no further, viable remedy.\u201d\n\nAbrams also said she would be filing a federal lawsuit against the state over what she called the \"gross mismanagement\" of the election \u2013 though not aimed at making her governor.\n\nAbrams' legal team had been considering a longshot legal challenge that could have been filed once the results are certified.\n\nBut her announcement Friday effectively ended the bitterly fought race. The contest had been marked by claims of voter suppression and a host of lawsuits filed by Abrams and her supporters.\n\nKemp said he appreciated Abrams' passion, hard work, and commitment to public service.\n\n\"The election is over and hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward,\" Kemp said. \"We can no longer dwell on the divisive politics of the past but must focus on Georgia\u2019s bright and promising future.\"\n\nAbrams on Friday accused Kemp of pinning his hopes of election on suppressing voters. She said he was \"deliberate and intentional in his actions.\"\n\n\"I know that eight years of systemic disenfranchisement, disinvestment and incompetence had its desired effect on the electoral process in Georgia,\" Abrams said.\n\nShe announced the launch of a political action committee called Fair Fight Georgia, which she said would pursue accountability in Georgia's elections. The federal lawsuit against the state will be one of the group's first projects.\n\nThe Georgia Secretary of State's office still has not certified the results of the election. The Republican declared himself the winner last week, resigned as secretary of state and named a transition team.\n\nKemp, 55, has served as a state legislator and secretary of state. He was a home builder and developer before he entered politics.\n\nYear of the Woman 2?: Record election success for women that goes way beyond the numbers\n\nMore: Midterm results 2018: How Trump\u2019s 2016 election set the stage for the female wave\n\nRelated: These are the historic firsts for women, minority and LGBTQ candidates in 2018\n\nKemp vowed during the campaign to support small businesses, protect rural hospitals, raise teacher pay, defend gun rights and stop sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants.\n\nAs Georgia's secretary of state from 2010 until last week, he took credit for record voter turnout and registration across all demographic groups and for a new online voter registration website.\n\nAbrams, 44, became a rising national star running strong as a liberal in a red state. She promised to improve public schools, strengthen gun control, expand Medicaid and generate jobs through investment in small businesses.\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer was the first African-American to serve as minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, and the first woman to lead either party in the General Assembly. She was trying to become the first African-American woman governor in the nation.\n\nDuring the campaign, Abrams and her supporters accused Kemp of trying to suppress the Democratic vote as secretary of state by removing voters from the state rolls. Kemp\u2019s office said it was investigating the state Democratic Party for what it called a \"failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system.\"\n\nAfter the election, Abrams managed a pair of wins in court that have led to hundreds of rejected ballots being counted \u2013 but not enough to force a runoff or recount.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ordered election officials to provide reports explaining why each voter was required to cast a provisional ballot, and to establish a hotline or website where voters could determine whether their provisional ballot was counted.\n\nU.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled that the state could not certify the election until absentee ballots rejected for missing or incorrect birth dates were counted.\n\nThe longshot challenge Abrams was considering Friday, first reported by the Associated Press, would have been based on a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \u201cmisconduct, fraud or irregularities \u2026 sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\u201d\n\nAbrams would have need to prove that there had been enough irregularities to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 eligible voters had their ballots rejected or were not allowed to vote.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/16/stacey-abrams-push-new-georgia-governor-vote-race-brian-kemp/2023277002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gene Sloan, USA TODAY", "title": "Photos: The christening of Symphony of the Seas, world's largest cruise ship", "description": "The new world's largest cruise ship, Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, was christened Nov. 15, 2018 in Miami.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/cruises/2018/11/16/royal-caribbean-symphony-seas-christened-miami/2023172002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/08ab7841-def8-4f28-9082-3c490fea4bac-1542343498_sy-mia-sbw-1871.JPG?crop=3499,1958,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:28:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nActors Carlos and Alexa PenaVega, along with their one-year-old son Ocean, served as the godparents of Royal Caribbean's new Symphony of the Seas at a christening ceremony on Nov. 15, 2018.

He gently bounced the gascan on his shoulder as he adjusted his balance, and that\u2019s when the cap came off.\n\n\u201cThe cap hit my arm, and fuel started splashing back in my face, and I got a ton of it in my eyes,\u201d Mills said. \u201cSo as I\u2019m blinking, I can feel layers of my eye wiping off, and I was like, \u2018This is not good.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t want to go blind right now.\u2019 So I took everything I had on off and then they took me to the infield care center. They took a hose for a nose (airway), and they flipped it inside out and they had an IV drip. They put it on the bridge of your nose, and it drips saline water into your eyes to flush it all out.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press, Associated Press", "title": "6 rescued from elevator in one of Chicago's highest skyscrapers after crews break wall", "description": "Firefighters broke through a wall in one of Chicago\u2019s tallest skyscrapers to rescue six people who were trapped in an elevator.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/16/875-north-michigan-avenue-rescued-chicago-skyscraper-elevator/2023200002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d5960f958cc33d29a9121cd707a9550a540ef1cc/c=832-807-1702-1299/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/07/25/1406323940000-ILLINOIS.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:18:28Z", "content": "Illinois State Promo (Photo: Shane Music) CHICAGO Firefighters broke through a wall in one of Chicagos tallest skyscrapers to rescue six people who were trapped in an elevator.

USA TODAY\n\nPete Davidson turns 25 Friday and, all things considered, it's reasonable to expect the \"Saturday Night Live\" quipster is ready to bid adieu to 24. The last 365 days dealt Davidson the pain of two break-ups and, more recently, backlash from a widely-slammed joke about wounded war veteran Dan Crenshaw.\n\nHere are the highs and lows from Davidson's tumultuous year.\n\nNov. 18, 2017:More jeers for his jests\n\nDavidson's Crenshaw remarks aren't Davidson's only cracks to cause waves. A little more than a month after opening up about his borderline personality disorder during \"Weekend Update,\" Davidson returned to the desk to trash his hometown of Staten Island. He made headlines for the roasting, which included jokes like: \"I know Staten Island isn't all heroin and racist cops. It also has meth and racist firefighters.\"\n\nDavidson's pointed punchlines were celebrated and slammed on social media, with one Twitter user writing: \"As a matter of fact I think SNL's Pete Davidson should take his one note act over to the Postcards September 11th Memorial on Staten Island where the names of heroes including the 'racist' FDNY Firefighters and NYPD Police Officers are engraved and do his (expletive) jokes there.\"\n\nIt's worth noting Davidson's father was a firefighter who died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nPete Davidson with his former fianc\u00e9e, Ariana Grande, at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in August.

Merry Christmas my friend.\u201d\n\nPete Davidson with ex-girlfriend Cazzie David in 2016. (Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)\n\nMay 2018: Love lost and love gained\n\nThe same month Davidson confirmed he and Larry David's talented offspring Cazzie David had gone their separate ways, he and Ariana Grande became Instagram official.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Open Late with Peter Rosenberg,\" Davidson confirmed his breakup. \"We're not together anymore,\" a seemingly uncomfortable Davidson remarked of his longtime love. \"Very talented girl. She'll be great, and she'll do fine,\" he added.\n\nLater in the month, Davidson seemed to confirm reports he and Grande were an item by sharing an Instagram that depicted the two in \"Harry Potter\"-themed robes with a coy caption: \"the chamber of secrets has been opened ...\"\n\nJune 20, 2018: An engagement is confirmed\n\nWhile chatting with Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show,\" Davidson confirmed he and Grande were engaged.\n\n\"I feel like I won a contest (getting engaged to her),\" he said. \"It's so sick. It's so lit.\"\n\nSeptember 2018: Becoming a pig parent\n\nIn mid-September, a pig made its debut on Grande's social media. Davidson opened up about caring for the pet, dubbed Piggy Smallz, during an interview with Seth Meyers on Sept. 28.\n\n\u201cThe first two days it was really new and didn\u2019t move much,\u201d he told his host. \"Now it\u2019s starting to bite, and you know... it\u2019s a pig.\"\n\nDavidson showed his devotion to the animal he described as \"bougie\" by getting a tattoo on his stomach. \"Yeah, I don\u2019t think; I just kind of do,\u201d Davidson said on \"Late Night\".\n\nOct. 14, 2018: Reports of a break up surface\n\nA few weeks later, rumors began swirling that the two had called it quits. Davidson himself joked about their split and moving out of their Manhattan apartment at a comedy show on Oct. 20.\n\n\"Does anybody have any open rooms?\" Davidson told the West Hollywood crowd, per an excerpt obtained by E! News. \"Looking for a roommate?\" Davidson also joked about covering up some ink, presumably tattoos he got honoring Grande. \"Yeah, I'm afraid to get my mom tattooed on me, that's how bad it is,\" he said.\n\nNov. 3, 2018: Davidson ignites battle with Crenshaw\n\nOn the first \"SNL\" of November, Davidson was slammed for a controversial quip about former Navy SEAL-turned Texas Congressman-elect. Davidson faced backlash on social media and from fellow cast member Kenan Thompson after comparing Crenshaw's looks to \"a hitman in a porno movie.\"\n\nThe following week, Crenshaw and Davidson made up when the vet appeared on the sketch show. Davidson apologized directly to Crenshaw, who got his turn to roast the comedian. \"Pete looks like if the meth from 'Breaking Bad' was a person,\" Crenshaw cracked. \"Pete looks like Martin Short in 'The Santa Clause 3.' \"\n\nHere's hoping Davidson can laugh off the last year.\n\nContributing: Jayme Deerwester, Carly Mallenbaum, Patrick Ryan and Cydney Henderson\n\nMore: Ariana Grande calls her life 'painful and yet beautiful' post-Pete Davidson split\n\nMore: Dan Crenshaw addresses Pete Davidson's panned 'SNL' joke during victory speech\n\nMore: Pete Davidson calls Ariana Grande a 'wonderful, strong person' on 'Saturday Night Live'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/16/pete-davidson-birthday-25-dan-crenshaw-snl-saturday-night-live-ariana-grande/1998778002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Erin Jensen, USA TODAY", "title": "'Shame on you': Bette Midler's NSFW Melania Trump tweet sparks backlash", "description": "\"You\u2019ve turned into a wretched old woman- it\u2019s really too bad,\" a user wrote in response to Bette Midler's tweet about first lady Melania Trump.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/16/bette-midler-melania-trump-tweet-british-gq-cockpit-modeling-photo/2023036002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/cbf78aea-37c7-4941-a975-0589046759d4-GTY_1052312100.JPG?crop=3092,1739,x0,y91&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:12:56Z", "content": "Actress Bette Midler refused to end her speech at the Tony Awards, as she accepted the award for Leading Actress in a Musical for \"Hello, Dolly!.\" (June 12) AP Bette Midler in New York City on Oct. 16, 2018.

But if you're looking for a great gift to give a kid on your list this year, check out this deal on the best headphones for kids. If they\u2019re getting into music or always begging to watch their favorite new movie or play games at full volume, a pair of headphone could be perfect. But not just any set will do, especially for little ears.\n\nWe\u2019ve tested all the most popular headphones for kids to find which one are the safest for young, developing ears.

But outside of the Black Friday shopping window, the BT2200s rarely, if ever, go on sale. And when they do, it's never for this big of a discount. That's an even better deal than the sitewide 20% off coupon Puro is offering right now, (and no, unfortunately they cannot be combined).\n\nSo why did we name the BT2200s the best kids headphones of 2018? Not only did their volume stay within the recommended levels (85 dB) for safe listening, but they were among the only pairs that managed to do so while connected to an iPhone. By the way, they're even able to connect wirelessly, so you don't have to worry about tangles or clutter. They also offered the best comfort, making them perfect for long road trips, and they come in four colors (pictured above) and include a hard-shell carrying case.\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published, but may change over time.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered this holiday season.

Buzz60\n\nA group of people sit at a restaurant table eating pizza. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nPete:\n\nYou need to reveal a hidden expense that can easily be stopped. That expense is eating out. All over America, at every income level, people who shouldn\u2019t eat out are. Cooking at home every day, three times per day, is a lost art. Bring bagged lunches to work and school. No more swinging by restaurants to pick up carry-out on the way home.\n\nDan, Florida\n\nI passed my driver\u2019s test in December of 1993. Sixteen, excited, and ready for the freedom that came with a little piece of plastic adorned with a grainy photo of a freckled face, I drove to my best friend\u2019s house, picked him up, and we went to our favorite fast-food restaurant. We had food at home, we had time. But when moved by the spirit of freedom and choice, we chose to commemorate a monumental moment by spending $18 on double-bacon cheeseburgers, cheese fries and chocolate shakes.\n\nThis is the complexity of choosing to dine out over cooking at home.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I agree with you, Dan. Choosing to spend money on something you don\u2019t need is fundamentally a poor decision. But for better or worse, the fast-paced nature of life today makes home-prepped meals more unrealistic than you\u2019d like. And for some, dining behavior can be influenced by the availability of fresh food in the area in which they live.\n\nPeople dine out for several reasons, but I find all of them fall into two main categories: entertainment and convenience.\n\nMore Money: Midsize truck war? Toyota Tacoma leads, but new Ford Ranger, Jeep Scrambler pose threat\n\nMore Money: 401(k) millionaires at Fidelity jump 41 percent in third quarter to record 187,400\n\nMore Money: Saddled with huge student loan debt, homebuyers sacrifice more to purchase a house\n\nI am tickled when a chef can make simple ingredients taste like magic. How can a piece of fish taste fine when I make it, but transform into an ethereal experience when prepared by a master? Whatever the answer, I\u2019m willing to pay for that moment. I\u2019m also willing to pay to watch a group of relative strangers place a sombrero on my kid\u2019s head, and sing Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os off key. In fact, I place moments like these in my entertainment budget, and you should too.\n\nBut convenience is an entirely different story, one that tempts us all with the slipperiest of slopes.\n\nConvenience is when a person chooses to exchange money for time. On the way home from your kid's soccer, gymnastics or falconry lessons, you decided you weren't willing to spend time preparing a meal when you got home. And you certainly didn\u2019t spend time preparing one before you left. Instead, you paid money to save time.\n\nBut food convenience has gone too far. From purchasing pre-made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with the crust cut off to pre-peeled garlic, you have to wonder how much time we\u2019re really saving. I mean, spend 90 seconds peeling the stinking garlic yourself, and save yourself a couple of bucks.\n\nI chose to answer this particular question this week as a catharsis. I fancy myself a learned financial mind. So why do I consistently have food delivered to my house, at a fee, when I could drive the two miles and five minutes to secure it myself? In this area of my life, I\u2019m lazy. I\u2019m not proud of it, but I\u2019m willing to admit to it.\n\nIf, upon inspection, a person feels as though they\u2019re not accomplishing their financial goals because of the amount of money they spend on food, then obviously further scrutiny is needed. However, it\u2019s been my experience that most folks simply don\u2019t have hard and fast financial goals, therefore overspending on food can\u2019t be blamed for a lack of success, because success is undefined. If I were to tie my desire to keep my kids from having student loans to the pizza I pick up on the way home from soccer, we\u2019d likely just have a can of soup when we got home.\n\nBut I ... I just can\u2019t. Does that make me a hypocrite? I don\u2019t know. Although I can say with certainty that my well-established financial goals aren\u2019t impacted by my dining habits, that doesn\u2019t mean I should feel justified in objectively lazy acts.\n\nMy assertion is most people who spend too much on dining out do so because of their relationship with convenience. Spending money to save time, isn\u2019t always a good idea. I\u2019m personally reflecting on this idea as I write it. Thousands of articles have been written about meal prep, meal planning and cheap eating. And it would behoove Americans to adopt healthier practices in these areas. But none of it matters if definitive financial goals aren't in place to counterbalance our urge to live a convenient life.\n\nDan, your suggestion is correct, to the point and indisputable. But when you wrote \"easily ... stopped\", well, easy is in the eye of the beholder.

Vanderbilt hosts Mississippi on Saturday, Nov. 17. (AP Photo/File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The Vanderbilt Commodores have no time left to lament the four games that have slipped through their grasp because they couldn't make the play to finish off a victory.\n\nWith two games remaining, the Commodores must win out if they want to play in a bowl for the second time in three seasons.\n\n\"It's win or go home,\" Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said.\n\nJunior receiver Kalija Lipscomb says it's a bit frustrating that the Commodores (4-6, 1-4 Southeastern Conference) have had issues playing a full 60 minutes each game. But Lipscomb says they know they're close and almost beat three Top 15 teams. Instead, they've lost four of their last five.\n\n\"We have to put four complete quarters together, and hopefully we do that this week,\" Lipscomb said.\n\nNow the Commodores host another team disappointed with its record in Mississippi (5-5, 1-5) on Saturday night. They beat Ole Miss when the Rebels visited two years ago as part of Vandy's push for Mason's first bowl game as a head coach. Now the Rebels have lost three straight including last week's 38-24 loss to Texas A&M despite one of the nation's best offenses.\n\nOle Miss coach Matt Luke and his Rebels face a quick turnaround too, playing the Egg Bowl on Thanksgiving. Luke has a similar message as Mason's, pushing his Rebels to finish games.\n\n\"They keep getting up off the mat to keep battling,\" Luke said. \"The object of the game is to win, and that's what those guys want. They're coming up short, they're disappointed, frustrated, but we have 10 more days left to pour into it to find a way to get that win in the fourth quarter. We're going to pour everything in to these last 10 days to keep these guys fighting and competing and find a way to win this thing in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nSome other things to know about Ole Miss and Vanderbilt:\n\nPHILLIPS UNCERTAIN\n\nThe biggest surprise on the Ole Miss offense this season has been junior college transfer Scottie Phillips, who has run for 927 yards and an SEC-leading 12 rushing touchdowns. He had just four yards rushing against Texas A&M last weekend after suffering a sprained ankle in the first quarter. His status for the Vanderbilt is uncertain.\n\nVANDY'S BIG BACK\n\nKe'Shawn Vaughn has put together back-to-back games that ranks among the best in Vanderbilt history. He ran for 172 yards at Arkansas, and he topped that by running for 182 yards in the Commodores' 33-28 loss at Missouri last week. His 354 yards rushing in consecutive games is the best by a Vandy running back since Frank Mordica ran for 435 yards against Air Force and Tennessee in 1978. Vaughn ranks fourth in the SEC with 849 yards rushing and has nine TDs rushing.\n\nQUITE A SERIES\n\nThe Ole Miss-Vanderbilt series has been very competitive over the past 13 years with the Commodores holding a 7-6 advantage during that span. Vanderbilt won six of eight in the series from 2005 to 2012 before the Rebels bounced back by winning four of the past five.\n\nTACKLING MACHINE\n\nVanderbilt linebacker Jordan Griffin is second in the SEC with 98 total tackles, and he's fourth with 50 solo tackles in a career season for the senior.\n\nSANOGO'S EMERGENCE\n\nIt's been a rough year for the Ole Miss defense, which ranks at or near the bottom of the SEC in many categories. One bright spot is the emergence of sophomore linebacker Mohamed Sanogo, who matched a career-high with 16 tackles against Texas A&M. He leads the team with 92 tackles and is fourth in the SEC with 9.2 tackles per game.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer David Brandt contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nROCHESTER, N.Y. \u2013 An early winter storm that dumped more than 6 inches of snow on Central Park spread chaos and misery from the Midwest to New England to the Deep South, caused at least seven deaths and triggered a New York-area commuter nightmare with jammed roadways, fuming travelers and buses stalled for lack of snow tires.\n\nAt one point, the weather service had issued winter storm warnings from western North Carolina to northern Maine, a distance of almost 1,000 miles.\n\nOff the Virginia coast, NASA even had to postpone a planned supply mission to the international space station.\n\nIn New York, snowplows and salt trucks were hampered in trying to deal with the wintry onslaught due to crushing gridlock on highways and local roads.\n\nThe wintry weather was moving quickly across New England on Friday but could linger in some parts through Saturday morning.\n\nSnow totals across the country's northern tier piled up as quickly as snowflakes from the unexpected pre-Thanksgiving storm. The St. Louis area had as much 8 inches of snow, parts of suburban Philadelphia got 5 inches and sections of New Jersey were on target for 8 inches. Parts of southern New England were bracing for up to to 6 inches as the storm moved east.\n\nMore than a foot of snow fell across portions of the Poconos in Pennsylvania and the Catskill Mountains in New York, and 6 to 10 inches of snow accumulated from western Maryland to northeastern Massachusetts.\n\nSome parts of New Jersey received 6 to 8 inches of snow, making it one of the largest totals ever for a single storm in November.\n\nCentral Park, with 6.4 inches, recorded the second-snowiest November day since 1869, turning the Manhattan park into a winter wonderland.\n\nWashington's Reagan National Airport recorded 1.4 inches, breaking the 112-year-old record for November of 0.2 inches. Baltimore had 1.7 inches of snow, beating the 1908 record for the day by 0.5 inches. Philadelphia's 2.4 inches bested the former record for the day of 1.6 inches.\n\nThe early winter blast was blamed for at least seven deaths. In Mississippi on Wednesday, a tour bus bound for a casino overturned, leaving two people dead and 44 others injured. And in the Little Rock, Arkansas, area, three people were killed in separate crashes on icy roads Wednesday night.\n\nOfficials in Ohio reported at least one traffic death that was likely weather-related. Indiana State Police also reported a death early Thursday, which they said was caused by a 60-year-old woman driving too fast on a slick road.\n\nOutages were reported throughout the snow's path. As of early Friday, roughly 300,000 customers were without power, mostly in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nUtility companies blamed a combination of the wet snow, heavy winds and the early-season timing of the storm \u2013 with trees still clinging to their leaves in the late fall \u2013 for the falling branches.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, along a 30-mile stretch of I-78 in the Lehigh Valley, some drivers were stuck for up to 12 hours Thursday afternoon into Friday morning.\n\nAt one point, WPVI-TV reports, police drove along the opposite side of the interstate, honking their horns to wake up drivers who fell asleep in their trucks. \"Drivers, wake up! Traffic's moving!\" police shouted.\n\nNew Jersey State Police responded to 555 crashes and 1,027 motorists in need of aid, Sgt. Lawrence Peele said.\n\nThe storm caught travelers and political leaders alike off guard.\n\n\"The total lack of preparedness from the governor\u2019s mansion on down left our state in a complete mess!\" said Jay Wanczyk, who spent more than seven hours on a NJ Transit bus from Pompton Plains, New Jersey, to Manhattan.\n\nNewly installed New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy sympathized.\n\n\"Again, I don\u2019t blame folks for being, you know, sitting there in a parking lot, being frustrated,\" Murphy said. \"But again, patience. Mother Nature has thrown us a real tough one tonight, and we\u2019re going to clear the roads out.\u201d\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Christie joined the chorus of critics, saying on Twitter he needed five hours and 40 minutes to drive from Piscataway to Mendham, a 27-mile trip that normally takes around 40 minutes.\n\nNew Jersey's largest city, Newark, was among the metropolitan areas blitzed by the storm. A ground stop was in place briefly at the city's international airport early Friday morning following a day in which 400 flights were cancelled. A ground stop was also briefly in place at Boston Logan Airport on Thursday night.\n\nIn New York City, as the chaos on roadways intensified, commuters were advised not to go to the Port Authority Bus Terminal because of overcrowding that had turned the facility into wall-to-wall people, all staring at the schedule board.\n\nThe poor weather had made it difficult for buses to reach the terminal, officials said. A multivehicle accident on the George Washington Bridge added to the nightmare, as did the closure of the Bayonne Bridge connecting Staten Island to New Jersey.\n\nStephanie Garcia said her mother's trip from Pelham to Yonkers \u2013 typically a 12- to 15-minute drive \u2013 took 4\u00bd hours.\n\n\"It's a total disaster. There were cars and buses stuck absolutely everywhere,\" Garcia said. \"I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t salt the roads before it started.\"\n\nAlso adding to chaos in New York City were buses, without chains, having difficulty going up inclines and in some cases ending up sprawled across the roadway.\n\nNYC Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia told FOX 5\u2019s \u201cGood Day New York\u201d that the day was \"challenging\" but that the city all its equipment \"up and ready to go.\"\n\nShe said having more equipment would not have helped. \u201cIn all honesty, I am not sure what we could have done if we had added a tremendous amount of additional pieces of equipment, if they would just have been stuck,\" she said.\n\nRegarding the lack of chains on the tires of city buses, Garcia said having them would have been helpful but the forecasts at the time they went out would not have called for chains.\n\nForecasters said the early winter blast is not over. Another round of winter weather could bring more heavy snow to parts of the Northern Plains.\n\nContributing: Scott Fallon in Bergen, New Jersey; Christopher J.

Lesser, European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A record-breaking total of more than $5 billion was spent on the just concluded midterm elections, but dozens of candidates who spent more money than their opponents were not celebrating a win on election night.\n\nIn at least 41 House races, the bigger spender lost \u2013 including 36 contests in which the Democrat outspent the Republican, according to an analysis of campaign spending totals compiled by USA TODAY.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the amount of money raised and spent was not a factor. The winner of the majority of House races was the candidate who raised and spent the most money. Democratic candidates held a huge spending advantage over Republicans in this year\u2019s midterms, which drew massive voter turnout compared to most off-year elections.\n\nDemocrats ousted one incumbent GOP senator \u2013 Nevada\u2019s Dean Heller \u2013 and at least 22 Republican incumbent House members (with several races still to be decided), while Republicans defeated four Senate Democratic incumbents \u2013 Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Bill Nelson of Florida.\n\nAnother big factor in winning at the polls remains a longstanding trend in American politics: the power of incumbency. More than 90 percent of the incumbents who did run for re-election won their races.\n\nRecords were also set by the more than $1.3 billion spent by outside groups \u2013 those other than the candidates\u2019 campaign committees \u2013 and the $98 million in so-called dark money. These are funds spent by groups who don\u2019t have to reveal their donors.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you haven\u2019t paid any attention,\" said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, the government reform group. \"The result would be pretty much what you expect: the red states went red; the off party in the midterm did well.\"\n\nA good example of an election where the candidate who spent more money didn\u2019t win was in Georgia\u2019s 6th District in the northern suburbs of Atlanta where Democrat Lucia McBath defeated Karen Handel. McBath\u2019s campaign spent $1.2 million compared to $8 million dropped by Handel\u2019s campaign.\n\nOutside groups more than compensated for the disadvantage that McBath faced by spending $12.2 million to support her or attack Handel, compared to $4.3 million spent by outside groups who supported Handel or attacked McBath.\n\nThis congressional district race is no stranger to big money. Last year, it was one of the most expensive House races in history ($55 million) when Democrat Jon Ossoff lost to Handel in a special election for a seat once held by Tom Price, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services. Price resigned from the Trump administration over using chartered flights on official government business.\n\nHere are a few other campaign finance facts out of the 2018 midterm election:\n\n\u2022 The Texas race in which Republican Sen. Ted Cruz defeated challenger Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke is the most expensive House or Senate race in U.S. history, with O\u2019Rourke alone setting a record by raising $69.1 million.\n\n\u2022 The Congressional Leadership Fund, a committee that supports GOP candidates, set a record for a Super PAC by spending $137.5 million in the campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\u2022 Special interest political action committees continue to focus their giving on incumbents, with these PACs giving $385 million to those already in office for an average of more than $500,000 per incumbent compared to the $72.5 million, or average of more than $35,000, for challengers.\n\n\u2022 Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam, were the top individual Republican donors, giving a total of more than $130 million to GOP candidates and committees. The top Democratic giver was Thomas Steyer, the businessman who has been pushing for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. He gave more than $50 million.\n\nSheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam, were the top individual Republican donors in the midterms, giving a total of more than $130 million to GOP candidates and committees.

His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league franchise.\n\nIncluding the Atlanta Braves.\n\nHarper rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract offer from the Washington Nationals in September, and is a good bet to set a new standard for the most lucrative contract in North American sports history.\n\nIt may take weeks for that process to play out. In the meantime, USA TODAY Sports will examine why every team could use Harper\u2019s services \u2013 some more than others, certainly some better-equipped to procure them.\n\nA case for Harper and the Braves joining forces:\n\nOn the field\n\nIn an era of \u201cwindows\u201d and franchises closely monitoring their \u201cwin curves,\u201d it\u2019s refreshing when a team knocks down the door and tells the front office, \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nThat was the Braves in 2018, shrugging off the service-time suppression of Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. to win 90 games and the National League East over Harper\u2019s Nationals.\n\nNow, they have a rare mix of established but still viable veterans and emerging stars. And dropping Harper into a lineup bracketed by Rookie of the Year Acu\u00f1a and three-time All-Star Freddie Freeman (he of the .875 lifetime OPS) is, well, it\u2019s what you want.\n\nThe vacancy is natural: Right fielder Nick Markakis is a free agent. Harper could stroll right into SunTrust Park and set up shop for the next decade-plus, flanked for the next two seasons by Ender Inciarte in center field and across the way from left fielder Acu\u00f1a for the next six.\n\nFreeman, still just 29, also is signed through the next two seasons. The middle-infield combo of Dansby Swanson and Ozzie Albies are under control for four and five more seasons, respectively.\n\nIn short: The Braves would have a devastating, well-balanced and athletic core for the next two seasons, and a sustainable one far beyond that.\n\nOff the field\n\nHarper has been the game\u2019s most consistently recognizable face and theoretically could boost his marketing cachet in places like Los Angeles, Chicago or New York.\n\nDon\u2019t sleep on the ATL, however.\n\nAlready a top-10 market, Atlanta is on pace to surpass Philadelphia in population by 2022, moving to eighth overall in the USA. It added 90,000 new residents in 2017, its growth trailing only the Dallas and Houston markets. And that growth skews young, diverse and professional.\n\nClearly, there are worse destinations to expand your brand.\n\nThe Braves fan base also is something of a sleeping giant: There\u2019s still plenty of \u201880s and \u201890s kids raised on TBS broadcasts scattered about the country, and the club\u2019s social media metrics rank highly. While teams often suffer an attendance dropoff in the second year of a ballpark, the Braves enjoyed a 2% bump (cracking 2.5 million) in 2018 as they went from contenders to division champions.\n\nWhy they could pull it off\n\nWith a franchise value approaching $2 billion and annual revenues of $335 million, according to Forbes, the Braves certainly have money. Complicating that cash flow is the fact that they\u2019re one of the few corporate-owned teams in this era, as Liberty Media controls the purse strings.\n\nAnother downside: A below-market TV contract that runs through 2027, although a 2013 re-working of the deal should lead to more than $500 million in revenue flowing toward the ballclub, Liberty said in 2014.\n\nWith that in mind, securing Harper\u2019s services \u2013 for, say, 12 years and $420 million \u2013 might be a wise long-term investment.\n\nWhile industry observers ponder the concept of a \u201cTV rights bubble,\u201d Major League Baseball\u2019s contract extension with Fox that keeps its jewel events on television through 2028 shows the TV sports model is shifting but won\u2019t shatter anytime soon.\n\nHarper will be 35 by the time the Braves\u2019 local rights hit the market again, but he\u2019d still be under contract and presumably would have added significant relevance and reach to the Braves\u2019 brand. That wouldn\u2019t hurt come time to negotiate a new TV deal.\n\nWill it happen?\n\nProbably not. Lavishing that much money on one player would be a relatively rash departure from the Braves\u2019 disciplined rebuild. While there are significant arms among their top prospects, pitching remains the greater short-term need over a big bat.\n\nShould they prefer a bigger-picture approach, however, Harper makes a lot of sense \u2013 for both parties.\n\nFollow Lacques on Twitter @GabeLacques"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "AC Milan preparing for new UEFA judgment on FFP violations", "description": "AC Milan is preparing for another hearing before UEFA's club finance panel next week", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/16/ac-milan-preparing-for-new-uefa-judgment-on-ffp-violations/38542189/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/486f78fddb4223f675847e2e3616c4fb2309b3a5/c=0-137-3439-2071/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/39e0d1004328434795db32b2eced79f5.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:55:16Z", "content": "FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018 file photo, AC Milan's Patrick Cutrone reacts at the end of the Europa League, Group F soccer match between AC Milan and Betis, at the Benito Villamarin Stadium in Seville, Spain.

(AP Photo/Manuel Gomez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 AC Milan is preparing for another hearing before UEFA's club finance panel next week.\n\nIn July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned a ban imposed on the seven-time European champions for overspending.\n\nCAS said the one-year exclusion from European competition was too harsh considering Milan's recent takeover by U.S.-based hedge fund Elliott Management.\n\n\"They do not have a very difficult task,\" Milan executive chairman Paolo Scaroni told the Gazzetta dello Sport. \"Both parties agree on the fact that in the period between 2014 and 2017 the club infringed the limits of FFP. They must only establish a proportionate sanction.\"\n\nPossible new sanctions include limits on player salaries, transfer spending, squad sizes in the Champions League or Europa League and large suspended fines.\n\nWhen it was initially banned in June, Milan said it failed to break even on soccer-related business in the period from July 2014-June 2017 \u2014 before its 2017 spending spree.\n\nFor 2017-18, Milan spent more than 200 million euros (then nearly $250 million) on new players. That was despite questions over the financial stability of the Chinese-led consortium that purchased the club from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for $800 million in April 2017.\n\nElliott took control of Milan in June after former owner Li Yonghong missed a deadline to repay part of a loan worth more than 300 million euros ($350 million) from the hedge fund. Elliott repossessed the holding company in Luxembourg that Li used to buy Milan.\n\nScaroni rejected reports that Elliott was seeking a new minority shareholder.\n\n\"There are no negotiations \u2014 zero \u2014 no shareholder in sight nor we are looking for it,\" Scaroni said in an interview published Friday. \"Elliott has a broad design to be implemented in three-five years. Firstly, it must create value to eventually disinvest one day.\"\n\nWhile Milan is currently in fifth place in Serie A, one spot \u2014 and one point \u2014 below the Champions League places, Scaroni said that qualifying for the lucrative competition would not be decisive financially.\n\n\"In all the papers relevant to this year's business plan we do not foresee the qualification in the Champions League,\" Scaroni said. \"Next year, we do. We would need a Plan B if we fail.\"\n\nMilan hasn't played in the Champions League since the 2013-14 season.\n\nNext month, former Arsenal CEO Ivan Gazidis will assume the same position at Milan.\n\n\"He will manage the engine: I will take a step back,\" Scaroni said. \"AC Milan has the vital problem of increasing revenues, which today are the same as in 2003 against double or triple expenses to pay players. Since there is no longer a patron who covers the expenses, we need another philosophy and Gazidis has already been down this road with Arsenal.\"\n\nLast week, Milan and city rival Inter agreed to work on a shared stadium project, announcing a preference for \"complete renovation\" of their city-owned San Siro home.\n\nScaroni called the stadium plan \"a way to halve investments and maintenance and at the same time to double the value of the sponsors.\"\n\n\"The stadium increases the revenues by 40-50 million euros and a big sponsor could purchase naming rights,\" Scaroni said. \"We will have international companies queuing to make the investment. And we would cash a lot more than the Allianz Stadium (Juventus' home) in Turin.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Their relationship was detailed this month in the \"Football Leaks\" series of confidential documents and emails.\n\nThormann's suspension from leading the financial crimes unit was revealed last week, following a complaint filed in September.

Two were convicted last December after a trial lasting more than a month at Brooklyn federal court.\n\nAlso Friday in Switzerland, members of the Valais parliament voted 120-1 to seek further investigation of reported links between prosecutor Rinaldo Arnold and Infantino, who grew up in the region.\n\nAccording to \"Football Leaks,\" Arnold helped arrange and attended a meeting between Lauber and Infantino in 2016, then accepted FIFA hospitality to attend meetings in Mexico and the World Cup in Russia. Infantino has said he broke no FIFA rules.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Durant has a player option for the 2019-20 season, and the Warriors want their superteam intact for the opening of their new arena, the Chase Center, in San Francisco next season. Green blurted to Durant something along the lines of, \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. We won without you. Leave,\u201d sources said. That stance couldn\u2019t be any further from how the franchise views its odds of competing for titles in the future without Durant. The Warriors desperately want to re-sign the 7-foot small forward, and such a divisive incident in front of the entire team from one of their most influential players was deemed grounds for discipline. Emotions got the best of both of them, but Green put the organization in a difficult spot. There was a point during the argument when Durant cringed, and that was when it went from a typical competitive basketball argument to a personal shot that cut deep, sources said.\n\nIt makes complete sense why the Warriors would react with a suspension. There are arguments between players, and then there\u2019s doing the opposite of a free agency pitch to one of the NBA\u2019s best players. Golden State\u2019s discipline is a message to Durant \u2014 this is how much we don\u2019t agree with Green, basically.\n\nIf the Warriors want any chance at retaining Durant\u2019s services, they need to be completely in line from top to bottom, giving the forward everything he wants from rings to the comfort of teammates he enjoys playing with.\n\nIt seems like the organization is in the process of moving on now.

(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nROCHESTER, N.Y. \u2013 An early winter storm that dumped more than 6 inches of snow on Central Park spread chaos and misery from the Midwest to New England to the Deep South, caused at least seven deaths and triggered a New York-area commuter nightmare with jammed roadways, fuming travelers and buses stalled for lack of snow tires.\n\nAt one point, the weather service had issued winter storm warnings from western North Carolina to northern Maine, a distance of almost 1,000 miles.\n\nOff the Virginia coast, NASA even had to postpone a planned supply mission to the international space station.\n\nIn New York, snowplows and salt trucks were hampered in trying to deal with the wintry onslaught due to crushing gridlock on highways and local roads.\n\nThe wintry weather was moving quickly across New England on Friday but could linger in some parts through Saturday morning.\n\nSnow totals across the country's northern tier piled up as quickly as snowflakes from the unexpected pre-Thanksgiving storm. The St. Louis area had as much 8 inches of snow, parts of suburban Philadelphia got 5 inches and sections of New Jersey were on target for 8 inches. Parts of southern New England were bracing for up to to 6 inches as the storm moved east.\n\nMore than a foot of snow fell across portions of the Poconos in Pennsylvania and the Catskill Mountains in New York, and 6 to 10 inches of snow accumulated from western Maryland to northeastern Massachusetts.\n\nSome parts of New Jersey received 6 to 8 inches of snow, making it one of the largest totals ever for a single storm in November.\n\nCentral Park, with 6.4 inches, recorded the second-snowiest November day since 1869, turning the Manhattan park into a winter wonderland.\n\nWashington's Reagan National Airport recorded 1.4 inches, breaking the 112-year-old record for November of 0.2 inches. Baltimore had 1.7 inches of snow, beating the 1908 record for the day by 0.5 inches. Philadelphia's 2.4 inches bested the former record for the day of 1.6 inches.\n\nThe early winter blast was blamed for at least seven deaths. In Mississippi on Wednesday, a tour bus bound for a casino overturned, leaving two people dead and 44 others injured. And in the Little Rock, Arkansas, area, three people were killed in separate crashes on icy roads Wednesday night.\n\nOfficials in Ohio reported at least one traffic death that was likely weather-related. Indiana State Police also reported a death early Thursday, which they said was caused by a 60-year-old woman driving too fast on a slick road.\n\nOutages were reported throughout the snow's path. As of early Friday, roughly 300,000 customers were without power, mostly in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nUtility companies blamed a combination of the wet snow, heavy winds and the early-season timing of the storm \u2013 with trees still clinging to their leaves in the late fall \u2013 for the falling branches.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, along a 30-mile stretch of I-78 in the Lehigh Valley, some drivers were stuck for up to 12 hours Thursday afternoon into Friday morning.\n\nAt one point, WPVI-TV reports, police drove along the opposite side of the interstate, honking their horns to wake up drivers who fell asleep in their trucks. \"Drivers, wake up! Traffic's moving!\" police shouted.\n\nNew Jersey State Police responded to 555 crashes and 1,027 motorists in need of aid, Sgt. Lawrence Peele said.\n\nThe storm caught travelers and political leaders alike off guard.\n\n\"The total lack of preparedness from the governor\u2019s mansion on down left our state in a complete mess!\" said Jay Wanczyk, who spent more than seven hours on a NJ Transit bus from Pompton Plains, New Jersey, to Manhattan.\n\nNewly installed New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy sympathized.\n\n\"Again, I don\u2019t blame folks for being, you know, sitting there in a parking lot, being frustrated,\" Murphy said. \"But again, patience. Mother Nature has thrown us a real tough one tonight, and we\u2019re going to clear the roads out.\u201d\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Christie joined the chorus of critics, saying on Twitter he needed five hours and 40 minutes to drive from Piscataway to Mendham, a 27-mile trip that normally takes around 40 minutes.\n\nNew Jersey's largest city, Newark, was among the metropolitan areas blitzed by the storm. A ground stop was in place briefly at the city's international airport early Friday morning following a day in which 400 flights were cancelled. A ground stop was also briefly in place at Boston Logan Airport on Thursday night.\n\nIn New York City, as the chaos on roadways intensified, commuters were advised not to go to the Port Authority Bus Terminal because of overcrowding that had turned the facility into wall-to-wall people, all staring at the schedule board.\n\nThe poor weather had made it difficult for buses to reach the terminal, officials said. A multivehicle accident on the George Washington Bridge added to the nightmare, as did the closure of the Bayonne Bridge connecting Staten Island to New Jersey.\n\nStephanie Garcia said her mother's trip from Pelham to Yonkers \u2013 typically a 12- to 15-minute drive \u2013 took 4\u00bd hours.\n\n\"It's a total disaster. There were cars and buses stuck absolutely everywhere,\" Garcia said. \"I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t salt the roads before it started.\"\n\nAlso adding to chaos in New York City were buses, without chains, having difficulty going up inclines and in some cases ending up sprawled across the roadway.\n\nNYC Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia told FOX 5\u2019s \u201cGood Day New York\u201d that the day was \"challenging\" but that the city all its equipment \"up and ready to go.\"\n\nShe said having more equipment would not have helped. \u201cIn all honesty, I am not sure what we could have done if we had added a tremendous amount of additional pieces of equipment, if they would just have been stuck,\" she said.\n\nRegarding the lack of chains on the tires of city buses, Garcia said having them would have been helpful but the forecasts at the time they went out would not have called for chains.\n\nForecasters said the early winter blast is not over. Another round of winter weather could bring more heavy snow to parts of the Northern Plains.\n\nContributing: Scott Fallon in Bergen, New Jersey; Christopher J.

Toyota Tacoma leads, but new Ford Ranger, Jeep Scrambler pose threat\n\nMore Money: 401(k) millionaires at Fidelity jump 41 percent in third quarter to record 187,400\n\nMore Money: Saddled with huge student loan debt, homebuyers sacrifice more to purchase a house\n\nI am tickled when a chef can make simple ingredients taste like magic. How can a piece of fish taste fine when I make it, but transform into an ethereal experience when prepared by a master? Whatever the answer, I\u2019m willing to pay for that moment. I\u2019m also willing to pay to watch a group of relative strangers place a sombrero on my kid\u2019s head, and sing Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os off key. In fact, I place moments like these in my entertainment budget, and you should too.\n\nBut convenience is an entirely different story, one that tempts us all with the slipperiest of slopes.\n\nConvenience is when a person chooses to exchange money for time. On the way home from your kid's soccer, gymnastics or falconry lessons, you decided you weren't willing to spend time preparing a meal when you got home. And you certainly didn\u2019t spend time preparing one before you left. Instead, you paid money to save time.\n\nBut food convenience has gone too far. From purchasing pre-made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with the crust cut off to pre-peeled garlic, you have to wonder how much time we\u2019re really saving. I mean, spend 90 seconds peeling the stinking garlic yourself, and save yourself a couple of bucks.\n\nI chose to answer this particular question this week as a catharsis. I fancy myself a learned financial mind. So why do I consistently have food delivered to my house, at a fee, when I could drive the two miles and five minutes to secure it myself? In this area of my life, I\u2019m lazy. I\u2019m not proud of it, but I\u2019m willing to admit to it.\n\nIf, upon inspection, a person feels as though they\u2019re not accomplishing their financial goals because of the amount of money they spend on food, then obviously further scrutiny is needed. However, it\u2019s been my experience that most folks simply don\u2019t have hard and fast financial goals, therefore overspending on food can\u2019t be blamed for a lack of success, because success is undefined. If I were to tie my desire to keep my kids from having student loans to the pizza I pick up on the way home from soccer, we\u2019d likely just have a can of soup when we got home.\n\nBut I ... I just can\u2019t. Does that make me a hypocrite? I don\u2019t know. Although I can say with certainty that my well-established financial goals aren\u2019t impacted by my dining habits, that doesn\u2019t mean I should feel justified in objectively lazy acts.\n\nMy assertion is most people who spend too much on dining out do so because of their relationship with convenience. Spending money to save time, isn\u2019t always a good idea. I\u2019m personally reflecting on this idea as I write it. Thousands of articles have been written about meal prep, meal planning and cheap eating. And it would behoove Americans to adopt healthier practices in these areas. But none of it matters if definitive financial goals aren't in place to counterbalance our urge to live a convenient life.\n\nDan, your suggestion is correct, to the point and indisputable. But when you wrote \"easily ... stopped\", well, easy is in the eye of the beholder. That\u2019s the frustrating part about human behavior: We often act in ways that don\u2019t make a lot of sense.\n\nPeter Dunn is an author, speaker and radio host, and he has a free podcast: Million Dollar Plan.

Lesser, European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A record-breaking total of more than $5 billion was spent on the just concluded midterm elections, but dozens of candidates who spent more money than their opponents were not celebrating a win on election night.\n\nIn at least 41 House races, the bigger spender lost \u2013 including 36 contests in which the Democrat outspent the Republican, according to an analysis of campaign spending totals compiled by USA TODAY.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the amount of money raised and spent was not a factor. The winner of the majority of House races was the candidate who raised and spent the most money. Democratic candidates held a huge spending advantage over Republicans in this year\u2019s midterms, which drew massive voter turnout compared to most off-year elections.\n\nDemocrats ousted one incumbent GOP senator \u2013 Nevada\u2019s Dean Heller \u2013 and at least 22 Republican incumbent House members (with several races still to be decided), while Republicans defeated four Senate Democratic incumbents \u2013 Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Bill Nelson of Florida.\n\nAnother big factor in winning at the polls remains a longstanding trend in American politics: the power of incumbency. More than 90 percent of the incumbents who did run for re-election won their races.\n\nRecords were also set by the more than $1.3 billion spent by outside groups \u2013 those other than the candidates\u2019 campaign committees \u2013 and the $98 million in so-called dark money. These are funds spent by groups who don\u2019t have to reveal their donors.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you haven\u2019t paid any attention,\" said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, the government reform group. \"The result would be pretty much what you expect: the red states went red; the off party in the midterm did well.\"\n\nA good example of an election where the candidate who spent more money didn\u2019t win was in Georgia\u2019s 6th District in the northern suburbs of Atlanta where Democrat Lucia McBath defeated Karen Handel. McBath\u2019s campaign spent $1.2 million compared to $8 million dropped by Handel\u2019s campaign.\n\nOutside groups more than compensated for the disadvantage that McBath faced by spending $12.2 million to support her or attack Handel, compared to $4.3 million spent by outside groups who supported Handel or attacked McBath.\n\nThis congressional district race is no stranger to big money. Last year, it was one of the most expensive House races in history ($55 million) when Democrat Jon Ossoff lost to Handel in a special election for a seat once held by Tom Price, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services. Price resigned from the Trump administration over using chartered flights on official government business.\n\nHere are a few other campaign finance facts out of the 2018 midterm election:\n\n\u2022 The Texas race in which Republican Sen. Ted Cruz defeated challenger Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke is the most expensive House or Senate race in U.S. history, with O\u2019Rourke alone setting a record by raising $69.1 million.\n\n\u2022 The Congressional Leadership Fund, a committee that supports GOP candidates, set a record for a Super PAC by spending $137.5 million in the campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\u2022 Special interest political action committees continue to focus their giving on incumbents, with these PACs giving $385 million to those already in office for an average of more than $500,000 per incumbent compared to the $72.5 million, or average of more than $35,000, for challengers.\n\n\u2022 Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam, were the top individual Republican donors, giving a total of more than $130 million to GOP candidates and committees. The top Democratic giver was Thomas Steyer, the businessman who has been pushing for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. He gave more than $50 million.\n\nSheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam, were the top individual Republican donors in the midterms, giving a total of more than $130 million to GOP candidates and committees.

One thing is for sure, LSU's ranking is head scratching. USA TODAY\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa during the first quarter against LSU at Tiger Stadium. (Photo: Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNick Saban resisted the temptation \u2013 and we all know it lurked somewhere inside \u2013 to erupt this week. We knew the questions were coming. He knew the questions were coming.\n\nSomeone had the temerity to ask Saban whether, given Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s gimpy knee, he might rest the sophomore quarterback Saturday against The Citadel?\n\n\u201cNo. \u2026 No,\u201d Saban told reporters Monday. \u201cWhy would we do that? I mean (are you trying) to say this is not an important game or he doesn\u2019t need to play?\u201d\n\nWell, yes. That\u2019s exactly what they were saying \u2013 but Saban was finished; he left the room. It was good stuff, though. Even if it was mild by his standards, it was as predictable as the annual November date against an overmatched nonconference opponent.\n\nWelcome, y\u2019all, to the SEC\u2019s Cupcake Weekend. While other leagues are fighting it out for conference titles (and College Football Playoff hopes), the SEC carves out time for a breather from the grind of a long season before the final push.\n\nYeah, there are three conference games. But Alabama plays The Citadel. Florida has Idaho. South Carolina gets Chattanooga. Beyond the FCS opponents, it's Massachusetts at Georgia, Rice at LSU, Liberty at Auburn and Alabama-Birmingham at Texas A&M (though that one is at least intriguing).\n\nWhy? Because they can. Because it works.\n\nEven as the rest of college football grumbles, the November paycheck games provide a nice boost to the SEC\u2019s postseason hopes.\n\nIf these games were played in September, there\u2019d be far less complaining from elsewhere. Instead, the SEC plays conference games earlier in the season, which serves the dual purpose of providing TV partners with more attractive inventory in the season\u2019s first month \u2013 when those other Power Five leagues are usually gorging on their own cupcakes \u2013 and building resumes that impress the playoff selection committee when it begins its work in late October.\n\nAnd then, in the final weeks of the season, this soft weekend helps to ensure that pushes will not be derailed, and provides a nice break before finishing with rivalry games. And the selection committee has not so far shown any inclination to meaningfully re-evaluate those bodies of work; the first impressions have more staying power than the empty calories.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, too: If the SEC\u2019s Power Five peers wanted, they could do the same. No one forces the Big Ten, Big 12 or Pac-12 to play nine conference games. No one made those three, plus the ACC, fill November almost exclusively with conference games.\n\nAnd no one should expect the SEC to change.\n\nStill, when Saban describes the matchup with The Citadel as \u201ca challenge for us,\u201d it\u2019s hard not to laugh. His challenge this week is keeping the players motivated (though that likely does not matter, either). The biggest challenge is getting anyone excited about any of these games.\n\nBut instead of pretending this slate is anything other than what it really is, maybe the SEC should simply acknowledge and embrace it. Sign endorsement deals with local bakeries. Pass out cupcakes in the parking lots. This, of course, assumes folk are tailgating; this weekend is one of the very few where it\u2019s safe to schedule a fall wedding, or a hunting trip can be taken without guilt.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much external carping as the potential its own people might stay away that might eventually force the SEC to change. With its passionate fan bases, the league has seemed largely immune to the falling attendance across the college football landscape (and in other sports at almost any level). But even in the South, sold-out stadiums are no longer a given \u2013 and that\u2019s especially true when the opponent barely has a pulse.\n\nJust don\u2019t suggest that last part to Saban. If you doubt his sincerity in talking up The Citadel this week \u2013 or at least in insisting it is ludicrous to question if his stars should play \u2013 recall what happened in 2007, his first season at Alabama, when Louisiana-Monroe took advantage of four turnovers and upset the Tide. That was before Alabama got things rolling, sure. But Saban remembers.\n\nThere are more recent examples. Jacksonville State beat Ole Miss in 2010. When Georgia Southern beat Florida in 2013 (without completing a pass!), it was a pivot point in Will Muschamp\u2019s tenure in Gainesville; he was fired a year later (just ahead of a game with Eastern Kentucky).\n\nAnd when, ahem, The Citadel beat South Carolina 23-22 in 2015, it came after Steve Spurrier\u2019s midseason retirement and shortly before Muschamp\u2019s hiring by the Gamecocks. In other words, when South Carolina hosts Chattanooga on Saturday, no one should count it as an automatic win.\n\nBut no one will ever mistake it, or any of these November matchups, as anything but glorified scrimmages.\n\nIf Saban had his way, the practice wouldn\u2019t exist. He\u2019d like to play only non-conference games against other Power Five leagues. And he\u2019s on board with Auburn\u2019s Gus Malzahn in advocating for a nine-game SEC schedule \u2013 which would mean only three non-conference games, and would presumably end these annual late-season pillow fights.\n\nBut the SEC does not appear close to change. Last July, commissioner Greg Sankey brought up the league\u2019s scheduling philosophy, unprompted, at SEC media days. He recited several pertinent statistics including this one: An SEC team has played in 11 of the last 12 national championship games; winning nine.\n\nHe noted the SEC had at least 10 teams in bowls for four consecutive seasons from 2013-16, and nine in 2017. Nine teams have qualified already this season; two more have a shot (Ole Miss could, too \u2013 though the Rebels can\u2019t go to a bowl because of NCAA sanctions).\n\n\u201cStated succinctly, what we do works at both the national championship level,\u201d Sankey said, \u201cand at a level that provides our teams\u2019 meaningful access to postseason bowl opportunities.\u201d\n\nTranslation: It just means more cupcakes. Which brings us back to one of Saban\u2019s frustrated answers about whether Tagovailoa should play Saturday.\n\n\u201cYou all might be taking the week off this week,\u201d Saban told reporters this week. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nSadly, though, the SEC essentially is."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY", "title": "Phillies will spend big bucks in free agency, 'maybe even be a little bit stupid about it'", "description": "Owner John Middleton and the Phillies have plenty of salary wiggle room to score big wins in free-agent market - like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2018/11/16/phillies-free-agency-bryce-harper-manny-machado/2016945002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/cabf456d-78bd-4895-904d-795728287cb7-USP_MLB__Atlanta_Braves_at_Philadelphia_Phillies.JPG?crop=2911,1637,x2317,y418&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:00:03Z", "content": "Phillies center fielder Roman Quinn signs autographs on fan appreciation day.

That figure drops to $50.68 million in 2020 and plummets to $15.1 million in 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to contemplate what we may be able to do this off-season,\u2019\u2019 Middleton said. \u201cWe know the free agent class this year is really, really good.\u2019\u2019\n\nCould they spend in excess of $700 million to land the two biggest fish in the free-agent sea?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re referring to,\u2019\u2019 Middleton said, with a laugh. \u201cBut we will be spending.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Phillies have been eyeing this winter for years, knowing they could land at least one of the two greatest young players to hit the marketplace in decades. They could sign Harper or Machado, and grab a marquee starter like Patrick Corbin or Dallas Keuchel, or All-Star closer Craig Kimbrel.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have like one need,\u2019\u2019 Middleton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we need a left-handed relief pitcher in the eighth inning. We got lots of ways to go to improve this ballclub. Starting pitching. Bullpen. In the field. At the plate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good because it gives you the opportunity to explore a lot of different ways, but it\u2019s difficult because it creates a lot of options. So, you\u2019re talking to a lot of people, and do a lot of evaluations.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd at the same time, making friends who happen to be player-agents, who\u2019d love to get a piece of that Phillies\u2019 money pie. If not now, maybe in 2019 or 2020.\n\n\u201cEvery free agent now is apparently my free agent,\u2019\u2019 Middleton said. \u201cAs Andy [MacPhail, Phillies president] likes to tell me, 'John, we are playing baseball after 2019, so, you can\u2019t spend every last dime after this year.'\n\n\u201cYou got to have something in the tank for future years.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Phillies believe their window to win is opening. They were in first place in the NL East as late as Aug. 12, but failed to finish with a winning record for the seventh consecutive season, dropping to 80-82 and losing 20 of 28 games in September. Yet, their 14-game improvement in the wins column and young core have them believing they could be on the verge of greatness, resurrecting the days of 2007-2011 when they reached the postseason five consecutive years and won a World Series.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at the end of the season, we quite frankly collapsed,\u2019\u2019 Middleton said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve gotten better. It\u2019s always more fun building and making progress, than the beginning of that rebuilding stage. There\u2019s a lot of talk in Philadelphia about the off-season now.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe expectations have become so great in Philadelphia there would be a major meltdown if the Phillies don\u2019t come away with either Harper or Machado, and a few other free agents or trade acquisitions.\n\n\u201cIt makes it fun,\u2019\u2019 Middleton said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot of pressure, too. ...

There were plenty of others dating back to when I started drinking the summer before ninth grade.\n\nFor me, fortunately, dashing my dreams of an on-air television and print journalism career became my \"bottom.\" It surprised even me that I would drink all through Super Bowl Sunday, stopping only to sleep about an hour before showing up for a 6 a.m. TV spot the next day, Jan. 27, 1992. And that's despite the fact I was drinking about two bottles of wine a night in the 10 years since college.\n\nMore: Alcohol is killing more, and younger, people.

There was a violent first marriage that seemed drawn from the footage of the movie \"Barfly.\" (My rehearsal dinner toast: \"To my mother, who said I'd never meet a nice guy in a bar!\") And he certainly wasn't the only ill-considered romantic relationship.\n\nJayne O'Donnell has been a USA TODAY reporter since November 1993. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nUntil I started researching the dramatically increasing deaths due to alcohol, I thought society's drinking problem had changed along with my own. After all, people seemed far more focused on working out and eating healthy, and there is so much more attention on drunken driving. Plus, the opioid epidemic is getting all the attention now, even though it's all the same disease \u2013 addiction. Having to alternate liquor stores and justify bulk wine purchases seemed so last decade.\n\nWas I ever wrong.\n\nTalk about genetic predisposition\n\nLike me, my paternal grandfather quit drinking at age 32. Grandfather O'Donnell, a bar owner who died before I was born, told my dad he got tired of throwing up every day.\n\nMy late mother would complain about my father's drinking, which during their nearly 30-year marriage never included drinking alone at home. Those were the guys who had the problems, he'd say. But going to happy hour at 3 p.m. and coming home at 3 a.m. seemed a questionable high road.\n\nMore: To live in California is to be stalked by wildfire. How are we doing? Edgy. Tired. Angry.\n\nAs a loneliness epidemic rages, I've learned you're only as sick as your secrets\n\nWhy so busy? Our flawed college system takes toll on families years before tuition is due\n\nMom could hardly say she wasn't warned. On her first date with my father, Dad and his close friend \u2013 who worked part time at a liquor store \u2013 each brought a case of beer. For themselves.\n\nDad quit drinking after his heart condition prompted his cardiologist to limit him to two beers. \"What's the point?\" he asked.\n\nMy last drink came a couple years later, but long after the warning signs started appearing.\n\nA danger to myself and others\n\nWhen I was 16, I missed a sharp turn while drunk and careened into the former mayor's mailbox, totaling my mother's beloved new white Ford Mustang II. The following year, I did Kamikaze (vodka, lime juice and Triple Sec) and Snake Bite (Yukon Jack and Rose's lime juice) shots at the bar I worked at and proceeded to wrap the front end of our old Dodge around a telephone pole. I was bringing the car home so I could go out and drink more.\n\nI showed up to college orientation at the University of Maryland with sutures closing the giant gash in my chin. As the fire marshal's daughter, I didn't get arrested after either crash. It was a different time, before MADD \u2013 or Uber.\n\nMy fateful TV appearance was the second time I appeared on this station's early morning TV show to talk about cars, which I had been covering since the late 1980s. It was a beat my high school friends found ironic, given my spotty safety record behind the wheel. Their skepticism was borne out when I totaled a BMW I was reviewing the year before I quit drinking. This time, the police didn't know or care who my father was. They stuck me in a D.C. jail cell for an hour or so, and a judge later restricted my license.\n\nI still hadn't sunk low enough to stop drinking altogether.\n\nBy the time I mistakenly urged budget and safety-conscious viewers to consider the long-dead Chevrolet Corvair \u2013 rather than Chevy Corsica \u2013 in 1992, friends and family were increasingly, but only quietly, concerned about my drinking. Fortunately, one called my doctor while I tried to sleep off my epic post-Super Bowl hangover.\n\nAfter I quit, I went to a therapist who specialized in alcohol addiction. She once asked me about my very handsome, clingy and bankrupt new boyfriend: Didn't I think I deserved better?\n\nIt was hard to believe the new, sober me really did.\n\nRecognize the signs \u2013 then step in to help\n\nI've spent weeks talking to the friends and family members of people who quite literally drank themselves to death. Two lived \u2013 and died \u2013 near me, leaving teenage children behind.\n\nSeveral also had the genes for it, and none of the necessary grit when the going got really tough later in life. If balancing school, a job and a social life seems hard when you're young and single, try being a new mother and airline reporter after 9/11 with aging parents battling heart disease. That's the kind of perfect storm that would have sent me back to the bottle if I hadn't hit bottom when I did.\n\nI wasn't one of those women who always dreamed of being a mother, but once I faced fertility problems, as Amy Durham did, I too would have drowned my sorrow with alcohol, jeopardizing any pregnancy or hopes of being a good parent.\n\nAmy Durham, 46, with Dr. Joseph Garbely, who helped save her life when her alcohol addiction left her comatose with triple organ failure in 2012. Photo taken Oct. 24, 2018 at the Carole and Ray Neag Medical Center on Caron Treatment Centers\u2019 campus in Wernersville, PA. (Photo: Caron Treatment Centers)\n\nLike Durham, who nearly died due to alcohol in 2012, I was ashamed. I was covertly guzzling white wine at home and struggling to hide both the shakes that preceded the next day's Chardonnay and the broken blood vessels starting to spider across my face.\n\nThe beautiful Erika Byrd of Vienna, Virginia, was a University of Virginia graduate and law firm partner who her father says wasn't entirely kidding when, before alcohol took her life, she told him: \"Teeth are really overrated.\" She died in 2011.\n\nKatie Bertling says that whenever she and her family talked to sister Sara Myers about her drinking, \"she would get defensive, so we tended to leave it alone thinking it was better to preserve our relationship than push her away.\" Myers, like me, drank progressively more from high school through college and various jobs in bars. She died in January at the age I was when I quit, 32.\n\nShe had the same disease I had, that Ashley Hartshorn, dead at 32, had and that afflicted all of the young people whose family members contacted me because they want to shatter the stigma around alcoholism.\n\nTheir ending could have been my ending.\n\nI'm telling my story because it shouldn't be any more embarrassing than the heart disease I could also develop, thanks to my genes. It's behind me now, as it could soon be for you, your friend or family member. If you see the signs and disregard the discomfort that comes from bringing up such an uncomfortable topic, you just might save a life.\n\nJayne O\u2019Donnell is a health care policy reporter for USA TODAY.

(Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTravis Frederick just wanted to put Oliver and Kensington to bed.\n\nHe\u2019d always carried his young son and daughter up the stairs.\n\nThen the Dallas Cowboys center returned home from the hospital in August, fresh off his diagnosis and spinal tap treatment for Guillain-Barre Syndrome, the autoimmune disorder that had ambushed his football career and sapped his strength.\n\n\u201cNot being able to carry my kids upstairs to bed \u2013 certain things change the way you look at life,\u201d Frederick told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview Thursday. \u201cNot knowing how bad it\u2019d be.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty scary there.\u201d\n\nIt was scary for a while.\n\nFrederick lost feeling in his hands and feet. His hips lost the strength to stabilize his walk, so he limped, which put extra pressure on his back. He lost about 18 pounds. And he lost the sense of camaraderie with the offensive line group for which he became an anchor in four Pro Bowl seasons since Dallas drafted him in 2013.\n\nSuddenly, Frederick identified with what Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo referred to after his 2016 career-ending collarbone fracture as \u201ca dark place, probably the darkest it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nAnd not just dark.\n\n\u201cI would say it is a dark and lonely feeling,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the brotherhood of being able to play, work and sacrifice with the guys.\n\n\u201cAnd all of a sudden, you\u2019re taken from that. And someone else is doing it in your place.\u201d\n\nTwo and a half months later, it\u2019s an adjustment that Frederick has embraced.\n\nDallas\u2019 October 29 bye week was a turning point.\n\nIt was then that Frederick, whom the Cowboys placed on injured reserve Oct. 6, was able to finally lift heavier weights. For two months he worked simply to maintain strength and combat muscle atrophy.\n\nMore: USA TODAY Sports' Week 11 NFL picks: Split opinions on Chiefs-Rams and many more matchups\n\nMore: Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes offered lifetime supply of Heinz ketchup if he gets 57 touchdowns\n\nAnd when the Cowboys fired offensive line coach Paul Alexander, Frederick\u2019s role as player-coach became way more than just a way to keep a sidelined captain occupied.\n\nIn the return from the bye week, before the Cowboys\u2019 Monday Night game vs. the Titans on Nov. 5, Frederick finally experienced progress.\n\nHe and right guard Zack Martin for years have played catch in pregame warmups.\n\nIn September, Frederick couldn\u2019t throw far. He couldn\u2019t catch Martin\u2019s passes. He moved gingerly to retrieve balls.\n\nBefore the Titans game, Frederick moved with renewed vigor. He threw a spiral 25 yards.\n\n\u201cNow I can zing the ball better,\u201d Frederick said, \u201cput spin on it, finally, which is good.\u201d\n\nHis hands and feet no longer tingle. The numbness is now contained to his fingers and toes, a reduction that\u2019s one of the few measurable ways Frederick has been able to track progress with a rare condition (about one in 100,000 is affected by it, according to the National Institutes of Health).\n\n\u201cBut (the recovery) has to take me back to being at professional level,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of data on that.\u201d\n\nSo Frederick has redefined his goals, opting not to pursue even a general target for his return. He\u2019s confident he can do one day make a comeback. But he\u2019s also adamant that getting back to action too early risks not only own injury for himself, but could potentially endanger quarterback Dak Prescott or running back Ezekiel Elliott as well.\n\nSo instead he\u2019s traded his uniform \u2013 for now \u2013 for a headset, communicating between box and sideline coaches, charting defensive plays and integrating instantaneous adjustments.\n\n\u201cI take pride knowing I\u2019m helping the team win still,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd how\u2019s a football IQ coaches describe as the highest in the building learning from a new vantage point?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been very helpful,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019d ever suggest anybody does. But I\u2019ve been able to see the game in a different light, see it from a different angle and it\u2019s helped me not only see how defense react but also technically how I want to approach certain blocks \u2013 how I could do it better.\u201d\n\nFrederick, who is one of 1,300 NFL players this season to receive a Sleep Number 360 Smart Bed, said getting biometric data on his sleep habits has helped him to improve on rest and recovery.\n\nAnd after what he endured earlier this year, any sign of progress helps him see a brighter future.\n\n\u201cEarly on, when things were going downhill, the changes and improvements were so minute it was hard to quantify,\u201d Frederick said. \u201c(Now) I can tell that there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\u201cI know the light is a long way away, but I can at least see the glimmer.\u201d\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "5 tips for getting a personal loan", "description": "Credit score, debt and income are all factors in getting a personal loan, and the requirements vary by lender.

USA TODAY\n\nCarolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey (22) carries the ball in the second quarter against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Bank of America Stadium. (Photo: Jeremy Brevard, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCHARLOTTE \u2013 Christian McCaffrey has recited the words so many times that he no longer hears them.\n\n\u201cBe like water making its way through cracks,\u201d the Carolina Panthers running back's favorite Bruce Lee quote goes. \u201cDo not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.\n\n\u201cEmpty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water,\u201d the saying continues. \u201cIf you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\u201d\n\nThat very philosophy is central to the rise of one of the NFL's most well-rounded offensive threats in McCaffrey, the second-year pro whose 1,018 yards from scrimmage have him on pace to shatter the Panthers' single-season record.\n\n\u201cIt has a lot to do with fluidity and being able to adapt,\u201d McCaffrey told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI think when you\u2019re running through a hole and you\u2019re hit in certain, different ways, you have to be able to move and change and make people miss. You\u2019ve got to be able to adapt to your environment. It all relates.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey has long revered Lee. His father, Ed McCaffrey, introduced him to the martial arts icon\u2019s movies (his favorite is \"Enter the Dragon\") at a young age. But it wasn\u2019t until he got older that he started studying Lee\u2019s teachings on self-discipline, as well as body and mind control. Once he did, he found ways to relate them to football.\n\nVarious martial arts exercises help strengthen his core and improve his flexibility and reactionary skills. Numerous proverbs from Lee have fortified his mind. As a result, McCaffrey said he has \u201ctaken the next step as an NFL player.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe takes this very seriously,\u201d Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s very motivated. He\u2019s very conscious of his body and the things it takes each day, each week to do well at that position. He makes sure he\u2019s at optimal level \u2013 what he eats, the stuff he does at home to prepare. He takes a lot of pride in what he does.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey grew up in a house of four boys and watched his father win three Super Bowls (one with the 49ers, two with the Broncos) in 13 NFL seasons. But he said his mother, Lisa, who played soccer at Stanford, is the best athlete of the family. He equally credits her for his athletic development.\n\nMcCaffrey started playing running back at 7 years old but always saw himself as more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always tried to be a complete athlete and not limit myself to one position or one sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really helped mold my whole football game.\u201d\n\nThat mentality also paved the way for McCaffrey to become one of the most prolific college football players of all time (he holds the single-season record for all-purpose yardage). Now his multifaceted skills have carried over to the NFL, where this season he has 579 rushing yards, 439 receiving yards and eight total touchdowns.\n\n\u201cAll the guys I\u2019ve been fortunate to be with, I always say, each has his own special skill set that sets them apart,\" Panthers offensive coordinator Norv Turner told USA TODAY Sports, \"but Christian's versatility is as good as anyone I've been around.\n\n\"He\u2019s got the ability to be an inside runner, outside runner, run routes in the passing game, do all those types of things. He\u2019s been really impressive.\"\n\nMcCaffrey grew up watching Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith and LaDainian Tomlinson, so he was excited to learn the Panthers had hired Turner, who worked with both backs. Turner said in the early going, the young ball carrier had a list of questions about his plans for him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a competitive guy,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHe was feeling me out because he wanted to make sure that he had the opportunities to do the things he thinks he can do well.\u201d\n\nTurner and the Panthers have given McCaffrey those opportunities, and he's rewarded them in kind. McCaffrey has teamed with quarterback Cam Newton to give the team the third-best rushing attack in the league (138.4 yards per game). He serves as Newton's favorite pass-catcher (his 54 catches and 63 targets both lead the team) and leads an offense that ranks ninth in scoring (26.8 points per game).\n\nMcCaffrey still gets overlooked in the discussion of the best all-around backs, but he has learned to disregard public opinions.\n\nLeading up to the draft, where Carolina drafted him eighth overall, McCaffrey faced questions about his ability to play running back in the NFL, with many suggesting a switch to slot receiver.\n\nNow, he trains himself to guard against other forms of disrespect.\n\n\u201cI will catch myself. It\u2019ll rub me the wrong way sometimes for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t play though for recognition. I play because I love the game and play for my teammates. I don\u2019t let any of that affect me.\u201d\n\nBut how?\n\n\u201cTrial and error,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of late nights thinking about this and that and catching myself. You can never satisfy other people, I learned. End of the day, it\u2019s extremely important that you know yourself better than anybody else, and if you can do that, it doesn\u2019t matter what anybody thinks about you, good or bad.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey said he doesn\u2019t need to use others' slights as extra fuel.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of my own motivations,\" he said. I never play to prove anyone wrong. I always try to prove myself right.\u201d\n\nWhether consciously or not, McCaffrey summed up another one of Bruce Lee\u2019s sayings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in this world to live up to your expectations,\u201d the saying goes, \u201cand you\u2019re not in this world to live up to mine.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey already is living up to his own standards, and certainly to those of the Panthers.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Dalvin Brown, USA TODAY", "title": "On a budget?

Short covering is adding to the boost in both commodity prices and stock prices for major producers. (Photo: Jitalia17 / Getty Images)\n\nIf you think winter is hard on you, imagine how your car must feel.\n\nDeep, cold temperatures make it harder for the engine to work properly. Salt on the road can cause erosion in the undercarriage. Not to mention, ice and snow can impede a car's ability to do the one thing it's supposed to be good at \u2013 driving. Winter is the absolute antagonist to your daily driving companion.\n\nBut the good news is that it doesn't have to be.\n\nPaying a little extra attention to your car before Old Man Winter really sets in can ensure that you aren't left stranded with a hefty tow and repair bill.\n\nAnd the best part? You can winter-proof your vehicle on almost any budget.\n\nHere are a few tips based on how much you're looking to spend:\n\nLess than $15\n\n\u2022 General inspection: The cheapest thing you can do to ensure your vehicle is prepared to hold up throughout the cold weather months is thoroughly inspect the outer body.\n\n\"It can be as simple as washing your car by hand,\" said Tony Molla, vice president of the Automotive Service Association and am ASE certified automotive technician. \"If you do that, you're going to be going over the body closely to see if there are any obvious signs of damage that might need addressing.\"\n\n\u2022 Tire check: There are several popular ways to make sure your tires are in good standing. One of the easiest and most affordable methods involves using what's known as \"the penny test.\"\n\n\"Insert a penny into your tire's tread groove with Lincoln's head upside down and facing you,\" Molla said. If you can see all of Lincoln's head, your treads are shallow and worn, so it's time to replace your tires. If not, your tires are fine.\n\nRemember that when temperatures drop, so does tire pressure.\n\n\"Stop by a filling station and top off the tires to the pressure recommended by the manufacturer,\" Molla said. There's usually a label sticker on the driver's side door jam that lists the recommended tire pressure.\n\n\u2022 Battery cleaning: Look for green fuzz on or around your battery terminal. \"If you spot some, it's corrosion.

Newly elected leaders like me are prepared to do that.\n\nIn Simi Valley, California, on Nov. 12, 2018. (Photo: Ringo H.W. Chiu)\n\nIn one of my campaign ads this year, I put on a harness and climbed a 26-story wind turbine ladder to draw attention to how renewable energy can benefit our state.\n\nLast week, voters across our country elected leaders who, like me, have pledged to fight climate change and embrace clean energy \u2014 proving that these are winning issues. More and more Americans are experiencing the direct impacts of climate change, from the wildfires in California, to devastating hurricanes in the Southeast, to drought in the Southwest. And they are choosing candidates who are ready to do something about it.\n\nAbout a dozen of the governors-elect campaigned on strong clean energy platforms. I proposed transitioning New Mexico to 50 percent renewable energy by 2030 and 80 percent by 2040. Our neighbors in Nevada and Colorado also elected governors who strongly support climate action and clean energy and pledged to strengthen their states\u2019 renewable energy portfolios. Governors-elect in Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan and Maine have committed to similar goals.\n\nThis is not just an opportunity for Democrats: several re-elected Republican governors,including Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Larry Hogan of Maryland, are poised to move their states forward on clean energy.\n\nClimate change, clean energy are now a priority\n\nCongresswoman and psychiatric nurse Eddie Bernice Johnson will likely be the next chair of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, putting the gavel back in the hands of someone with a science background for the first time in two decades. With Democrats regaining control of the House, we can now exercise desperately needed oversight of the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.\n\nThat includes efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to roll back fuel efficiency standards and attempts by the Energy Department to bail out the coal industry, both of which stymie federal action on climate change, harm our health and force us to pay more for energy that pollutes. Climate change and clean energy issues will now receive significant focus on a Democrat-led House Energy and Commerce Committee, and from the resurrected select committee on climate change.\n\nAnd the midterm election has provided real opportunities to move forward on climate change in the states. Nevada voters approved a ballot measure to increase renewables to 50 percent by 2030, while voters in Portland, Oregon increased funding for renewable energy projects and job training. And clean energy advocates gained ground in governor's mansions and state legislatures.\n\nMore: States can lead the way on climate change as Trump rolls back protections\n\nDon't let Donald Trump roll back auto fuel economy standards\n\nHow to fight California's wildfires? It's an 'all of the above' response\n\nSeveral states have already seen success in the last year. In New Jersey, newly elected Gov. Phil Murphy and his legislature adopted a goal to move the state to 50 percent renewables by 2030 and expand offshore wind energy. In Virginia, Democrats kept the governorship and made major gains in the legislature, paving the way for energy efficiency programs as well as new solar and wind power capacity. And California adopted the nation\u2019s second 100 percent clean energy goal last summer, after wildfires that drove climate awareness. (Hawaii was the first).\n\nIn New Mexico next year, I will work with lawmakers in both parties to increase our Renewable Portfolio Standard, develop transmission infrastructure so we can export our solar and wind power to the West, and increase energy efficiency that will help residents and businesses save money. As our clean energy industries grow, so too will sustainable, well-paying jobs.\n\nAs the recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made strikingly clear, we have barely more than a decade to address climate change. But its early impacts of are already here, and particularly acute in the Southwest. In New Mexico, we are facing a water crisis driven by drought that is becoming more severe with climate change. Instead of denying this reality, we must create a long-term plan to effectively manage our water, reduce our carbon emissions, and transition to a low-carbon economy. We cannot solve a problem we refuse to acknowledge.\n\nVoters chose leaders on climate, clean energy\n\nThe electricity sector is one area where we already have the tools we need to effectively reduce carbon emissions. According to a recent Consumer Reports survey, more than 75 percent of Americans agree that increasing renewable energy is a worthwhile goal,and last week\u2019s results are further proof of that. Renewable energy is the fastest growing energy source around the world and more than 3 million Americans work in the clean energy sector\u2013 more than registered nurses and nearly as many as school teachers. Wind technician and solar installer are the two fastest-growing jobs in the country.\n\nIn New Mexico, the fastest-growing state for wind power in 2017, our economy has thrived thanks to our position as a leading energy producer. I campaigned heavily on expanding clean energy because I believe our state has what it takes to be a leader in this growing sector: abundant sunshine, wind, land and hardworking people.\n\nBy embracing clean energy across the country, we can create more and better jobs, protect the air our children breathe and the water they drink, and keep electricity more stable over time.\n\nClimate change is real and we have to address it. The good news is that transitioning to clean energy is also an opportunity to grow our economy. Americans are eager for action, and have made their voices heard by electing leaders who campaigned explicitly on climate and clean energy platforms.\n\nDemocratic Rep.

(Photo: Getty Images) A variety of ethical and ecological issues face the marijuana industry in California, and, for years, cannabis \u2026 [+5714 chars]", "fulltext": "Along with providing health and ethical benefits, clean cultivation tastes and feels superior to anything else on the market. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA variety of ethical and ecological issues face the marijuana industry in California, and, for years, cannabis grown in both legal and illegal channels contained higher concentrations of pesticides than what you'd find in most food products. Green Door West addresses those challenges head-on by promising that every strain the company sells is 100% vegan and 100% organic. The benefits of clean cultivation are obvious for health and ethical reasons, but more importantly, it gives Green Door West a catalog that tastes and feels superior to anything else on the market \u2014 regardless of your own dietary priorities.\n\n\"The first question we get is, 'What does this organic thing mean? How do you grow a plant in a vegan way?'\" said management at Green Door West. \"It has to do with the fact that we're not using any chemical-based additives and no animal product. A lot of cultivation out there uses animal products in their operations. We, on the other hand, don't treat our flowers with anything that's not organic or vegan.\"\n\nSo how does that manifest itself in the field? What distinguishes their growing operations? Firstly, all of Green Door West's product is herbalized in specialized hydroponic facilities, which acts as a cross between a greenhouse and a laboratory. That means that all of the cannabis the company sells is specifically grown indoors, with careful, dutiful monitoring by a team of industry experts. This is a step up from outdoor marijuana fields of the '60s and '70s because growers can better govern the specifics of the soil chemistry and light distribution.\n\n\"It lets us control the entire environment,\" said management. \"We could only do that indoors.\" Green Door West doesn't mean to outright disparage outdoor cultivation projects but said that the company wants to maintain high-end, pharmaceutical-grade marijuana for their store shelves, to give the industry higher agricultural standards. Because of that, they refuse to spare any expenses. \"We're not making your everyday Budweiser,\" management said.\n\nThere are a number of ways a business can cultivate cannabis in a hydroponic environment, but by far, the best option is also the most painstaking: To do everything by hand. It's not surprising, given everything else about Green Door West's ethos, that this is the methodology the company embraces. In their operation you will not see the towering, grocery-store sprinklers hosing down thousands of marijuana flowers at once, nor will you see any machinery or automation applying a one-size-fits-all shakedown to every strain in the shop. Instead, the team at Green Door addresses each plant individually with a hands-on approach, and according to management, that allows the company to get far more intimate and knowledgeable with their product than any other startup in the state. \"It's not 5% extra work,\" said management. \"It's 200% extra work.\"\n\nCurrently, the marijuana business is trending toward mass production. Companies are buying up massive amounts of acreage to flood the market with their product, with the hope of carving out a name for themselves while the industry is still young. Unfortunately, the larger a marijuana enterprise grows to be, the more likely it will rely on factory-grade pesticides and insecticides. Green Door West subverts that script by focusing, exclusively, on small-batch cannabis cultivation. This means that there's never a risk for one plant to slip through the cracks.\n\n\"We don't medicate anything over 10,000 square feet of canopy. We know the limitations of the cultivation and we're saying that the idea of aggregating all of our products under a single group \u2014 no matter how many dollars and cents that saves \u2014 doesn't make any sense,\" said management. \"That doesn't make sense from a conservation standpoint, a quality standpoint or a business standpoint. Our end product would suffer, and our customer retention rate is so high and so important to us that we're building everything on quality.\"\n\nEssentially, Green Door West is making an argument. The company is founded upon the premise that marijuana deserves to be taken seriously, and that there needs to be an agent ready to provide luxury, high-end cannabis products for a community of customers willing to pay for quality. Today, the headshops that dot Los Angeles are filled to the gills with weed lollipops and novelty grinders \u2014 the kind of stuff that tourists bring home from Amsterdam \u2014 and Green Door wants to shift the conversation. With its comprehensive hydroponic system, hands-on botanical care and wide-ranging covenant guaranteeing vegan and organic gardening practices, they're refusing to underestimate the average Angeleno marijuana consumer.\n\n\"We've figured out that the consumers we're targeting care about organic and vegan products. Even if they don't identify as a vegan, or exclusively buy organic produce, they've still embraced us,\" said management. \"We've made sure to cater to those consumers ourselves. All of our flowers are sold in beautiful glass jars, rather than plastic bags or something like that. Our customers aren't price-sensitive like your typical (cannabis customer).\u201d\n\n\"I don't drink bad wine or bad whiskey. When I do drink, I'm going to get the best, highest-quality thing I can get. We're pushing hard for our place in this industry, while also making sure that we're backing up all of our talk with cultivation standards. With that, we're moving the needle in Los Angeles.\"\n\nIf you'd like to peruse Green Door West's stock, check out their online catalog today.\n\nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the USA Today Network were not involved in the creation of this content.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/green-door-west/2018/11/16/why-one-cannabis-company-ensures-its-products-100-vegan-100-organic/1923027002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Steve Aoki: 'I find all my crazy outfits in Japan'", "description": "At the Latin Grammys, Steve Aoki reveled in a colorful outfit, while Lele Pons, Thalia, Inna, Karol G and more brought some glamor to the red carpet.

Buzz60\n\nThis artist's rendering shows SeaWorld San Antonio's forthcoming Turtle Reef attraction. (Photo: SeaWorld Entertainment)\n\nVisitors are finally returning to SeaWorld, but it's not because of the amusement park's famous killer whales.\n\nAfter nearly five years of declining attendance and revenue following accusations that it mistreated orcas and their trainers, SeaWorld Entertainment is gaining ground with new attractions and rides that have nothing to do with the black-and-white sea creatures that defined its identity for decades.\n\nIt might be too early to call it a comeback, but it certainly qualifies as a hopeful sign for SeaWorld after its total attendance last year hit the lowest point since at least 2010.\n\nUnder new management led by John Reilly, interim CEO and chief parks operations officer, the company is focused on new attractions, deals, conservation and cost cuts. While SeaWorld still has killer whales on display, the company decided in 2016 to stop breeding and featuring them in theatrical shows at its parks, including locations in San Diego; Orlando, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas.\n\nThe turnaround strategy, which started under Reilly's predecessor, is impressing investors and analysts. SeaWorld's stock has nearly doubled this year.\n\nReilly attributed the improvement to \"better execution on our strategic initiatives\" and a positive response by visitors to new rides and attractions.\n\n\"We also believe there\u2019s significant opportunity ahead,\" Reilly told USA TODAY.\n\nReilly said the company's plan is to introduce at least one new attraction for \"almost every park\" annually. That requires meticulous planning to minimize downtime and market the new features to guests.\n\nA steady stream of new rides and attractions reflects SeaWorld's response to the social media age.\n\n\"People want experiences,\" Reilly said. \"We believe we can put more attractions in our parks and do it more frequently and do it much more efficiently.\"\n\nCLOSE After almost three years at the helm of SeaWorld Entertainment, CEO Joel Manby will step down following declines in attendance and revenues. Buzz60\n\nComing attractions for SeaWorld's 12 parks include:\n\n\u2022 A new Sesame Street-themed area at SeaWorld Orlando with six new rides, characters and a parade.\n\n\u2022 A Screamin' Swing ride named Finnegan's Flyer and a Cutback Water Coaster at SeaWorld's Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Water Country USA in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\n\u2022 A new tiger conservation-themed steel roller coaster called Tigris at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay (Florida) and an ocean-conservation-themed dueling roller coaster called Tidal Twister at SeaWorld San Diego.\n\n\u2022 A new sea-turtle exhibit called Turtle Reef, along with themed family rides at SeaWorld San Antonio.\n\nSeaWorld Orlando is adding a Sesame Street-themed area, pictured here in an artist's rendering. (Photo: SeaWorld Entertainment)\n\nLife after orcas\n\nNone of the new attractions or rides feature orcas, which are also gone from the home page of SeaWorld's website and hard to find in marketing materials. The company has 21 orcas remaining at its U.S. parks, according to charity group Whale and Dolphin Conservation.\n\nAfter the 2013 documentary \"Blackfish\" raised concerns about SeaWorld\u2019s treatment of orca whales and trainers, the negative publicity contributed to an 11 percent decline in attendance over the next four years.\n\nThe company's management at the time initially denied that the controversy was hurting attendance. Earlier this year, SeaWorld reached a $5 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over what the watchdog agency called \"untrue and misleading statements or omissions\" about the controversy's impact. SeaWorld did not admit wrongdoing.\n\nThe rocky years following \"Blackfish\" forced SeaWorld to rethink its identity. The company appointed an outsider, theme-park veteran Joel Manby, as CEO in spring 2015, and he ultimately made the call to end orca breeding and theatrical shows. Manby also started the process of investing in alternative rides and attractions.\n\nBut the company's attendance continued to fall under his tenure, and he left the company abruptly in February 2018. That's when Reilly was installed as the interim chief. Asked whether he expects to get the permanent job, he said he's focused on delivering results in his current role.\n\nSeaWorld Entertainment's total attendance in the first nine months of 2018 rose 8.7 percent from a year earlier to 18 million visitors. Revenue was up 9.5 percent to $1.09 billion.\n\n\"It\u2019s fair to say that John Reilly has more or less steadied the ship by any number of indicators,\" said Tuna Amobi, an analyst at CFRA Research who tracks SeaWorld. \"The attendance numbers don't lie.\"\n\nAmobi said he \"always had some skepticism\" about the company's belief that new attractions and rides would deliver a turnaround.

(Photo: Thinkstock)\n\nFalling oil and gasoline prices should deliver an early Christmas present to holiday shoppers and the economy in coming weeks, lifting consumption by a few billion dollars a month, economists say.\n\nAt the same time, sliding crude prices will hobble a resurgent U.S. oil industry, analysts say, but that will only partly offset the overall benefits for the economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to put more money in consumers\u2019 (pocketbooks) to spend on other goods and services,\u201d economist Chris Lafakis of Moody\u2019s analytics says.\n\nThe price of U.S. benchmark oil has plunged 26 percent from $76 a barrel in early October to around $56. Economists cite the Trump administration\u2019s decision to ease restrictions on Iran\u2019s oil exports as well as record production by Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. There are also concerns about slowing global demand.\n\nAmericans likely to spend more\n\nSo far, oil\u2019s tumble has only partly filtered into gasoline prices. Regular unleaded averaged $2.67 per gallon nationally Thursday, down from $2.90 a month earlier, according to AAA. The drop in crude prices, combined with a typical seasonal slowdown in U.S. driving, should push gas prices to $2.25 to $2.50 a gallon in the next few weeks, says Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.\n\nThat would save Americans $2.5 billion a month, or $30 billion annually, compared with average oil and gas prices in the third quarter, assuming the lower pump prices are sustained, Lafakis says. Economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics estimates the monthly savings at $3.3 billion, and Kloza puts it as high as $5 billion.\n\nThe average household would save $20 to $40 a month, or $224 to $480 a year, depending on how low prices go.\n\nThe savings are more limited so far but they're making a difference for some. Leslie Fox, of Columbus, Ohio, has to make two different dinners each night because her daughters are vegetarian or vegan while her sons only eat meat. With gas prices lower, she\u2019s bringing in prepared food from grocery stores or restaurants three to four times a week, up from once or twice previously.\n\nShe figures she\u2019s saving about $4 each time she fills up compared with a month ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a psychological difference,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels good so you go, \u2018I\u2019m buying that bread.\u2019\u201d\n\nOil producers could ease drilling\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. oil industry has flourished in recent years as a result of the shale oil boom. The country produces about 11.7 million barrels of oil a day, up from about 5 million a decade ago. If oil prices stay at around $55, that would likely prompt oil companies to reduce the number of oil drilling rigs nationally by about 100, tantamount to a $10 billion drop in annual investment, Ashworth says.\n\nMore: Gas prices plummet amid 'bewildering' decline for oil as Thanksgiving travel approaches\n\nMore: Powerball winner, a single mom, shares her wealth with wounded veterans\n\nMore: Despite common usage, health savings accounts are helpful for retirement\n\nIn other words, for the broader economy, a decline in oil prices is not as overwhelmingly positive as it used to be because the oil industry makes up a bigger part of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. Still, the pullback in oil outlays would offset only about a quarter of the rise in consumer spending, Ashworth says.\n\n\u201cIt would still be a positive for the economy,\u201d economist Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics says.\n\nAll told, economists say, the oil price decline would add one- to two-tenths of a percentage point to economic growth in the last three months of the year and in 2019 if prices stay low.\n\nWhile that\u2019s not much, it would be a welcome bump as economic growth slows from a projected 3 percent this year to 2.5 percent in 2019 as the effects of federal tax cuts and spending increases fade.\n\nFrom early January to October, the opposite dynamic occurred. Crude prices rose from $58 to $76, bolstering oil investment and damping consumer spending, resulting in a modest net drag on economic growth, Daco says. Yet that hardly seemed to matter because the tax cuts still spelled an overall gain for consumer spending.\n\nLower gas prices likely to trim inflation\n\nA drop in oil and gasoline prices would also temper inflation that has crept higher this year.\n\nAshworth says it should push overall annual price increases from the current 2 percent \u2013 right at the Federal Reserve\u2019s target \u2013 to slightly below that benchmark.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect the Fed to scale back its tentative plan to raise interest rates for a fourth time this year in December and three more times in 2019, Ashworth says. The Fed mostly focuses on a core inflation measure that strips out volatile food and energy items.\n\nThe big question is how long oil and gas prices will remain low.\n\nKloza reckons crude prices will climb back into the $60 to $70 range by next month as OPEC cuts production. He expects gas prices to stay low through the winter as Americans travel less but to start climbing back toward $2.90 in the spring.\n\nCapital Economics, however, predicts oil and gas prices will largely remain a bargain through next year.\n\nCLOSE Experiential spending is the big winner this holiday season, according to Sarah Quinlan, senior vice president of market insights at MasterCard . The experiences category, which includes travel and airlines, saw increases in year-over-year spending, according to Quinlan.

Nancy Pelosi from resuming the speakership that she was forced to relinquish after the 2010 election, bears a resemblance to the acceptance, by some Americans, of the anti-Hillary Clinton narrative peddled on social media by Russian trolls in 2016. In the case of Pelosi, the hostile power that launched the demonization of the Democratic leader was the Republican Party.\n\nGOP campaign organizations dug a rabbit hole that some Democrats eagerly dived into. These Democratic back-benchers in the House who have been mounting a challenge to Pelosi have bought into this grotesque GOP narrative on her and it has soured the growing Democratic majority that has been unfolding since November 6.\n\nDemocrats forcing Pelosi from the speakership would be akin to Abraham Lincoln firing General William T. Sherman after he captured the city of Atlanta from the Confederates based on false rebel narratives of atrocities even though the fall of the city enabled Lincoln to win the election of 1864.\n\nDems owe Pelosi for her legislative victory\n\nCashiering the author of a major political victory is an act of legislative malpractice and those promoting it like Reps. Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan ought to be disbarred. Sadly, a number of newly-elected Democratic members also promised to toss Pelosi over the side and now have to confront the fact that there is no plausible candidate to replace her. They are in the untenable position of trying to beat somebody with nobody, and worse, making it their first order of business.\n\nThe campaign against Pelosi is a kind of Children\u2019s Crusade whose symbolic leader is perhaps the least-experienced member of the 2018 Democratic cohort, Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who has cast a magical spell over the party on the strength of her improbable victory in a Democratic primary against the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House leadership. Had Ocasio-Cortez dethroned some conservative dinosaur, her claim on spiritual leadership might have some merit but she knocked off a man who lacked nothing in the way of progressive credentials. Many Democrats overlook the fact that, more than anything else, Ocsio-Cortez\u2019s surname was, quite probably, the most decisive factor in her victory in a congressional district whose ethnic composition had changed dramatically.\n\nMore: Health care is now a major liability for Republicans. Will they dig the hole deeper?\n\nAfter historic midterm election wins, Muslims struggle a little less with their American identity\n\nHow can Donald Trump be re-elected in 2020? By talking about the economy\n\nFor the Democrats sake, I would hope that this madness is only the result of temporary euphoria in the aftermath of what has come to resemble a wave election. Out of power since the election of 2010, many Democrats are unaccustomed to the reality that they are now the majority party. They may also be in denial of the fact that, as newcomers, they have a lot to learn that can\u2019t be gained solely in a week of freshman orientation.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is a sprawling institution that has always required strong leadership and this reality may not yet have dawned on the newcomers. The speaker, although constitutionally the leader of the entire institution is also the leader of the party whose hand is prominent in everything from fund-raising to the assignment of members to committees and the shaping of legislation. If the new Democratic majority is not to stumble, it is imperative that its leaders know what they are doing. It is no place for on-the-job training.\n\nPelosi deserves the opportunity to lead\n\nIn time, it may appear that Rep. Pelosi is unable to lead effectively. Leaders can be replaced at any time as we saw in the case of Speaker John Boehner who was dethroned by another group of newcomers in the Republican ranks, the Freedom Caucus. But Rep. Pelosi deserves the opportunity to prove that she can lead the majority if for no other reason that she is very much the author of the Democratic victory.\n\nGratitude may be a rare virtue in American politics these days and the newly-elected Democratic members must be feeling pretty full of themselves right now for their victories, but they owe a substantial part of their success to the shrewd strategy and tireless fund-raising of Nancy Pelosi and the campaign organizations over which she presided. The least-defensible reason for ousting her is implicitly buying into the Republicans\u2019 effort to frame her as an out-of-control San Francisco liberal. It\u2019s a false stereotype that Democratic members, especially the newest ones, should not buy into.\n\nRoss K.

USA TODAY\n\nAmerica\u2019s Islamic Heritage Museum in Washington, DC. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 One of the greatest stories rarely told about the long history of Muslim immigration to the United States stretching back hundreds of years is actually being told most days by Amir Muhammad, the founder and chief curator of America\u2019s Islamic Heritage Museum, a tiny institution with a do-it-yourself collector\u2019s vibe and a modest entrance fee that sits in an out-of-the-way corner of southeast Washington, D.C.\n\nBut, in an age of American political sectarianism when immigrant and minority-rights groups and U.S. lawmakers have blasted President Donald Trump\u2019s incendiary comments, not many people are paying attention to the story Muhammad is revealing about the Muslim experience.\n\n\"American Muslims haven't been great at explaining our side, at engaging with folks \u2013 you know? Not too many Americans come out here. We get some schools and international guests,\" said Muhammad, 64, in a recent interview.\n\nAs Muhammad spoke in one of the museum\u2019s small airless hallways, the lights kept flickering. Nearby, a smoke alarm chirped in need of batteries. Dusty glass displays featured Qurans from around the world. Outside, the run-down front entrance was framed by a sign in a blue font: America\u2019s Islamic Heritage Museum. Orange-yellow streaks of rust ran down the face of it.\n\n\"Once, a French documentary crew stopped by,\" he added. \"It's like that.\"\n\nVestiges of Islam\n\nAmerica's Islamic Heritage Museum started in 1996 as a traveling exhibition called Collections and Stories of American Muslims. Since moving, in 2011, to its location on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, the museum has introduced and entertained about 52,000 people with artifacts, documents and photographs that explore the contributions and legacies of American Muslims. Last year, about 8,000 people visited, a figure far from the more than 30 million visits made last year to the 19 museums, galleries and National Zoological Park that comprise the Smithsonian Institution a few miles away.\n\n\"This area\u2019s kind of the hood of the hood,\" said Muhammad, using slang to describe an economically deprived area, and also to justify why some Americans may deliberately choose to give his museum a wide berth. But \"from darkness comes light,\" he added, noting that the neighborhood was improving.\n\nBut there are other reasons, too.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Islamic Heritage Museum & Cultural Center sees about 2,600 visitors each year. By comparison, more than 30 million people visited the Smithsonian Institution last year. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\n\"It was a struggle for a long time to even get American Muslims behind our idea,\" said Emad Al-Turk, referring to the International Museum of Muslim Cultures in Jackson, Mississippi, an institution he co-founded about six months before the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe International Museum of Muslim Cultures is perhaps less well known than America's Islamic Heritage Museum, partly because it is located far from any major city in a predominantly rural state. And its focus is on educating the public about Islamic history and culture and Muslim contributions to world civilization, not just America's.\n\n\"At the time, people were really scared about what was happening and how the relationship between American Muslims and non-Muslims was changing,\" Al-Turk said.\n\nIn \"Al' America,\" his 2008 book about America's Arab and Islamic roots, the writer and journalist Jonathan Curiel notes that since the 9/11 terrorist attacks it has been difficult for some Americans to \"see Arab and Muslim culture as anything other than terrorism and fundamentalism ... 'Arab' and 'Muslim' have become code words of alarm.\"\n\nThere has also been a tendency, Curiel believes, to reject any historical claims Arab and Muslim culture might have on American culture \u2013 to view it as \"their\" culture, not \"ours.\"\n\nAnd yet:\n\nDid you know there are two towns in the United States called Mohammad? There\u2019s also a Palestine, in Texas, and an Aladdin, in Wyoming. There\u2019s been a U.S. post office in Mecca, Indiana, since 1888. In fact, from New Orleans to the Alamo, Moorish styles of architecture can be detected in buildings across the USA. Even the pointed arches that once stood at the base of the fallen World Trade Center towers in New York City mimicked Islamic geometric tradition. Blues music may be a uniquely American art form that originated in the Deep South \u2013 music ethnographers have established that many of its harmonies and note changes resemble Muslim prayers and other recitations, a result of the African slaves who came to the U.S. from Muslim areas on that continent.\n\nAmir Muhammad is the founder and chief curator of America's Islamic Heritage Museum. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nScholars of the Middle East say that there are many possible explanations for an apparent lack of interest in the USA\u2019s Islamic heritage, not least that many Americans simply don\u2019t know it exists.\n\n\"A lot of people might assume Muslim immigration started in 1965 when the U.S. had a period of immigration reform, others will date it back to the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, yet others to the 9/11 attacks, but usually no one looks further back than the 1960s and certainly not beyond the 20th century for this history at the popular level,\" said Hussein Rashid, who teaches at Columbia University.\n\nSome point to the rhetoric of President Donald Trump as a more recent reason for the dearth of interest in Islam in America.\n\nNot only has the president signed executive orders targeting immigration from some majority-Muslim countries, but Trump himself has frequently negatively associated Islam and the Middle East more generally with violence and cultural differences claimed to be anathema to American life and identity.\n\n\"Islam hates us,\" Trump said on the campaign trail in 2016.\n\n\"Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in,\" he tweeted on Oct. 22 after ordering the military to be on alert for a caravan of migrants from Central America attempting to enter the U.S. despite efforts to have them stopped at the border.\n\n\"For Trump, there appears to a whole lot of people who are not fully American. Muslims aren't. Mexican-American communities aren't. Women. Black people,\" said Rashid.\n\nBut experts on Islam say there is a problem with Trump's Muslim narrative: Muslims have been coming to America since at least the 17th century, with anywhere from a third to a quarter of the enslaved Africans brought to the U.S. against their will likely Muslims.\n\nThere is also evidence that Muslims were on the ships that the Italian explorer, navigator and colonist Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in the 15th century.\n\nThere are even reports of Chinese Muslims making it to American shores, in California, in the 9th century. They arrived as pirates or fleeing religious persecution.\n\n\"We have autobiographies, we have oral histories, we have mosques, cemeteries, tombstones. We also have a lot of conjectural evidence: For example, the way people are buried facing Mecca (Islam's holiest city, in Saudi Arabia),\" Rashid said.\n\nCornelia Walker Bailey, who died last year aged 73, wrote in her memoir that children on Sapelo Island, Georgia, where she grew up, learned to say their prayers facing east toward Mecca in keeping with Muslim practice. Bailey, like many African-Americans from Sapelo Island, claim Bilali Muhammad, a Muslim scholar from West Africa who was brought to Georgia as a teenage slave in the 18th century, as a distant relative.\n\nA growing population\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, about 3 million Muslims live in the U.S. This compares to approximately 5.6 million Jews and 240 million Christians, the two dominant religions. (About 50 million people are religiously unaffiliated.) But by 2050, Pew Research Center estimates, there will be at least 8 million Muslims living in the U.S. while the Jewish population will remain fairly stagnant, at about 5.3 million.\n\nFederal hate-crime data published by the FBI show that in 2017 more than half of religious hate crimes in America targeted Jews while nearly a quarter targeted Muslims.\n\nAmerican Muslim groups raised thousands of dollars for the Pittsburgh synagogue victims and also offered Jews help with protection and other services they might need.\n\nImmigration was one of the topics that were at the forefront of voters' minds as they went to the polls with record-level enthusiasm to vote in the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nMore: Hate crimes in USA surge in 2017 with big jump in anti-Semitic attacks, FBI says\n\nMore: What other nations do when security threats are everywhere\n\nYet if the American Jewish and Christian experiences are well documented in countless journals, research institutes, museum collections, in business, and in popular culture and entertainment, the American Muslim experience mostly appears to sit outside the broader narrative of stories Americans tell themselves about their history, according to religious scholars such as Lior Sternfeld, who specializes in Jewish studies.\n\n\"Muslim-Americans were a much smaller and more marginalized community, but it's changing,\" said Sternfeld, who teaches at Penn State University.\n\nMuhammad, of America's Islamic Heritage Museum, wants to do something about this.\n\nHe spends his spare time traveling around the USA searching for Islam's forgotten roots in a country where they were never fully remembered in the first place.\n\nHe has collected gravestones all over the South dating to the 1800s with Islamic names written on them in Arabic. He has 200-year-old census records and wills and testaments from virtually every U.S. region that show vestiges of Islamic immigration.\n\nHe also has the robe of the first U.S. Muslim judge, the uniform of the first Muslim U.S. Army chaplain and a wall filled with photos of contemporary American Muslim newsmakers, and sports stars from Muhammad Ali to Sam Khalifa, the only Muslim player in the history of Major League Baseball.\n\nIn all, his collection consists of a few thousand examples of American Islamia.\n\n\"Not even American Muslims always know this stuff exists,\" he said.\n\nAt least 145 American Muslims, virtually all of them Democrats, ran for state or national public office this year. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nHani Bawardi, a professor at the Center for Arab American Studies at the University of Michigan in Dearborn, outside Detroit, said the story of Islam in America \"awaits excavation.\" He said no good scholarship exists on the subject, partly because \"no one traced sufficiently the archival evidence on enslaved Muslims. Every time we think we know the location of the oldest mosque an older one is discovered,\" he said. \"I can't even point you to a good study there. But Muslims were represented in very remote areas.\"\n\nSill, Muhammad Fraser-Rahim, a historian of Islam who spent more than a decade as a counterterrorism adviser, including at the Department for Homeland Security, said that at a time when Trump appears to be questioning whether Islam is compatible with American life, there is an appetite for more awareness of its place in the American story.\n\n\"Quite frankly, a lot of American Muslims are not that conversant in their own history. We're a pretty diverse group: Economics, class, resources, access. There are so many things that divide American Muslims rather than necessarily uniting them. And I can give you plenty of examples of Muslims in corporate America with the name 'Mohammad' who have gone by the name 'Mo' because they haven't been all that comfortable with being Muslim in a public space,\" he said. \"Now, people are thinking that they might need to be a bit more vocal in this current (political) context.\"\n\nAmerican Muslims are raising their profiles and speaking out in different ways.\n\nFormer Michigan state lawmaker Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, Minnesota's first Somali-American legislator, become the first Muslim women elected to Congress in the midterm elections this month. (Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., became, in 2006, the first Muslim to be elected to the lawmaking body.)\n\nAnd at least 145 American Muslims, virtually all of them Democrats, ran for state or national public office this year, according to Jetpac, a Boston-based organization that works to increase American Muslim education and civic engagement.\n\nOf these, 110 were first-time candidates who represent an unprecedented rise for a diverse Muslim community that is typically underrepresented in American politics.\n\n\"For almost two years people have been witnessing the direction our country is going in\" and they don't like it, said Abdullah Hammoud, who is serving his first term in the Michigan House of Representatives. \"I don't think Donald Trump is something new. He's just unveiled what was behind the curtain. They feel empowered to speak vitriol.\"\n\n\n\nAway from politics, Moses the Comic \u2013 real name Musa Sulaiman, 33, from Philadelphia \u2013 has embarked on a \"Super Muslim Comedy Tour\" to break down negative barriers and narratives surrounding Muslims in the USA.\n\n\"It's about going into public places and subverting the stereotypes by making people laugh,\" he said. \"Art and entertainment can combat ideologies of racism and bigotry. Not all black men only become Muslim in prison, something we are constantly told,\" he said.\n\nMusician Mona Haydar in Detroit. Michigan has one of the largest American Muslim populations in the United States. (Photo: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY)\n\nAnd Mona Haydar, 30, from Michigan, which has the largest Muslim population in the USA, is a poet-turned-rapper who has written a song called \"Hijabi (Wrap My Hijab).\"\n\nThe video has been watched 5 million times on YouTube. Haydar told USA TODAY in Detroit last month that the song was about \"normalizing Muslim-American women.\"\n\nNormalizing Islam is something Muhammad, of the museum, also strives for.\n\nWhen USA TODAY visited with him in early September he kept getting interrupted every few minutes by a group of school kids, ranging in age from 6 to 16, loudly knocking on the museum's front entrance. Because there was no one else in the building, Muhammad had locked the front entrance to conduct his tour, but these kids were here to collect snacks as part of an after school program the museum runs for neighborhood children.\n\nMuhammad said that while a few of the kids from time to time might express interest in the museum and its exhibits, which he was grateful for because there was \"nobody else, literally nobody else\" to share this history with them, they mostly came for the snacks.\n\nReporting for this story was made possible by the Washington-based East-West Center, a nonprofit organization that promotes better relations among the United States, Asia, and the Pacific.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/16/islam-america-muslims-religion-president-trump-american/1736878002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Charles Ventura, USA TODAY", "title": "Man\u00e1 after receiving Latin Grammy Award: We vow to fight for immigrants, women's rights", "description": "Legendary Mexican rock band Man\u00e1 vowed to fight for immigrants and women's rights after being honored at the Latin Grammy Awards in Las Vegas.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/16/mana-latin-grammy-awards-immigrants-womens-rights/2022145002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/16/USAT/1156b7a7-8a4b-40f4-92aa-f43f58b2e54e-EPA_USA_LATIN_GRAMMYS_2018.jpg?crop=4199,2362,x0,y107&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:33:02Z", "content": "Mana are pictured after receiving the Person of the Year during the 19th Annual Latin Grammy Awards ceremony at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

(Photo: Thomas Hawthorne/USA TODAY Network)\n\nIt was 1983 and I remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nI had just started as a young firefighter in suburban Sacramento County, California, and was called to a fatal vehicle accident. There, in the middle of a busy intersection, lay the victim, his lower body turned inside out. I was looking at parts of the human body I had only seen in school books.\n\nRight then, I learned the first hard lesson about my new profession: Being a firefighter means being there for people on the worst day of their lives \u2014 sometimes on the day their lives end.\n\nOver the course of a career, firefighters experience every extreme, both physical and emotional. The blazing heat of a wildland or structure fire. The satisfaction of saving a life. The heartbreak of a medical call that ends with a child dying in your arms.\n\nAs every firefighter will tell you, it\u2019s all part of the job.\n\nA life of external, internal dangers\n\nThe most visible risks of the job have been on display this past week on the wildfire lines in California. The deadly Camp Fire near Chico burned hot enough to melt aluminum, whipped by winds up to 70 miles an hour. As I traveled the fire scene, I talked to a crew that had been on the job for nearly two full days without a break, fighting fire. The stress and exhaustion were etched into their faces. They just couldn\u2019t stop. Dozens of firefighters lost their own homes. Yet they still showed up for work. Part of the job.\n\nFor me, the fire service is far more dangerous than when I started out. Year-round wildfires are the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Building materials burn hotter and more dangerously. Call volumes have exploded, as staffing remains flat or declines.\n\nOur View: How to fight California's wildfires? It's an 'all of the above' response\n\nOpposing View: We need common-sense forest policies if we want to prevent wildfires\n\nMore: To live in California is to be stalked by wildfire. How are we doing? Edgy. Tired. Angry.\n\nThere are also risks that don\u2019t present themselves in the moment, but over time. On more than one occasion, I have told my family that I believe it is not a question of whether I will get job-related cancer, it\u2019s a question of when. Another silent killer is post-traumatic stress. Our culture is to bury our feelings about tough calls, but these \u201cexposures\u201d add up too: Last year, more firefighters died by their own hand than in the line of fire.\n\nA life of service, community\n\nYes, it\u2019s a dangerous job. But it is also extremely rewarding. Early in my career, we rescued a young child whose arm had been caught in a dangerous garden machine. It looked like his whole arm was gone, but our actions helped save most of it. Two years later, when a second-grade class came to visit the fire station, there he was with his parents.\n\nOnce, my entire crew scrambled to help a couple flying to England for a funeral. They had left their passports in a closed Kinkos and we were their last hope. We got their passports \u2014 without breaking in \u2014 and the couple made their flight.\n\nThe fire service also gives you a second family. We count on each other when we\u2019re on calls, and we\u2019re living and eating together in the firehouse. It forms an indestructible bond: I know they have my back, and I have theirs.\n\nAs deep as our bond with each other is our bond with those we serve. Everybody focuses on the \u201cguts and the glory\u201d of the job, but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. If you\u2019re not committed to helping people and the community, it\u2019s not the job for you.\n\nMore than anything, it is this commitment that sparked a strong reaction from many firefighters to a statement by the president in the early stages of the Camp Fire. As our people were responding to an unfolding human tragedy, the president\u2019s first words were a 240-character Twitter broadside that included a threat to withhold federal aid, which could hurt the very communities they were sweating blood to save. As busy as they were, our members let me hear about it, and many weren\u2019t happy.\n\nSince then, I\u2019m pleased to say the president has fulfilled his mission, moving quickly on a major disaster declaration that brought critical firefighting assets and emergency aid to the thousands displaced. This action is greatly appreciated, as are the countless expressions of support we\u2019ve received on this and other events. Trust me, it means a lot.\n\nIn my 31 years in the fire service, I\u2019ve never met a firefighter who thought of himself or herself as a hero. Certainly, I never did. Everything we do, we do because it\u2019s part of the job. But at its best, that job is its own reward. Whether we\u2019re fighting fire or rescuing a family\u2019s trip, every day, firefighters have a chance to be helpers.\n\nIt\u2019s a privilege to serve. Even knowing all the risks, I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else.\n\nBrian K. Rice is president of the California Professional Firefighters, representing 30,000 firefighters and paramedics.

(Photo: MARK PETERS, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2013 The last surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge that brutally ruled Cambodia in the 1970s were convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes Friday by an international tribunal.\n\nNuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were sentenced to life in prison, the same sentence they are already serving after earlier convictions at a previous trial for crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers and mass disappearances of people. Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Schoars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic group whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide. The court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for lack of evidence, though he was found guilty of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint command responsiblity.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed \u2018auto-genocide\u2019 through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappeances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nBoth defendants were present as Judge Nil Nonn opened the proceedings, but Nuon Chea suffers heart problems, so was granted permission to later move from the hearing room to a separate holding room.\n\nKhieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nA large crowd of spectators attended Friday\u2019s session, including members of the Cham minority.\n\nLah Sath, a 72-year-old Cham man from eastern Kampong Cham province, brought his wife and four young granddaughters to Friday\u2019s session.

(Photo: MARK PETERS, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2013 The last surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge that brutally ruled Cambodia in the 1970s were convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes Friday by an international tribunal.\n\nNuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were sentenced to life in prison, the same sentence they are already serving after earlier convictions at a previous trial for crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers and mass disappearances of people. Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Schoars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic group whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide. The court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for lack of evidence, though he was found guilty of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint command responsiblity.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed \u2018auto-genocide\u2019 through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappeances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nBoth defendants were present as Judge Nil Nonn opened the proceedings, but Nuon Chea suffers heart problems, so was granted permission to later move from the hearing room to a separate holding room.\n\nKhieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nA large crowd of spectators attended Friday\u2019s session, including members of the Cham minority.\n\nLah Sath, a 72-year-old Cham man from eastern Kampong Cham province, brought his wife and four young granddaughters to Friday\u2019s session. He said he often heard people talking about the trial and sometimes watched it on TV, but decided it was time to see it with his own eyes.\n\nJust talking about the Khmer Rouge brought back horrible memories of life in those years, he said. The Cham were treated as enemies and exploited without mercy as they were forced to do intensive farm labor, he recalled.\n\nLah Sath said his younger brother was killed by Khmer Rouge for failing to take good care of a cow.\n\nIn addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal has carried out one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability.

Trump's hesitance to compromise could cost him in 2020.\n\nPresident Donald Trump at the White House on Nov. 13, 2018. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo)\n\nContrary to what you hear on TV, there are a few things that Washington's big three can do together in the next two years. At a minimum, President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi, who is likely to once again become Speaker of the House, will have to cooperate on budgets to keep the government running. The newly empowered House Democrats might also find Republicans are willing to work with them on infrastructure, criminal justice reform and maybe even health care.\n\nAnd if this was the America of 1946, 1986 or 1994, I might be optimistic that an incumbent president who justlost a chamber of Congress in a midterm would be able to work with the other party to get things done. That\u2019s whatHarry Truman, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton did in those years.\n\nTruman lost the House, Reagan lost the Senate, and Clinton lost both. But all three, though smarting from their defeats, decided that the way forward politically \u2014 and the best thing for the country \u2014 was to reach out to the opposition and give a little to get a little. In other words, compromise. Gerald Ford, president from 1974 to 1977, said it best: \u201cCompromise is the oil that makes governments go.\u201d\n\nFinding common ground has proven successful\n\nEven then, it was tough. Truman and Reagan found common ground with the other party on foreign affairs \u2014 Truman\u2019s hugely expensive Marshall Plan and Reagan\u2019s thawing of ties with the Soviet Union, for example \u2014 but were generally thwarted domestically. But Clinton is a model that Trump may want to study.\n\nThe Red Wave of \u201994 turned Georgia firebrand Newt Gingrich into Speaker of the House and humbled Clinton. It led to a moderation of his views and an outreach to Gingrich. The two found common ground on issues like deficit reduction (which led to budget surpluses between 1998 and 2001) and a massive overhaul of the country\u2019s welfare system.\n\nClinton\u2019s sudden humility \u2014 and a booming economy \u2014 led to his solid reelection in 1996. One wonders what else might have been accomplished if House Republicans hadn\u2019t dropped everything they were doing to impeach Clinton for lying about an affair.\n\nMore: America is rejecting Trump and protecting democracy, midterm election results show\n\nElection results 2018: Voters rebuke Trump, modestly\n\nHealth care is now a major liability for Republicans. Will they dig the hole deeper?\n\nThe advice for Trump here \u2014 and I know I\u2019m probably wasting my time \u2014 is for him to also learn from his setbacks and become more humble. Republicans think this wasn\u2019t a wave election? Even as votes were still being counted Thursday, the Cook Political Report had Democrats leading Republicans by 7.2 percentage points in the national House popular vote, and its analysts said that could go higher. That would make this wave bigger than the Republican waves of 1994 (+7.1%) and 2010 (+6.8%).\n\nIf Trump wasn\u2019t so steeped in self-delusion, this could be a teachable moment for him. But based on everything he has said and tweeted since Election Day, there\u2019s no evidence so far that he has learned a thing. That\u2019s too bad for him \u2014 and for the country.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s fair to point out that Democrats aren\u2019t exactly in the mood to compromise, either. Their strategy is just like Mitch McConnell\u2019s. Remember back in 2010? The Kentucky Republican \u2014 soon to be the Senate Majority Leader \u2014 said then that his No. 1 goal was to make Barack Obama a one-term president. Well, guess what? The shoe\u2019s now on the other foot. Democrats want Trump to be a one-term guy too, and will do whatever they can to undermine him.\n\nMcConnell and other Republicans are already whining about obstruction. But coming from the party that sat on Obama\u2019s judicial nominees and killed a Supreme Court nomination by burying it for nearly a year, their hypocrisy is obvious in all its full-blown glory.\n\nBoth parties will try to undermine each other\n\nThis Democratic undermining will begin on day one with a series of investigations into Trump that will be conducted with the same zeal that Republicans showed when they went after Democrats for problems and missteps like the attack on Americans in Benghazi and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.Trump supported all that back then, of course. He surely must be nervous that Democrats may get their paws on his tax returns and prop up special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.\n\nNever one to turn the other cheek, the president has promised to retaliate by having the Senate launch investigations into the Democrats. But Trump forgot to tell McConnell, who indicated last week he has better things to do, like confirm more conservative judges.\n\nAs he gears up for re-election, I wonder if Trump knows that of the other four popular vote losers who nevertheless won the presidency, only one was re-elected. Trump hasn\u2019t expanded his base, hasn't modified his behavior, hasn\u2019t learned to be a president for all Americans. Over the next 24 months he can, perhaps, change a few minds by doing what Truman, Reagan and Clinton did \u2014 learning from an electoral thrashing and making adjustments. But Trump\u2019s Trump. If past is prologue, he\u2019ll never change.\n\nPaul Brandus, founder and White House bureau chief of West Wing Reports, is the author of Under This Roof: The White House and the Presidency and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

The retailer is re-emerging in time for a holiday season that will be the first in decades without Toys R Us, another store chain that, like FAO Schwarz, specialized in dolls, cars, games and gadgets. In addition to having its own store, it will be a presence in other retailers over the holidays, including Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus.\n\nBonus: 'Fantastic Beasts' sequel premieres\n\nThe second in an anticipated five-part series, \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" starring Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, along with Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol and Ezra Miller, premieres Friday. \"Crimes\" focuses on Scamander's adventures in 1926 Paris, a few after the plot ended in the first film, amid Gellert Grindelwald's (played by Depp) attempt to raise a dark resistance of true-blood wizards in Europe. USA TODAY'S Brian Truitt described the film as a \"darker and bolder film\" than the original \"Beasts\" that \"intertwines different eras of the \"Potter\" mythology and delivers a more relevant cinematic villain.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/16/georgia-florida-recount-presidential-medal-freedom-cnn-jim-acosta/1998277002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "ND-Syracuse at Yankee Stadium headlines Week 12 slate", "description": "Football showdown in baseball stadium: No. 3 Notre Dame puts unbeaten record at stake against No. 12 Syracuse at Yankee Stadium", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/16/nd-syracuse-at-yankee-stadium-headlines-week-12-slate/38541725/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3152045c27f2bf07f7bebdac9ef21cf6c3a602b7/c=0-186-4402-2662/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/0e33f1eaec764457baf3e69aaf7b004b.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T08:05:10Z", "content": "FILE - In this Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, file photo, Colorado head coach Mike MacIntyre watches during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Washington State in Boulder, Colo.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Nebraska's offense has generated more than 450 yards in seven straight games, something not even the powerhouse Tom Osborne teams of the 1990s did.\n\nIf the Cornhuskers put up the same numbers Saturday against Michigan State's stout defense, it will be another sign first-year coach Scott Frost's up-tempo spread option is a force in the Big Ten just as it was when he was at Central Florida in the American Athletic Conference.\n\n\"I've said this a bunch, but this team could've gone a hundred different directions when we were struggling early on and getting bad breaks and losing games,\" Frost said. \"It couldn't have started any worse and this team held together and got better through that, and now we're dangerous. We are a team that can beat just about anybody in this league. We have to play well to have a chance, but we're a dangerous team.\"\n\nThe Huskers (3-7, 2-5 Big Ten) have beaten Minnesota, Bethune-Cookman of the Football Championship Subdivision and Illinois in their last four games, and they had no trouble moving the ball against Ohio State in a loss.\n\nMichigan State (6-4, 4-3) will be another chance to measure how far Nebraska's offense has come since it got stopped cold at Michigan nearly two months ago. The Spartans allow fewer than 20 points per game, lead the nation in rushing defense and are 21st overall.\n\n\"This is close to or as good as the best defenses we've faced all year,\" Frost said. \"They know their schemes and they know their issues, places that people try to hit them, and they have answers for that. Best thing about them, they get 11 guys playing hard and sprinting to the football, they don't give up big plays.\"\n\nNebraska's defense under coordinator Erik Chinander will be in the spotlight as Frost heads into year two. The Huskers rank no better than 12th in the Big Ten in any of the major statistical categories, allowing 34 points and 449 yards per game.\n\nThey'll be going against a struggling Michigan State offense beset by injuries, none bigger than the shoulder problem that has limited quarterback Brian Lewerke the past two games. Redshirt freshman Rocky Lombardi has replaced Lewerke the past two games. Coach Mark Dantonio has not named a starter for this week.\n\n\"The most important thing to me is that our football team remains intact from a chemistry standpoint, which it will,\" Dantonio said, \"and we will bring great energy to the game on Saturday against Nebraska.\"\n\nSPARTANS' BAD MEMORIES\n\nThe last time Michigan State visited Lincoln, in 2015, the Spartans were ranked No. 6 and Tommy Armstrong Jr. drove Nebraska 91 yards in the final minute for a 39-38 win. MSU fans still mutter about the ending. Brandon Reilly stepped out of bounds and came back in to make the catch on the winning 30-yard touchdown. Officials ruled it was legal because cornerback Jermaine Edmondson forced Reilly out. The play withstood a video review.\n\nIt was the Spartans' only loss before they were beaten by Alabama in a College Football Playoff semifinal.\n\nSTRUGGLING TO RUN\n\nMichigan State's offense has been known for its balance under Dantonio, but consistency running the ball has been a struggle since LJ Scott went out with injury in September. The Spartans are averaging 118 yards a game on the ground, ranking 13th in the Big Ten, and they ran only 18 times in last week's loss to Ohio State, their fewest number of attempts since 2006.\n\nSO LONG, SENIORS\n\nNebraska will honor 19 seniors before the game. The group includes 12 fifth-year seniors who have had three head coaches (Bo Pelini, Mike Riley and Frost).\n\nFOLTZ-SADLER CEREMONY\n\nThis will be the first game between the teams since former punters Sam Foltz of Nebraska and Mike Sadler of Michigan State died in a car accident in July 2016 while both were in Wisconsin to work at a kicking camp.\n\nFrost and Dantonio will meet at midfield with the parents of Foltz and Sadler and the specialists of both teams. The coaches will make a presentation. The coin flip will include the Foltz-Sadler coin used by the Big Ten during the 2016 season.\n\nSTARTING OUT RIGHT\n\nNebraska has scored touchdowns on its opening possession in six straight games, with all the drives covering at least 65 yards.\n\n\"Watching tape,\" Frost said, \"I see people punting nine straight times against this outfit. If we can score on our first drive this week, I'll be really happy.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Colgate coach Dan Hunt says he really didn't see this coming, and that's easy to understand.\n\nHeading into the season finale at Michie Stadium on Saturday against Army (8-2), Colgate is unbeaten in nine games this season and has rekindled memories of the school's famed 1932 team. Coach Andy Kerr guided those Raiders to a 9-0 record and had one overwhelming statistic \u2014 they shut out every team.\n\nHunt's squad has done its best imitation, posting five shutouts to match the Championship Subdivision record set in 1978 by South Carolina State and easily win the Patriot League title. Lehigh's second-quarter touchdown last Saturday in a 48-6 loss to the Raiders snapped a 70-day, 29-quarter streak of zero touchdowns allowed dating to the fourth quarter of Colgate's season opener against Holy Cross.\n\n\"We knew we were going to have a good team,\" said Hunt, whose Raiders are on a 14-game winning streak. \"We set goals. I don't think anybody set the goal of being undefeated, and I certainly don't think anybody set the goal of giving up 29 points on the season. If they had, I would have had to tell them to check themselves a little bit.\"\n\nSome numbers: Colgate has outscored its nine opponents by an average of 31.9-3.2 and the Raiders have taken the notion of getting an early jump to the extreme\u2014 they've outscored teams 67-0 in the first quarter and 195-9 in the first half.\n\n\"I'm surprised by the staggering numbers,\" Hunt said. \"I've been coaching a long time. I've never seen a team put up numbers like that. Somebody asked me the other day why we weren't more aggressive on kick returns. I said, 'Well, we're only returning one kick a game.' It's just crazy. You never expect to do that. Here we are going into our last game of the season and there hasn't been one second that we've been behind all year.\"\n\nArmy represents a step up in class for Colgate, ranked sixth in the FCS, and the Black Knights have been dominant at Michie Stadium the past two seasons, winning 12 straight. A victory would give them their second straight unbeaten season at home, something the team hasn't accomplished since the mid-1980s when it won 13 in a row over two seasons.\n\n\"It's going to be a challenge for us to play our very best,\" Army coach Jeff Monken said. \"I've watched them play.\"\n\nOther things to know when Colgate visits Army on Saturday:\n\nDAUNTING DEFENSES\n\nThe teams operate with a similar mentality \u2014 focus on the run to control the clock and keep the defense rested. Colgate ranks first in FCS in total defense (192.3), rushing defense (56.7), red zone defense (0.333) and scoring defense (3.2), and is second in time of possession (34:45) and third-down conversion percentage defense (0.227). Army leads the Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in time of possession (39:00), ranks second in rushing (307.2), seventh in third-down conversion defense (.274 percent), and ninth in rushing defense (98.3).\n\n\"People talk about their offense,\" Hunt said. \"That defense is really good.\"\n\nCONFIDENCE GAME\n\nThis is a big game for Army because the regular season finale looms in three weeks against archrival Navy. Plus, it's senior day and this class has been instrumental in helping turn the program into a winner.\n\n\"You'd like to carry some confidence into that (Navy) game,\" Monken said. \"That's really what we're hoping for. Hopefully, we'll do a good job of sending our seniors out with a memory that's a positive one.\"\n\nRUNNING MAN\n\nColgate has a long history of stellar running backs, from Marv Hubbard to Mark van Eeghen to Rich Erenberg to Kenny Gamble and Jamal Branch and the current team has another in senior James Holland. He's averaging 5.9 yards per carry and has 899 yards rushing with 11 TDs.\n\nDO THE MATH\n\nColgate's defensive prowess has Monken shaking his head.\n\n\"You look at 29 points allowed for the entire season and you scratch your head,\" Monken said. \"You're hoping you can score 29 points, and that would be two less than their average. If they score 31 points and we score as much as they've given up the entire year, we'd still lose the game.\"\n\nQUARTERBACK DECISION\n\nSophomore Grant Breneman has been the No. 1 guy under center for Colgate, averaging 201 yards offensively. He's completed 103 of 160 for 1,347 yards and five TDs with three interceptions but did not play last week because of an injury. With an NCAA playoff game looming in a week, Hunt says he'll make a game-time decision to go with either Breneman or senior Sage Attwood.\n\nCOMMON GROUND\n\nThe teams have had one common opponent \u2014 Lafayette. Colgate beat the Leopards 45-0 in late September while the Black Knights are coming off a 31-13 victory at home last Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: KCNA VIA KNS, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSEOUL \u2013 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the successful testing of a \u201cnewly developed ultramodern tactical weapon,\u201d state media reported Friday.\n\nKCNA News said that Kim supervised the high-tech weapon test at the country\u2019s Academy of Defense Science. No details on the type of weapon were given.\n\nThe report said that Kim expressed \u201cgreat satisfaction\u201d at the test\u2019s success and said that it was \u201ca striking demonstration of the validity of the Party policy of prioritizing defense science and technology.\u201d\n\nThe weapons test, the first one to be publicly announced since last year, comes as negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang over the communist nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program are at an impasse.\n\nNorth Korea had agreed to suspend nuclear and missile tests as part of its ongoing diplomatic efforts with South Korea and the U.S. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Security revealed this week, however, that the North has at least 13 secret operating bases where the regime is continuing work on its ballistic missile program.\n\nPyongyang has also heated up its rhetoric recently, expressing anger over continuing economic sanctions and ongoing joint military exercises in South Korea.\n\nMore: President Trump says easing sanctions on North Korea is a 'two-way street'\n\nMore: Kim Jong Un wants 2nd summit with Donald Trump, Moon Jae-in says\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry warned it could return to its \u201cpyongjin\u201d policy of simultaneous nuclear weapons and economic development if sanctions aren\u2019t lifted.\n\nNorth Korea has been seeking a phased process of sanctions relief for concessions in dismantling its nuclear arsenal. Pyongyang also wants a peace declaration to formally end the Korean War, which took place between 1950-1953 and was halted with an armistice.\n\nHowever, the U.S. has maintained that complete denuclearization must take place before those conditions can be met.\n\nPyongyang also criticized the resumption of small-scale military drills by U.S. and South Korean marine earlier this month, calling for a halt to \u201call hostile acts.\u201d\n\nKim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump signed a vaguely worded agreement in June at their historic summit in Singapore that promised to work toward a \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d but details remain scarce on how to achieve that goal. North Korea has made concessions, such as dismantling a nuclear test site, that critics say remain token gestures at best.\n\nThe State Department released a statement in response to North Korea\u2019s latest weapons test, saying that the U.S. was confident that Pyongyang would still comply with the agreement reached in Singapore.\n\n\"We remain confident that the promises made by President Trump and Chairman Kim will be fulfilled,\" a spokesman said in the statement.\n\nNorth Korea abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York last week, but a second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un is still planned for 2019, Vice President Mike Pence confirmed on Thursday.\n\nPence said the U.S. will not require North Korea to provide a complete list of its nuclear weapons and missile sites ahead of the meeting, dropping what had been seen as a key prerequisite.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in Singapore, where Pence is attending regional summits, the vice president said the goal of the next Trump-Kim meeting will be to come up with a verifiable plan for cataloging the North\u2019s weapons programs.\n\n\u201cI think it will be absolutely imperative in this next summit that we come away with a plan for identifying all of the weapons in question, identifying all the development sites, allowing for inspections of the sites and the plan for dismantling nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.\n\n\"Now we need to see results,\" he added.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/15/north-korea-tests-new-tactical-weapon/2022226002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "'Pedal-down' Northwestern aims to avoid let-up at Minnesota", "description": "'Pedal-down' Northwestern aims to avoid let-up at Minnesota after clinching Big Ten West", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/16/pedal-down-northwestern-aims-to-avoid-let-up-at-minnesota/38541641/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c1bc62b25e66efc6c521377cfe870d2d82f23086/c=0-576-2483-1973/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/8a26b85dce544df9b21a7fc75f168214.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T07:21:18Z", "content": "FILE - In this Sept. 15, 2018, file photo, Minnesota wide receiver Tyler Johnson catches a pass against Miami (Ohio) in the second half of an NCAA football game, in Minneapolis.

(Kyodo News via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNAGOYA, Japan (AP) \u2014 Coming off a strong showing against a team of Major League Baseball All-Stars, Japan manager Atsunori Inaba has every reason to be confident about his team's chances of winning a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nJapan won the six-game exhibition series 5-1 against an MLB squad featuring National League Rookie of the Year Ronald Acuna Jr., fellow nominee Juan Soto and veteran catcher and nine-time gold glove winner Yadier Molina.\n\nThe tour was a chance for Inaba to gauge the progress of his young players ahead of the Olympics their capital will be hosting in less than two years. Players like 23-year-old Seiji Uebayashi and Sosuke Genda stepped up against the major leaguers and performed well.\n\n\"I told my players to play this series with Tokyo 2020 in mind,\" Inaba said. \"We used a lot of young players and it was a valuable experience for them. I hope they continue making progress.\"\n\nThe host country has set an ambitious target of 30 gold medals at the 2020 Games and few would be more coveted than the top prize in baseball, the most popular sport in Japan.\n\nJapan has never won gold in the Olympics but won the World Baseball Classic in 2006 and 2009, and has produces players the caliber of Ichiro Suzuki and Shohei Ohtani.\n\nMiami Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who managed the MLB tour of Japan, said Japan has a good chance to win gold.\n\n\"The WBC is a pretty good indication,\" Mattingly said. \"They've won it a couple of times and do a good job of doing what you have to do to win games. There are a number of countries that are going to put pretty good teams out there and in that type of format anything can happen but (Japan) has a great chance because of the way they play the game.\"\n\nBaseball will be returning to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, and part of the reason it was reinstated by the IOC was because of its popularity in Japan.\n\nSome of the games will be held in Fukushima, an area devastated by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.\n\nOlympic organizers have been eager to use the games as a symbol of recovery from the disaster that hit Japan's northeastern region including Fukushima, 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, where entire communities fled after meltdowns at the nuclear plant.\n\nMore than 18,000 people died or went missing after the disaster.\n\nThe IOC approved the use of Fukushima Azuma Baseball Stadium as an additional venue for baseball and softball, although Yokohama Stadium will be the main venue.\n\nMajor league players won't take part as the games are scheduled for July 24-Aug. 9 \u2014 in the middle of the MLB season.\n\nIn 2008, players on major league 25-man rosters and disabled lists on June 26 were ineligible to play. The U.S. roster included 17 players from Triple-A, seven from Double-A and college pitcher Stephen Strasburg, now with the Washington Nationals.\n\nMitch Haniger, who was part of the MLB tour of Japan, said he'd like to be a part of the Olympics.\n\n\"One of my dreams has always been to put on a United States uniform and play for my country, but I don't know if it will happen during a season,\" he said. \"I'm not the one making the calls, so we'll have to wait and see but hopefully at some point during my career, I'd love to play for my country.\"\n\nIn 2020, the main competition for Inaba's squad will likely come from traditional baseball powers like Cuba, the Dominican Republic and the U.S.\n\nThe Cubans have won three gold medals in the event since baseball became a medal event in Barcelona in 1992, while the U.S. and South Korea have each won a gold medal. Japan's previous best was a silver medal at Atlanta in '96.\n\nInaba's squad is hoping to take that next step in Tokyo.\n\n\"We did well against these great players from MLB,\" said Genda, who hit a bases-clearing triple in Thursday's 4-1 win at Nagoya. \"I think that is the general feeling within the team. It has certainly given us a lot of motivation as we look forward to (the 2020 Olympics).\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWACO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Baylor coach Matt Rhule is more interested in what his team and the seniors who stuck around can accomplish, and not what the Bears could do to Big 12 rival TCU in the process.\n\nThe Bears (5-5, 3-4 Big 12) can get bowl eligible with a win Saturday in the home finale for 10 fifth-year seniors who remained through a sexual assault scandal that rocked the school more than two years ago, and led to only one win in Rhule's debut last season. They host the Horned Frogs (4-6, 2-5), who have to win their last two games to get to a bowl.\n\n\"Probably no group of seniors has ever been through more than they've been through,\" Rhule said. \"My whole focus with our team this week is going to be about sending the seniors out on senior day the right way, and really send them out with the best home record. ... This is a special group to me, and I'd love to have a chance to play one more game with them.\"\n\nBaylor will honor 20 seniors overall before the game. That includes the fifth-year guys and three players who came into the program from other schools as graduate transfers.\n\nReceiver Chris Platt, nose tackle Ira Lewis and the other fifth-year seniors arrived in Waco at the peak of the program's on-field success \u2014 after the Bears' first Big 12 championship in 2013, and then a share of the title in 2014 in their first season on campus. Eight of the fifth-year seniors already have degrees and could have gone elsewhere this season as graduate transfers. They have been part of two bowl wins, during a 10-win 2015 season and the Cactus Bowl in 2016 that capped a 7-6 record under interim coach Jim Grobe in the immediate wake of the scandal.\n\nTCU played in the Big 12 title game last year after ending that regular season by beating the Bears for the third year in a row. Now the Frogs have to win out \u2014 at Baylor and their home finale against Oklahoma State \u2014 or miss a bowl for only the third time in coach Gary Patterson's 18 seasons as head coach.\n\n\"It is a must-win game because we do want to win a bowl game,\" tight end Cole Novak said. \"That is the end game, and we're going to do everything we can in order to make that happen.\"\n\nBut the injury-plagued Frogs, with 36 players missing much or all of the season, are coming off their most lopsided loss under Patterson \u2014 47-10 at No. 7 West Virginia last week. The only times they missed bowls under GP were 2004 and 2013, but rebounded with at least 10 wins the following season.\n\n\"You want to have some urgency about doing it, but I don't think you're panicking. If you're not careful, you cause a lot more problems that way,\" Patterson said. \"When you're struggling, what you need to do is worry about you. You don't worry about your opponent.\"\n\nSome other things to know about the 113-game series that dates back to 1899, and is the most-played for both schools:\n\nFROGS ON THE RIVER BANK\n\nTCU has played twice in Baylor's campus stadium on the banks of the Brazos River. There was that epic 2014 game when Baylor scored 24 points in the final 11 minutes for a 61-58 win that eventually left the Bears and Frogs as Big 12 co-champions \u2014 and both out of the initial four-team College Football Playoff. TCU won 62-22 there in 2016 and has a 54-52-7 series lead.\n\nFIRST-HALF SUSPENSION\n\nBaylor DE Greg Roberts will miss the first half after he was ejected from the second half of last week's loss at Iowa State for reaching over an official to throw a punch at running back David Montgomery. Bears starting quarterback Charlie Brewer won't have to serve any further penalty after his automatic ejection. He got his second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the fourth quarter for saying something to an official \u2014 every player had been assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after the earlier melee.\n\nDIFFERENT FEEL\n\n\"Well, I think both of us, probably the rivalry's a little bit downplayed,\" Patterson said. \"It's a lot easier to do that when both teams are winning a lot, and this season both of us we're sitting around .500, so it's a lit bit more numb.\"\n\nRECLAIMING THE BEARS HOME\n\nBaylor went into this season with an eight-game home losing streak. The Bears are 4-1 this year at McLane Stadium, and a win over TCU would give them their best home record since 6-0 in the stadium's inaugural season in 2014.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 No. 4 Michigan has one last chance to fine tune its team against a lesser opponent before playing championship-caliber teams.\n\nThe Wolverines (9-1, 7-0 Big Ten, No. 4 CFP) are favored to beat Indiana (5-5, 2-5) by more than four touchdowns in their final home game of the season.\n\nThen, things get kicked up a big notch.\n\nMichigan closes the regular season at No. 8 Ohio State, desperately hoping to beat its rival on the road for the first time since 2000. If the Wolverines finally win in the Horseshoe, they will advance to the conference championship for the first time. And, a Big Ten title would likely put Michigan in the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"We're in a beautiful position where we control our own destiny,\" Wolverines linebacker Josh Ross said.\n\nStaying motivated game to game, with a matchup looking against the Buckeyes, has been accomplished.\n\n\"Ever since, I would say, Wisconsin, it's kind of been like every week is like a playoff game,\" Ross said. \"We're in a mode where we've got to win out to make the playoffs, so we have to stay focused. It's natural to be focused every single day because we know what the stakes are and we can come up short at anytime.\"\n\nHere are some things to watch when the Hoosiers play at the Big House:\n\nONE TO GO\n\nIndiana has two chances to pick up the one win it needs to become bowl eligible for the third time in four years.\n\nIt won't be easy.\n\nThe Hoosiers haven't won at Michigan since 1967 and they may be underdogs at home next week against rival Purdue. After ignoring the postseason chatter last season, coach Tom Allen is freely talking about the scenarios.\n\n\"Taking a completely different approach and very up front with our guys about it and that will continue,\" Allen said. \"There have definitely been some changes for sure.\"\n\nTHOSE WHO STAY\n\nGrant Perry will be among the Michigan seniors honored before the game, an experience the receiver from suburban Detroit is eagerly anticipating.\n\n\"Those who stay will be champions,\" he said, repeating a mantra made popular by former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. \"I've lived by that motto and just try to be a Michigan man like the rest of the guys who have come before me. That's what I knew growing up. I really wanted to be a Michigan Wolverine and I'm close to ending that.\"\n\nPerry was in Jim Harbaugh's first recruiting class at Michigan.\n\nFifth-year seniors, such as defensive end Chase Winovich and defensive back Brandon Watson, were signed by former coach Brady Hoke.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAYS\n\nIndiana has forced a Big Ten-best 24 turnovers, ranking fourth in major college football, and has a takeaway in 16 straight games. The Hoosiers share the FBS lead with 13 fumble recoveries and are No. 25 in interceptions, picking off at least one pass in nine straight games.\n\nDOWN PAT\n\nMichigan's Shea Patterson is one of five finalists for the Unitas Award, which recognizes college football's best upperclassman quarterback. He has completed 67 percent of his passes with 19 touchdowns and just three interceptions. The former Ole Miss star has career highs with 187 yards rushing and two scores on the ground.\n\n\"Shea Patterson is special,\" said Allen, a former Ole Miss assistant coach. \"I was part of the staff that recruited him when he was younger. I know him extremely well. Watched him play a lot on film in high school. A lot of respect for his talent. He's an extremely gifted passer, but also has great escapability.\"\n\nFAMILIAR FACES\n\nMike Hart ran for a school-record 5,040 yards at Michigan from 2004 to 2007, but he won't be wearing maize and blue on Saturday. Hart is Indiana's running backs coach and among the nominees for the Broyles Award, which honors college football's top assistant.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It's been a year since James Dolan announced his intent to sell the New York Liberty, and the team is still on the market.\n\nThere have been several potential buyers and a few have gotten close to purchasing the team, but for various reasons all the potential deals fell through. Even without a new owner on the horizon and the Liberty in the same situation as last November, there is no danger of the team ceasing to exist this winter.\n\n\"There is no risk of the Liberty folding in the offseason,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a phone interview. \"Jim has been very helpful to the league on the Liberty. Even though the team wasn't sold on his initial timeline, he indicated he would do whatever is necessary to support the transition to a new owner.\"\n\nThe Liberty said in a statement they would \"work closely with the WNBA to find the right steward for the team moving forward.\"\n\nNew York tried to make itself more appealing to a new owner by strengthening its financial structure after incurring heavy losses over the first 21 years. The team said before the season that it had \"lost money every year since its inception and cumulative losses exceed $100 million.\"\n\nMoving most of the home games to Westchester this past season did help the Liberty lose less money, although the franchise declined to comment on this season's financial situation.\n\nOperating costs at the Westchester County Center were nearly 20 times less than playing a game at Madison Square Garden. The move to the WCC wasn't popular with longtime fans who would either have to drive or take a commuter train to reach the new arena.\n\nThe team dropped from fourth in attendance in 2017 to last in the league this past season, averaging 2,823 fans. That number was even smaller when the two kids' day games at MSG were taken out, with just 1,886 fans coming to the 15 Westchester dates. They couldn't routinely fill the arena, which was configured to hold only 2,319 fans.\n\nThe team plans on playing its games at the arena next year as well and already has sent out ticket renewal forms to its fans. The Liberty didn't announce they were playing at Westchester until February last season.\n\nImproved play on the court could also help draw more fans. The Liberty struggled this season, finishing with the second-worst record in the league. To the Liberty players' credit, they didn't publicly grumble about the change in venue, which lacks many amenities of an NBA facility.\n\nThe union has discussed the arena issues with the league.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Gonzaga was flying up and down the court in the first half against Texas A&M, taking hurried shots, and coach Mark Few was not pleased.\n\nAt halftime he told his team to slow down, and the No. 3 Bulldogs responded by blowing out the Aggies 94-71 on Thursday night.\n\n\"We slowed a couple of guys down,\" Few said. \"We got the ball in the right places and took the right shots.\"\n\nZach Norvell Jr. scored 22 points and Rui Hachimura added 18 for Gonzaga, which had broken the 100-point mark in its two previous games.\n\nBrandon Clarke had 14 points and 11 rebounds for Gonzaga (3-0), which won its first three games for the eighth consecutive season.\n\nFive Zags finished in double figures.\n\n\"That's obviously the strength of our team,\" Few said. \"We've got good balance.\"\n\nGonzaga blocked 10 shots and had eight steals against the Aggies.\n\n\"We had to dig deeper than the score would indicate tonight,\" Few said. \"There were a lot of high-level plays at the rim.\"\n\nSavion Flagg scored 18 points and T.J. Starks 16 for Texas A&M (1-2). The Aggies went to the Sweet 16 last season, but had major losses to graduation and the NBA draft.\n\nCoach Billy Kennedy was not immediately available after the game.\n\n\"Starks is a heck of a player,\" Few said.\n\nThe Aggies were plagued by shooting in the 30 percent range most of the game, although a late flurry of scoring allowed them to finish at 41.5 percent. Gonzaga shot 49 percent.\n\nNeither team shot well in the early going, and Gonzaga led 16-14 with 11 minutes left in the first.\n\nThe Aggies tied the score at 28, but Gonzaga went on a 15-5 run in the closing five minutes, including a pair of 3-pointers by Norvell, to take a 43-33 halftime lead. Hachimura and Norvell each scored 13 points in the first, while Texas A&M was held to 36 percent shooting.\n\nGonzaga opened the second half with a 14-4 run to build a 57-37 lead.

(AP Photo/A.E. Maloof, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Sixty-five members of the 1968 Harvard football team are expected back in Boston this weekend for the 50th anniversary of the most memorable entry in the 143-year-old history of The Game. A luncheon for returning Yale players was canceled for lack of interest.\n\nNot all ties come out even.\n\nFifty years after a furious comeback against Yale left Harvard celebrating a 29-29 \"victory,\" players from both sidelines have no doubt who won and who lost in what is still considered one of the greatest games in college football history.\n\n\"All I could think about was Harvard claiming the victory, and it sure feels like a defeat to us,\" Yale end Bruce Weinstein said this week. \"It doesn't grate. It's what amateur sports are all about, the fact that they are still talking about 50 years later. But I'd rather be the one to bring the topic up.\"\n\nThe Game in 1968 had a backdrop of social unrest that reached into the locker rooms, where players who protested the Vietnam War dressed alongside those, like Harvard safety Pat Conway, who fought in it. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy had been assassinated; riots shook the Democratic National Convention.\n\nChange was also coming to the schools: A week earlier, Yale president Kingman Brewster announced that the school would admit its first class of women; he was \"hissed and booed,\" The Yale Daily News reported, by male students who would have to move out of their residential college to make room.\n\nBut if the students sensed that tradition was crumbling around them, there was still The Game.\n\nAlways the season finale, in most years the matchup gave each school one last chance to salvage its season \u2014 perhaps by ruining its rival's. The anticipation was even more intense in 1968: For the first time in almost 60 years, both teams arrived with a perfect record, and an Ivy League title was on the line.\n\n\"It was an unbelievable game in a very different society,\" Yale quarterback and captain Brian Dowling said. \"It sort of lived up to the billing, if that's possible.\"\n\nAlthough the gap has grown between the Ivy League and college's football factories, Yale in 1968 was a budding power that received votes in The Associated Press Top 20 and would see three players drafted by the NFL, including first-round pick Calvin Hill. Dowling finished ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting, with the fourth-most first-place votes (still far behind winner O.J. Simpson).\n\nHarvard halfback Vic Gatto remembers people ringing the field to watch practice \u2014 not just alumni, but Cambridge residents, too. And it wasn't just the Yale game that sold out.\n\n\"It's hard to recapture that time. It's not the same,\" he said. \"The Patriots were around, but they weren't big. So we were the game. If you lived in Cambridge or the environs, that's what you'd want to see.\"\n\nUnder coach Carm Cozza, a future Hall of Famer, Yale did not trail in a game all season and was the heavy favorite against Harvard.\n\nDowling had not lost a game since he was in the seventh grade and was known around campus simply as \"God\"; he was also the inspiration for the character B.D. in the Doonesbury comic strip penned by Yale classmate Garry Trudeau. Hill, the future Dallas Cowboys star, was his favorite target.\n\nSo, few were surprised when Yale went ahead 22-0 in the first half. Nor was there much concern on the Bulldogs sideline when the lead was down to 29-13 in the fourth quarter. Yale was driving again when a fumble gave Harvard the ball at its own 14 yard-line and 3:34 to play.\n\nBackup quarterback Frank Champi led Harvard downfield for a score with 42 seconds left, then the Crimson converted the 2-point conversion on a second try after a phantom pass interference penalty on the first. Harvard recovered the onside kick, and marched to another score, culminating in Champi's 8-yard pass to Gatto as time expired.\n\nFans stormed the field, only to be cleared away for the decisive 2-point conversion. When Champi connected with Pete Varney to tie it 29-29, the stands emptied anew.\n\n\"It was so improbable, the kind of finish if you wrote a movie script about it, nobody would believe it,\" said Weinstein, who would be drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the eighth round.\n\nThe result left the schools sharing the Ivy League title, but the winner was obvious. The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, ran its story under the headline \"Harvard Beats Yale 29-29,\" and that's the way the outcome has been viewed for half of a century since.\n\nA documentary on the 40th anniversary used the headline as its title and included interviews with the players, including actor Tommy Lee Jones, who was an offensive lineman on the football team and roommates with Al Gore at Harvard. (Meryl Streep also shows up in the film: While attending Vassar, she dated Yale fullback Bob Levin, whose fumble started the Harvard comeback.)\n\nAfter all this time, Dowling still bristles at the notion of a Harvard victory.\n\n\"Despite saying they won, they didn't win,\" he said. \"We both won. Harvard won because of the comeback and we were winners because we got to play for Carm Cozza. And after 40 years we got to be in a movie with Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep.\"\n\nAs implausible as the comeback was, the tie score was even more unlikely.\n\nYale inexplicably and uncharacteristically went for two after scoring its third touchdown to make it 22-0. (\"I have no idea why we did that,\" Dowling said.) Harvard missed an extra point after its first score, leaving the Bulldogs with a 22-6 lead at halftime.\n\n\"But for the tie, nobody would remember that game at all,\" Weinstein said in a telephone interview this week. \"If either team had won, you and I wouldn't be talking.\"\n\nDowling and Gatto will take part in a ceremonial coin flip on Saturday when Harvard and Yale (both 5-4, 3-3 Ivy) meet for the 135th time, and the '68 Harvard team will be recognized at halftime. Nothing more than third place in the Ivy League is at stake.\n\nInstead, the history comes from the venue: The Game will be played at Fenway Park \u2014 the first off-campus site since the 1894 matchup in Springfield, Massachusetts, that was so violent that the Harvard faculty voted to discontinue football entirely; they were overruled and the rivalry was put on hold for two years instead.\n\nAlthough alumni and students have griped that the urban ballpark leaves no option for tailgating, Harvard coach Tim Murphy said he is looking forward to taking the field in yet another historic arena.\n\n\"Any time you break from tradition it's very tough to make everybody happy,\" said Murphy, who grew up in Massachusetts and remembers reading about the 1968 tie as a 12-year-old. \"Having said that, the players are really, really excited to play at Fenway. So if they're excited, I'm excited.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Torrey ripped off a 46-yard run on the next play from scrimmage and, after Fine was injured two plays later, Shanbour scored from 5 yards out. Nate Brooks picked off a pass from Chris Robison three plays later and Shanbour's second TD run made it 34-24 with 6:33 left in the quarter.\n\nDevin Singletary's 8-yard scoring run capped an eight-play, 75-yard drive on FAU's next possession and both offenses sputtered until Torrey's long TD run.

New England's Stephen Gostkowski, Greg Zuerlein of the Los Angeles Rams and Indianapolis' Adam Vinatieri finished in that order.\n\nGostkowski received 79 points, including one first-place vote, and appeared on every ballot along with Tucker and Vinatieri.\n\n\"Gostkowski is consistent, clutch and deadly accurate,\" said New York-based Dennis Waszak Jr. \"He replaced Adam Vinatieri in 2006 and the Patriots' kicking game never missed a beat.\"\n\nZuerlein, who received 63 points, has a powerful leg and is 26 of 45 (57.7 percent) from beyond 50 yards in his career, though the Rams don't need to call him much any longer because they find the end zone quite often.\n\n\"'Greg the Leg' can deliver from long range with the best of them,\" San Francisco-based Josh Dubow said.\n\nVinatieri set a pair of NFL records this season, surpassing Hall of Famer Morten Anderson for most points and most field goals. The GOAT turns 46 on Dec. 28 and is in his 13th season with Indianapolis after 10 years in New England, where he helped the Patriots win three Super Bowls by making game-winning kicks in the final seconds in two of the wins.\n\nVinatieri received 55 points and a first-place vote from Simmi Buttar.\n\n\"Doesn't matter how old he is. He's got the most points ever in NFL history. Case closed,\" said Buttar, who is based in New York.\n\nWil Lutz finished fifth, one point behind Vinatieri. He is 19 of 20 on field goals for the Saints. Lutz got a pair of first-place votes.\n\n\"He's come through when called upon for a field goal, and he's limiting opponents in the return game by consistently sending kicks into the end zone,\" Nashville-based Teresa Walker said.\n\nCarolina's Graham Gano was sixth with 39 points. Kansas City's Harrison Butker was seventh with 35 points. Jason Myers of the New York Jets was eighth with 25 points. Buffalo's Stephen Hauschka came in ninth with 22 points.

That didn't bother the Toronto Maple Leafs a bit and they ended up with the win.\n\nJohn Tavares opened the scoring just after a power-play for an early run at Kadri ended and Kasperi Kapanen had two goals, including a short-handed tally that broke a tie in the second period and sent the Maple Leafs to their fifth win in six games, 5-3 over the Sharks on Thursday night.\n\n\"I don't know what was going on to be honest,\" Kapanen said about Barclay Goodrow going after Kadri right off the opening faceoff.\n\n\"Nazzy loves that stuff. It got him into the game. I think that was a mistake by them. To go after Naz like that is not going to do anything to him. I think it's the opposite. It's going to get him going. I thought our line had a pretty good night tonight.\"\n\nThe Sharks were still upset at Kadri for pulling out a chunk of Joe Thornton's beard during a scrum last season in Toronto. Goodrow sought revenge early and the Sharks kept going after Kadri for most of the night.\n\n\"It seemed like they were pretty agitated to start, so I figured I'd just try to use that to my advantage,\" Kadri said. \"I think they might have been a little too worried about their own thing out there. We took care of business, and it was a good win for us.\"\n\nFrederik Andersen made 42 saves and assisted on Mitch Marner's insurance goal with a pass to the opposite blue line late in the third period to seal Toronto's eighth win in nine road games this season. Josh Leivo also scored for the Leafs.\n\nJoe Pavelski scored his fourth goal in the past three games, and Kevin Labanc and Marc-Edouard-Vlasic also scored for the Sharks, who had their four-game home winning streak snapped.\n\nMartin Jones made 29 saves but wasn't able to stop enough of the several odd-man rushes the Leafs generated with their speed.\n\nThe Maple Leafs took the lead in the second thanks to a pair of odd-man rushes. Leivo tied the game early in the period when he converted a two-on-one off a pass from Tyler Ennis.\n\nThen with the Sharks on the power-play midway through the second, Toronto took advantage of a turnover at the blue line by Pavelski to take the lead. Marner got the puck ahead to a streaking Kapanen, who went in all alone and beat Jones to make it 4-3.\n\n\"The frustrating part right is we haven't played to our identity,\" Pavelski said. \"We do it for a few minutes and then we do this or that and suddenly there's a breakaway, then another breakaway. We're just hanging them out to dry with these odd-man rushes and chances. It happened again tonight. It can't happen five times a night.\"\n\nThe teams traded goals off fortunate bounces early with Tavares' centering pass deflecting off Vlasic's skate and into the net just after Goodrow got out of the box for his penalty against Kadri.\n\nThe Sharks tied it when Erik Karlsson's dump-in bounced in front of the net instead of going around the boards. Andersen never saw it and Labanc knocked the loose puck into the open net.\n\nPatrick Marleau then got his first point against San Jose after scoring 1,082 for the Sharks during his 19 years with them when he took advantage of a bad line change to find Kapanen on a two-on-one.\n\n\"It was pretty emotional,\" Marleau said about his second game in San Jose since signing with Toronto. \"Being on the other side for so many years and being on this side is a little different.\"\n\nBut Pavelski tied it with a deflection off a pass from Brent Burns on a power play about a minute later and then set up Vlasic for his goal late in the period that made it 3-2.\n\nNOTES: Maple Leafs F Auston Matthews (shoulder) skated in the morning but will miss his eighth straight game. ...

(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Aaron Rodgers did what he liked for the first 30 minutes. He threw a pair of touchdowns, including a 54-yarder on the run to an unknown tight end for his first NFL catch. His passer rating was nearly perfect. Green Bay looked like it could score on every drive.\n\nAnd then it almost completely stopped. Rodgers was unable to solve Seattle in the second half, and was left to watch Russell Wilson lead another late touchdown drive and send the Packers back home with a loss.\n\n\"It's tough losing on the road. It's tough losing by one possession,\" Rodgers said. \"Obviously I'm frustrated, and not just by the last throw, but some other stuff that we could have done better out there. I still believe we have a lot to play for.\"\n\nGreen Bay's road woes continued in a 27-24 loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night. The Packers (4-5-1) had leads of 14-3 and 21-17, only to see Wilson throw a 15-yard TD pass to Ed Dickson with 5:08 remaining to give Seattle the lead for good.\n\nThe Packers still had a chance to get out of Seattle with its first win here since 2008, yet their final possession lasted all of three plays. And it was the last pass by Rodgers that seemed to baffle everyone.\n\nFacing third-and-2 at its own 33, Rodgers called a quick pass to the flat for Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Except the pass never got there. It hopped in front of the intended receiver, and instead of going for it on fourth down, Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy opted to punt with more than 4 minutes remaining and the Packers still having one timeout.\n\nThe decision backfired. Green Bay never saw the ball again, instead forced to watch Wilson kneel three times to run out the clock.\n\nRodgers said the pass for Valdes-Scantling \"stuck\" in his hand and guessed he could make that throw 100 times and that wouldn't happen again.\n\n\"We beat ourselves in the second half,\" Rodgers said. \"We kind of moved the ball at will in the first half.\"\n\nGreen Bay's problems went well beyond that one bad throw by Rodgers and the decision to punt. Rodgers was sacked five times, four of those in the second half. Twice in the third quarter Green Bay was forced to punt after drives stalled at midfield. The Packers were 3 of 11 on third downs, 2 of 7 in the second half. A week after Aaron Jones rushed for a career-high 145 yards, the Packers had just 48 yards rushing and Jones finished with 40.\n\nGreen Bay is 0-5 on the road this season and has lost seven straight road games dating to last year.\n\n\"I think it kind of went the way we thought it would go. When you're playing in this environment, particularly when you're on the road up here. There's a high tendency for big-momentum plays, big swings, and I think that definitely held true,\" McCarthy said. \"They made more big plays than we did. ... We've got to finish games better, especially in the fourth quarter, and especially on the road.\"\n\nRodgers finished with 332 yards passing and his TD throw to Robert Tonyan in the first quarter, and his 57-yard strike to Davante Adams in the fourth quarter showed again the greatness of his arm. But Rodgers had 214 yards at halftime and Seattle was able to pressure Rodgers enough in the second half to disrupt Green Bay's passing attack.\n\nInjuries certainly didn't help either. Green Bay was already down four starters before the first snaps with cornerback Kevin King, safety Kentrell Brice, linebacker Nick Perry and wide receiver Randall Cobb all out due to injuries. They lost two more in the first half when Bashaud Breeland \u2014 starting for King \u2014 aggravated a groin injury and Jimmy Graham injured his thumb. Graham had a 13-yard reception on Green Bay's first offensive play in his return to Seattle, but that was his only catch.\n\nMike Daniels suffered a foot injury early in the second half and backup safety Raven Greene suffered an ankle injury. Neither returned. If there's an upside to the loss, it's Green Bay getting extra rest before facing Minnesota in a must-win game next week.\n\n\"We have a number of opportunities where our record would be very different right now, unfortunately, that's the way it's played out,\" Clay Matthews said. \"We've set ourselves up for a pretty good second half, we just have to get back to work. We have no other option. On to Minnesota after a couple days rest.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The previous record by a living artist was set by Jeff Koons' \"Balloon Dog,\" which sold for $58.4 million in 2013.\n\nThe 1972 painting by Hockney, now 81, is \"the holy grail of his paintings, from both the historical and the market perspectives,\" Alex Rotter, co-chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, said in September. He noted that it reflects both the European and the American perspectives of an artist who came to live in sunny California in the '60s, and saw himself as living on both continents.\n\n\"It has all the elements that you would want in a Hockney painting,\" Rotter said in an interview. He noted that writers have referred to the swimming pool as being sort of a self-portrait of Hockney, though he never confirmed that, just saying he was fascinated to paint moving water.\n\nMore: Modigliani painting fetches $157 million at Manhattan auction\n\nRelated: Buyer goes ahead with $1.4M purchase of shredded Banksy artwork\n\nThe painting, whose buyer was not immediately revealed, had been long held by a private collector.\n\nA depiction of two men \u2013 one swimming the breaststroke underwater, the other standing by the pool looking down \u2013 the painting was originally inspired, according to background provided by Christie's, by two photographs Hockney found juxtaposed on his studio floor, one of a swimmer in Hollywood in 1966, and another of a boy staring at something on the ground.\n\nThe rocky landscape is in southern France, and the standing figure is said to represent Peter Schlesinger, whom the artist met in 1966, when the younger man was a student in one of Hockney's art classes at UCLA. For the next five years, according to Christie's, he was both \"the great love of Hockney's life\" and one of his favorite models.\n\nThe relationship ended in 1971. Hockney had already begun the painting and he abandoned it, starting again the following year.\n\nCLOSE Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you probably heard about the self-destructing Banksy painting that sold for $1.4 million at a live auction.

The latest update to the vote count gave Porter 51 percent and a 6,203-vote lead.\n\nPorter, 44, campaigned on an unabashed liberal agenda and in direct opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities: She advocates overturning his tax reform package, supports universal health care, and endorses mandatory background checks on all gun sales and a ban on so-called assault-style weapons.\n\nRelated: Kyrsten Sinema helped turn reliably red Arizona purple. Is it a midterm fluke or a new trend?\n\nMore: Trailing in tight election, Republican Rep. Mia Love sues to stop vote count in Utah\n\nShe said she was running \u201cto hold Donald Trump and the powerful special interests in Washington accountable.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Porter said she will \u201cbring accountability back to Washington.\u201d She promised to protect health care and the environment and fight for a tax system in which \u201ceveryone pays their fair share.\u201d\n\nA political newcomer, Porter overcame considerable odds. The district has a 7-point Republican registration edge, and Walters was re-elected in 2016 by 17 points, even though Hillary Clinton carried the district by 5 points in 2016.\n\nThe heavily suburban district was one of seven targeted by California Democrats after Clinton won them two years ago.\n\nWith Porter\u2019s win, Democrats have picked off three GOP seats either all or partly in Orange County, and they are threatening to win another district where votes continue to be counted.\n\nIf Democrat Gil Cisneros wins that undecided race against Republican Young Kim in the 39th District where GOP Rep. Ed Royce is retiring, the county once considered Republican holy ground won\u2019t have a GOP representative in Congress.\n\nIn returns Thursday, Cisneros climbed into a 941-vote lead after Kim held the early lead.\n\nEarlier, Democrat Mike Levin captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county, and Democrat Harley Rouda ousted 15-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in the county\u2019s coastal 48th District. Democrats also seized GOP-held seats north of Los Angeles and in the agricultural Central Valley.\n\nWith Porter\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 44-9 edge in California U.S. House seats. They hold every statewide office, a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7-million advantage in voter registration.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/election-2018-democrats-flip-another-house-seat-california/2021499002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "UC Irvine beats Santa Clara 61-49", "description": "Collin Welp scored 12, Eyassu Worku and Max Hazzard added 11 points each, and UC Irvine used a second-half surge to beat Santa Clara 61-49", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/16/uc-irvine-beats-santa-clara-61-49/38541013/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:30:58Z", "content": "SANTA CLARA, Calif.

Brodie during the first period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018, in Calgary, Alberta. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCALGARY, Alberta (AP) \u2014 In a duel of struggling goaltenders, one returned to vintage form, while the misery continued for the other.\n\nCarey Price backstopped the Montreal Canadiens to a 3-2 win over Mike Smith and the Calgary Flames on Thursday night, despite the visitors being outshot 45-22.\n\n\"He's the best goalie in the world,\" said Artturi Lehkonen, who scored the game-winner in the third period. \"He was outstanding in the net. He was a big key as to why we won.\"\n\nLehkonen's first goal in 18 games, dating back to the season-opener, came on a harmless-looking 40-foot wrist shot from off the wing that leaked through Smith's pads.\n\n\"Bad goal, bad timing,\" said Smith, who fell to 5-7-1.\n\nSmith's save percentage dropped to .876 on the season, which ranks 49th out of 50 goaltenders who have played six-or-more games.\n\n\"When you feel like you've let your team down, that's probably the biggest frustration/disappointment that can ever happen in your career,\" said the 36-year-old. \"Our team played such a great game tonight and deserved a much better fate. When something happens like that and it's on you, it's obviously disappointing.\"\n\nIt has been a tough year for Price, too, who entered the night with an .892 save percentage. Price found himself on the bench the last two games after giving up 11 goals on 63 shots in his previous two starts.\n\nBut he was back in form against Calgary.\n\n\"Just trying to stop the puck and try to read plays well and let them hit you when they come,\" said Price, who improved to 6-4-3.\n\nPrice stopped all thirteen shots he faced in the final frame as the Canadiens won for the third time when trailing after two periods.\n\n\"He's got his reputation as Carey Price, the best goalie in the world, for a reason and we have that confidence playing in front of him and I don't think anyone was ever worried,\" said Canadiens forward Brendan Gallagher.\n\nTomas Tatar and Jonathan Drouin also scored for Montreal (10-6-3), which has split the opening two games of its three-game Western Canada road trip. The Canadiens play in Vancouver on Saturday.\n\nMax Domi had an assist for the Canadiens to extend his point streak to eight games (5-7-12).\n\nMatthew Tkachuk scored both goals for Calgary (10-8-1). Tkachuk's eighth and ninth markers of the season put him at a team-best 21 points on the season. Mark Giordano had two assists. The Flames' four-game homestand continues Saturday when they are host to the Edmonton Oilers.\n\n\"Very, very tough,\" said Tkachuk, about the setback. \"It's one of those where you don't want a third period like that, especially when you're up 2-1 in your building.\"\n\nMontreal tied the game 2-2 at 8:32 of the third. After a scramble in front of the net, Smith kicked out his pad to stop Andrew Shaw's backhander, but Drouin was right there to slide in the rebound.\n\n\"Carey stood tall in net and gave us a chance after two periods to still be in the game,\" said Canadiens coach Claude Julien. \"I liked the way we came out in the third. Finally we talked about it, starting to play on our toes again like we had been when things are going well.\"\n\nThe Canadiens opened the scoring eight minutes into the first on another shaky one as Tatar's shot from the slot deflected off Smith's upper body and went into the net.\n\n\"We all have bad days at work sometimes,\" said Flames defenseman Travis Hamonic, when asked about his goaltender. \"We battle as a team. We win and lose as a team. It's never on one player.\"\n\nComing on the fifth shot Smith faced, it was the 10th time in 13 starts that he has surrendered a goal on one of the first six shots.\n\nNotes: Flames forward Dillon Dube (upper body) is back practicing and is nearing a return. He has missed four games. ...

(David Hockney/Courtesy of Christie's Images LTD via AP) ORG XMIT: NYR106 (Photo: David Hockney via AP)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 A painting by the British artist David Hockney has fetched $90.3 million at Christie's on Thursday night, easily breaking the record for a work by a living artist sold at auction.\n\nAmong his famous \"pool paintings,\" ''Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures)\" is considered one of his premier works. The previous record by a living artist was set by Jeff Koons' \"Balloon Dog,\" which sold for $58.4 million in 2013.\n\nThe 1972 painting by Hockney, now 81, is \"the holy grail of his paintings, from both the historical and the market perspectives,\" Alex Rotter, co-chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, said in September. He noted that it reflects both the European and the American perspectives of an artist who came to live in sunny California in the '60s, and saw himself as living on both continents.\n\n\"It has all the elements that you would want in a Hockney painting,\" Rotter said in an interview. He noted that writers have referred to the swimming pool as being sort of a self-portrait of Hockney, though he never confirmed that, just saying he was fascinated to paint moving water.\n\nMore: Modigliani painting fetches $157 million at Manhattan auction\n\nRelated: Buyer goes ahead with $1.4M purchase of shredded Banksy artwork\n\nThe painting, whose buyer was not immediately revealed, had been long held by a private collector.\n\nA depiction of two men \u2013 one swimming the breaststroke underwater, the other standing by the pool looking down \u2013 the painting was originally inspired, according to background provided by Christie's, by two photographs Hockney found juxtaposed on his studio floor, one of a swimmer in Hollywood in 1966, and another of a boy staring at something on the ground.\n\nThe rocky landscape is in southern France, and the standing figure is said to represent Peter Schlesinger, whom the artist met in 1966, when the younger man was a student in one of Hockney's art classes at UCLA. For the next five years, according to Christie's, he was both \"the great love of Hockney's life\" and one of his favorite models.\n\nThe relationship ended in 1971. Hockney had already begun the painting and he abandoned it, starting again the following year.\n\nCLOSE Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you probably heard about the self-destructing Banksy painting that sold for $1.4 million at a live auction.

Jalen Coleman-Lands and Strus then each made one of two free throws for a 72-68 advantage.\n\nThe big story, though, was the defense, which held Penn State to 0-for-6 shooting in OT.\n\nDePaul got off to a miserable start, committing turnovers on its first six possessions to fall behind 11-0. The Blue Demons didn't manage to get off a shot until nearly four minutes had expired and didn't score until a basket by Femi Olujobi with 15:46 left in the first half.\n\nBut things suddenly started clicking offensively behind Cage, who had 12 first-half points and scored 10 straight DePaul points at one point. Cage's 3-point play with 4:21 to go gave the Blue Demons a 28-26 lead, their first of the game.\n\nDePaul had a 36-31 halftime advantage.\n\nA Strus 3-point play \u2014 he was fouled on an alley-oop dunk \u2014 gave DePaul a 63-53 lead, its biggest of the game. The Blue Demons still were up 68-60 with two minutes remaining, but Penn State ran off eight straight points to tie the score at 68 with 26.1 seconds to go.\n\nStevens, though, had a chance to give the Nittany Lions the lead after tying the game with the first of two free throws, but he missed the second and the game went to overtime.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nPenn State: Despite taking an 11-0 lead, the Nittany Lions didn't take full advantage of DePaul's struggles at the start. Cold shooting in the first half then caused the lead to vanish completely.\n\nDePaul: After season-opening wins against Bethune-Cookman and Morgan State, the Blue Demons seemed overwhelmed by the step up in class at first, but quickly responded.

Everyone has a game like tonight. It's frustrating when you have to speak to effort and this wasn't any fun. Tonight we didn't have it for some reason.

It was the most points scored in the first two quarters this season by the Nuggets, who forced the Hawks into 10 turnovers in that span, eight by steals.\n\nMillsap, who spent four seasons with the Hawks before coming to Denver as a free agent two years ago, was at the center of the defensive effort, getting all four of his steals in the first half.\n\nThe Nuggets surpassed the century mark on a three-point play by Millsap for a 101-68 lead with 3:11 left in the third quarter. By the start of the fourth quarter, the Nuggets were up by 36 points and substituting freely.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHawks: F Taurean Prince was held out of the game because of Achilles tendon soreness. \"After shootaround, he just didn't feel comfortable testing it out tonight, so a night of rest,\" Pierce said.\n\nNuggets: The previous high for points in the first half was 68 against the Sacramento Kings on Oct. 23. ...

(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 After a shaky beginning, Russell Wilson got hot in the fourth quarter, Bobby Wagner and Seattle's defense stymied Aaron Rodgers and the Seahawks stayed in the middle of the NFC playoff race.\n\n\"We've been through so much throughout this season it was time to get over the hump,\" Wagner said. \"We've been down, we've been up, we've lost close games, we've won close games. It was time.\"\n\nWilson threw for 225 yards and his 15-yard touchdown pass to Ed Dickson with 5:08 left was the difference in the Seahawks' 27-24 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Thursday night.\n\nIn a key matchup in the battle for the two NFC wild-card spots, Seattle (5-5) snapped a two-game losing streak by overcoming an early 14-3 deficit. Wilson was inconsistent at times early, but was outstanding in the fourth quarter, capping the winning drive by recognizing a blitz and hitting Dickson quickly for his second TD pass of the night.\n\n\"I thought that whole drive was pretty exceptional. ... When it came down to it, third-down, you've got to win in the red-zone and we were pretty clutch in the red-zone there at the end of the game,\" Wilson said.\n\nSeattle still has not lost three straight games since the middle of the 2011 season and the Seahawks finally closed out a one-score victory after consecutive close losses to the Chargers and Rams. Seattle was 1-8 in its previous nine games decided by one score.\n\nRodgers had a huge first half and threw for 332 yards, but the Packers (4-5-1) had just one scoring drive in the second half, helped by a 57-yard strike from Rodgers to Davante Adams. Rodgers threw a pair of touchdown passes in the first half, but never got the ball back after Green Bay punted with 4:20 left. Seattle got first-down runs from Wilson and Mike Davis and finished the game kneeling three times.\n\n\"It was definitely consideration, but with the one time out and the clock stopped at two minutes, we played the numbers,\" Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said.\n\nChris Carson rushed for 83 yards and a touchdown, overcoming the mistake of fumbling on the first play of the game and setting up Green Bay's opening score. Tyler Lockett had two key receptions late in the fourth quarter and Doug Baldwin had his first TD catch of the season for Seattle.\n\nRodgers was 21-of-30 passing with 10 of those going to Adams for 166 yards receiving. Backup tight end Robert Tonyan had the first catch of his career go for a 54-yard touchdown to give Green Bay an early 14-3 lead. The Packers led 21-17 at halftime after Aaron Jones caught a 24-yard TD pass from Rodgers in the final minute of the half, but Green Bay's offense was stymied in the second half.\n\n\"Of course there's hope. Of course we believe in each other,\" Rodgers said. \"It's just going to take one galvanizing moment, whether that's a speech or a practice or something happens in the game, something's got to get this thing going.\"\n\nJones finished with 40 yards rushing after going for a career-high 145 a week ago. Rodgers was sacked five times, four of those in the second half. The Packers gained just 114 yards in the second half, half coming on the one throw from Rodgers to Adams. That pass set up Mason Crosby's 36-yard field goal with 8:23 left to give Green Bay a 24-20 lead.\n\nWilson had one more answer. Wilson hit Lockett on consecutive plays for 18 yards \u2014 to convert a third-down \u2014 and 34 yards to the Green Bay 16. Two plays later, facing another third-and-long, Wilson recognized the blitz and hit Dickson quickly over the middle to put Seattle in front.\n\nThat proved to be enough. On Green Bay's next drive, Rodgers short-hopped a pass on third-and-2.\n\n\"The ball just stuck to my hand and went in the dirt,\" Rodgers said. \"Frustrating obviously, I can do that a hundred times and probably not do that again.\n\nRather than going for it on fourth-down, Green Bay punted and never got the ball back.\n\n\"I have faith in this team so I'm going to be an aggressive caller and go for it and say that we'll get it, but at the same time, you have to be realistic and I agree with coaches call 100 percent put it back on the defense,\" Adams said. \"It was tough, they have a great running game, they made a play and that's how it unfolded.\"\n\nINJURIES\n\nGreen Bay was down four starters with CB Kevin King, S Kentrell Brice, LB Nick Perry and WR Randall Cobb all out due to injuries. They lost two more in the first half when Bashaud Breeland \u2014 starting for King \u2014 aggravated a groin injury and Jimmy Graham injured his thumb. Graham had a 13-yard reception on Green Bay's first offensive play in his return to Seattle, but that was his only catch.\n\nMike Daniels suffered a foot injury early in the second half and backup safety Raven Greene suffered an ankle injury. Neither returned.\n\nROAD WOES\n\nThe Packers dropped to 0-5 on the road this season and have lost seven straight away from Lambeau Field dating to last season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPackers: At Minnesota on Nov. 25.\n\nSeahawks: At Carolina on Nov. 25.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Wilson had sought $5 million ($7 million AUD) in damages.\n\nBut this June the amount was reduced by 90 percent after the magazine's publishers, Bauer Media, appealed. Victoria's Court of Appeal said Wilson could not prove economic loss, or that she'd missed out on film contracts as a result of the articles. The court ordered the actress to pay back almost $3 million ($4.1 million AUD), and 80 percent of Bauer's legal costs.\n\nRelated: Rebel Wilson's record Australian defamation payout severely slashed\n\nWilson's lawyers on Friday sought leave to appeal against the reduction in the High Court \u2013 Australia's highest judicial body \u2013 but the application was refused.\n\nWilson, who sat in the front row of the public gallery during the brief hearing, said outside the court she was glad the process had been brought to an end. She continued her thoughts on Twitter, reflecting on her \"long journey in the Australian courts these past few years.\"\n\n\"I am glad the matter is now at a definite end.

It was the four turnovers.\n\n\"But 14 and four is pretty good,\" Robinson said. \"I can't be turning the ball over. I knew I had more turnovers than I wanted to.\"\n\nBOOST FOR LATER\n\n\"A good win for us, and they'll be a high RPI team, so that's good.

He had eight points on 4-of-10 shooting and six rebounds but the 6-foot-8 post appeared to get winded while playing 21 minutes.\n\n\"Nate's going to get better and better,\" Hutson said. \"Eight points and six rebounds in 21 minutes is not bad.\"\n\nPAST FOES\n\nTCU and Fresno State were in the WAC together from 1997-2001.

New Jersey got its second road win in nine tries this season. The Devils have played eight of their last nine on the road.\n\n\"It's important to get back on the winning track,\" coach John Hynes said. \"It's important to put an end to that.\"\n\nPhiladelphia lost its second straight after Tuesday's 2-1 loss to Florida ended a six-game point streak.\n\nBesides Kinkaid's strong game, the Devils had fortune on their side. Philadelphia hit the goal post five times and had a goal disallowed.\n\n\"We did a lot of good things,\" Flyers captain Claude Giroux said. \"It's definitely frustrating.\"\n\nKinkaid maintained a one-goal lead through the second period when he used his glove to stop Jakub Voracek twice in the final 56.1 seconds. The goalie almost gifted Philadelphia a goal with just over three minutes left when he turned it over from behind the net to Wayne Simmonds right in front. Kinkaid recovered to get his stick on Simmonds' attempt.\n\nThe shutout was Kinkaid's third of the season and seventh of his career.\n\n\"That's the way we have to play on the road,\" Kinkaid said. \"We battled hard.\"\n\nAnderson's goal 2:45 into the contest was the only one until Palmieri's wraparound tally with 6:08 remaining. Coleman's shot into an empty net finished the scoring with 3:02 left.\n\nFlyers goalie Brian Elliott appeared to suffer a lower body injury on the play. He was replaced by backup Calvin Pickard.\n\nFlyers coach Dave Hakstol said the team would learn more Friday about the extent of Elliott's injury.\n\nAnderson staked New Jersey to a 1-0 lead by finishing a tic-tac-toe passing attack with a hard wrist shot from the slot that got past Elliott's left pad. A rookie, Anderson recorded his first career goal after pretty assists from Coleman and Brett Seney.\n\n\"Nice for him to be able to get his first goal,\" Hynes said. \"He's played really well and really fits how we want to play.\"\n\nThe Flyers hit the goal post on four shots and had a goal disallowed in the first. Shayne Gostisbehere's apparent equalizer five minutes after Anderson's goal was nixed due to goalie interference when James van Riemsdyk bumped Kinkaid. The officials' on-ice call was upheld after a video review.\n\nHakstol said he wasn't displeased with Philadelphia's effort.\n\n\"We created enough, and then some, to score goals,\" he said. \"I like the way we played.\"\n\nPhiladelphia welcomed its big offseason acquisition, van Riemsdyk, back to the ice. The forward had been out since injuring his knee in the second game of the season.\n\nNotes: Flyers D Radko Gudas (illness) was a late scratch.

And that\u2019s just a real chilling, chilling effect on victims who are complaining under the Title IX processes the university has set up.\u201d\n\nTim Doty, a Purdue spokesman, said Wednesday that university officials had not been served with the lawsuit. On Thursday, he released a statement:\n\nTo the extent the case challenges the university\u2019s handling of complaints under our anti-harassment policy and procedures, we stand by our commitment to provide a safe and secure environment for all members of our community.\n\n\n\nThese are often difficult matters to investigate and decide, but we are confident in our processes and believe they afford all students with broad and appropriate protections, whether they are raising allegations of sexual misconduct or responding to them.\n\n\n\nFair application of our policy necessarily entails ensuring all parties participate in the process in good faith by providing truthful information to assist the university in making its determinations.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims the women didn\u2019t know each other and that their reports of sexual assaults were not related. The suit also claims the reports about sexual assault were made about different men.\n\nMacey declined to answer questions about how they wound up in the same lawsuit.\n\nMacey said the women, now 20 and 21, were treated \u201cas if they were the accused harassers\u201d by investigators who \u201cmade discriminatory assumptions\u201d about their behavior while dealing out smaller punishments to the men in each case.\n\n\u25ba Nov. 15: Trump administration creates new in-flight sexual misconduct task force\n\n\u25ba Oct. 23: Will #MeToo finally make us question violence against women on TV?\n\nHere are the particulars, as claimed in the lawsuit:\n\n\u2022 Doe, a freshman at the time, reported on Oct. 10, 2017, to the Purdue University Police Department that she\u2019d been assaulted in her residence hall room by a male student who had already landed on the university\u2019s persona non grata list, banned from campus \u201cbecause of his conduct directed against a different female student.\u201d\n\nThe suit claims the Purdue police reported the incident to the university, which launched its own investigation. The suit does not say why Purdue police turned the investigation over to the university.\n\nThe suit claims Doe spoke with a university investigator at the start, but then quit participating. The investigation went on, according to the suit. The suit claims that the investigation turned, treating Doe \u2013 without her knowledge \u2013 as the target.\n\n\u25ba Oct. 13: 19 million tweets later: A look at #MeToo a year after hashtag went viral\n\n\u25ba Sept. 21: Sex assault survivors risk lives, reputations to stand up to powerful men\n\n\u201cContrary to its own policy, defendants made credibility findings against Doe based on her decision to not participate in the investigation,\u201d the suit claims.\n\nThe university eventually alleged that Doe fabricated her account of the assault and expelled her, before reducing the punishment to a two-year suspension on Feb. 22, 2018.\n\n\u2022Roe, a junior at the time, said she was sexually assaulted April 17, 2017, in her dorm room after a male student walked her home from a party at a fraternity. The suit claims she was intoxicated and incapable of giving consent for sexual intercourse. The suit claims the man sexually assaulted her, making audio recordings of what was happening.\n\nThe suit says Roe became concerned about what might have happened the night before when she discovered bruising on her neck after going to class the next day. That\u2019s when she sought medical treatment and reported the incident to the university. After Purdue investigated, the suit said, Roe was accused of reporting the assault maliciously and expelled her. Her expulsion also was reduced to a two-year suspension on Oct. 17, after she appealed.\n\nThe suit claims that when Purdue found out that the fraternity member in Roe\u2019s case had recorded her without her consent, it assigned him a 10-page paper as a punishment. The topic of the paper was not mentioned.\n\nMacey said the initial intent of the lawsuit is to get the two women reinstated at Purdue.\n\n\u201cThis has really derailed their education careers,\u201d Macey said.\n\nBeyond that, he said, Purdue should be on notice about how it handles sexual assault investigations.\n\n\u25ba June 20: Woman who lied about rape at Michigan college sentenced to jail\n\n\u25ba Dec. 6: Purdue failed to 'adequately respond' to sexual assault\n\n\u201cJust because Purdue doesn\u2019t believe you doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve maliciously set out to harm somebody, which is my understanding of what the standard is for expulsion,\u201d Macey said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a situation where you have someone risking their academic career to even raise a complaint. And it appears Purdue\u2019s moved in that direction.

Anderson denied Rasmussen's attempt to go through the leg pads.\n\n\"You'd have to go back in the record books to see how many times that's happened,\" Anderson said. \"It's one of those things.

(AP) \u2014 A date with road-weary Vancouver came at the right time for the Minnesota Wild.\n\nMikko Koivu had a goal and two assists, and the Wild rebounded from a recent hiccup by beating the Canucks 6-2 on Thursday night.\n\nEric Staal and Matt Dumba had a goal and an assist, and Charlie Coyle, Nino Niederreiter and Jason Zucker also scored for the Wild, who had a season high in goals. Ryan Suter had two assists, and Devan Dubnyk made 25 saves. Minnesota has won four of five and 11 of 14.\n\nMinnesota, which ended seven-game trip Sunday with five wins, was not sharp Tuesday in a 5-2 loss to Washington.\n\n\"We want to be great at home. Obviously, the way the Caps beat us was definitely not fun. We made sure we came out strong and prove ourselves and go right back on track,\" Niederreiter said.\n\nMinnesota is 6-1-2 at Xcel Energy Center this season. It is 22-3-8 on home ice since Dec. 27, 2017.\n\n\"I didn't think we were at the top of our game, but I think they looked very tired like they were wanting to get home,\" said Wild coach Bruce Boudreau.\n\nThe Canucks were at the end of their second six-game trip of the season and started a netminder who hadn't played in the NHL in more than 19 months.\n\nBo Horvat and Markus Granlund scored for Vancouver, which has lost three straight in regulation. The Canucks have played a league-high 14 road games, double their number of home contests.\n\nKoivu, who assisted on Minnesota's opening goal, scored one of the easiest goals of his 14-year career on the power play to make it 2-0 less than eight minutes into the game. Canucks goalie Richard Bachman passed from behind his net directly to Koivu feet from an empty net.\n\n\"It happens sometimes, and mistakes are a part of the game,\" said Koivu, who has 10 points, including two goals, in his last six games. \"I'm sure he'd like to get that one back.\"\n\n\"I just fanned on it,\" Bachman said. \"Most times I'll get those up, out and down the ice. ... Maybe I was overthinking just a little because it had been awhile.\"\n\nBachman, who played last season and the start of this season with AHL Utica, was in goal for Vancouver for the first time since April 9, 2017. He made 23 saves.\n\nJacob Markstrom started the nine previous games, Anders Nilsson remains out with a fractured finger and top prospect Thatcher Demko is out with post-concussion symptoms. Nilsson took some shots during morning skate but has not been medically cleared to play.\n\nWith Vancouver's spotty defense, Bachman was forced to make sprawling saves, and a couple other pucks trickled just wide, especially late in the first.\n\n\"It was the players in front of him who let him down tonight,\" said defenseman Michael Del Zotto.\n\nOn the power play, Niederreiter redirected Koivu's pass 1:46 into the second for a 3-0 lead.\n\nHorvat got the Canucks within 3-1 with a power-play goal later in the period, but Staal scored on a wraparound 36 seconds later to restore the three-goal lead.\n\nDumba's shot from the blue line beat a screened Bachman late in the period. It was his seventh goal of the season, one behind Toronto's Morgan Rielly for the league high by a defenseman.\n\n\"I've got a couple greasy ones and guys are just doing a good job of getting to the net kind of like tonight. From the parking lot, and it still found a way it,\" he said.\n\nNOTES: Wild LW Zach Parise missed the game with an illness. C Matt Hendricks, who's missed 11 of 12 games with a lower-body injury, returned. ... Minnesota is tied with Ottawa with a league-best 17 goals scored by defensemen. ... Horvat leads the Canucks with 18 points, including 10 goals. ...

(Photo: Chris Carlson/Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Democrat Katie Porter captured a Republican-held U.S. House seat Thursday in the heart of what once was Southern California\u2019s Reagan country, extending a rout of the state\u2019s GOP House delegation that might not be over.\n\nPorter\u2019s upset in Orange County is a sign of changing times in a region once known nationally as a GOP fortress. The coastal county southeast of Los Angeles was home to President Richard Nixon, and President Ronald Reagan once likened it to a Republican heaven.\n\nPorter, a law professor and protege of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, defeated Republican Rep. Mimi Walters, who was re-elected in a walkover just two years ago in the 45th District. The latest update to the vote count gave Porter 51 percent and a 6,203-vote lead.\n\nPorter, 44, campaigned on an unabashed liberal agenda and in direct opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities: She advocates overturning his tax reform package, supports universal health care, and endorses mandatory background checks on all gun sales and a ban on so-called assault-style weapons.\n\nRelated: Kyrsten Sinema helped turn reliably red Arizona purple. Is it a midterm fluke or a new trend?\n\nMore: Trailing in tight election, Republican Rep. Mia Love sues to stop vote count in Utah\n\nShe said she was running \u201cto hold Donald Trump and the powerful special interests in Washington accountable.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Porter said she will \u201cbring accountability back to Washington.\u201d She promised to protect health care and the environment and fight for a tax system in which \u201ceveryone pays their fair share.\u201d\n\nA political newcomer, Porter overcame considerable odds. The district has a 7-point Republican registration edge, and Walters was re-elected in 2016 by 17 points, even though Hillary Clinton carried the district by 5 points in 2016.\n\nThe heavily suburban district was one of seven targeted by California Democrats after Clinton won them two years ago.\n\nWith Porter\u2019s win, Democrats have picked off three GOP seats either all or partly in Orange County, and they are threatening to win another district where votes continue to be counted.\n\nIf Democrat Gil Cisneros wins that undecided race against Republican Young Kim in the 39th District where GOP Rep. Ed Royce is retiring, the county once considered Republican holy ground won\u2019t have a GOP representative in Congress.\n\nIn returns Thursday, Cisneros climbed into a 941-vote lead after Kim held the early lead.\n\nEarlier, Democrat Mike Levin captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county, and Democrat Harley Rouda ousted 15-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in the county\u2019s coastal 48th District. Democrats also seized GOP-held seats north of Los Angeles and in the agricultural Central Valley.\n\nWith Porter\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 44-9 edge in California U.S. House seats. They hold every statewide office, a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7-million advantage in voter registration.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/15/election-2018-democrats-flip-another-house-seat-california/2021499002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Time, Time Sports, Time", "title": "Rockets will part ways with Carmelo after 10 games", "description": "Carmelo Anthony's brief time with the Houston Rockets is over, with the team announcing Thursday that it is working to part ways after signing Anthony as a free agent this summer.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/nba/rockets/2018/11/15/rockets-part-ways-carmelo-after-10-games/38539845/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5967671149001_5967676205001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T03:42:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Harden scores 27 as Rockets rout Warriors 107-86", "description": "James Harden scored 27 points to lead five players in double figures and the Houston Rockets routed the Golden State Warriors 107-86 on Thursday night", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/11/15/harden-scores-27-as-rockets-rout-warriors-107-86/38540425/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/721f274b7f70aa5b3c0359f79c7dda1bad7d7792/c=0-1875-4000-4125/local/-/media/2018/11/15/USATODAY/usatsports/9e725463b3f3442db30993191061bd7b.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T03:42:10Z", "content": "Golden State Warriors' Klay Thompson (11) drives toward the basket as Houston Rockets' Eric Gordon (10) and Gary Clark defend during the first half of an NBA basketball game Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018, in Houston.

(AP Photo/David J. Phillip) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 For a team with championship hopes, it seems a bit silly for the Houston Rockets to be happy about being .500.\n\nBut after the way they started the season, the Rockets took a moment to appreciate their recent progress after a rout of Golden State on Thursday night improved them to 7-7.\n\nJames Harden scored 27 points in Houston's 107-86 victory in a rematch of last season's Western Conference finals.\n\nThe Rockets, who announced before the game that they were \"parting ways\" with 10-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony, have won three straight and six of their last eight games after starting 1-5 to reach .500 for the first time since they were 1-1.\n\n\"I just told them: 'Congratulations, guys. We're .500. That's really good,'\" coach Mike D'Antoni said with a laugh.\n\nThen he got serious.\n\n\"This is a good step ... it's early but we do have the potential to be really good in different areas of the game and we've just got to keep building on it.\"\n\nThe Warriors, who got Draymond Green back from his suspension but were without Stephen Curry for the fourth straight game, have lost two of their last three. Curry has already been ruled out for Golden State's next two games because of a groin injury.\n\n\"We're banged up a little bit physically and right now we're banged up spiritually,\" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \"There's no getting around that. So we've got to fill up our cup and get our spirit back, get our energy back and we're going to. It's a long season and this is a tough stretch we're dealing with.\"\n\nHouston had a 13-point lead after three and opened the fourth quarter with a 12-2 run to make it 88-65 and spur Kerr to call a timeout. The Rockets then scored the first nine points after the timeout, with six from James Ennis, to make it 97-65 midway through the quarter and put the game out of reach. Both teams cleared their benches a couple of minutes after that.\n\nHarden likes the attitude the Rockets have shown in clawing back after their terrible start.\n\n\"Our spirit and just the way we're getting after it,\" Harden said. \"We're taking an individual challenge and the team challenge of guarding and offensively we're just sharing the basketball and obviously we're knocking down shots.\"\n\nKevin Durant had 20 points for the Warriors on a night they were just 4 of 18 on 3-pointers.\n\nGreen had five rebounds and five assists in his return from the one-game ban imposed by the team for a dustup with Durant in Monday night's overtime loss to the Clippers. Green addressed the situation for the first time after shootaround but did not apologize for his actions in the heated exchange.\n\nHe said he and Durant had spoken and that they were \"moving forward.\"\n\n\"I think there's no secret that I am an emotional player,\" he said. \"I wear my emotions on my sleeve. I play with that same emotion. Sometimes they get the best of me. And (if) it doesn't work to my favor I'm going to live with that.\"\n\nDurant was in no mood to discuss their relationship after the game, saying: \"Don't ask me about that again,\" before turning away from the reporter who posed the question.\n\nWhile the Warriors dealt with the drama between Green and Durant, the Rockets were left to answer questions about the decision to move on from Anthony.\n\nAnthony played just 10 games after signing a one-year, $2.4 million deal during the offseason.\n\n\"In the summer we tried to hit a home run and it didn't work out,\" D'Antoni said. \"He tried everything he could. He was great while he was here. It just didn't work out for whatever reason. I just thank him for his professionalism. It was good. He tried everything he could to make it work and it just didn't work out.\"\n\nThe Rockets opened the third quarter with a 7-2 run to stretch the lead to 54-43. Harden scored five straight points to make it 63-47 on his 3-pointer with about 5 1/2 minutes left in the quarter.\n\nGolden State got going after that, using an 8-2 spurt to get within 65-55 a couple of minutes later.\n\nGary Clark ended the run with a 3-pointer, and two more 3s by him within a minute of each other late in the third extended the lead to 76-59. It was 76-63 headed to the fourth.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWarriors: Curry was with the Warriors on the trip but it's unclear when he'll return. \"We're going to be very, very careful, and obviously he's going to need plenty of court time before he returns,\" Kerr said. \"When I say court time, I mean live action. He hasn't had that.\"... Kevon Looney scored a season-high 12 points.\n\nRockets: Gerald Green returned after missing the last two games with a sprained ankle. ... Ennis finished with 19 points and Eric Gordon had 17 off the bench. ... Houston made 16 of 47 3-pointers.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\nHouston's Chris Paul on the end of Anthony's time with the Rockets: \"For Melo it's all about just him being happy. So wherever that is or whatever's next he's going to figure it out.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWarriors: Visit Dallas on Saturday night.\n\nRockets: Host Sacramento on Saturday night.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Now the Utes seem to be turning a corner.\n\nUtah built a sustained rhythm on offense and defense for the better part of 40 minutes in a 98-63 victory over Mississippi Valley State on Thursday night. It wasn't just about getting stops or knocking down shots. The Utes did plenty of both at every important juncture.\n\n\"Guys are really gaining confidence,\" sophomore forward Donnie Tillman said. \"Dudes are learning plays and learning where to be defensively. One thing I'm proud of is our communication. Everyone was talking tonight.\"\n\nParker Van Dyke scored 16 points off the bench to lead Utah. Timmy Allen finished with 13 points, six rebounds, and three assists. Tillman tallied 12 points, nine rebounds and seven assists.\n\nThe Utes (2-1) have won 11 straight regular season nonconference home games dating back to the 2016-17 season.\n\nDante Scott scored 16 points to lead the Delta Devils (0-4). Mississippi Valley State leading scorer Jordan Evans scored just two points after going 0 of 11 from the field. Evans averaged 19.0 points over his first three games.\n\nUtah wasted no time putting Mississippi Valley State on its heels. Behind a 14-4 run, punctuated by back-to-back 3-pointers from Riley Battin and Van Dyke, the Utes carved out a 19-9 lead.\n\nThe Delta Devils cut the deficit in half on baskets from Michael Green and Aleska Koracin. They had a chance to make it a one-possession game, but Gregory Holloway missed an open layup. Vante Hendrix quickly answered by burying a transition 3-pointer on the other end. Tillman followed up with a long-distance basket of his own and then set up Van Dyke for a layup, pushing Utah's lead to 27-14.\n\nMississippi Valley State rallied a second time before halftime. The Delta Devils cut it to 37-30 on Emmanuel Ejeh's jumper. Utah scored baskets on six straight possessions as part of a 15-0 run. Battin and Van Dyke each contributed a pair of baskets to fuel the run. Once Van Dyke finished it off by driving for a layup, Utah led 52-30 with 1:21 remaining before halftime.\n\nFor Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak, the decisive spurt all started with his players embracing a defensive attitude and not letting shooting percentages dictate their effort.\n\n\"It's really in the details of executing, sharing the ball, having your defensive (mindset),\" Krystkowiak said. \"Sometimes you want to make a big picture out of it and try to figure out what took place, but it's just about winning that next possession.\"\n\nThe Utes shot 55.6 percent from the field in the first half \u2014 including 8 of 15 from 3-point range. Their hot shooting continued into the second half when they led by 20 points or more the entire way.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMississippi Valley State: For one half, the Delta Devils showed some tenacity and hung around with the Utes. Their inability to stop random quick spurts from the Utah offense finally caught up with them by halftime. Like other SWAC teams, plenty more tough games lie ahead before conference play.\n\nUtah: The Utes worked some kinks out of their offense with an easy win over an overmatched opponent after struggling with long scoring droughts against Minnesota earlier in the week. Utah will need offensive production to stay consistent if it hopes to make a splash at the Wooden Legacy tournament over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nPERIMETER ATTACK\n\nUtah tied a school record set in 2002 against UNLV by making 17 3-pointers. Reserve forward Brandon Morley helped the Utes match the record on the second of back-to-back 3-pointers with 2:13 left.\n\nThe Utes tried to break the record, but Brooks King misfired on a 3-point basket a minute later. It didn't sit well with Mississippi Valley State coach Andre Payne who stared down Krystkowiak in the final seconds. The Utah coach defended his decision, saying he wanted to give his end-of-the-bench players experience running the team's offense.\n\n\"It's no disrespect,\" Krystkowiak said. \"I explained myself to him. Those guys work too hard to get put in a game and have to come down and dribble it out.\"\n\nROCKY ROAD\n\nLike other SWAC teams, Mississippi Valley State counts on lengthy road trips to pay the bills. The Delta Devils opened the season with a five-game road swing and will close out nonconference play with another four-game road swing in December. They play 12 of their first 15 games on the road.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMississippi Valley State travels to Robert Morris on Saturday to conclude a five-game road trip.\n\nUtah plays against Hawaii in the opening round of the Wooden Legacy on Thursday November, 22nd.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Mississippi State led just 35-28 at halftime after Lamar forced 12 turnovers, including 10 steals.\n\nThe Bulldogs (3-0) responded by scoring 69 points in the second half and taking better care of the ball.\n\n\"I'm very pleased with the second half and extremely disappointed with the first half,\" Schaefer said. \"We just turned it over too much. 20 turnovers is way too big a number. We've got to learn to take care of the ball better.\"\n\nLamar's good start didn't last as Mississippi State's depth slowly wore the Cardinals down. Mississippi State had five different players score in double figures, led by Anriel Howard and Teaira McCowan, who both had double-doubles.\n\nFor Howard, it was her best night as a Bulldog. The graduate transfer from Texas A&M poured in 24 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nHoward scored 21 of those points in the second half on 8 of 11 shooting from the field.\n\n\"I think the first quarter I didn't come out aggressive on offense like I could have,\" Howard said. \"I felt like I had to help out a little bit more.\"\n\nMcCowan had 11 points and 16 rebounds for her ninth-straight double-double dating back to last season.\n\nThe Cardinals (3-1) were led by Chastadie Barrs who had 16 points and four steals, but lost the rebounding battle 64-32.\n\nLamar's defense was impressive, especially in the first half. The Cardinals led the nation in steals a year ago, and their 14 steals were the most the Bulldogs have allowed since 2015.\n\n\"I think that we played really well for the first two quarters but we played a really good team and the wheels came off in the second half,\" Lamar coach Robin Harmony said. \"They got to the cup the entire time in the second half and they made their shots.\"\n\nAfter leading 35-28 at halftime, the Bulldogs had a 42-15 advantage in the third quarter that included an 18-0 run.\n\nFRESHMAN SHINES\n\nWith McCowan in foul trouble in the second half, freshman center Jessika Carter stepped up for the Bulldogs.\n\nThe Georgia native had 10 points, eight rebounds and four blocks in 18 minutes, all career highs.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLamar: The nation's leader in steals the last two seasons, the Cardinals were especially tough to deal with for the Bulldogs through two quarters. But a halftime adjustment and the size and skill of Mississippi State proved too tough.\n\nMississippi State: For the second time in as many home games, the Bulldogs were sloppy in the opening minutes. As rough as it was in the first half, the second half showed the quality depth that this team possesses as five players scored in double figures. Jordan Danberry scored 15 points, Chloe Bibby had 11 points and Carter added 10.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMississippi State hosts Coppin State on Sunday.\n\nLamar hosts LeTourneau on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And sure enough, once we got one, the flood gates opened up for us.\"\n\nKorpisalo, starting in place of Sergei Bobrovsky, stopped 38 shots. Along with Bobrovsky, forwards Artemi Panarin and Riley Nash were sidelined with an unspecified illness.\n\nMarkus Hannikainen broke a 3-3 tie for Columbus early in the third when he spun around and swept the puck past goalie Roberto Luongo from the edge of the blue paint. Anthony Duclair and Josh Anderson followed with breakaway scores, and Boone Jenner added an empty-netter to seal it.\n\nColumbus picked up a point in its sixth straight game (4-0-2) and is in first place in the Metropolitan Division. Its goals came from seven players.\n\n\"Good first period then we let off the gas,\" said Florida forward Mike Hoffman, who broke a franchise record with a point in his 14th straight game, a primary assist on a first-period goal by Aaron Ekblad . \"They came back in the second and got a couple on us, and we were never able to recover from that point. They kept pace in the third period and really sealed the deal.\"\n\nDuclair, Jenner, Brandon Dubinsky and Pierre Luc-Dubois also had a goal and assist each for Columbus (11-6-2).\n\nLuongo had 30 saves, and Nick Bjugstad and Keith Yandle also scored for the Panthers (7-6-3).\n\nBjugstad got credit for the opening goal 1:44 into the game when he deflected in a long shot from the left point by Mike Matheson. Ekblad tapped in the second goal five minutes later on a power play.\n\nAtkinson made it 2-1 with a short-handed goal 28 seconds into the period , taking a pass from Alexander Wennberg on a rush after a Florida turnover. Dubinsky evened the score a few minutes later when batted a shot between Luongo's pads.\n\nDubois gave Columbus the lead after Luongo ventured out of the crease to block a breakaway shot by Duclair. Dubois swooped in and knocked the puck in the net before the goalie could recover.\n\nYandle tied the game again later in the second on a power play when he went between Korpisalo's pads with a shot from the high slot before Columbus cracked it open in the third.\n\n\"We had a lot of guys that just had off games,\" Florida coach Bob Boughner said. \"I'm going to chalk it up to that. I'm not going to spend a lot of time dissecting this game.\"\n\nNOTES: Columbus coach John Tortorella also was feeling sick and didn't take questions from the reporters after the game. ...

Compact-car sales fell 13.8 percent through October, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nU.S. Corolla sales fell 11.3 percent during that same period to 257,188\n\nAt the same time, sales of Toyota trucks and SUVs are surging. Still, the Corolla remains the brand's third-best-seller in the U.S. And it's the second-best-selling compact car in the industry, trailing only the Honda Civic.\n\nToyota has sold more than 45 million units of the Corolla globally since it was introduced in 1966.\n\n\"We\u2019re talking about a vehicle that\u2019s really important for the Toyota brand, and it's important for Toyota globally, not just in the U.S.,\" said IHS Markit auto analyst Stephanie Brinley.\n\nThursday night's reveal is the sedan version of the hatchback Corolla unveiled earlier this year.\n\nDesigners aimed for a lower, leaner look. Though the car has the same size wheelbase as its previous generation, its front overhang was shortened and its rear overhang was extended while total height and the hood were lowered.\n\nFascia design and lighting are varied based on the trim level. The SE and XSE grades are considered the sportier versions.\n\nThe vehicle gets an 8-inch touchscreen to control audio, navigation and apps, and physical controls for heat and air. It has Apple CarPlay compatibility and works with Amazon Alexa.\n\nThe L, LE and XLE grades get a 1.8-liter engine with unspecified horsepower. The XSE and SE grades get a 2-liter engine with 169 horsepower.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The Pittsburgh Penguins filled the penalty box in a hurry. Brayden Point loaded up the net with pucks at a rapid pace, too.\n\nPoint scored three straight power-play goals in 1:31 \u2014 the sixth-fastest three goals in NHL history \u2014 and the Lightning beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 on Thursday night.\n\n\"That's a first for me,\" Point said. \"They told me after the game, so it's pretty cool. Guys made good plays and I was able to score.\"\n\nBill Mosienko holds the record, scoring three times in 21 seconds for Chicago against New York in 1952. Point's 91-second burst was the first NHL hat trick of his career and the second-fastest three goals since 1967-68.\n\n\"It's great to see because he's such a hard worker and he plays the game the right way,\" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. \"You like to see those guys get rewarded and he was tonight.\"\n\nPittsburgh took three penalties in 10 seconds in the final minute of the first period. Point's first power-play goal came with 2.7 seconds left in the first. He scored twice in the first 1:28 of the second period, finishing two slick one-touch passing sequences with one-timers.\n\n\"I thought we moved the puck well,\" Point said. \"Obviously, 5-on-3s are pretty tough to defend, and I thought we weren't getting too cute with it. I thought we were making good plays to the net and shooting the puck.\"\n\nYanni Gourde also had a power-play goal, Nikita Kucherov added three assists, and backup goalie Louis Domingue made 28 saves to help the Lightning win for the fifth time in seven games. Starting goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy is out indefinitely after injuring a foot during practice Wednesday.\n\nPittsburgh star Sidney Crosby sat out after sustaining an upper-body injury Tuesday night at New Jersey. Coach Mike Sullivan confirmed the injury is not a concussion, and Crosby is considered day-to-day, but will likely miss a week.\n\nPatric Hornqvist scored twice for Pittsburgh, Phil Kessel also connected, Evgeni Malkin had two assists and Matt Murray stopped 22 shots. The Penguins have lost seven of eight following a four-game winning streak.\n\nPittsburgh committed eight penalties through two periods, which led to four Tampa Bay power-play goals.\n\n\"We put ourselves in a real tough spot at the end of the first period,\" Sullivan said. \"We have to find a way to get through that and we didn't get it done, so we have to be better.\"\n\nNewly acquired forward Tanner Pearson was in the lineup for Pittsburgh. The Penguins acquired Pearson from Los Angeles on Wednesday in exchange for Carl Hagelin in a roster shakeup. Pearson skated with Malkin and Hornqvist.\n\n\"Tanner is a guy that we think can help us offensively,\" Sullivan said. \"He's played with top players when he was in L.A. and we'd like to give him a decent look and see if he can develop some chemistry.\"\n\nThe teams combined to score the first five goals on power plays.\n\nHornqvist scored Pittsburgh's first power-play goal at home in seven games when he tipped Kessel's shot behind Domingue. Kessel gave Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead with a power-play goal later in the period.\n\nHornqvist's second goal tied it for Pittsburgh, but Gourde gave Tampa Bay the lead with the Lightning's fourth power-play goal of the game, a blocker-side slap shot from the top of the circle.\n\n\"Clearly special teams was a big part of this game,\" Cooper said. \"They got their chances and scored and we got ours and scored. The power play was huge for us tonight and gave us momentum.\"\n\nNOTES: Kucherov had his 200th NHL assist. Gourde has points in eight of his last 10 games. Tampa Bay's Alex Killorn has an assist in a career-best four straight games. Kris Letang passed Syl Apps for sixth on the Penguins' assists list. Letang has points in 11 of his last 14 games against Tampa Bay. ... The Lightning allowed the first goal for the ninth time in the last 10 games. The Penguins wore their yellow third jerseys for the first time. Hall of Famer and Penguins owner Mario Lemieux dropped the puck for a ceremonial opening faceoff, celebrating 25 years of his foundation.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLightning: At Philadelphia on Saturday night.\n\nPenguins: At Ottawa on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nCarmelo Anthony appeared in 10 games for the Rockets. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCarmelo Anthony's brief time with the Houston Rockets is over. The team announced Thursday that it was \"working toward a resolution\" to part ways after signing Anthony as a free agent this summer.\n\nAnthony appeared in just 10 games for the Rockets and averaged career-lows of 13.4 points and 29.4 minutes. With his tenure in Houston over, speculation naturally turns to potential landing spots for the 10-time All-Star.\n\nOptions could be limited for Anthony. He still wants to play big minutes, but he likely won't find many roles that offer that type of playing time. Anthony's shooting has diminished in recent years, further complicating his ability to find a role in today's NBA.\n\nHowever, contending teams will always have a need for proven scoring depth off the bench. Should he finally be willing to play a reserve role, Anthony will have suitors. Let's break down the potential landing spots ....\n\nGolden State Warriors: At first glance, it would seem like a patented \"best team signs ring-chasing veteran\" move. Perhaps it would be, but the two-time defending champs can afford to take such a risk.\n\nBeyond the surface, though, Anthony could actually fill a need for shooting and scoring off the bench. It seems silly to think of Golden State needing more shooting, but it's actually a bit top-heavy in that regard. Beyond the star trio of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant, the Warriors lack shooting depth, especially off the bench.\n\nAnthony shot only 40.5% overall and 32.8% from 3-point range with the Rockets. If he shoots closer to his career averages of 44.9% and 34.7%, Anthony could help make Golden State's road to a three-peat even easier.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: Perhaps the best basketball fit for Anthony's skill set, the 76ers are reportedly \"kicking the tires on the idea\" of bringing Anthony in.\n\nThe 76ers showed they're all-in for a championship push with the acquisition of Jimmy Butler. They know they're not a complete product, though, and additional shooting is a top priority, especially since they sacrificed some by trading Robert Covington and Dario Saric to get Butler.\n\nAs with a potential Warriors pairing, Anthony would need to regain top form as a shooter to be the type of impact addition the 76ers would need him to be. However, his career numbers suggest he could help improve Philadelphia's 20th-ranked 3-point shooting.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: With the Lakers back in title-hunting mode, the connection to another available star \u2014albeit an aging one \u2014 is inevitable. Add in Anthony's long-time friendship with LeBron James, and it's practically certain.\n\nThe Lakers are in need of more help on defense than offense, but Anthony could still fill a need for supplementary scoring. Josh Hart leads the second unit, but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Lance Stephenson have been inconsistent. Any scoring from Tyson Chandler is a bonus. Anthony could be a potent additional option next to Hart and also add flexibility off the bench.\n\nAlready a mash-up of big personalities, the Los Angeles locker room would seemingly have little trouble integrating another in Anthony. The Lakers would need to make some moves at the back end of the roster to add Anthony.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: They aren't as flashy as the other names on this list, but the Pelicans could be a better basketball fit for Anthony, one that could provide a boost in a needed spot for a promising young team with hopes of advancing further in the playoffs.\n\nElfrid Payton has been out with an ankle injury for nearly three weeks. Without him, New Orleans has had a tough time finding playmaking when Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday are off the floor. With Anthony leading the second unit, he could assume the lead role off the bench and allow coach Alvin Gentry to rest Davis and Holiday at the same time.\n\nThe Pelicans' fast-paced offense would seem to be ill-suited for Anthony. But as the top option on the reserve unit, Anthony would be able to slow things down whenever he wanted and use his versatility on the wing or the low block, places he has excelled before.\n\nFollow Matt Eppers on Twitter @meppers_."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "McKnight leads Tennessee St over Carver Bible College 92-57", "description": "Kamar McKnight scored 15 points to lead five players in double figures and added three assists and two steals to lead Tennessee State to a 92-57 victory over Carver Bible College", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/15/mcknight-leads-tennessee-st-over-carver-bible-college-92-57/38540135/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T02:54:06Z", "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.

No need to play her tonight,\" coach Kim Mulkey said.\n\nBrown was in uniform if needed, but that wasn't necessary. The senior ended her streak of 113 consecutive games and 64 starts in a row.\n\nBaylor (4-0) led throughout, and was already up 28-7 late in the first quarter after a 20-3 spurt when seven different players combined on the nine baskets in that span of less than five minutes.\n\nMoon Ursin, Queen Egbo, NaLyssa Smith, Chloe Jackson and Caitlin Bickle all had 11 points for the Lady Bears, while Lauren Cox scored 10 points and blocked five shots. Egbo, Smith and Bickle are all freshmen like Scott-Grayson.\n\nJackson, the graduate transfer from LSU, had eight assists.\n\n\"I like to think that I've always had pretty good court vision,\" Jackson said. \"They make it easy for me. My teammates get open pretty easily. It's just about execution and finding them.\"\n\nCourtney Parsons had 11 points for Southern (2-2), which was outrebounded 42-24 and outscored 38-15 in the paint.\n\n\"I thought our young ladies battled. We were overmatched on the inside,\" coach Carlos Funchess said. \"They were 6-5 (and) 6-6, and we're 6-0 (and) 5-11. It's tough down there, but they battled. We had a hard time rebounding the basketball. I think that was one of the keys of the game.\"\n\nThe Lady Bears shot 75 percent (24 of 32) before halftime, when they led 59-27.\n\n\"I thought we played well in the first half. I didn't think it was anything but sloppy in the second half,\" Mulkey said. \"Now, why was it sloppy? Could it have been who I had on the floor together? Could it have been scoreboard, they're looking at the scoreboard? Could it have been a lot of things? I thought the first half was much better than the second.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSouthern has won its two games against lower-division teams \u2014 a Division III and an NAIA team. But the Jaguars have had lopsided losses to major conference teams. They lost 89-58 at Kentucky.\n\nBaylor has won it three home games by an average margin of nearly 55 points and averaged just under 103 points in those games. It was the second time this season that the Lady Bears matched a team record with seven players scoring in double figures.\n\nEJECTED\n\nSouthern senior post Sarai Blissett was ejected midway through the third quarter when officials reviewed courtside video monitors after she was initially called for her fourth foul.\n\nFunchess said officials thought Blissett \"swung back and hit the young lady in the head. It was an unfortunate incident. She's our most athletic post player and the one person we have who can rebound the basketball.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouthern plays its next two games at home, Monday against South Alabama and then Nov. 29 vs. Dillard.\n\nBaylor, which doesn't play at home again until Dec. 12, will be in Las Vegas to play in a tournament after Thanksgiving. The Lady Bears play Nov. 23 against South Dakota State.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Connecticut upset Syracuse, 83-76, in the first game.\n\nThe Huskies passed the first major test of the Dan Hurley era with the win against their former Big East rival.\n\n\"They had a look the last couple days that they couldn't get here and play. They went out and performed at such a high level,\" Hurley said.\n\nIowa coach Fran McCaffery was watching the first game of the doubleheader at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"I was impressed with how hard (UConn) played,\" he said. \"I thought they shared the ball and I thought they really competed defensively.\"\n\nHe could have said the same about his team, as the Hawkeyes held the Ducks to 37.1 percent shooting from the field (23-62) and 33.3 percent shooting from 3 (6-18).\n\n\"It was a disappointing effort,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"Our ball movement was not good. Our transition, we looked over the top a few times and didn't finish, and really kind of quit running after that. Our ball movement was bad. We didn't penetrated took to make shots for our teammates. And when you're playing poorly like that offensively, you have to do something defensively and we were bad there.\"\n\nOregon only forced eight turnovers while committing 14. Moreover, Iowa made 35.2 percent of its shots from the field (19-54), 35.7 percent from 3 (10-28) and knocked down 29-33 from the foul line.\n\n\"I know I'm disappointed in what I saw,\" Altman said. \"We just didn't do a good job. We didn't compete, and I know they're disappointed in that.\"\n\nIowa led throughout. The Hawkeyes jumped out to an 8-0 lead in the first 2:36, and enjoyed a 39-28 advantage at halftime. The lead grew to 13, 52-39, on Kriener's dunk with 12:19 left in the second half.\n\nOregon closed with seven, 76-69, in the final 23.6 seconds, but that was as close as the Ducks would come.\n\n\"We saw a little frustration going on,\" Bohannon said about the Ducks. \"So we knew right there that we had them.\"\n\nEhab Amin led all players with 25 points. Bol Bol chipped in with 14, and Victor Bailey Jr. had 12.\n\nSyracuse coach Jim Boeheim was disappointed in the way his team played. Syracuse dropped to 2-1 with its first loss of the season in a game in which the Orange missed 40 of their 66 shots from the field, including misfiring on 16 of 22 3s.\n\nNot improving his mood was the fact UConn out rebounded Syracuse 46-32.\n\n\"We weren't in any way, shape or form good on the offensive end,\" said Boeheim, who later added, \"we got crushed on the boards. We got crushed inside.\"\n\nJalen Carey led all scorers with 26. Tyus Battle had 16, and Elijah Hughes chipped in with 15.\n\n\"Jalen played with a lot of poise,\" said Boeheim, \"but the guys we count on to score did not play well.\"\n\nFrom the opening tip, an unceasing cacophony filled Madison Square Garden, a reminder that these programs \u2014Syracuse in the ACC, Connecticut in the American Athletic Conference \u2014can trace their roots to the World's Most Famous Arena, and more specifically, the Big East Conference.\n\nSo it was only fitting that the game was played with a distinct Big East flavor. Easy shots were at a premium. Seemingly every loose ball was contested. Arms and legs were entangled with other arms and legs. Bodies fell to the famous hardwood. Players on the benches jumped up and roared with glee at every call that went their way. When they weren't stalking up and down the sidelines, Hurley and Boeheim were either gesticulating to the officiating staff or engaged in one-way conversations with their players.\n\nThe Huskies led 38-32 at halftime due in part to a 13-4 run in the first 4:29, and outscoring the Orange, 9-7, in the last 5:01.\n\n\"We got after them to start the game,\" Hurley said. \"They were rattled.\"\n\nConnecticut opened the scoring in both halves. Adams slammed a back door, alley-oop jam just 14 seconds into the game, and Vital's left side 3 49 seconds into the second half increased the Huskies' lead to 41-32. Gilbert's left-side 3 5:06 later extended UConn's lead to 10, 51-41, and forced Boeheim to call a timeout.\n\nWhen play resumed, Syracuse outscored UConn 25-19 over a span of 10:42 to cut the deficit to 70-66. But any chance Syracuse would complete the comeback were snuffed by Gilbert and Adams 3s on consecutive possessions. Smith, Tyler Polley, Gilbert and Adams combined to knock down seven of eight free throws in the final minute to seal the win.\n\n\"We didn't play very smart on offense and scored (76) points,\" Boeheim said. We've just got to be better on offense. Movement wasn't good. We have to get into things. We haven't been good offensively for all the game that we've played and we're trying to work guys out of position. We're not in sync (on) offense at all.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Jared Wilson-Frame doesn't seem to be bothered by not being in the starting lineup.\n\nThe Pittsburgh senior came off the bench for 20 points on Thursday, lifting the Panthers to a 97-71 victory over Central Arkansas.\n\nWilson-Frame has passed the 20-point barrier in each of his three games this season. As usual, he did most of his damage from beyond the arc, shooting 4 of 8 from 3-point range. He's shooting 55.6 percent from long range on the season.\n\nHe didn't waste much time getting involved, first coming off the bench as the Bears jumped out to a 17-8 lead, but Wilson-Frame immediately fought back with a 3-pointer that sparked a 16-2 Pitt run, after which the Panthers never trailed.\n\n\"I'm just comfortable,\" Wilson-Frame said of his bench role. \"I'm going to keep using that word, because it's just fun to play basketball this way and it's fun to play basketball with these guys \u2014 guys you love.\"\n\n\"He's a guy that can put up points, but more importantly, he's a guy that can create plays,\" Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. \"We want Jared to be aggressive when he has open looks.\"\n\nFreshman wing Au'Diese Toney set a career high with 15 points. Fellow freshmen Xavier Johnson (12) and Trey McGowens (11) also finished in double digits. Malik Ellison had 13 points.\n\nThatch Unruh led the way for the Bears with 15 points, all of which came in the first half.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCentral Arkansas: The Bears will get a couple more shots against major conference opponents after a 13-point loss to Missouri and Thursday's loss to the Panthers. The Bears visit Louisville on Dec. 5, Indiana on Dec. 19 and Oklahoma State on Dec. 21.\n\n\"I don't mind getting slugged in the mouth a little bit,\" Bears coach Russ Pennell said. \"We play in the Southland Conference. You get one bid. . We've got to be ready and be men by the tournament in March. That's what we gear everything toward. That's why we play Pitt.\"\n\nPitt: Wilson-Frame continues to be the Panthers' most prolific scorer in his sixth-man role. His 20 points actually decreased his season average to 21.3, but that's still 7.0 more than second-leading scorer Johnson.\n\nPHYSICAL BATTLE\n\nThe teams combined for 42 personal fouls, with many of them sending a player sprawling to the floor. Johnson was whistled for a technical in the first half.\n\nThe Panthers did a better job taking advantage, getting to the free-throw line for 35 attempts and hitting 26 of them. Central Arkansas made just nine of its 13 from the stripe.\n\n\"That's part of the game,\" said Toney, who was 6 of 7 from the line. \"If you attack, they're going to call fouls.\"\n\nMISSING MAN\n\nJohnson played just 17 minutes, a season low, after his technical and second personal foul earned him a seat on Pitt's bench.\n\nCapel credited Ellison and Sidy N'Dir for steadying things at the point and Johnson for responding with a stellar second half.\n\n\"That's sitting for a while, for over a half hour,\" Capel said. \"I thought he did a really good job of keeping himself in the game.\"\n\nMAKING ADJUSTMENTS\n\nUnruh had 12 as Central Arkansas built an early lead, but was largely neutralized after that thanks to Pitt's defensive adjustment.\n\n\"I thought they really sat on him and turned him into a driver,\" Pennell said. \"He's a catch and shoot guy. . I thought their athleticism kind of engulfed him in the second half.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCentral Arkansas: Visits Troy on Sunday.

He did not answer questions about the incident but said his \"first priority right now is clearing my name.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Avenatti said in a text message. \"The measure of a person is how they get up when they are knocked down.\"\n\nBut the hurdles in his way are adding up. On Wednesday, Avenatti, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump who rose to prominence as the attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of domestic violence.\n\nHours after being taken into custody, Avenatti posted $50,000 bail and strongly denied wrongdoing as he left the Los Angeles Police Department and tweeted on Thursday that he hasn't been charged with anything related to the accusation.\n\nMore: Michael Avenatti's ex-wives come to his defense after domestic violence arrest in LA\n\nMore: Michael Avenatti arrested in Los Angeles, denies domestic violence accusations\n\n\"I have never struck a woman.

When we are fully exonerated I am coming for you Jacob Wohl,\" Avenatti wrote.\n\nAvenatti did not immediately provide answer additional text messages from USA TODAY about the allegations and whether he believed this incident could pose an issue to his possible presidential bid.\n\nEven before the arrest, Avenatti would have faced an interesting road to the Democratic primary if he chose to throw his hat in the ring for president.\n\nAlong with not holding public office before, Avenatti was criticized for his role in the Supreme Court hearings on Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSome critics, both Republicans and Democrats, blamed Avenatti for Kavanaugh's successful confirmation as a Supreme Court Justice. Critics said the decades-old allegations about a gang rape by his client Julie Swetnick cast doubt on the other allegations of sexual assault.\n\nBut, Avenatti's name recognition, his high-profile legal fights with Trump and his fight-fire-with-fire attitude could rally Democratic support.\n\nAhead of the midterm elections, Avenatti toured the nation speaking at Democratic fundraising events, some of which sold out.\n\nIn recent weeks he's gotten help from a group of veteran Democratic advisers and launched a political action committee, Politico noted in October. The group of advisers includes those who've worked on campaigns for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nContributing: Steve Kiggins, Gregory Korte\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/15/michael-avenatti-still-considering-run-president-after-domestic-violence-arrest/2019880002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Cydney Henderson, USA TODAY", "title": "Disneyland Hotel sued by woman who alleges she was 'butchered' by bedbugs", "description": "Woman sues Disneyland Hotel for bedbugs", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/15/disneyland-hotel-sued-woman-who-alleges-she-butchered-bedbugs/2019412002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/9e583c5d-22a2-4d04-a22f-f76967d5349a/9e583c5d-22a2-4d04-a22f-f76967d5349a_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T02:07:03Z", "content": "Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle lit up at night.

The study found that human-caused climate change significantly increased rainfall from those three storms, but did not boost their wind speed.\n\nFuture storms, however, will see increases in both rainfall and wind speed, the study said. Specifically, if the climate continues to warm, peak wind speeds could increase by as much as 29 mph.\n\n\"Scientists are coming to a consensus that global warming will lead to increases in rainfall from tropical cyclones,\" Patricola said. \"One of the remaining uncertainties is how much.\"\n\nMaria hit Puerto Rico and other parts of the Caribbean in 2017, killing as many as 3,000 people. Irma hit the Caribbean and Florida that same year, while Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, leaving over 1,800 dead.\n\nA separate study that dealt with 2017's Hurricane Harvey said the city's topography increased rainfall totals, which included some of the nation's most extreme rains ever recorded.\n\nFirst, the city's skyscrapers increased atmospheric drag, leading to heavier rainfall. Second, the rock-hard city surface increased flooding, probably due to the extensive concrete and asphalt coverage.\n\nThe studies were published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/global-warming-boosted-rainfall-recent-hurricanes-study-suggests/2016646002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Bay Area residents coping with wildfire smoke", "description": "Deadly wildfires in Northern California are sending smoke into the San Francisco Bay area, prompting residents to stay indoors or wear face masks while outside as the Environmental Protection Agency rates the area's air as \"very unhealthy.\" (Nov. 15)", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/15/bay-area-residents-coping-wildfire-smoke/38539751/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5967666048001_5967655977001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:48:49Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Drone video shows destruction from NorCal wildfire", "description": "As the search continues for more victims, drone video shows the extent of destruction from a wildifire that struck Paradise, California.

The 6-foot-10 forward had a total of 15 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and two blocks.\n\nSchool officials said Azab experienced shoulder discomfort as Memphis prepared for last season's American Athletic Conference tournament. That led to a diagnosis of leukemia lymphoma.\n\nAzab announced his diagnosis April 21 on social media. He wrote in a Twitter post at the time that he has \"started treatment and am working through the process, but I wanted to spread the word and ask for prayers to help strengthen me in this journey.\"\n\nAzab received the annual Coach Dave Loos MVP Award at the Tennessee Coaches vs. Cancer Tip-Off Reception earlier this year in Nashville, Tennessee.

He transferred to Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago for his senior season.\n\nHe came to Memphis in 2016, but sat out the 2016-17 season awaiting NCAA clearance.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and personal heartache that we mourn the passing of Karim Azab,\" Memphis athletic director Tom Bowen said in a statement. \"Karim was a wonderful young man who was excited to be a part of the University of Memphis and Tiger basketball.

Now, odds makers are listing the surging Saints, who lead the NFL in scoring with 36.7 points per game, as favorites by more than a touchdown.\n\nStill, the Saints sound wary of underestimating the team that upended the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl just nine months ago.\n\n\"They're still a good team no matter what their record is,\" Saints running back Alvin Kamara insisted. \"They wouldn't have won last year if they didn't have the talent.\"\n\nKamara's take is no surprise to Philadelphia coach Doug Pederson, who asserted that when you're the defending champs, \"you get everybody's best each week.\"\n\nPederson even recalled pep-talks he gave his team last season in which he said, \"Listen, if you want to be one of the best teams in the league, we have to beat the best. And I know teams are saying that about us, and we just haven't lived up to how we're capable of playing in a couple of situations this year.\"\n\nThey need to start living up to their capabilities now. A loss in New Orleans, combined with a Washington win, would put the Eagles three games down in the NFC East with six games left.\n\nThat makes Philadelphia the more desperate team in this game, and in the NFL, a combination of talent and desperation can be dangerous.\n\n\"They are a prideful group. They know how to win,\" Saints quarterback Drew Brees said. \"They have a ton of playmakers over there. We have our work cut out for us and we know what type of game it's going to be. We know they're coming in hungry for a win. Both teams have a lot to play for.\"\n\nSome other key story lines in the Eagles-Saints matchup:\n\nSLOW STARTS\n\nThe Eagles have scored only 21 points in the first quarter, including 14 against the Giants after a turnover set up a short field. Pederson scripts the first 15 plays and they have often resulted in more negative yards than positive.\n\nPederson said he bases his script on watching film of the opponent and tries to avoid repeating play calls and giving away indicators. It's not working.\n\n\"In the case of some of our struggles, it has just been our execution,\" Pederson said. \"How we start games, that's where the urgency, I think, coaches, players, everybody involved really needs to sort of heighten, so that we can stay on the field and go down and score points.\"\n\nBREES APPRECIATION\n\nEagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz didn't have to spend a lot of time watching highlights of Brees throwing interceptions or getting sacked. Brees has one pick and he's been sacked nine times, none in the past three games.\n\n\"He's playing at an insane level right now,\" Schwartz said. \"Extremely accurate quarterback, smart, knows where to go with the ball. Still has good mobility, can buy time.\"\n\nIt doesn't help Philadelphia's case that starting cornerback Ronald Darby went down with a torn ACL last week. Jalen Mills, the starter opposite Darby, has been limited by a foot injury. Starting nickel cornerback Sidney Jones has missed the past three games because of a hamstring injury. Also, starting safety Rodney McLeod already was lost for the season with a knee injury.\n\n\"We've got some young players that need to fill in and make their way in the league,\" Schwartz said. \"Our job as players and coaches is work to find a formula that works for the guys that we have.\"\n\nLINE ITEMS\n\nThe Saints enter the game without starting left tackle Terron Armstead, who left last week's victory in Cincinnati with an unspecified shoulder injury. Coach Sean Payton declined to update Armstead's condition this week, but he did not practice and reportedly could miss several weeks. Filling in is Jermon Bushrod, who was a first-year starter at left tackle on the Saints 2009 Super Bowl team. He left in free agency several years ago, only to return this season as a reserve.\n\n\"For him to step in, he's ready for that,\" Brees said. \"We're used to that and we're ready to go.\"\n\nINGRAM'S INFLUENCE\n\nThe Saints are rushing for more than 140 yards per game since veteran running back Mark Ingram returned from a four-game suspension to start the season. His return has eased the workload on Alvin Kamara, leaving both players relatively fresh during games. In a 51-14 victory at Cincinnati last week, Ingram gained 104 yards on 13 carries to go with three catches for 58 yards, including a 28-yard TD.\n\n\"I feel like we're getting in a groove,\" Ingram said. \"We have a great team, we have great players, and I just want to be on point so I can help us win.\"\n\nMARSHALL PLAN\n\nThe Saints have given 34-year-old free agent receiver Brandon Marshall a chance to join their prolific passing game . The 6-foot-5 Marshall has had eight 1,000-yard seasons, but he didn't fit in with Seattle, which released him seven games into the season. Time will tell how he meshes with the record-setting Brees.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Minnesota\u2019s defense was vulnerable in the first quarter of the season, but Vikings coach Mike Zimmer and his staff and players have successfully made the adjustments they needed to get the group back on a dominant track. (AP Photo/Howard Simmons, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Minnesota's fumble gave Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions a fresh set of downs early in the fourth quarter two weeks ago, another opportunity to start climbing back into the game.\n\nThough they held an 11-point lead, the Vikings had been unable to pull away. On the first play after the change of possession, Stafford faked a handoff to Kerryon Johnson and rolled out to his right.\n\nWith a hard stop, Stafford pivoted and threw back to his left where Johnson was waiting for the screen pass with four blockers within 5 yards of him. Vikings defensive tackle Tom Johnson wasn't fooled, though.\n\nHe kept his eyes on the running back the entire time, closing in to make the tackle for a 6-yard loss as soon as the ball was caught. Five plays later, with the Lions still in their own territory, defensive end Danielle Hunter scooped up a fumble and returned it for a victory-sealing touchdown.\n\nWhen the Vikings beat the Lions 24-9 that afternoon, the most encouraging development entering their week off was the start-to-finish dominance by a defense that didn't look like its usual self in the first quarter of the season. That rollout screen play that Johnson blew up went for big gains against the Vikings a few times earlier in the fall. Coach Mike Zimmer and his staff put plenty of work into adjusting the scheme and the calls after in light of the vulnerabilities that arose in September.\n\nThe Vikings allowed a season-low 209 yards to the Lions. Their next three lowest totals all came over the three previous games.\n\n\"There's a lot of teams now that are playing a style of defense similar to us. Now, all these offenses are attacking these defenses pretty much the same way. So we've had to adjust and change coverages,\" Zimmer said, adding: \"Luckily, our players have been able to execute it.\"\n\nThe 4-3 system that Zimmer largely used throughout his time as defensive coordinator for Dallas and Cincinnati gained fame by the novel use of the double A-gap blitz that send the inside linebackers as pass rushers on both sides of the center.\n\nAs more and more teams began to integrate that concept, the added exposure around the league gave opponents more opportunities to strategize about how to block it. Zimmer estimated that 10 or 12 other teams around the NFL now use a form of what his original base defense was.\n\nAs for the Double-A gap blitz, Zimmer has rarely called one of those this season. One alternative that has worked well has been to overload one side of the line and use a defensive back to rush like Harrison Smith or Mackensie Alexander, who had the only one of 10 sacks of Stafford what wasn't from a defensive lineman.\n\n\"Everybody copies if you've been good,\" Zimmer said, adding: \"You see a gradual thing. I've had many coaches say they watch our blitz tape every week to see what we're doing. That's kind of how it starts.\"\n\nGeneral manager Rick Spielman will often join Zimmer for his 5:30 a.m. film review of the previous game on Monday mornings, and this season he's been witness to perhaps more scheming than usual.\n\n\"It's pretty incredible to see how they evolve things and why they evolve it,\" Spielman said.\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) play at Chicago (6-3) on Sunday night for control of the NFC North, and they'll need the defense to keep this up.\n\n\"We're recognizing the plays and understanding the downs and distances, getting to the ball, getting to the quarterback,\" cornerback Xavier Rhodes said. \"We're in great coverage. We're aggressive. Once we call a blitz, we're aggressive all the way around. We're just being us. We're finding our identity. We had it, but we were making errors in the beginning of the season and now we're trying to minimize those.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Now going into Sunday\u2019s Cup Series finale, the Ford EcoBoost 400, Truex and Logano are two of the Championship 4 drivers, along with Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick.\n\nIt\u2019s been suggested that perhaps Truex \u2014 the No. 78 Toyota driver and defending Cup Series champion \u2014 is racing too conservatively. But he knows exactly what he\u2019d do should a reversed situation arise during the championship race.\n\n\u201cDepends on who\u2019s in front of me,\u201d Truex told For The Win on Thursday. But if it\u2019s Logano? \u201cOf course. An eye for an eye.\u201d\n\nLogano knows that\u2019s how Truex would approach this hypothetical situation because he said it\u2019s part of racing. The No. 22 Ford driver distinguished between what he did at Martinsville and full-on wrecking another driver because Truex still finished third in what turned out to be a drag race across the finish line with Denny Hamlin in second.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less,\u201d Logano told FTW. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got here, right? We\u2019re racers, we\u2019re going to race hard. I think bump and run is totally acceptable in a lot of cases.\n\n\u201cNow, spinning someone out is a different play. To me, it\u2019s different, but everyone\u2019s rules are different. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to put yourself in a position to go out there and win it.\u201d\n\nBut Logano doesn\u2019t see his attitude as a \u201cfree pass\u201d for Truex to wreck him at any time, and it didn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s how Truex interpreted their previous conversation.\n\nElaborating on his Code of Hammurabi mentality, Truex said: \u201cI have a free pass. He already told me I could (bump him for the lead). He told me he\u2019s fair game, so here we go.\u201d\n\nIn response, Logano repeated a tired drivers\u2019 cliche about anticipating others will race him the same way he races them. So he\u2019d accept a similar bump-and-run move but certainly not getting thrown into the wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a hard racer, (and) I expect to get raced hard,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI didn\u2019t crash him, moved him up enough to have a drag race. That\u2019s what I explained to him.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "FBI unveils replica heads from Alcatraz escape", "description": "Half a century after a notorious prison escape from Alcatraz Island, the FBI has created replicas of decoy heads that inmates used to distract guards from a plan that still captivates researchers and tourists.

(AP Photo/Gary Landers, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Even if the memory is still fresh, the temptation is there for Pittsburgh to overlook the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nThe Steelers might have been guilty of that in January in the AFC divisional playoffs. Mike Mitchell and Le'Veon Bell talked more about a rematch in the conference title game against New England than the Jaguars, who had beaten them soundly at home earlier in the year. The Jaguars beat them again, 45-42.\n\nNever mind that both players are now gone, Mitchell signing with the Colts and Bell not signing his $14.5 million franchise tender and sitting out the season.\n\n\"Hopefully, people get the memo on that and respect these guys, because all they've done is kick our butt the last two times we've played them,\" Steelers guard David DeCastro said. \"I don't know that there's much to talk about, playing at their place. It's going to be a tough game. They're a really good defense, especially for us.\"\n\nBut there is much to talk about.\n\nThe Steelers are soaring. After a sluggish start, they have won five straight games, including a 52-21 victory a week ago Thursday against the Carolina Panthers when Ben Roethlisberger had a perfect quarterbacking rating for the first time in nearly 11 years.\n\n\"They're going to come in with a chip on their shoulder,\" Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette said.\n\nThe Jaguars more closely resemble the team that went nine straight seasons without reaching the playoffs than a team that was one quarter away from beating New England and reaching its first Super Bowl.\n\nFrom a 3-1 start, the Jaguars have lost five in a row. And while they still have the top-rated pass defense in the league, they looked bumbling at times last week in a 29-26 loss at Indianapolis thanks to busted coverages and confusion.\n\nJacksonville can't afford another loss if it wants to return to the playoffs. And it can't afford to live in the past, whether it's the 30-9 victory at Heinz Field last year when it intercepted Roethlisberger five times and Fournette ran for 181 yards, or the postseason win.\n\n\"Our margin for error is zero,\" Jacksonville defensive tackle Calais Campbell said. \"But we have the ability to do something special. We have to bury the past and just look forward. With our team, our coaches and the way we prepare, I don't see why we can't make it happen.\"\n\nThe Steelers are favored to win, just like the last two times. No one is talking about that on either side.\n\nMOVING ON\n\nThe Steelers no longer have the absence of Bell hanging over them. He won't play this season after declining to sign his one-year, $14.5 million franchise tag. They've managed just fine with second-year running back James Conner, second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage. His 10 rushing touchdowns are more than Bell ever had in a single season.\n\nConner's rise put him in a bit of an awkward spot. He considers Bell a friend and wanted no part of the narrative that he and Bell would be at odds if Bell opted to return. Now that the possibility of them reuniting is out of the way, Conner feels free to just go about his business.\n\n\"I'm excited we've got more football to play,\" Conner said. \"I earn everything. Nothing was given to me. I'm going to be doing the same thing I've been doing every week.\"\n\nFOURNETTE FORGES AHEAD\n\nOne reason for the Jaguars' sluggish start has been the absence of Fournette, not only a bruising runner but an explosive one. He broke off a 90-yard score last year against the Steelers in that 30-9 victory.\n\nFournette played parts of two games this year and had 20 carries. He returned last week and rushed 24 times and caught five passes.\n\n\"There no pitch count,\" Fournette said, adding that his hamstring felt strong.\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin says the Jaguars' turnover margin \u2014 minus 11 \u2014 is one reason for the 3-6 start. Another was the absence of Fournette.\n\n\"When you lose your feature runner, particularly one of his caliber, it affects you and it affects you in negative ways,\" Tomlin said.\n\nON THE ROPES\n\nThe Jaguars are three games behind Houston in the AFC South and have lost to every team in the division, putting their playoff hopes in serious jeopardy.\n\n\"We put a lot of stuff in a lot of other people's hands,\" linebacker Tevin Smith said.\n\nQuarterback Blake Bortles said Jacksonville needs a winning streak, but it has to start with one win first.\n\n\"We continue to let opportunities pass us by and eventually we're going to have to change that and win a football game,\" Bortles said. \"That's the only way to get hot and get a win streak going. You have to start with one. No better week to start than this week. ... It's a perfect game for us to get fired up.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Will Graves contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rajon Rondo had surgery Thursday on his broken right hand, and the Los Angeles Lakers plan to use a variety of strategies to replace the veteran point guard while he heals.\n\nLos Angeles will be without Rondo for four to five weeks after he was injured in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' fourth straight win, 126-117 over Portland on Wednesday night. Rondo apparently hurt his hand while making a steal, but he kept playing for several more minutes before coming out of the game.\n\nCoach Luke Walton praised Rondo's leadership and two-way contributions after the Lakers' final practice before heading out on a three-game road trip. Although he has played only 11 games for LA, Rondo is already a key component of the revamped club.\n\n\"Obviously we can't replace what Rondo does for our team and how important he is to our team, but we're not going to make excuses,\" Walton said. \"That's not who we are as a group. We're going to step up, and guys are going to pick up the slack and add to their responsibility.\"\n\nRondo is averaging 8.5 points, 6.5 assists, 4.5 rebounds and 1.2 steals in his first season with the Lakers. He has been the leader of Los Angeles' second unit while also serving as a valuable coach on the floor with his younger, less-familiar teammates, according to Walton.\n\nThe injury comes at an inopportune time for the Lakers (8-6), who are off to their best 14-game start since the 2011-12 season. Their four-game winning streak is the NBA's longest active run.\n\n\"As a group, we'll do our best to continue to play the way that we've started to play,\" Walton said.\n\nThe Lakers already spent three games without Rondo this season during his suspension for fighting with Chris Paul during LA's home opener. They have even more options to fill in during this longer stretch without him.\n\nLonzo Ball, who took over as a starter during Rondo's suspension and never left, is likely to play more minutes overall. Rondo has been a mentor to Ball, even studying film with the second-year playmaker.\n\n\"We'll miss him, but his presence is still going to be felt,\" said Ball, who is averaging 8.7 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.8 assists while playing his usual stellar defense. \"When he comes in, the pace goes however he wants it to go. He gets everybody in their spots. So that's what I try to do.\"\n\nLeBron James and Brandon Ingram \u2014 who was suspended along with Rondo for that brawl with the Rockets \u2014 also will increase their playmaking responsibilities.\n\nThe gangly, 6-foot-9 Ingram was surprisingly effective as a point guard and offense initiator last season when Ball was out with an injury. Even rookie shooting guard Svi Mykhailiuk could get point guard minutes, Walton said.\n\nJames sat out of practice to rest Thursday. The Lakers' road trip includes two games in Florida followed by James' return to Cleveland on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: www.apnews.com/NBA and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A short while later, Pulisic lost the ball and Jesse Lingard gave England the lead. Just 104 seconds later, Trent Alexander-Arnold doubled the advantage.\n\n\"We need to get a lot better if we want to beat a good side like that,\" Pulisic said after Thursday night's 3-0 defeat. \"We're not happy with the result.\"\n\nCallum Wilson beat Brad Guzan in the 77th minute, and Wayne Rooney entered in the 58th minute in his English national team farewell. The United States is 0-3 in three matches at old and new Wembley, outscored 7-0.\n\n\"We were a little timid and we allowed a little bit too much space,\" U.S. interim coach Dave Sarachan said.\n\nPulisic, the top player on the rebuilding Americans, played just his second game for the U.S. since the loss at Trinidad and Tobago last October ended a streak of seven straight World Cup appearances. This marked the first time Pulisic played together with midfielders Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Tyler Adams, who entered in the 62nd minute.\n\nSarachan played Pulisic on a wing, where Borussia Dortmund used the 20-year-old midfielder.\n\n\"That's always going to be a debate,\" Sarachan said. \"You have arguably our best player and so most would think, well, we should use him in the middle of the field, and I'm not saying maybe that won't happen, but I also know that when you watch him play for his club in the position he plays, he's very dangerous in confined space, so our thinking tonight was let's put him in a comfortable spot, having the freedom to cut inside and make the game, and I think there were moments when he did.\"\n\nSarachan's successor will face the same question.\n\n\"I think as we move along, as this program moves along, as players around him get settled and allow him maybe more freedom as a central guy, that's probably a place that would make sense,\" Sarachan said.\n\nU.S. center backs John Brooks and Matt Miazga had trouble closing down England, a World Cup semifinalist, and the Americans dropped to three wins, four losses and four ties under Sarachan going into his likely finale, against Italy on Tuesday at Genk, Belgium.\n\nRooney, who joined Major League Soccer's D.C. United in July, made his 120th international appearance, the most among England outfield players. The best chance for the 33-year-old striker was in stoppage time, when his low shot was saved by Guzan to the frustration of a crowd of 68,155. Rooney finished with an England record 53 goals.\n\n\"Another yard it would have been in ... and it would have great,\" Rooney said. \"But in some ways it's great because if I did score it would have opened another whole lot of debate whether that goal should count or not. In some ways it's probably better it didn't go in.\"\n\nEngland went ahead in the 25th minute when Dele Alli took the ball into the corner and passed to Lingard the top of the penalty area. Lingard took a touch as Miazga failed to close him down, then lofted the ball to the far corner over Guzan's outstretched arm.\n\nWilson dribbled into the penalty area in the 27th at Brooks and Miazga. The ball bounded out to Jadon Sancho, who passed to an unrushing Alexander-Arnold. Brooks failed to challenge him and Alexander-Arnold beat Guzan to the far post from with an angled shot from 10 yards.\n\nWilson scored off a pass from Fabian Delph, beating Brooks to a cross and putting in a volley from 7 yards. Wilson and Alexander-Arnold scored their first international goals.\n\n\"Probably gave them too much respect in the first half,\" Guzan said. \"Ultimately we were outclassed.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Philip Rivers and the Los Angeles Chargers offense have been sensational during their six-game winning streak. The veteran quarterback noted this week as they prepare for Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos that things can turn south quickly.\n\n\"We haven't won six in a row in a while, but it can be a one-game losing streak just like that. So I think, again, it's week to week,\" Rivers said. \"Again, now we've reset and get ready for the Broncos on Sunday.\"\n\nThe Chargers (7-2) have one of the league's most-balanced offenses. Rivers is third in the league with a 115.4 passer rating and running back Melvin Gordon is third in yards from scrimmage (1,033).\n\nRivers has been sacked only 12 times, third least among quarterbacks who have started nine or more games. But the Broncos have one of the NFL's best pass-rushing duos in Von Miller and Bradley Chubb, who have combined for a league-high 17 sacks.\n\nMiller, who has nine sacks this season, has sacked Rivers 15 times since entering the league as the second overall pick in 2011. That is the most by an active player against an active QB.\n\n\"I'm a big Philip Rivers fan. I feel like he's always played great, but the difference this year is he doesn't have as many interceptions,\" Miller said. \"He can make all the throws but he don't take all the shots. He is still accurate as hell, the running game is lights out, and he has a pretty good team.\"\n\nMiller added that the biggest difference with the Chargers this season is they are relying more on the running game with Gordon and Austin Ekeler, which has allowed Rivers to take fewer risks.\n\nChubb, the fifth overall pick in last April's draft, has 6 1-2 of his eight sacks over the past four games. Chubb said he got to meet Rivers last season at North Carolina State when he came in to talk to the team.\n\n\"He throws the ball out quick. It's making sure that when I get there, I make sure I try to get the ball out,\" Chubb said. \"He's kind of a bigger guy, he's not going to try to move around too much. But a lot of guys slip off of him. If I get to him, just make sure I secure it and get the ball up.\"\n\nRivers is tied for fourth in the league with 21 touchdown passes and has thrown two or more in nine straight games. Only five quarterbacks have done it in 10 or more straight games. He has thrown two or more TDs the past three times the Chargers have faced the Broncos.\n\nDenver (3-6) is rested after having its bye last week, while the Chargers return to StubHub Center for the first time in six weeks. Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said he sees a lot of similarities between this year's Broncos and his team last year, which was 3-6 before winning six of its last seven.\n\n\"This team (Denver) has lost four of the six games to division leaders, and they were close games. So this is a good football team,\" Lynn said. \"So, you know, I think it's a matter of time that this team gets going on a streak, but we're just trying to prevent that from being this week.\"\n\nHere are other things to watch in the meeting of AFC West rivals:\n\nGORDON'S STREAK\n\nGordon has five straight games of at least 120 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. Only four players in NFL history have done it in six straight games or more. Coincidentally, the last to do it was the Chargers' LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006.\n\nFREEMAN'S RETURN\n\nBroncos RB Royce Freeman, who has missed the last two games due to an ankle injury, is likely to be back for this week. Freeman is part of a prolific rookie trio that also features RB Phillip Lindsay and WR Courtland Sutton. They have combined for 1,462 yards from scrimmage, sixth-most yards by a rookie trio through nine games since the 1970 merger.\n\nCHALLENGING CORNERBACK\n\nBroncos star Chris Harris Jr. is hardly being challenged by quarterbacks this season. In his last game, he locked down on Texans No. 1 receiver DeAndre Hopkins and was only thrown at twice. But he knows that will change Sunday.\n\n\"Against Rivers, I'm excited this week because he always gives me a chance. I know Rivers is going to let me play ball.\"\n\nCENTER OF ATTENTION\n\nWith Matt Paradis on IR with a broken right leg, Connor McGovern will get his first start at center Sunday after moving over from right guard. QB Case Keenum said losing Paradis puts a lot more on everyone's plate.\n\n\"Everyone needs to step their game up,\" Keenum said. \"What's great is that nobody has to be anybody but themselves. Everybody's confident in what their ability is and everybody's confident in what their job is. I think everybody is going to step up on the offensive line, including me, too. I definitely can help out with those guys.\"\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON\n\nChargers DE Joey Bosa is back practicing and could he see action. Bosa has missed the first 10 games due to a bone bruise to his left foot, but will be a game-time decision. The Chargers struggled with their pass rush early this season, yet have 15 sacks over the past four games.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Arnie Stapleton contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Leighton Vander Esch said it almost felt weird to have the ball in his hands again on the first NFL interception for the Dallas Cowboys linebacker.\n\nThe rookie from Boise State who used to play every down \u2014 offense and defense \u2014 for his eight-man high school team never said anything about it feeling strange to diagnose a screen pass before it was in the air, slip past a pair of blockers and make a critical open-field tackle for loss.\n\nThat defensive play of the game in a season-saving win at Philadelphia was a signature moment weeks in the making, through preparation and focus that Vander Esch said should be expected of any team's first-round draft pick. At least that's how he sees it.\n\n\"I've never really thought that I've been caught off-guard with anything,\" said Vander Esch, taken 19th overall last spring . \"I'm confident in my abilities and my athleticism, in my preparation. It's going to put me in position to make plays on the field on game day.\"\n\nVander Esch established a Cowboys rookie record with 19 tackles against the Eagles, according to the coaches' count. He's the first rookie Dallas linebacker with an interception since injured teammate and mentor Sean Lee had two in the same game eight years ago.\n\nBarring a surge from Jaylon Smith, who figures to be his linebacking partner for years to come in Dallas, Vander Esch could become the first rookie to lead the Cowboys (4-5) in tackles since coaches starting tracking the stat in 1977.\n\nVander Esch has 96 through nine games going into Sunday's trip to Atlanta (4-5), and Smith is second with 82.\n\n\"He's going to be around here a long time,\" Smith said. \"He's developing into a great player. He's the best tackler on the team. I joke to him all the time. He's finding ways to learn from his 96-inch arms.\"\n\nSmith, a first-round talent relegated to the second round in 2016 because of a knee injury in his final game at Notre Dame, watched as a rookie while recovering from the injury, so his second season was really his first.\n\nBecause of injuries to Anthony Hitchens and Lee, Smith had to play more than expected and struggled at times. More hamstring issues for Lee have forced the 6-foot-4 Vander Esch into essentially a full-time role \u2014 he and Smith played all 62 defensive snaps against the Eagles.\n\nVander Esch hasn't struggled nearly as much, perhaps in part because he's had Smith out there with him. And he's had Lee in his ear on the sidelines \u2014 and in the meeting rooms all week. The Cowboys have raved about Lee's preparation for years.\n\n\"He's lucky to have a guy like Sean Lee in that room with him,\" coach Jason Garrett said. \"To see that example really each and every day in your room, up close, seeing how a guy like that does it, how he approaches it, I think that's been really good for him.\"\n\nApparently so.\n\n\"I wouldn't have been able to do it without him,\" Vander Esch said. \"He's right there to give us tips and to be on us right as we come on the sideline after being on the field. I love the guy. I feel like I've known him for my whole life.\"\n\nLee has already missed four games with separate hamstring injuries and likely won't be back until the final month because of the second one. Injuries have defined his career, and several times brought the Dallas defense down with them.\n\nSmith's improvement in his first year without a foot brace that he needed because of nerve damage from the knee injury is part of the reason the Cowboys, ranked seventh in the NFL in total defense, are in their best shape in several years to survive without Lee.\n\nThe rapid rise of the Vander Esch is the other reason, and perhaps isn't that surprising considering he went from tiny Riggins, Idaho, to a Boise State walk-on who developed fast enough through a redshirt year and three seasons to enter the draft early.\n\n\"For a guy as big as he is, the things that we saw from him on tape in college that led him to be really intriguing prospect, it is showing up,\" passing game coordinator Kris Richard said. \"And it's translating into this league.\"\n\nVander Esch has a signature play to show for it.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

By beating Spain in a thriller on Thursday, the Croats have given Gareth Southgate's squad a chance to advance to the final phase of the inaugural UEFA Nations League.\n\nTin Jedvaj scored his second goal three minutes into stoppage time to earn Croatia a 3-2 victory and a first win in a competitive match since beating England in the World Cup semifinals.\n\nSpain remained atop League A, Group 4 with six points. England and Croatia have four points each ahead of their head-to-head meeting at Wembley Stadium on Sunday in the last match.\n\nA win for either England or Croatia will assure qualifying for the Final Four in June along with the other three group winners. Spain would go through if England and Croatia draw. The bottom team will be relegated to League B.\n\n\"We wanted to win this and to have the last match at Wembley to decide the group winner,\" Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic said. \"Let's go and enjoy our football now. We are very motivated for that one.\"\n\nWhile Croatia beat former world champion Spain, England eased to a 3-0 win over the United States in a friendly marking the farewell appearance of Wayne Rooney.\n\nElsewhere in the Nations League, Belgium beat Iceland 2-0 to stay on course to reach the finals. In the lower leagues, Bosnia and Herzegovina earned promotion to League A, and Finland earned promotion to League B.\n\nIn other friendlies, Germany routed Russia 3-0, the Czech Republic edged Poland 1-0, Ireland and Northern Ireland played to a 0-0 draw, and Israel thrashed Guatemala 7-0.\n\nCroatia's win avenged a 6-0 loss, its worst ever, to Spain in September.\n\nThe World Cup finalists pressed Spain in its area late and Jedvaj pounced after goalkeeper David de Gea pushed the ball into his path. The Bayer Leverkusen defender had earlier made it 2-1 to the hosts when he was left unmarked to head in a cross by Luka Modric for his first international goal.\n\nSpain twice rallied to equalize, first through Dani Ceballos canceling out Andrej Kramaric's opener and then via a penalty by Sergio Ramos.\n\nLuis Enrique's lineup was pressing for a late goal when Croatia produced one last push that paid off with Jedvaj's second score.\n\n\"Croatia got that little bit of fortune when both teams were desperately trying to win this match right at the end,\" Luis Enrique said.\n\nROONEY BIDS FAREWELL\n\nMaking his 120th and last appearance for England, the 33-year-old Rooney was denied a perfect farewell by Brad Guzan when the U.S. goalkeeper dived to stop his shot in stoppage time.\n\nRecalled after two years out of the England squad, the D.C. United forward sparked the biggest cheers of the night when he went on as a 58th-minute substitute against the country he now calls home.\n\nEngland's goals came from Jesse Lingard, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Callum Wilson.\n\nBELGIANS ON COURSE\n\nMichy Batshuayi, replacing the injured Romelu Lukaku in attack, scored twice as Belgium beat Iceland for a third victory in the Nations League.\n\nA draw against Switzerland on Sunday would be enough for Belgium to reach the finals. It has nine points from three games in Group 2 of League A, three ahead of Switzerland. Iceland had already been relegated to League B before the match.\n\nFrance and Portugal are also favored to reach the finals from their groups in League A.\n\nOTHER GAMES\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina will join the top 12 teams on the continent for the next Nations League after it won Group 3 of League B. The Balkan nation got the point it needed by drawing 0-0 at Austria and remaining undefeated. The result also relegated Northern Ireland.\n\nFinland won Group 2 of League C with one match remaining despite losing 1-0 against Greece. Estonia was relegated from the same group after losing 2-0 at Hungary.\n\nIn League D, already-promoted Georgia drew 1-1 at Andorra, Latvia drew 1-1 at Kazakhstan, Belarus won 2-0 at Luxembourg and Moldova won 1-0 at San Marino.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
