(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 When Arizona plays at the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, rookie Josh Rosen will make his eighth start at quarterback for the Cardinals. It's been a bumpy, up-and-down ride so far.\n\n\"I think he has been pretty good,\" coach Steve Wilks said. \"I'd like for him to be a little bit more consistent. We all would, and he would probably tell you the same thing. The biggest thing is that we've got to make sure we limit the takeaways.\"\n\nArizona is 2-5 with Rosen the starter.\n\n\"I don't think that's good by anyone's standard,\" the 21-year-old quarterback said.\n\nRosen's statistics aren't impressive. He's completed 55 percent of his passes for 1,416 yards and nine touchdowns, with 10 interceptions. In his last six games, he's thrown for seven TDs and was intercepted eight times. In Arizona's 23-21 home loss to Oakland last Sunday, Rosen threw for a career-best three touchdowns but was intercepted twice. Both interceptions led to Raiders touchdowns. Rosen completed only nine of 20 passes in the game for 136 yards, 59 of them on one play.\n\n\"Some of them are happenstance, \" Wilks said of the interceptions, \"but some of them could be just a lack of wanting to take the check down. He's trying to force things in there sometimes.\"\n\nAsked what he needs to improve, Rosen said \"turnovers is a big thing, but just everything, being 100 percent of your checks, 100 percent of your reads. Just constant improvement in as many possible areas.\"\n\nRosen, by nature, is an aggressive player and he acknowledges having to mitigate that with the willingness to check down and play things safe.\n\n\"There are certain kind of defensive positions where you can try and fit it in,\" he said. \"So, if there's a zone dropping linebacker, there's no way you're going to get it around him, but if it's man coverage and the guy is kind of on his hip, that's something where you can give a guy a shot. ...\n\n\"But there are certain ones where I don't care how good you are, you're not going to get it complete. Depends on the play, the situation and defense.\"\n\nRookie wide receiver Christian Kirk said people need to realize how much Rosen is being asked to do.\n\n\"He's got a lot on his plate. I think people forget about that,\" Kirk said. \"But he does a great job in embracing it and I think every week he's just learning to take what the defenses gives him. He's a competitor. He wants to win. So at times he'll put a ball out there that's 50-50. Sometimes it doesn't go our way. But that's just him being a competitor.\"\n\nSeven games into the season, the Cardinals fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and replaced him with quarterbacks coach Byron Leftwich.\n\nIt's the fifth offensive coordinator in four seasons for Rosen, going back to his early days at UCLA. Rosen praises what Leftwich has done for him.\n\n\"There's a lot of stuff within the offense that I didn't know,\" Rosen said. \"It's an NFL offense. There are always going to be little things here and there. A lot more little tips on leverage and where guys are, which tells you what coverage you're going to get. So, there's a lot of disguise, but you're not allowed to disguise too good or otherwise you're going to be out of position. There are little tips and tells that I've been learning and picking up on.\"\n\nGONZALEZ IS BACK: Zane Gonzalez, the former All-American kicker at Arizona State who played just a little over one season with the Cleveland Browns, is back in Arizona on the Cardinals practice squad.\n\nHe's seen as insurance for Phil Dawson, who has had some injury problems, as well as perhaps a kicker for the future for the Cardinals.\n\nGonzalez is just glad to get the chance after being cut by the Browns two months ago. He said he's finally recovered from a recurring groin injury and didn't want to talk about his Cleveland experience on Wednesday.\n\n\"That's the past. I don't think about it anymore,\" he said. \"I went back, I watched the tape. There's obviously a lot of issues with injury, amongst other things. I'm not the kind of guy who's going to go out there and make excuses. I took it on the chin for what it was and moved on. I think I earned a lot of respect from people back in Cleveland for that.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Aaron Rodgers' last trip to Minnesota altered the course of a promising season for the Green Bay Packers.\n\nHe broke his right collarbone in Week 6 in 2017 on a hit out of the pocket by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr. After a 4-1 start, the Packers stumbled the rest of the way and missed the playoffs.\n\nMaybe things will change for the better this time for the Packers when Rodgers returns to U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday, his first road game against the Vikings since the collarbone injury. At 4-5-1, the Packers desperately need a win to keep their postseason hopes alive.\n\n\"Yeah, obviously I think about that day, it was a tough day, especially going out there early in the game and the way we were rolling on offense and as a team through the first five games,\" Rodgers said after practice Wednesday. \"But I feel good. My body feels good.\"\n\nDifferent season, different injury.\n\nRodgers is getting better after hurting his left knee in the season opener this year against Chicago. In his first game after that injury in Week 2, the Packers and Vikings tied at 29 .\n\nThere have been challenging times since then for Green Bay. Rodgers' mobility was initially limited after the injury, but that has improved.\n\n\"I'm able to move around the way I want to move around. It's been a frustrating season at times injury-wise,\" Rodgers said. \"But you don't think about getting hurt. You just think about playing and trying to avoid some of those hits outside the pocket.\"\n\nThe Packers are winless in five road games this season. Part of the problem is they haven't been consistent in third-down situations. (19th in NFL). Now they face the league's best defense on third down.\n\n\"We want to win games and we've won a lot around here. We've got to find a way to get back on track,\" receiver Randall Cobb said this week.\n\nNot having Cobb in the lineup of late because of a hamstring injury has taken away a trusted option. Cobb might be closer to returning after being limited in practice on Wednesday.\n\n\"Well it hurts Randall not playing,\" Rodgers said. \"His ability in the slot is why he's stuck around the league for so long, and will long after this year.\"\n\nTight end Jimmy Graham broke a thumb during the first half of last week's loss at Seattle, though coach Mike McCarthy has said that Graham intends to try to play through the injury. Receiver Geronimo Allison is also on injured reserve with a groin issue.\n\nThat's three of Rodgers' top targets hurt, meaning the Packers have had to rely on rookies Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St. Brown more in the passing game.\n\nJake Kumerow, a star in training camp who showed chemistry with Rodgers before the receiver landed on injured reserve with a shoulder injury, returned to practice Wednesday. He could be a step closer to being activated.\n\n\"He's a talented guy and I think most of us were wondering if he was going to be back on the field this year,\" Rodgers said.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nS Kentrell Brice (ankle) was a limited participant. Among those missing practice were CB Bashaud Breeland (groin), S Raven Greene (ankle), CB Kevin King (hamstring) and LB Nick Perry (knee).\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Zay Jones can reflect on the past 18 months and see how much he's matured as a player and a person.\n\nLooking back, the Bills' second-year receiver realizes how ill-prepared he was entering the NFL as a second-round draft pick in 2017. Jones had the wild idea then in believing his success at East Carolina, where he set NCAA records for career and single-season receptions, would immediately translate at the professional level.\n\n\"You have to understand that things just don't happen like that,\" Jones said, snapping his fingers for emphasis.\n\n\"Things take time,\" he added. \"For me as a man, just understanding this league, how it goes and finally letting the dust settle with everything, I've learned a lot.\"\n\nIt's a hard-earned perspective gained from his season-long struggles as a rookie, followed by a frightening meltdown during which a bloodied and naked Jones was arrested \u2014 but not charged \u2014 after trashing a downtown Los Angeles apartment in February.\n\nJones, who still has scars on his right knee from the outburst, wouldn't change a thing if he could.\n\n\"It hurts sometimes because there's growth pains,\" he said. \"You don't understand what the NFL requires until you're in it. And hopefully, for some guys it's not too late.\"\n\nIt wasn't too late for Jones, who is beginning to show signs of emerging as a dependable receiver on a young and patchwork offense expected to have rookie Josh Allen back under center Sunday, when Buffalo (3-7) hosts Jacksonville (3-7).\n\nJones entered the bye week coming off a career-best outing. He had eight catches for 93 yards and a touchdown in a 41-10 win over the New York Jets on Nov. 11, with Matt Barkley starting for Buffalo. Jones now leads Buffalo with 37 catches for 392 yards and two TDs receiving. He's already passed last year's totals in catches (27) and yards (316) while matching his scoring output.\n\n\"I'm proud of myself, I wouldn't lie to you,\" Jones said. \"It was nice to just sit back during the bye week and recognize the things that I've done, but also know there's still a long ways ahead.\"\n\nIt's a far better place than where Jones was a year ago, when he was being criticized for dropping too many passes and not being on the same page with quarterback Tyrod Taylor. The most memorable incompletion came in the final seconds of a 9-3 loss at Carolina in Week 2, when Jones failed to bring down a pass near the goal line.\n\nThat's not the type of production anyone, including Jones, was expecting from a player who finished his college career with 399 catches, including 158 in his senior season.\n\nIn Jones' defense, he spent a portion of last season playing with a shoulder injury. It was also unfair to expect Jones to stand out amid a group of receivers mostly made up of rookies and journeymen.\n\nJones was disappointed by his lack of production and stung by the criticism.\n\n\"If people want to place the blame on me last year, sure I'll take it,\" he said. \"But it's helped me grow as a man. It's helped me grow as a football player. I've matured.\"\n\nHow much Jones matured wasn't immediately apparent in February, when security video showed him arguing with his brother before being arrested for vandalism. It didn't help that Jones required surgery to repair a knee injury, which sidelined him through the second week of training camp in August.\n\nJones won't go into detail, except to say what happened in Los Angeles could have cost him his life.\n\nHe will acknowledge having made mistakes.\n\n\"I'm a professional in what I do. And I take that criticism,\" Jones said. \"Is a lot of it deserved? Maybe some.\"\n\nCoach Sean McDermott is impressed by the maturity Jones showed in putting the past behind.\n\n\"He persevered, and that's a testament to Zay,\" McDermott said. \"He's still a work in progress, like we all are. But to be able to step back and learn and grow from those moments on the field and then off the field in February says a lot about him as a person.\"\n\nNOTES: DE Shaq Lawson did not practice a day after hurting his elbow. ... DE Trent Murphy, who has missed three games with a knee injury, practiced on a limited basis. ... LB Matt Milano has been cleared from the concussion protocol.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Ducks look to perhaps improve their bowl prospects. The Beavers' season ends regardless of the outcome.\n\nBut there are bragging rights.\n\n\"It's important for our players to understand how important this game is for everyone in this state. Houses divided, families divided. And that goes with the territory in a rivalry game,\" Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said. \"The motivation for us is extremely high. We didn't do too well the last time we were over there. So we talk about a lot of things that are motivating factors, but our team is motivated.\"\n\nThe Ducks (7-4, 4-4 Pac-12) are bowl-eligible but the most they can finish with is eight wins. It is looking increasingly likely that they'll land either in the Redbox Bowl or the Sun Bowl, but a win in the Civil War might get them a bid from the Holiday or Alamo.\n\nOregon's future also relies a bit on the results of the Apple Cup. If Washington State wins, then wins the Pac-12 championship and somehow lands a spot in the College Football Playoff, the Cougars would play in the one of the designated semifinal bowls. And the Rose Bowl would choose the representative from the Pac-12.\n\nBut that's getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nThe Beavers (2-9, 1-7) would like more than anything to collect another win in coach Jonathan Smith's first season. The former Oregon State quarterback was urging a level-headed approach.\n\n\"If you're going to play your best, you want the approach to be consistent,\" Smith said. \"Emotions do run high in rivalry games, but once you get into the game it comes down to execution.\"\n\nFriday will be the 122nd meeting between the two teams. Oregon has won nine of the last 10 meetings and holds a 64-47-10 all-time advantage.\n\nA few highlights \u2014 and lowlights \u2014 from past Civil Wars.\n\nLAST YEAR: Oregon State capped a turbulent year with a 69-10 loss to the Ducks at Autzen Stadium. Beavers coach Gary Andersen had abruptly left the team in the middle of the team's one-win season. Royce Freeman ran for 122 yards and two touchdowns and Justin Herbert passed for 251 yards and three scores. It was the final game of a one-year stint as head coach for Willie Taggart, who left for Florida State in early December.\n\nEARLY DAYS: Oregon State, then Oregon Agricultural College, won the first one 16-0 in a showdown between the \"Farmers\" and the \"Lemon-Yellows\" in front of some 500 fans. In 1916, Oregon beat OAC 27-0, giving the Ducks a 6-0-1 regular-season record and their first appearance in the Rose Bowl, where they topped Penn 14-0.\n\nPYRAMID PLAY: The 1933 game was notable because Oregon's extra-point attempt was blocked by Clyde Devine, who was lifted in the air by his teammates. The Ducks nonetheless defeated Oregon State 13-3, and the so-called Pyramid Play was later banned by the NCAA.\n\nTERRY BAKER: In 1962, the Beavers and their Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback trailed 17-6 at halftime but dominated the second half. Terry Baker's 13-yard touchdown pass to Danny Espalin in the fourth quarter sealed a 20-17 victory. Baker was the only Heisman Trophy winner from an Oregon school until Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota in 2014.\n\nGIANT KILLERS: A week after beating No. 1 USC and O.J. Simpson 3-0 in the mud in Corvallis, the Beavers' famous 1967 \"Giant Killers\" team came back from a 10-0 deficit to win the first Civil War at the new Autzen Stadium, 14-10.\n\nTOILET BOWL: A futile 0-0 tie on a blustery and wet day in November 1983 featured 11 fumbles, five interceptions and four missed field goals. It would go down as the last scoreless Division I college football game.\n\n\"It was almost like neither team wanted to win,\" Oregon coach Rich Brooks was quoted as saying.\n\nROSE BOWL BOUND: The Ducks entered the 1994 Civil War tied with USC for the Pac-10 championship and needed a win to clinch their first Rose Bowl berth since 1957. Trailing 13-10, Danny O'Neill drove the team 70 yards, hitting Dino Philyaw for a 19-yard touchdown with 3:47 to play, giving Oregon a 17-13 victory.\n\nTHE FLY SWEEP: The Beavers snapped a 10-game winning streak for the home team in the 2007 Civil War when freshman James Rodgers scored on a fly sweep for a 38-31 double-overtime victory. On Oregon's chance to answer, the Beavers stopped Jonathan Stewart on fourth-and-1 from the 16.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In fourballs you're always going to make birdies and hopefully you don't make any mistakes.\"\n\nPoulter has picked up 15 career points in Ryder Cup events for Europe over the United States. He had two in Europe's win in Paris in late September \u2014 one with Rory McIlroy in foursomes (he also lost with McIlory in foursomes) and a singles victory over Dustin Johnson.\n\nHe was happy with the way he and Hatton combined for the fourballs on Thursday.\n\n\"We dovetailed nicely, when one was out of position, the other one was in position and that's exactly what you have to do.\"\n\nLeishman said he and Smith, who will play in the next-to-last group Friday with Malaysia, need to avoid any early mistakes\n\n\"If you get off to an average start in foursomes, things can start going the wrong way pretty quickly,\" Leishman said.\n\nAn said he and Kim combined well to keep South Korea atop the leaderboard.\n\n\"I think we saved each other pretty good,\" An said. \"When he was struggling, I made some birdies, and when I was out (of the hole) he made some good par saves.\"\n\nThree teams were tied for fourth, one stroke behind \u2014 Belgium (Thomas Pieters and Thomas Detry), Malaysia (Gavin Green and Ben Leong) and Soren Kjeldsen and Thorbjorn Olesen, who won the title for Denmark by four strokes two years ago at nearby Kingston Heath.\n\nIndia (Anirban Lahiri and Gaganjeet Bhullar) and Ireland (Shane Lowry and Paul Dunne) were tied for seventh after 64s. The U.S. team of Kyle Stanley and Matt Kuchar was in a large group tied for 13th among 28 teams after a 66.\n\nOfficials moved up tee times for Thursday because of expected storms and showers which didn't eventuate. When the last group finished, the sun was shining and the wind had dropped off.\n\nRain is in the forecast for both Friday and Saturday, with a high temperature expected of only 14 Celsius (57 Fahrenheit) on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Thomas Watkins, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has authorized active-duty military troops stationed along the southwest border to use lethal force, if necessary, a significant escalation of the support role they had been tasked with that may run afoul of a 140-year-old law that generally bars the military from operating within U.S. boundaries.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly signed a memo late Tuesday expanding the mission of the 5,800 troops to include protecting Customs and Border Protection agents. That represents a sharp change in the orders given to troops currently deployed in California, Arizona and Texas, who had been lining the border with concertina wire and providing only logistical support to CBP personnel.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis confirmed the new guidelines to reporters on Wednesday but downplayed the level of interaction his troops will have with migrants. He said most troops aren\u2019t carrying weapons and that the military would stay away from civilian law enforcement roles such as arrests, which are forbidden under in the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nThe law prohibits the federal government from using the armed forces in a domestic police role, except in situations specifically authorized by the Constitution or Congress.\n\nMattis emphasized that he would use his expanded authorities only in response to a specific, detailed request from Secretary of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and that none has yet been made.\n\n\"I now have the authority to do more,\" Mattis told reporters. \"Now we'll see what she asks me.\"\n\nThe memo was first reported by the Military Times.\n\nMattis\u2019 assurances did little to quell criticism from advocacy groups worried about Trump\u2019s increasingly dangerous actions and rhetoric as thousands of migrants \u2014 mostly from Central America \u2014 line up in Tijuana, Mexico, and elsewhere to try to enter the country to request asylum. The president had previously suggested that troops would be allowed to fire upon migrants if any of them threw rocks at the U.S. troops, but neither the Pentagon nor the Department of Homeland Security backed up that assertion.\n\nWith the new orders, Michael Breen, president of Human Rights First, said the White House is officially \"upping the ante\" against migrants, and creating a hostile environment that could lead to deadly confrontations.\n\n\"This legally dubious 'cabinet order' creates confusion, undermines morale, and may very well lead to violence,\" Breen said. \"Americans should be thankful that those currently serving are likely to exhibit more judgment than their commander in chief.\"\n\nPublic Citizen, a liberal advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding the public release of Kelly's order to determine whether it violates the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\n\"The authorization of the military to use force within domestic borders is a matter of grave consequence for a nation under civilian rule,\" said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen. \"Kelly's order should be published immediately for the public to understand exactly what he has authorized, whether the Trump administration is violating the law and what risk of violence may await asylum-seekers.\"\n\nTrump, who is spending the Thanksgiving holiday at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, ordered the troops to the border following reports of a caravan of Central Americans inching its way toward the U.S. border. In the run-up to the midterm elections, he repeatedly described the caravan as an \u201cinvasion\u201d and returned to the issue in a tweet Wednesday evening.\n\n\"There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan. We will stop them. Catch and Detain!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"Judicial Activism, by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens, is putting our country in great danger. Not good!\"\n\nThere are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan. We will stop them. Catch and Detain! Judicial Activism, by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens, is putting our country in great danger. Not good! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nTrump was likely referring to a ruling from a California judge on Monday that halted the administration's attempts to bar migrants who enter the country illegally from applying for asylum.\n\nThe U.S. military has been deployed domestically to conduct law enforcement duties before, but only under laws passed by Congress.\n\nIn 1991, Congress passed a law that allows the Pentagon to assist federal and state law enforcement officials during domestic anti-drug operations. That led to a 1997 incident in Texas where a Marine on a drug-surveillance mission shot and killed an 18-year-old who was herding goats on his family's ranch.\n\nA Congressional Research Service report in April concluded that the military could be deployed, but only if it was limited to \u201ccertain types of support\u201d to law enforcement, such as conducting aerial surveillance, operating equipment, sharing intelligence and providing advice.\n\nBut the report said the administration would run into legal trouble if it tasked the military with conducting law enforcement activities.\n\n\"There must be a constitutional or statutory authority to use federal troops in a law enforcement capacity to stop aliens from entering the country unlawfully, or to apprehend gang members or seize contraband,\" the report found.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/21/white-house-approves-military-use-lethal-force-border-migrant-caravan/2082306002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "4 in NJ mansion killed by 'homicidal violence'", "description": "A homeowner, who died along with his wife and two children as their luxury home went up in flames, suffered a gunshot wound and all four are considered to be homicide victims, prosecutors in New Jersey said Wednesday.

(AP) \u2014 Even in limited minutes, Teaira McCowan is still doing things no Mississippi State player has done before.\n\nMcCowan made all 11 of her shots in 20 minutes of action on Wednesday, finishing with 24 points and 10 rebounds for her 43rd career double-double as the sixth-ranked Bulldogs made quick work of Furman in a 106-41 win.\n\nThe preseason Southeastern Conference Player of the Year became the first Mississippi State player to make 100 percent of her shots while attempting 10 or more field goals.\n\nIt helped McCowan to have production all around her. The Bulldogs made 12 of 20 3-point shots and had four other players score in double figures.\n\n\"We've got people knocking down shots on the outside, which frees it up for me to go 1-on-1 to the hole,\" McCowan said. \"My 1-on-1 game is pretty good, so I'm confident in that.\"\n\nThe Bulldogs (5-0) used a 30-0 run over 12 minutes of the first and second quarters to run away from the Paladins. Mississippi State led 60-18 at halftime.\n\nThe Bulldogs closed the third quarter on a 16-0 run and had 18 points in the period from McCowan for an 88-26 advantage.\n\n\"I thought Furman and those kids really competed,\" Mississippi State coach Vic Schaefer said. \"I just thought our kids did a good job of taking them out of what they wanted to do.\"\n\nLe'Jzae Davidson scored 17 points on 5-of-17 shooting from 3-point range to lead Furman (2-3).\n\nChloe Bibby had a career-high 21 points on 5-of-6 shooting from long range for the Bulldogs. Andra Espinoza-Hunter had 14 points, Anriel Howard scored 12 and Myah Taylor had 10.\n\nBibby came into the game shooting 52 percent from 3-point range and has already surpassed her 3-point total from last year.\n\n\"I didn't really think about my shot,\" Bibby said. \"If I get open, I'm going to shoot and today we found the extra pass and I was wide open. I was just happy to knock down the shots when I needed to do it.\"\n\nMississippi State shot 63 percent from the field. The Bulldogs out-rebounded the Paladins 45-24, forced 26 turnovers and dished out 28 assists.\n\n\"We're great in transition \u2014 this is one of our better ones, maybe our best,\" Schaefer said. \"If teams don't turn it over 26 times, are we good enough to execute things in the half court and still score? I think we're making shots right now and it's a whole lot easier game when you're making shots.\"\n\nCENTURY MARK AGAIN\n\nMississippi State hit the 100-point mark for the third straight game, the first time in school history it has accomplished that feat.\n\nAfter losing four seniors that helped make up the highest-scoring team in school history, MSU is averaging 96 points per game early in the year and has just one fewer 100-point game than it had all of last year.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFurman: Davidson enjoyed a solid 33 minutes of action against a top-10 team, but Furman otherwise had few positive takeaways.\n\nMississippi State: It was another tune-up game for a Bulldogs, who will see their schedule strengthen in December when they face Texas, Oregon and Marquette over a span of four games.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\"Trust me, all of the naysayers are out there. I feel them on the back of my neck saying, 'OK, let's see how they do in December.' I think we're playing well, but the naysayers are out there and that's my challenge to them.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Nothing has gone right for the Jacksonville Jaguars since early October.\n\nInjuries mounted, losses followed and all the momentum the franchise built during a surprising run in the AFC playoffs last year disappeared.\n\nThe team's six-game losing streak heading to Buffalo \u2014 a rematch from the 2017 postseason \u2014 has raised questions about what will happen in the offseason.\n\nSpoiler alert: Don't expect drastic changes.\n\nThe Jaguars (3-7) believe the rash of injuries they endured goes well beyond normal, especially since most occurred on the offensive side of the ball, and they would like to keep the core of the team together for a do-over in 2019.\n\n\"I don't even know if I've ever heard of something like this,\" offensive coordinator Nathanial Hackett said. \"Even asking Coach (Tom) Coughlin, this was actually I want to say probably Week 5 before it had actually gotten to this level, which you didn't think it could get much crazier, but even talking with him, I just remember he looked at me and said, 'This is a total abomination. I don't understand how this can happen.'\"\n\nIt was the first glimpse into how Coughlin, who's in charge of all football decisions, views the seemingly lost season.\n\nJacksonville played six games without running back and offensive centerpiece Leonard Fournette and lost three left tackles, two tight ends, leading receiver Marqise Lee and dynamic scat back Corey Grant. Many of those guys were placed on injured reserve early in the season.\n\nThe Jags haven't looked the same since.\n\n\"Having some key guys go down, a good amount of them on the offensive side of the ball, kind of changes things,\" quarterback Blake Bortles said. \"You have to find a way. That's going to happen. You're going to lose guys, you're going to have guys get hurt.\n\n\"You have to be able to have guys that can plug in and play and continue to find ways to win football games. We have struggled doing that. I have no idea what they are thinking or what they are going to do. I know we have six more chances to try and persuade them one way or another.\"\n\nThe first one comes against the Bills (3-7), who were eliminated from the playoffs with a 10-7 loss in Jacksonville in January.\n\nBortles completed 12 of 23 passes for 87 yards and a touchdown in that one. He was clearly off, but he avoided turnovers and scrambled for several key first late that allowed the Jaguars to milk the clock.\n\nBortles played well the next two weeks and was rewarded with a three-year, $54 million contract in February. He's been the team's biggest disappointment since , but the Jaguars are quick to point out all the injuries and inconsistency surrounding him.\n\nThe offensive line has been a mess, most notably because of injuries to left tackle Cam Robinson, backup Josh Wells, third-teamer Josh Walker, center Brandon Linder and guard A.J. Cann.\n\nJacksonville's receiving corps has done little to help Bortles out. Receiver Keelan Cole is tied for the league lead with seven dropped passes, and third-down running back T.J. Yeldon is close behind with five. Receivers DJ Chark and Rashad Greene also had outcome-altering miscues late in recent weeks.\n\nThe once-vaunted defense has been better of late as the team has started to re-establish its physical identity.\n\nNonetheless, there will be changes ahead. Just not a complete makeover. Even Bortles appears safe considering he's due to count $21 million against the salary cap in 2019. Cutting him would still cost Jacksonville $16.5 million.\n\n\"Injuries are part of it as drastic as it may be. I am not going to be that guy\" who blames injuries, coach Doug Marrone said. \"I have to do a better job, like I have said before. I am going to take responsibility for what I have to do, and at the end of the day, I can live with that. ... You are put in a leadership role. You have to take responsibility. It is very easy to look at it and point fingers or say things and make excuses. The best part of being a head coach is the job is so clearly defined. More than any other job in an organization. It is defined by winning games.\n\n\"When you are not, you are not doing your job. When you do, you have done a good job. Don't sit there too long and gloat. You have to get on to the next one because you have to keep playing.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Houston Texans didn't pick until the third round in this year's draft.\n\nThat hasn't stopped them from getting plenty of contributions from their unsung rookies, led by Justin Reid, a third-round pick whose 101-yard interception return for a TD helped Houston extend its winning streak to seven games last week.\n\nHouston did not have a pick in the first two rounds after trading a first-round pick to Cleveland in 2017 to move up to get quarterback Deshaun Watson at No. 12. They previously sent their second-round pick in the 2018 draft to the Browns as part of the deal to get rid of Brock Osweiler.\n\nBecause of those moves their first pick this year was at No. 68 and they used it to select Reid, a safety from Stanford. They got center Martinas Rankin and tight end Jordan Akins later in the third round; picked up receiver Keke Coutee in the fourth; and added tight end Jordan Thomas in the sixth.\n\n\"Those guys have really been an impressive class just from a personal standpoint \u2014 maturity, work ethic and they really work hard to improve, and they understand their role on the team, their spot on the team,\" coach Bill O'Brien said.\n\n\"Guys in that class are very respectful of the veterans in the locker room. I think they've added a lot to the chemistry of the locker room.\"\n\nReid has appeared in every game for the Texans, has 53 tackles and leads the team with three interceptions. He might have had a leg up on most rookies because his older brother, Eric, is a six-year NFL veteran who recently returned to the NFL with Carolina. Justin said the two used to sit outside the house and break down film when he was still in college.\n\nHe knows it's sometimes difficult for lower draft picks to contribute so quickly, but believes the success of this rookie class has been important to Houston's turnaround.\n\n\"You need that,\" he said. \"All good teams you need your role players to play well. You need guys to step up in big-time situations and make some plays. That's one of the best things about this team is we don't know week to week who's going to come up and make a big play ... and when you have guys all around the field making plays and able to contribute to a team win, that's when you know you have a good thing going.\"\n\nVeteran defensive back Tyrann Mathieu agreed and raved about Houston's rookie class.\n\n\"I hear a lot of people talk about our leadership, obviously, coming from an 0-3 start, but I would probably say that our young guys have really helped us out a lot, too,\" he said. \"Just their character ... just those guys showing up to work every day. That's all you can ask for from rookies.\"\n\nRankin has appeared in each game with three starts, and Akins, Thomas and Coutee have also contributed on offense. Coutee has played a bigger role since Will Fuller suffered a season-ending knee injury, and he has 26 receptions for 273 yards and a touchdown.\n\nAkins has 11 receptions for 131 yards. Thomas has 10 receptions for 138 yards and has become a favorite red-zone target of Watson and has three short touchdowns.\n\nCoutee said a key to finding success as a rookie is making sure the veterans know they can count on you.\n\n\"Just earning everybody's trust and showing everyone that you can play and that you belong, as well,\" he said. \"Once you get these guys' trust in this locker room, then you can make plays, and that's what a lot of our rookies are doing this year.\"\n\nReid credits his success this season to the work he puts in off the field and estimates that he spends 10-12 hours a week at home doing extra work to make sure he's prepared for the games.\n\n\"You should see my IPad and the notes that I take,\" he said. \"I take notes on everything and I study it, and I'm a film rat and I love to be able to see things on tape. And when you see it over and over on film, then you see it in the game, you can almost anticipate it. And then you combine that with the leadership you have on this team and just with experience with having reps, things just slow down more and more.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

At right is (AP Photo/Mark Black) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 The arrival of Kirk Cousins has provided the Minnesota Vikings the stability at quarterback they've sought for years, and the recipient of that unprecedented $84 million fully guaranteed contract has helped take their passing attack to a higher level.\n\nStill, at the 10-game mark of his debut season, Cousins and the Vikings offense remain a work in progress. Their two lowest yardage totals of the year have come in each of the past two games, they've gained fewer rushing yards than every team in the NFL but one, and their 16 turnovers are the fourth most in the league. After falling at first-place Chicago on Sunday night, they're 1\u00bd games behind the Bears in the NFC North .\n\n\"I'd like to think I'll be a better quarterback come this Sunday and the rest of the season,\" Cousins said, looking ahead to the game against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nIn the six games left for Minnesota (5-4-1), only one opposing defense, the Bears, is currently in the top 10 in the NFL in fewest yards allowed.\n\nNow's the time for the Vikings to consistently produce enough points to complement the vaunted defense that's back in form after some earlier trouble.\n\nWith a new quarterback in Cousins and a new coordinator in John DeFilippo, there were bound to be some bumps on the road to offensive rhythm. This midseason regression, triggered largely by fumbles and interceptions, has arisen past the point of chalking it up to transitional challenges.\n\n\"For the most part, what we're really talking about is not beating ourselves,\" running back Latavius Murray said, \"especially in very, very critical situations.\"\n\nThe timing of these struggles has appeared especially concerning in the context of the rest of the league, in a week when the Los Angeles Rams beat the Kansas City Chiefs 54-51 and the New Orleans Saints scored at least 45 points for the third straight game .\n\nThose are the teams with the three best records in the league, raising the question about whether this team can truly be considered a Super Bowl contender, let alone return to the NFC championship game.\n\nCoach Mike Zimmer, without prompting, wondered aloud this week whether DeFilippo and the Vikings were calling too complicated of a game plan.\n\n\"I don't know if learning to play together is quite the thing. We do have a lot of guys going in different spots. It might be ... a little too much volume,\" Zimmer said.\n\n\"Let's just play football, you know? You run a really good out route, you run the out route. He runs a good curl, he runs the curl. You know what I mean? So maybe we just need to focus a little bit on not trying to trick the other team quite so much.\"\n\nZimmer added: \"It might be the best play in the world \u2014 Vince Lombardi might have designed it \u2014 but if you can't execute it, it doesn't do you any good.\"\n\nCertainly, the offensive line is a major part of this equation, with not only more pressure allowed on Cousins than desired, but a concerning amount of running plays stopped at the line of scrimmage or in the backfield.\n\nMurray and Cook, who lost a fumble at the Bears 14-yard line on the second possession in one of the most crucial mistakes of that game, had no room to run in the first three quarters before the Vikings entered must-pass mode in an attempt to catch up.\n\nThe hamstring injury that kept Cook out of five games earlier this season was a significant blow to the offense, but even when he's been in action the Vikings have also been unable to get screen passes going the way they often did last year.\n\nAs dominant as Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs have been down the field, there's simply an element or two that's been lacking from this group overall in most of the games this season.\n\nOf course, the story of a team's success can start and end with turnovers, which have proven to be a consistent problem for Cousins.\n\nThough miscommunications with receivers, whiffs by offensive linemen and shaky handoffs with running backs have factored in, Cousins has been charged with 13 of the 16 turnovers.\n\nThe play that essentially sealed the victory for the Bears was an interception return for a touchdown by Eddie Jackson in the fourth quarter .\n\n\"Other than the turnovers, I have a hard time faulting him,\" Zimmer said. \"This kid is tough. He plays outstanding. He works his rear end off. He's a great team guy.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Accountability has become a common theme in the Philadelphia Eagles' locker room.\n\nThe team relied on strong brotherhood and camaraderie to overcome a lot of adversity and capture the franchise's first Super Bowl title last season. Now, players are questioning whether their teammates have enough drive and desire.\n\nLast week, center Jason Kelce said \"there was a much greater level of accountability from a cohesive standpoint\" in 2017.\n\nOn Tuesday, safety Malcolm Jenkins said \"the demeanor of the team really bothered me\" in a 48-7 loss to the Saints.\n\nCoach Doug Pederson and quarterback Carson Wentz responded to Jenkins' comments in different ways Wednesday.\n\n\"I talk about ownership quite a bit, and I think some of his comments are directed toward him,\" Pederson said of Jenkins. \"He'll own that. And I think it kind of sends a message a little bit to everybody. We're all held to a higher standard, and it starts with me. I lean on our leadership of this football team quite a bit and ask that if they see something, to respond. I don't think he is addressing it to one particular person. I think it's a whole, it's a group, and we all need to kind of step our game up.\"\n\nAfter Jenkins got beaten by Alvin Kamara for a 37-yard touchdown catch on fourth-and-7 in the fourth quarter and the Saints already leading by 31 points, Jenkins raised two middle fingers to his former head coach Sean Payton. Then he slammed his helmet to the turf on the sideline.\n\nWentz was visibly frustrated after throwing an interception earlier in the game and punched the air as he walked toward the bench.\n\n\"We all have a ton of respect for his opinion and how he sees things, and we all see things a little differently,\" Wentz said of Jenkins. \"What I said after the game is that we won't be a team that quits. We won't be a team that lays down. There's something that we can see on film from how we handled our body language and different things like that, myself included, that's uncharacteristic of who we are. It's really up to the leaders, Malcolm, myself, other leaders to hold everyone accountable and keep plugging along.\"\n\nThe Eagles were a close-knit group last season on their way to a 13-3 record. Players stood up for each other, supported one another and it was evident in how they overcame a slew of injuries to key starters. Wentz was having an MVP-caliber season when he tore two knee ligaments in Week 14. But Nick Foles stepped in and ended up becoming the Super Bowl MVP after leading Philadelphia past Tom Brady and the Patriots, 41-33.\n\nThat seems far longer than only nine months ago. The Eagles (4-6) have lost two in a row and will try to snap a three-game home losing streak when they host the New York Giants (3-7) on Sunday.\n\n\"They're disappointed. We're all disappointed. The season has not gone the way we anticipated coming out of training camp,\" Pederson said. \"So we continue to fight every single day in practice. ... This is one of the things I love about this football team, there isn't a ton of finger pointing. You might take Malcolm's comments as finger pointing or Kelce's; it's not. They're talking about themselves, too, right? They hold themselves accountable. I hold myself accountable, and then collectively we can do that as a group.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Florida State has played in a bowl in each season since 1982 and is looking to extend the streak.

USA TODAY\n\nMichigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh. (Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOne week into this season, after another offensively inept loss in a high-profile game, the hot takes about Jim Harbaugh were flying like Roman candles on the Fourth of July. Would Michigan actually consider firing him? Would he admit defeat by running back to the NFL? Had all the buzz about returning to his alma mater in 2015 been one big con job?\n\nThe skeptics were not without merit. Forty games into his Michigan tenure, what had Harbaugh really accomplished aside from a resounding win over eventual Big Ten champ Penn State in 2016, beating Jim McElwain twice at Florida and irritating SEC Network host Paul Finebaum?\n\nBut if 10-1 Michigan does what it\u2019s supposed to do on Saturday and beats Ohio State, it will be time for a narrative correction. In fact, it should be good enough to make Harbaugh the national coach of the year.\n\nThough his job was never on the line, nobody in college football was under more pressure to deliver than Harbaugh, whose norm-breaking, self-promoting style has not only gotten under his opponents\u2019 skin but made him a target for derision over the first three years of his tenure when the Wolverines did not do better than third place in the Big Ten East.\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that was by design. Harbaugh, who is anything but dumb, inherited a Michigan program that was largely in disarray and badly in need of a modern identity to freshen the staid tradition that the school always had relied on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Michigan,\u201d Harbaugh\u2019s predecessor, Brady Hoke, would often say, which was as impressive to recruits from outside the state as a box of yams. You might as well have been sending them snail mail and calling them on rotary phones.\n\nHarbaugh\u2019s willingness to continually make himself the center of attention, whether it was picking fights on Twitter with Butch Jones and Kirby Smart, doing spring practice at IMG Academy in Florida, taking his team to Rome and Paris or setting up so-called satellite camps in Georgia and Alabama had everything to do with making Michigan relevant nationally in a way it hadn\u2019t been since the mid-1990s.\n\nAt some point, though, parlor tricks and social media distractions weren\u2019t going to cut it. Harbaugh needed to win big this season or risk being reduced to a sideshow that only bothered the nation\u2019s truly elite programs from February through August.\n\nIt appears he\u2019s finally poised to deliver.\n\nThough the told-you-sos will be fierce Saturday if Michigan comes up short in what appears to be the Wolverines\u2019 best chance to beat Ohio State since Urban Meyer came on the scene, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the preseason consensus in both media polls and the Amway Coaches Poll was that Michigan would finish fourth in the East behind Ohio State, Michigan State and Penn State. Given the Wolverines\u2019 schedule, which included Wisconsin and a non-conference opener at Notre Dame, it was easier to see four losses than one or two.\n\nMichigan Wolverines running back Karan Higdon. (Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nInstead, what happened is that many of the players who were part of Harbaugh\u2019s early barnstorming blitz such as defensive tackle Rashan Gary, cornerback Lavert Hill and receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones have matured into the kind of upperclassmen that can contend for titles, just as their recruiting rankings indicated. Even Karan Higdon, a three-star running back from Florida who signed shortly after Harbaugh got the job, has become a massive success story with more than 2,000 rushing yards over the last two seasons.\n\nThe point is, while everyone was focused on the antics, Harbaugh was doing the necessary work to build a program.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t perfect. There were legitimate questions about why someone with such an esteemed reputation for working with quarterbacks couldn\u2019t find someone to competently run his offense until Ole Miss transfer Shea Patterson became available this year. More important, the results in rivalry games weren\u2019t there, though you can chalk some of that up to bad luck (his Michigan r\u00e9sum\u00e9 would look a lot different if not for a blocked punt at the buzzer in 2015 against Michigan State and a questionable spot against Ohio State in 2016).\n\nAdd it all up and it didn\u2019t seem likely after Michigan\u2019s 24-17 loss to Notre Dame in Week 1 that we\u2019d be sitting here in late November talking about how the Wolverines are favored to beat the Buckeyes in Columbus and primed to make the College Football Playoff.\n\nBut regardless of the Ohio State game, what they\u2019ve accomplished is truly impressive. Michigan is No. 1 in the country in total defense by a margin of nearly 20 yards per game over Clemson, No. 4 in scoring defense at 13.5 points per game, tied for 14th in turnover margin and ninth among Power Five schools in rushing. Their so-called revenge tour has brought the Wolverines resounding wins over Wisconsin, Michigan State and Penn State. And their dominance since the Notre Dame game has put them solidly into the No. 4 position in the playoff rankings, which probably correlates with why Harbaugh has been far more subdued and out of the spotlight this year. He's letting his team do the talking.\n\nNone of that is enough for Harbaugh\u2019s many critics, who need to see him deliver a Big Ten title before admitting that he\u2019s justified the massive contract Michigan gave him. But if he beats Ohio State, it\u2019s not only time to end the debate over whether he\u2019s worth it, it\u2019s time to hand him the trophy for coach of the year."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Nate Davis, USA TODAY", "title": "USA TODAY Sports' Week 12 NFL picks: Who wins on Thanksgiving tripleheader?", "description": "Thanksgiving provides its typical NFL tripleheader before we move into a 12-course meal for the remainder of the weekend.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/usa-today-week-12-nfl-picks-predictions-thanksgiving/2082304002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/2cdb0a08-d950-49e7-81b3-f17c20a7b55d-NFLPicks13_Thanksgiving.png?crop=842,474,x843,y822&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:21:22Z", "content": "SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes gives you a sure thing and an upset heading into Week 12 of the NFL.

Everyone from the Red Cross to entities such as the San Francisco 49ers, Raley\u2019s markets and Rite Aid have contributed to a swelling $5 million pot, says Alexa Benson-Valaranis, CEO of the area\u2019s Chico-based North Valley Community Foundation.\n\nVolunteers Paul Aggers and Izzy Taylor distribute free food to neighbors in need in Chico, Calif. on Nov. 13, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 The Oakland Raiders will not get the No. 1 overall pick in next year's draft if quarterback Derek Carr has any say in it.\n\nFor the 15th time in the last 16 seasons, the Raiders will finish no better than .500, and that's if they run the table over the final six weeks.\n\nBarring a sudden turnaround Oakland is headed for another top five pick in the draft. The Raiders are tied with the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals for the worst record in the NFL at 2-8. Based on strength of schedule, the 49ers own the top overall pick followed by the Cardinals and the Raiders.\n\nOakland held the No. 1 spot until beating Arizona last week to snap a five-game losing streak.\n\nCarr is determined to keep the Raiders out of that position again.\n\n\"I want to mess up the draft,\" Carr said Wednesday. \"I don't want the first pick. I want to win all these games. I want everybody to be mad at me for that. That's what I want to accomplish.\"\n\nSince the merger in 1970 the Raiders have had the first overall pick one other time \u2014 in 2007 when they drafted quarterback JaMarcus Russell. Russell lasted just three seasons and is widely considered one of the biggest busts in NFL history.\n\nThe Raiders had high hopes when the year began, with both owner Mark Davis and coach Jon Gruden talking hopefully of a Super Bowl before the team relocates to Las Vegas for the 2020 season.\n\nThose plans were derailed early when the team lost nine of its first 10 games. With the focus now on the future, the Raiders are hopeful of getting better through the draft.\n\nThrough a series of trades that sent Khalil Mack to the Chicago Bears and Amari Cooper to the Dallas Cowboys, they have three first-round picks in 2019 and two more in 2020.\n\nCarr, the 36th overall pick in 2014, has repeatedly brushed aside talk of the Raiders tanking in order to get the No. 1 pick and said it's more important for the team to establish a winning tone.\n\n\"For us as an offense it's really just building continuity,\" Carr said \"We've got a lot of young guys playing. We've got a lot of new guys playing. Everyone sees what's going on, what we're having to deal with but why not just go out and win some games? That would be so cool for this group to be able to hold onto.\"\n\nCarr will have to do some more adjusting to make that happen.\n\nWith wide receivers Jordy Nelson (knee) and Martavis Bryant (PCL) questionable, the Raiders signed Keon Hatcher off Green Bay's practice squad. Hatcher was on Oakland's 53-man roster coming out of training camp before being waived to make room for Bryant.\n\nThe Raiders also lost Brandon LaFell to an Achilles injury suffered against the Cardinals. LaFell was placed on injured reserve this week.\n\n\"Love Keon,\" Carr said. \"He's so competitive. That's the moral of the story with the guys coach keeps around. They're super competitive. You're going to see him do the dirty work.\"\n\nNotes: Wide receiver Johnny Holton was activated from the practice squad. Holton had been taking reps as a defensive back after beginning the season at receiver. With Oakland's injury issues at the position, Holton was switched back to offense. . Nose tackle Justin Ellis returned to practice for the first time since suffering a foot injury in Week 1. Ellis is the team's best run defender but Gruden declined to say whether he would be activated this week. . Wide receiver Saeed Blacknall and cornerback Arrion Springs were signed to the practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The Tennessee Titans are back in wait-and-see mode with Marcus Mariota.\n\nThe quarterback is trying to recover from a stinger that knocked him out of their last game. Mariota said Wednesday that the stinger, which came from a hit to his head in last week's 38-10 loss to the Colts, left him with some numbness in his throwing arm. But Mariota said the injury is not related to the nerve issue in his elbow that cost him playing time in September.\n\nMariota also said his grip holding a ball is fine. He wore a partial glove for five games to help him grab the ball better when recovering from the injured elbow.\n\n\"Basically one of those deals again with the nerves,\" Mariota said. \"Just feeling down my right arm wasn't totally there, so it's just one of those deals you just kind of got to wait and see for the nerve to calm down and things should be good.\"\n\nMariota took part in individual drills Wednesday. The Titans will not issue an injury report until Thursday with their next game Monday night in Houston (7-3), though coach Mike Vrabel said Mariota was limited.\n\n\"We're hopeful that he'll progress as the week goes on,\" Vrabel said.\n\nThe elbow injury kept Mariota out of the second game this season, a 20-17 victory over Houston. The Titans (5-5) desperately need a victory to pull within a game in the AFC South going into the final month of the season for a team looking for a second straight playoff berth.\n\nThe No. 2 pick overall in 2015 out of Oregon has missed eight starts in his Tennessee career, though Mariota came off the bench in Week 3 in Jacksonville after backup Blaine Gabbert was knocked out of the game with a concussion.\n\nThe quarterback needs only 10 more passing attempts to qualify for career completion marks in both the NFL and franchise history with at least 1,500 attempts. Once he throws his 10th pass, Mariota will top the late Steve McNair in both the highest career completion percentage in team history at 62.6 percent and passer rating at 88.5.\n\nMariota still has his doubters on whether he's the quarterback for this franchise long-term. The Titans picked up his fifth-year option for 2019 at a price of $20.9 million, but the offense in the first season with coordinator Matt LaFleur has struggled mightily. Tennessee ranks 30th in both total offense and yards passing (183.7 yards per game). The Titans rank 28th in points scored.\n\nHe's already been sacked 29 times this season \u2014 more than each of the past two seasons when he played 15 games apiece. Mariota was sacked 38 times in 12 times as a rookie playing 12 games.\n\nThe Titans have an extra day of preparation and healing with the Monday night game. Mariota says he doesn't believe he needs a \"whole lot\" of practice to be able to play.\n\n\"I feel like I've played enough ball that if it comes down to it, I'm feeling good enough to go out there and play I'll be ready,\" Mariota said.\n\nVrabel said they believe practice is important.\n\n\"Certainly there's a fine line between trying to get a guy back and practicing,\" Vrabel said.\n\nNotes: Titans defensive coordinator Dean Pees, who spent Sunday night in a hospital, returned to work Tuesday. He was on the field Wednesday at practice. \"He is back, and we are thankful to have him back here, and I would say healthy,\" Vrabel said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

This year's Museum Store Sunday is Nov. 25. (Photo: Fine Art Museums of San Francisco)\n\nLet\u2019s face it. By the Sunday after Thanksgiving, you\u2019re exhausted. You cooked. You ate. You cleaned. You watched football and parades. And you absolutely need to escape the relatives.\n\nOn Black Friday, you braved crowds for disappointing sales. You had a great time shopping on Small Business Saturday, but you still have a few hard-to-shop-for people on your list. It\u2019s time to support a different kind of small business \u2013 the museum stores.\n\nNine years ago, an important new date was added to the Thanksgiving week calendar: Small Business Saturday, bringing millions of customers into the small and local businesses that are the backbone of communities. Now, there\u2019s a new day worthy of your holiday attention: Museum Store Sunday, this year on Nov. 25.\n\n\u201cThe general public already loves shopping in museum stores, because they know they\u2019re sure to find something different,\u201d says Julie Steiner, director of retail operations at the Barnes Foundation, a Philadelphia Museum. \u201cMuseum Store Sunday gives people a chance to support local businesses, give back to the community through local nonprofit museums, support good causes, find unique holiday gifts and enjoy an entertaining and educational experience at favorite museums, all at the same time.\u201d\n\nI have been in love with museum stores for years. I buy most of my jewelry, interesting housewares and many gifts in museum stores. The merchandise is interesting, attractive and surprisingly affordable. I love knowing I\u2019m not only supporting a local cultural institution, but an individual artist. And I know I\u2019m going to get compliments.\n\nYou can find a list of museums participating in Museum Store Sunday at https://museumstoresunday.org/participating-museums/. Many are offering significant discounts.\n\nMore: These 8 retailers can't afford a disappointing 2018 holiday shopping season\n\nMore: Store credit cards: How to get the most out of them during the holidays\n\nMore: Picture your small business on Instagram: Here are some best practices\n\nLots of retail stores like to throw around the term \u201ccurate\u201d when describing how they choose products for their stores. The people behind museum stores literally are curators. So they know how to find items that are unique, appealing, useful. You\u2019ll find something for everyone on your gift list at museum stores: jewelry, clothing and scarves, housewares and home d\u00e9cor, books, desk accessories, postcards, artwork, games and puzzles.\n\nHere are just a few examples:\n\n\u2022 A beautiful apron packed in a pie pan ($29.95) at the Oakland (California) Museum, https://shop.museumca.org/collections/home/products/apron-in-a-pie-dish;\n\n\u2022 A child\u2019s astronaut suit ($49.99) from the Cosmophere Space Museum in Hutchinson, Kansas, http://shop.cosmo.org/space-suits-and-jackets/orange-astronaut-suit-child;\n\n\u2022 A cobalt and cream bead necklace ($54.95) at the Detroit (MI) Institute of the Arts https://diashop.org/manabi-tagua-necklace-cobalt-cream/\n\nYou can get a better idea of some of the types of products at the Museum Store Sunday gallery page, which includes information about how to get a 25 percent discount, https://museumstoresunday.org/product-gallery/\n\nLet\u2019s clear up three myths about museum stores:\n\n1. Museum stores are for the elite only.\n\nNinety-five percent of museum stores don\u2019t charge admission, according to the Museum Store Association.\n\n2. Museum stores are expensive.\n\nMuseums have gotten smart; they have products at all price points. The top-selling items are at the lower end of the price scale. Of course, you will find some handmade, one-of-a-kind items, such as unique jewelry and other objects made of precious materials among the small handful of items that command big prices.\n\n3. Museum stores sell only \u201cartsy\u201d stuff.\n\nNot all museums are art museums. On Museum Store Sunday, you can choose from a wide range of museums: history or natural history, nature or botanical gardens, science and technology, performing arts, military, air and space, anthropology, ethnic/cultural, zoos and aquariums and more.\n\nLet\u2019s say you need to buy something for your brother-in-law, who wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in an art museum. You might give him a Campbell\u2019s soup can decoy safe ($12.99) from the International Spy Museum http://spymuseumstore.org/campbells-chicken-noodle-soup-decoy-can-safe/\n\nWhen you shop at a museum store, you support not only the important work of museums, but also the local artisans and small producers that supply these small shops.\n\n\u201cMuseum Store Sunday pairs with Small Business Saturday because both events encourage shoppers to support the local community, whether at an indie bookstore or museum,\u201d says Stuart Hata, chair of the MSA\u2019s marketing and communications committee.\n\n\u201cMuseum stores are indies because we all are independent and unique to each of our institutions. Whether we\u2019re the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco or the New York Historical Society or the Columbia River Maritime Museum in Washington state, we are all a fabric of the local community. And by supporting your local institution, you are supporting your local community,\u201d Hata says.\n\nRhonda Abrams is author of \u201cSix-Week Start-Up\u201d just released in its fourth edition and other books for small business owners.

Gore played for the Colts last season, and at 35 he has no plans to retire. (AP Photo/Mike Roemer, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDAVIE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The subject was playing through pain, and Miami Dolphins running back Frank Gore drew on his extensive experience to share his thoughts with teammate Ryan Tannehill.\n\nGore's an ageless model of durability, while Tannehill plans to return from a throwing shoulder injury and start for only the sixth time in the Dolphins' past 31 games when they play Sunday at Indianapolis .\n\n\"He knows how much we need him,\" Gore said. \"It's football, though. Everybody is going to be in pain from here on out. Talking to him when he wasn't playing, he wanted to be out there. He knows that he's going to be in pain, but you can tell that he wants to play, so that's a plus for us.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Gore will be in the lineup too, which almost goes without saying. He'll start his 119th consecutive game, by far the most of any active running back.\n\nThat includes 48 games with the Colts in 2015-17. They then let Gore go, providing him with a little extra motivation when he faces his former team.\n\nNot that he needs any.\n\n\"I want to win,\" he said. \"I'm going to go out there and try to be me.\"\n\nThe Colts know he'll do that, and remember Gore fondly.\n\n\"He's the kind of teammates everyone wants to have,\" Indy quarterback Andrew Luck said. \"He always seemed like he was a step ahead, and I'd say, 'How did you know that?' And it was always hard for him to explain. He just knew.\"\n\nThe Dolphins (5-5) can count Gore as one of the bright spots in a season full of downers. He beat out the more explosive Kenyan Drake for the starting job and leads the team with 528 yards rushing, padding a career total that is the highest among active players and fourth on the all-time list.\n\nAnd this year may not be his swan song. Gore's yards per carry average of 4.5 is his best since 2012 with San Francisco. Anyone who has watched him break tackle after tackle this year can believe he'll be back at 36.\n\n\"I feel like as long as I'm healthy and blessed and feeling good and know I can still play, I'm going to play,\" he said. \"I'll evaluate myself at the end, my body, and see if I still want to go out in the offseason and train to get ready for another year. That's when I'll make my decision.\"\n\nHe's already a rarity at a position not known for longevity. Last week he became the first player to rush for 500 yards in 14 consecutive seasons, one more than Hall of Famers Walter Payton and Emmitt Smith.\n\nThe achievement won Gore plaudits from around the NFL \u2014 and beyond.\n\n\"Frank is my favorite player of all-time that I've ever coached,\" said former 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh, who is now at the University of Michigan. \"Surpassing Walter Payton and Emmitt Smith is incredible, just incredible.\"\n\nEqually impressed \u2014 but not surprised \u2014 is Dolphins coach Adam Gase. He was a 49ers assistant in 2008, when Gore ran for 1,036 yards for them.\n\n\"Our guys watch him practice, and it's almost like you forget where he's at in his career,\" Gase said. \"He treats it like he's an undrafted free agent almost. He practices extremely hard. He finishes everything he does. There's a lot of pride there. Seeing him 10 years ago and then seeing him now, there's just not a lot of differences in how he plays and what he can do.\"\n\nGore is still chasing a Super Bowl championship ring, and hasn't been to the playoffs in five years. He thought he would get there with the Colts, but injuries to Luck and others sabotaged their chances.\n\n\"It just didn't go the way I planned it, but I had fun,\" Gore said. \"The organization was great. Great people there. We fought.\"\n\nIt has been more of the same in Gore's native Miami, with his homecoming undermined by a wave of injuries to Tannehill and others.\n\nMeanwhile, the old man at running back just keeps showing up for work. Others may be surprised Gore is still going strong, but he's not.\n\n\"I know how I train,\" he said. \"I know how I go out every day in practice. I know in the offseason how I get myself ready. Competing with guys younger than me at my position, being around them every day, that helps me.\"\n\nAnd he learned a long time ago how to play through pain.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Michael Marot in Indianapolis and Larry Lage in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jim Cowsert, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Colt McCoy silenced his phone knowing he was coming back to his home state for his first NFL start in four years, in the stadium where he helped lead the Texas Longhorns to a shot at a national title as their star quarterback and where he last won a game as a pro.\n\nThe longtime Washington backup also knows what's most important as he takes over following Alex Smith's season-ending leg injury . The Redskins (6-4) can control the NFC East by beating the rival Dallas Cowboys (5-5) in the most traditional of Thanksgiving games Thursday.\n\n\"I'm thankful for the opportunity, but I think it's even more than that,\" McCoy said. \"It's time to just go play and put everything else aside. We have a huge game this week. It's a huge game.\"\n\nMcCoy is 2-0 at AT&T Stadium, beating Nebraska for the 2009 Big 12 championship and a spot in the BCS championship game, which Texas lost to Alabama when McCoy got hurt early. The small-town Texas kid beat the Cowboys five years later, completing 25 of 30 passes for 299 yards in a 20-17 overtime win for the Redskins.\n\nHe's 32 now, and hasn't started since the last of three straight defeats late in the 2014 season, a little more than a month removed from that win over the Cowboys. McCoy, a third-round pick by Cleveland in 2010 after that title-game loss to the Crimson Tide, has a career record of 7-18.\n\nMcCoy is in his fifth year as Washington's backup and has played just four games over four seasons, including when he replaced Smith in the third quarter of Sunday's 23-21 loss to Houston. A potential winning drive stalled near midfield, and Dustin Hopkins' 63-yard field goal try fell short with 3 seconds left.\n\n\"It's been a while since he's played in a significant game. That'll be the challenge,\" coach Jay Gruden said.\n\n\"I know he's excited as heck, man. He hated to get the opportunity the way he got it with Alex getting hurt. I understand that. But deep down inside, he's been waiting for this.\"\n\nDallas running back Ezekiel Elliott has been waiting for another Thanksgiving game since he had to miss last year on his six-game suspension over domestic violence allegations. In his Thanksgiving debut against the Redskins two years ago as a rookie, he jumped into the giant Salvation Army red kettle after a touchdown in a 31-26 Dallas win.\n\nThe Cowboys have a chance to tie the Redskins for the division lead thanks to their first winning streak of the season, a pair of victories on the road after they were winless in their first four away from home.\n\n\"We said this a couple weeks ago, though; we knew that the division was still in front of us,\" quarterback Dak Prescott said. \"Our backs are still against the wall. We know what this game means. We know how important this game is.\"\n\nBIG RETURNS\n\nWashington could get a major boost if any combination of left tackle Trent Williams, running back Chris Thompson, wide receiver Jamison Crowder and cornerback Quinton Dunbar can return from lengthy injury absences.\n\nWilliams just needs to feel comfortable blocking after surgery for a dislocated right thumb, and Thompson said his injured ribs feel markedly better this week. Dunbar, who's dealing with nerve damage as part of a shin injury, feels \"pretty close\" but isn't sure if he'll make the problem worse.\n\nELLIOTT'S WORKLOAD\n\nIt just so happens that Elliott's season high in touches \u2014 30 in a 22-19 win over Atlanta \u2014 came on the Cowboys' annual short week. In road wins over the NFC's past two Super Bowl participants in Philadelphia and Atlanta, Elliott had 55 touches (42 carries, 13 catches) for 388 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns.\n\n\"If that's what it has to be then that's what it's going to be,\" said Elliott, who needs 91 yards rushing to overtake idle NFL rushing leader and MVP contender Todd Gurley. \"I'm definitely not afraid of that.\"\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nPart of the Redskins' challenge in helping McCoy succeed is getting Adrian Peterson going on the ground. Peterson had just 16 carries for 51 yards in the loss to Houston, but ran for two touchdowns and is looking forward to playing back in his home state of Texas.\n\nThe pressure's on Peterson and the rest of Washington's running backs to produce in the running and passing games. The former Oklahoma standout had 99 yards in the earlier win over the Cowboys.\n\nGALLUP BACK\n\nDallas rookie receiver Michael Gallup is expected to play after rejoining the team Wednesday. He stayed behind with his family after getting the news following the win over the Falcons that his brother died by suicide.\n\n\"The situation's unique, the individual's unique, the circumstances,\" coach Jason Garrett said. \"I do think for all of us as we go through challenging things, I do think getting back to routine and structure typically can help us.\"\n\nSTARTS WITH DEFENSE\n\nThe Redskins, who haven't allowed a 100-yard rusher, held Elliott to 33 yards in a 20-17 win in the first meeting. It's the second-lowest total of his career. Both teams are in the top five in scoring defense and in the top six in rushing defense.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Small or unfamiliar changes could be overwhelming, especially to those with dementia.\n\nBring important health and legal documents, a list of medications and physician information.

They play a high-stakes exhibition Friday in Las Vegas in golf's first venture using pay-per-view. (AP Photo/Dave Martin, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGolf used to have a prominent place on the Thanksgiving weekend calendar with The Skins Game. That made-for-TV event ended in 2008 but Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson will have their own high-stakes showdown Friday.\n\nAfter years of discussion, the two will compete in \"The Match\" at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas, a $9 million winner-take-all event that will air on pay-per-view.\n\nMany wondered if a Woods vs. Mickelson match was a thing of the past.\n\nThe two have combined for 123 PGA Tour victories and 19 majors but had struggled in recent years. Talk of a match was revived earlier this year when Mickelson won in Mexico and Woods started to be competitive again before winning at The Tour Championship in September.\n\nMickelson said the original premise was both partnering up with some of the sport's younger stars, but television executives and fans have always wanted to see the two go head to head.\n\n\"To have the opportunity to go head to head and to win is just. . it's great to win the 9 million. I just don't want to lose to him and give him the satisfaction, because the bragging rights are what's going to be even worse than the money,\" Mickelson said during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nBoth were part of the U.S. team at the Ryder Cup but have not competed since then.\n\n\"After the Ryder Cup I shut it down for about 3-4 weeks and started to basically work on my body and try to get it stronger again,\" Woods said. \"I was really looking forward to the break, but I'm really looking forward to getting back to playing again. I missed competing, and to be able to go against Phil like this gets my juices flowing for sure.\"\n\nMickelson said he has been working on his game the past four weeks and that this is a good way during the offseason to prepare for next year.\n\nMany golf fans are used to made-for-TV events that have been genteel affairs. This will be the complete opposite.\n\nFor starters, this is believed to be golf's first pay-per-view match. This is the first major event with Warner Media, which was formed after the recent merger between Time Warner and AT&T. Turner Sports and BR Live are producing the event and it is being shown online as well as on DirecTV and AT&T U-Verse and other cable and satellite outlets for $19.95.\n\nErnie Johnson Jr., who has done the PGA Championship for Turner, will be the main announcer but it will feature others including Natalie Gulbis, Charles Barkley and Samuel L. Jackson\n\nThe broadcast will feature both golfers mic'd up as well as the caddies (Joe LaCava for Woods and Tim Mickelson for his older brother). With it being on pay-per-view, there will be no commercial breaks and plenty of opportunities to hear both golfers try to one up each other with verbal jabs.\n\n\"It's like a Tuesday practice round for a significant stake that makes us uncomfortable, but with the same type of banter that we're used to that most fans aren't privy to,\" Mickelson said.\n\nWoods and Mickelson used to be bitter rivals, but the relationship has improved in recent years as both got to know each other during Ryder Cups. But Darren Clarke, who has competed against both, expects the rivalry to intensify during the match.\n\n\"Different people think this is going to be a fun match but both are natural-born winners. At some stage you are going to see it get a bit uncomfortable as both will call out each other,\" he said.\n\nThe most intriguing thing is the gambling aspect. The players will set their own odds on shots during different times and fans will be able to bet along with them. Clarke said gambling has been a part of the European Tour for years and it will be interesting to see how it does Friday.\n\nCraig Barry, who is Turner's executive vice president and chief content officer, is also interested to see how the side bets work out, especially since more states are approving sports gambling.\n\n\"It makes you follow along more and engage. It definitely does create a deeper and richer narrative,\" Barry said.\n\nDon't expect gambling to become a part of Turner's NBA and Champions League coverage, though, since that appears to be a long way off.\n\n\"This is very different than anything golf has ever done in the past. That's one of the unique things about it. We're able to showcase our sport in such a different light and all the different technologies we're going to be bringing to this event, and doing it differently than any other golfing event has ever been done. That's the exciting thing for not only myself and Phil, but I think for all the viewers that are going to watch,\" Woods said.\n\nWoods and Mickelson already have high stakes on the first hole. Mickelson said he would wager $100,000 that he would birdie the first hole and Woods doubled it.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Matt Gentry/The Roanoke Times via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Leading receiver Jeff Thomas was dismissed from Miami's football team Wednesday, the latest blow in a turbulent season for the Hurricanes.\n\nThomas led Miami with 35 catches and 563 receiving yards this season. He was also a standout kickoff and punt returner for the Hurricanes, and became the first Miami player in more than two years to run back a punt for a touchdown when he took one in from 51 yards during last week's win at Virginia Tech.\n\nA few days removed from that, he was gone. Thomas was not happy about not starting the Virginia Tech game at receiver, missed some practice time this week and coach Mark Richt ultimately made the call to end his tenure at Miami.\n\nThe specifics about what went wrong were not released Wednesday. In fact, the school and Thomas couldn't even agree on what really happened \u2014 Miami's release said he was dismissed, and the receiver put out a statement saying he and Richt simply agreed that he needed to leave.\n\n\"We have high standards for excellence, for conduct and for the commitment to team for all of the young men who wear our uniform, and we will not waver from those standards,\" Richt said in a statement sent out after practice. \"We wish Jeff the very best as he moves forward in his journey.\"\n\nThomas insisted that he \"did not get kicked off the team.\"\n\n\"I couldn't thank this program (for) how much they've done for me, and the things I've done on the field is my way of respect for the program,\" Thomas tweeted. He ended his post with \"BeatPitt.\"\n\nMiami (6-5, 3-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) plays host to No. 24 Pittsburgh (7-4, 6-1, No. 24 College Football Playoff) on Saturday. The Panthers have already clinched the Coastal Division title, a crown that Miami won last year and was the overwhelming pick to wear again this season.\n\nBut it has been a troubling year for Miami, which started out ranked No. 8 nationally and still isn't even assured of having a winning season. The Hurricanes lost four straight games from Oct. 13 through Nov. 10, have had three quarterbacks \u2014 current starter N'Kosi Perry, plus backups Cade Weldon and Jarren Williams \u2014 suspended at times, and had a starting linebacker suspended last week for taking an unauthorized painkiller.\n\nThere was also the midseason news that wide receiver Ahmmon Richards, who had a breakout freshman season in 2016 and struggled with injuries since, needed to retire from the sport because of a neck injury.\n\n\"It's raining sledgehammers,\" Richards tweeted Wednesday.\n\nAnd now, the Hurricanes will be without perhaps their fastest player going forward.\n\nThomas, a sophomore from East St. Louis, Missouri, will have two years of eligibility remaining. He would very likely have to sit out the 2019 season if he transfers somewhere, though the NCAA could waive that if he presents some sort of case compelling enough for him to merit getting a hardship waiver.\n\nIt was a surprising fall from favor for Thomas. Miami's coaches choose captains on a weekly basis, and Thomas was a two-time selection there this season. His speed, smarts and route-running skills were something Richt had often raved about.\n\n\"I wish we had about three of him, to be honest with you,\" Richt said last month.\n\nHe doesn't have even one of him now.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It outlined the current understanding of the science behind climate change and was described as the largest, most comprehensive U.S.-focused report ever produced about our warming world.\n\nAs first mandated by Congress in the late 1980s, the assessment is prepared every four years by the nation's top scientists from 13 agencies. It's meant as a reference for the president, Congress and the public.\n\nThe World Resources Institute said it \"will be an invaluable tool for leaders who want to protect their citizens.\"\n\nWhy release it on what's practically a national holiday? Perhaps it because \"we know climate change is not a priority for this administration,\" Placky said. In 2017, President Donald Trump said he planned to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to establish ambitious targets to reduce the greenhouse gasses that cause global warming.\n\nHe once also tweeted that global warming was a \"hoax.\"\n\nPlacky also recalled that the previous assessment, in 2014, was released by President Barack Obama with a huge rollout at the White House.\n\nO'Mara of the wildlife federation said that \"releasing the National Climate Assessment on Black Friday won\u2019t obscure the fact that authorities are still identifying bodies in California\u2019s unprecedented megafires, Florida is still dealing with toxic algae outbreaks fueled by warmer water, and Americans are still picking up the pieces from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and Typhoon Yutu that were worsened by climate change.\"\n\nMeteorologist Angela Fritz with the Capital Weather Gang asked: \"Is there any way it could be buried more? How about New Years Eve at 9 pm, guys?\"\n\nThe Thanksgiving-holiday release comes more than two weeks earlier than the original planned release at the American Geophysical Union annual conference in December, according to Climate Nexus.\n\nAnother possible reason for releasing a report about global warming this Friday could be because the weather will be near-record cold in the heavily populated and media-saturated northeastern U.S.\n\nThe report will be released at 2 p.m. EST Friday.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/21/climate-change-report-released-friday-after-thanksgiving/2080298002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Numbers misleading in what has been down year for the ACC", "description": "The numbers are somewhat misleading in what has been a down year for ACC football", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/21/numbers-misleading-in-what-has-been-down-year-for-the-acc/38582351/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67f0a85fcb17525973278a1ce781b507b2894fd5/c=0-323-879-817/local/-/media/2018/11/21/USATODAY/usatsports/58706fb39fbb421c8506d4016a9dacfc.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:05:41Z", "content": "FILE - In this Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, Virginia Tech head coach Justin Fuente reacts during an NCAA college football game against Boston College, in Blacksburg, Va.

(AP Photo/Matt Bell, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe numbers are somewhat misleading in the ACC this season.\n\nThings sound pretty good when considering Clemson is a national title contender, the league has had a record 10 football teams make an appearance in the Top 25 and 12 of its 14 teams could be bowl eligible. But step back and take a more in-depth look at the Atlantic Coast Conference and outside of the Tigers, who are in line to be in the College Football Playoff for the fourth year in a row, it's been somewhat of a disappointing football season.\n\nMany of the league's other usually strong teams have struggled.\n\nThree of the teams that were ranked \u2014 Florida State, Duke and Virginia \u2014 held a spot in the Top 25 for just one week, and two that spent the first half of the season in the poll \u2014 Miami and Virginia Tech \u2014 now get no votes.\n\nLouisville and North Carolina are not bowl eligible this year.\n\nTwo other traditionally rich ACC football programs are in danger of having a pair of the nation's longest bowl streaks come to an end.\n\nThe Hokies, once ranked as high as No. 12, have some major work to do to extend their bowl streak to 26 years. If Virginia Tech (4-6, 3-4) can upset favored Virginia (7-4, 4-3) on Friday, the Hokies will then play Marshall on Dec. 1 seeking a sixth victory. If Virginia wins, the Marshall game won't be necessary.\n\nThe Hokies have not been able to reload as they have in the past.\n\nThey lost three defensive starters to graduation after last season and had three more defensive starters leave early for the NFL. During the offseason, coach Justin Fuente dismissed two more starters \u2014 Adonis Alexander and Mook Reynolds \u2014 from the team, and Trevon Hill was dismissed early in the season, leaving them exceedingly young.\n\n\"This is the youngest team I have ever coached,\" Fuente said after the loss to Miami, their fourth in a row and fourth at home this season. \"... I told the guys that I still believe in them and they are continuing to improve, work hard and have good leadership.\"\n\nFlorida State is also looking to pull off an upset to extend its impressive bowl streak.\n\nThe Seminoles (5-6) have struggled under first-year coach Willie Taggart and need to beat No. 13 Florida (8-3) on Saturday for their season to end with a bowl game for the 37th year in a row. That streak would rate as the longest in NCAA history, but the NCAA vacated the Seminoles' 2006 Emerald Bowl victory over UCLA because of an academic issue that led to more than 30 players being suspended for the Music City Bowl against Kentucky the following season.\n\nBut the Seminoles still count the game and want the streak to continue.\n\n\"It's important to our players,\" Taggart said. \"It's important to our fan base, it's important to the teams that came before us that we keep it going and we talked about it as a team and our guys understand what's at stake. It's important for our seniors to leave here and not be that senior class that didn't go to a bowl game.\"\n\nWake Forest is another underdog looking to become bowl eligible.\n\nThe Demon Deacons (5-6, 2-5) need a road-win at favored Duke (7-4, 3-4) on Saturday for their sixth win of the year.\n\nAt the top, Clemson has remained unblemished. The Tigers did have a challenge to their perch when they played at Boston College on Nov. 10, but they knocked BC quarterback Anthony Brown out of the game and won 27-7.\n\nThe second-ranked Tigers have maintained a spot in the top four all season, but even that could come back to haunt the ACC.\n\nClemson will take on No. 24 Pittsburgh for the ACC title on Dec. 1 in Charlotte, North Carolina. If the Panthers can derail the Tigers' title hopes, the league could lose its spot in the Orange Bowl, which is hosting one of the CFP semifinal games.\n\nBecause the Orange Bowl is a semifinal host this year, its contractual agreements with the ACC aren't a factor. So if Pittsburgh beats Clemson, the Tigers would likely still land in a New Year's Six bowl which might relegate the would-be ACC champion Panthers to the Camping World Bowl in Orlando \u2014 where they would face a team from the Big 12.\n\nIt would be a bizarre ending to season few in the league expected to play out the way it has.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joedy McCreary contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

At 54-51, it was the third-highest scoring game in NFL history, which says a lot.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the cleanest game or the strongest performance from the defense, but there were plenty of great games by various position groups. We graded each one from Monday night in our Week 11 report card.\n\nQuarterback\n\nJared Goff wasn\u2019t perfect on Monday night, but he went toe-to-toe with Mahomes and matched him every step of the way, throwing three fewer interceptions. He finished with 413 yards and four touchdowns, one of his best statistical performances ever. If not for Goff, the Rams don\u2019t win this game, especially given Todd Gurley\u2019s recently revealed ankle injury suffered in the first quarter.\n\nGrade: A\n\nRunning back\n\nGurley was hardly used against the Chiefs, touching the ball just 15 times in a game where the Rams scored 54 points. That\u2019s because he suffered a minor ankle injury on the opening drive, which Sean McVay says \u201cbothered\u201d him throughout the game. He still mustered 94 yards on those 15 touches, but based on his standards, it was an underwhelming performance. Malcolm Brown did chip in 15 yards on four carries, as well.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nWide receiver\n\nGoff had a surprisingly hard time connecting with Robert Woods, who caught just four of his 11 targets for 72 yards and a touchdown. However, he and Brandin Cooks hooked up eight times for 107 yards, including a 30-yarder. Josh Reynolds was the real surprise here, catching six passes for 80 yards and a touchdown. He nearly had a second score, too, and made a nice one-handed grab after Goff scrambled.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nTight end\n\nGerald Everett and Tyler Higbee really stepped up against Kansas City. Everett caught three passes for 49 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner. Higbee added six catches on seven targets for 63 yards, as well, the best game these two have ever played together.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nOffensive line\n\nThe offensive line faced a tall task in stopping the Chiefs\u2019 pass rushers. Goff was sacked five times, hit seven times and the Chiefs had six tackles for loss, wreaking havoc consistently. Chris Jones and Dee Ford were especially good, while Justin Houston also added a strip sack. Rodger Saffold struggled against Jones, as most guards do, but this is nothing to worry about.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nEmail Sign up Like this article?

You'll now receive the top Rams Wire stories each day directly in your inbox.\n\nDefensive line\n\nAaron Donald once again carried the load with two sacks, two quarterback hits and two forced fumbles, though he didn\u2019t make a tackle for loss, surprisingly. Ndamukong Suh was mostly a non-factor with just one tackle assist, while Michael Brockers had two total tackles. It\u2019s hard for this unit not to earn an above-average grade with Donald running the show.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nInside linebacker\n\nCory Littleton had a solid game with eight tackles, including back-to-back rangy stops on Kareem Hunt. Mark Barron wasn\u2019t as effective, but it was a decent performance by the tandem, limiting Hunt to 70 yards rushing.\n\nGrade: B\n\nOutside linebacker\n\nSamson Ebukam broke out with a sack, interception, forced fumble and two touchdowns, the first player ever to post that stat line. He won NFC Defensive Player of the Week for his efforts, helping the Rams to victory. Dante Fowler was the only other outside linebacker to play meaningful snaps, recording three tackle assists.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nCornerback\n\nTyreek Hill went off for 10 catches and 215 yards with two touchdowns, while Chris Conley added two scores on seven catches (74 yards) as well. The Rams\u2019 cornerbacks struggled to cover both players, leading to a big day from Patrick Mahomes. Sam Shields had a rough night, as did Troy Hill, while Marcus Peters pulled down an easy interception.\n\nGrade: C\n\nSafety\n\nJohn Johnson led the team with 11 tackles and Lamarcus Joyner chipped in seven of his own with a game-sealing interception. Neither was in good position on Tyreek Hill\u2019s first touchdown, but Joyner had a nice pass breakup later in the game.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nSpecial teams\n\nJohnny Hekker was a stud, pinning the Chiefs deep with two booming punts late in the fourth quarter. Greg Zuerlein missed an extra point and the two return specialists, JoJo Natson and Pharoh Cooper, struggled in that department, but it was a strong day from the special teams unit thanks to Hekker.\n\nGrade: A-"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Reds closer Iglesias agrees to 3-year deal", "description": "Reds closer Raisel Iglesias agrees to restructured 3-year deal through 2021 season, avoiding arbitration", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/11/21/reds-closer-iglesias-agrees-to-3-year-deal/38582315/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:58:36Z", "content": "CINCINNATI (AP) Reds closer Raisel Iglesias has agreed to a restructured three-year deal through the 2021 season, avoiding arbitration.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Reds closer Raisel Iglesias agreed Wednesday to a three-year contract guaranteeing $24,125,000, a deal that avoided arbitration.\n\nIglesias reached a $27 million, seven-year agreement in 2014 that allowed him to void the remainder of the deal once he was eligible for salary arbitration. That agreement called for $5 million salaries in each of the next two seasons.\n\nHe made $4.5 million this year, when he had a career-high 30 saves in 34 chances and a 2.38 ERA.\n\nRather than having Iglesias eligible for arbitration each season, the Reds offered a restructured deal that gives both sides certainty.\n\n\"If he does what we've seen him do over the next three years, there's all sorts of ways he can outperform these numbers,\" Reds president of baseball operations Dick Williams said. \"Obviously both sides are taking on some risk here, and both sides getting paid to take on some risk.\"\n\nThe Reds are trying to emerge from a massive rebuild that's left them with three straight 90-loss seasons. Last year, they added setup men Jared Hughes and David Hernandez to the bullpen and got significant improvement. Their priority this offseason is to add a couple of veteran starters.\n\nThey also hired David Bell as their manager in the offseason. Williams said Bell and his staff are looking at different ways to use Iglesias, who isn't limited to a ninth-inning role like many other closers. Over the last three seasons, Iglesias has 24 saves of more than one inning, the most in the majors.\n\n\"He's appeared in crucial situations in the middle of games,\" Williams said. \"Obviously he's done it as well as anybody at the end of the game.\n\n\"We want to be able to maximize the value of Iglesias.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

We wanted to give him a break from studying film.\"\n\nNo. 10 Ohio State has been watching some film, too, watching what Patterson has done with the fourth-ranked Wolverines this season.

He decided to transfer from Ole Miss nearly a year ago to Michigan, but he had to wait until April to find out the NCAA was granting his request to play this season instead of sitting out a year.\n\n\"It was a scary and anxious time,\" Sean Patterson recalled. \"I think going through what he did made him a tougher and stronger person and it makes him appreciate every moment with the winged helmet even more.\"\n\nWith the help of attorney Tom Mars, the appeal was won for Patterson \u2014 and the Wolverines.\n\n\"The best part of the experience for me was getting to know Shea and his family,\" Mars wrote in a text message. \"And, then watching what Shea's accomplished with his teammates this season \u2014 game after game. I haven't missed any of them, and I'll be in the stands in Columbus on Saturday.\"\n\nPatterson, a former five-star recruit from Toledo, Ohio, decided to transfer from Ole Miss after the NCAA penalized the football program with sanctions for rules violations under former coach Hugh Freeze. The penalties included a bowl ban for the 2018 season.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Bengals coach Marvin Lewis shut down the question immediately, making it clear he won't be talking about the latest addition to his staff \u2014 one who's in an unusual position to influence the next game.\n\nOnly last month, Hue Jackson was Cleveland's head coach, intimately involved in the Browns' game planning. Now he's on the Bengals sideline with Lewis, trying to beat the Browns \u2014 a sensitive subject that the head coach is trying to put off limits.\n\n\"I think I've answered enough Hue questions, OK?\" Lewis said Wednesday with an edge to his tone. \"We're done. We're over.\"\n\nOh, no. The intrigue is just getting started.\n\nThe Bengals (5-5) desperately need to beat the Browns (3-6-1) at Paul Brown Stadium to remain relevant in the playoff chase. They've lost four of five , fired their defensive coordinator and installed Lewis as leader of a historically bad unit.\n\nAs part of the shuffle, he brought back a close friend at an opportune time.\n\nJackson was fired by the Browns on Oct. 29 after winning only three games in three seasons. Lewis brought him back to Cincinnati for the third time , creating a role of special assistant. Jackson helps develop the weekly game plan on defense and provides tips on the sideline during games.\n\nHis input will be especially useful this week. Jackson knows the Browns' tendencies and the players' strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\"That was very unique,\" defensive end Carlos Dunlap said. \"He knows the players, he knows the staff. They just got a new (offensive coordinator), so they're probably calling things differently than when (Jackson) left. So you have your advantages there.\"\n\nIt's not unusual for a team to pick up a player who was released by an upcoming opponent, but it's highly unusual to get the other team's former head coach.\n\nOne more unique feature to this intrastate matchup: Both head coaches will be calling the defensive plays. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams was elevated to interim coach after Jackson was fired. Lewis took over the defensive coordinator duties after Teryl Austin was fired on Nov. 12.\n\n\"It brings a smile to my face,\" Williams said Wednesday during a conference call. \"It's kind of unique.\"\n\nIt's challenging to analyze what the opposing offense is doing and adjust defensively while also running the overall game. That's where Jackson's presence could be especially helpful on Sunday.\n\nThe Browns are coming off a bye week that gave them a chance to add a few things that Jackson won't anticipate.\n\n\"He's not there (in Cleveland) anymore, so they could have changed a lot of those things,\" Dunlap said. \"So you don't want to get caught guessing. But it's good to know what they like to do and what they're built and set up for, so it's great to have that understanding.\"\n\nJackson jogged off the practice field on Wednesday and declined to stop and talk about his reunion with Cleveland, referring questions to the closed-lipped Lewis.\n\nA.J. GETTING CLOSER\n\nReceiver A.J. Green could return against Cleveland. He's missed the past two games with an injured toe on his right foot, and the offense struggled in losses to the Saints and Ravens . Green didn't practice Wednesday, but Lewis said he will work out the rest of the week, aiming to be ready by Sunday.\n\nLeft tackle Cordy Glenn (back) and cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (shoulder) also missed practice. Defensive end Michael Johnson (calf) and safety Shawn Williams (hamstring) were limited.\n\nBROWN'S DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nThe Bengals figured they'd upgraded their linebacker group when they signed durable Preston Brown from Buffalo in the offseason. He was limited by a right ankle injury that he suffered the first game, and he injured his right knee during a 51-14 loss to the Saints. The Bengals put him on injured reserve Tuesday and signed defensive end/linebacker Kasim Edebali, a college free agent who has played with the Saints, Broncos, Lions and Rams. Lewis said Brown might have surgery on his ankle now that he can't return this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He decided to transfer from Ole Miss nearly a year ago to Michigan, but he had to wait until April to find out the NCAA was granting his request to play this season instead of sitting out a year.\n\n\"It was a scary and anxious time,\" Sean Patterson recalled. \"I think going through what he did made him a tougher and stronger person and it makes him appreciate every moment with the winged helmet even more.\"\n\nWith the help of attorney Tom Mars, the appeal was won for Patterson \u2014 and the Wolverines.\n\n\"The best part of the experience for me was getting to know Shea and his family,\" Mars wrote in a text message. \"And, then watching what Shea's accomplished with his teammates this season \u2014 game after game. I haven't missed any of them, and I'll be in the stands in Columbus on Saturday.\"\n\nPatterson, a former five-star recruit from Toledo, Ohio, decided to transfer from Ole Miss after the NCAA penalized the football program with sanctions for rules violations under former coach Hugh Freeze. The penalties included a bowl ban for the 2018 season.

(AP Photo/Lido Vizzutti, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 The most successful college football team in Southern California this season doesn't play in a major conference.\n\nIt certainly doesn't play before tens of thousands of fans every Saturday. Heck, its stadium doesn't even seat 10,000.\n\nIts 75-year-old coach, a former NFL middle linebacker and defensive coordinator, is collecting Social Security. The quarterback is an unassuming accounting major who has become one of the most prolific passers in Football Championship Subdivision history after being passed over by Football Bowl Subdivision teams.\n\nThat's how they roll at the University of San Diego, where coach Dale Lindsey and senior quarterback Anthony Lawrence have the Toreros in the FCS playoffs for the third straight season.\n\nIt's a terrific accomplishment, considering that the Toreros don't offer football scholarships and it costs approximately $65,000 a year to attend the small hilltop Catholic school known for its Spanish Renaissance architecture and a million-dollar view of Mission Bay and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"I think our program has advanced to the point where we have credibility on a national scale, at this level,\" athletic director Bill McGillis said after the Toreros (9-2) drew an opening-round matchup at Nicholls State (8-3) on Saturday. \"In talking to members of the FCS committee and just people throughout college football, they now recognize us as a very successful, sound, national program.\"\n\nUSD has won its opening-round playoff game each of the last two years before losing at powerhouse North Dakota State.\n\nUntil the Toreros \u2014 it's Spanish for \"bullfighters\" \u2014 began routinely qualifying for the postseason, they were best known for being the first steppingstone in Jim Harbaugh's head coaching career. Harbaugh went 29-9 at USD from 2004-06, including winning league titles with consecutive 11-1 finishes. Back then, the Pioneer League didn't have an automatic FCS playoff berth.\n\nWhen Ron Caragher left after the 2012 season, Lindsey was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach. Lindsey punts all credit to his assistants and the players.\n\n\"We have been fortunate enough to have dedicated coaches that are here long after everybody's gone home, working,\" said Lindsey, who is 55-15 in six seasons. \"We've been very successful in finding the right kind of guy that meets the academic requirements and athletic requirements to have a championship team. ... I just stand around and get out of the way.\"\n\nAfter a decades-long career playing and coaching in the NFL, and then pivoting to college coaching, Lindsey isn't in a hurry to go anywhere\n\n\"I like what I do,\" he said. \"Coaching was never a job. It's a hobby. I don't like to use the word 'work.' Work is something you go to that you don't like. This is something I go to that I like every day. I've been very fortunate ever since I was 22 that somebody paid me for my hobby.\"\n\nLawrence has enjoyed playing for Lindsey.\n\n\"He has a lot of fun out there. Even though he's serious, he makes a lot of jokes and has so much knowledge about the game,\" Lawrence said. \"He puts us in incredible positions to win. He has zero scholarships and he puts us in position to beat those teams, so I don't think you can speak enough for his coaching ability and the affect he has on this group of guys.\"\n\nUSD is the only non-scholarship team in the 24-team bracket. Academic money is available, and Lindsey said the parents who help get their sons through school are the real strength of the program.\n\n\"We definitely play with a chip on our shoulder,\" said Lawrence, who played at suburban Grossmont High. \"Most of us are underdogs and overlooked throughout high school and the recruiting process. We know we have the talent, we know we have the guys to go out and compete with anyone. The thing that gives us the edge is the underdog, chip on our shoulder mentality that these guys overlooked us, so let's show them why that was a mistake.\"\n\nUSD made its playoff debut in 2014, losing 52-14 at Montana. In 2016, USD earned its first playoff win, 35-21 at Cal Poly, before losing 45-7 at North Dakota State. Last year the Toreros stunned Northern Arizona 41-10 before again losing in Fargo, 38-3.\n\nThe San Diego-Nicholls State winner plays at Eastern Washington, which won the 2010 national title.\n\n\"We think we can make some noise this year,\" Lawrence said. Having lost in consecutive years to NDSU, which has won six championships in seven years, \"we know what we need to do to be successful in the playoffs.\"\n\nFor one, they need to play better defense. USD allowed Davidson to rush for an FCS-record 789 yards two weeks ago. But Lawrence threw for a school-record 556 yards and seven touchdowns to rally USD to a 56-52 victory that clinched the Pioneer League title.\n\nThe Toreros then won at Marist to clinch their third straight undefeated Pioneer League schedule.\n\nLawrence moved into a tie for eighth place in FCS history with 116 career touchdown passes and became the all-time leader in USD history, passing Josh Johnson (2004-07). He moved up to 11th place all-time with 12,306 career yards passing.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Branden Camp, AP)\n\nThe federal government will release a major climate change report \u2013 Volume II of the National Climate Assessment \u2013 on Black Friday, typically one of the slowest news days of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace to bury the truth about climate impacts in a year that saw hundreds of Americans die during devastating climate-fueled megafires, hurricanes, floods, and algal blooms,\" said National Wildlife Federation president Collin O\u2019Mara in a statement.\n\nVolume II is expected to detail a range of current and future climate change impacts and again warn that the Earth is warming, humans are the cause, and the already serious impacts \u2013 such as the current California wildfires \u2013 are only going to get worse, Climate Central said.\n\nThe new report should also have more of a regional focus, as demand rises for more local information on risks and consequences, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nThe report is also slated to contain a new chapter focusing exclusively on the U.S. Caribbean territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, a repeated skeptic of climate change, took to Twitter on Wednesday night to again express his doubts, using the especially cold Thanksgiving forecast as an example.\n\n\"Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?\" the president tweeted.\n\nVolume I of the report was released a year ago. It outlined the current understanding of the science behind climate change and was described as the largest, most comprehensive U.S.-focused report ever produced about our warming world.\n\nAs first mandated by Congress in the late 1980s, the assessment is prepared every four years by the nation's top scientists from 13 agencies. It's meant as a reference for the president, Congress and the public.\n\nThe World Resources Institute said it \"will be an invaluable tool for leaders who want to protect their citizens.\"\n\nWhy release it on what's practically a national holiday? Perhaps it because \"we know climate change is not a priority for this administration,\" Placky said. In 2017, President Donald Trump said he planned to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to establish ambitious targets to reduce the greenhouse gasses that cause global warming.\n\nHe once also tweeted that global warming was a \"hoax.\"\n\nPlacky also recalled that the previous assessment, in 2014, was released by President Barack Obama with a huge rollout at the White House.\n\nO'Mara of the wildlife federation said that \"releasing the National Climate Assessment on Black Friday won\u2019t obscure the fact that authorities are still identifying bodies in California\u2019s unprecedented megafires, Florida is still dealing with toxic algae outbreaks fueled by warmer water, and Americans are still picking up the pieces from Hurricanes Florence and Michael and Typhoon Yutu that were worsened by climate change.\"\n\nMeteorologist Angela Fritz with the Capital Weather Gang asked: \"Is there any way it could be buried more? How about New Years Eve at 9 pm, guys?\"\n\nThe Thanksgiving-holiday release comes more than two weeks earlier than the original planned release at the American Geophysical Union annual conference in December, according to Climate Nexus.\n\nAnother possible reason for releasing a report about global warming this Friday could be because the weather will be near-record cold in the heavily populated and media-saturated northeastern U.S.\n\nThe report will be released at 2 p.m. EST Friday.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/21/climate-change-report-released-friday-after-thanksgiving/2080298002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Streaking Saints, Brees seek to ground sagging Falcons", "description": "The latest chance for Saints fans to voice their gratitude to Drew Brees for the many triumphant moments and fond memories he's brought them comes on Thanksgiving night against rival Atlanta", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/streaking-saints-brees-seek-to-ground-sagging-falcons/38582229/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6414197a5e003d2553a47e379ac9b4c685effbba/c=0-506-1958-1607/local/-/media/2018/11/21/USATODAY/usatsports/1bf3ac16015c46d5a19be661beebc1f0.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:37:49Z", "content": "FILE - In this Sept. 23, 2018, file photo, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees (9) is sacked by Atlanta Falcons linebacker Vic Beasley (44) during the second half of an NFL football game, in Atlanta.

(AP) \u2014 Of the areas coach John Calipari can fault with No. 10 Kentucky right now, shooting isn't one of them after the Wildcats' best performance this season.\n\nMore important was that they were accurate early and consistently against Winthrop.\n\nPJ Washington had 19 points and 11 rebounds, Tyler Herro added 15 points and Kentucky shot a season-best 56 percent to run away from the Eagles 87-74 on Wednesday.\n\nComing off Sunday's tense victory over hot-shooting VMI, the Wildcats (4-1) had a far easier time against the Eagles (2-3) as they used their size to control the boards 37-20 and scoring in the paint (42-24). An 11-0 run to start the second half helped build a 68-42 cushion with 12:44 remaining and they were never really threatened, though several lapses allowed Winthrop to mount modest runs.\n\nThe Eagles never got closer than 13 in the final minutes as the Wildcats got needed plays at both ends of the floor to stay safely ahead.\n\n\"We didn't end the half well,\" Washington said, \"and then in the second half we just came out and got stops. That led to fast-break points, some 3s and the intensity was a lot better than how we ended the half. It was great, but we kind of lost it a little bit.\"\n\nWashington was the catalyst, making 7 of 11 from the field on the way to his second consecutive double-double. Herro left the game briefly after taking a hard tumble in the first half but returned to make 6 of 14 with three 3-pointers. He also had seven of Kentucky's season-high 20 assists.\n\nThe Wildcats made 31 of 55 from the field, the third consecutive game they've shot at least 49 percent. Keldon Johnson added 13 points and seven rebounds, Quade Green had 11 and Nick Richards 10 as Kentucky won its fourth in a row.\n\n\"We just started right out of the gate, we were pretty good to get going,\" Calipari said. \"There are games where we're not going to be able to just throw it in and jam it in there. But when you have that as an option and you can shoot the ball the way that we do, it becomes tough.\"\n\nJosh Ferguson, Charles Falden and Austin Awad each had 11 points, while Kyle Zunic and Adam Pickett added 10 apiece for Winthrop, which lost its second in a row and fell to 0-3 against Kentucky.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nKentucky has another game on Friday night but shouldn't lose its Top-10 ranking.\n\nA SLIGHT SCARE\n\nHerro went down hard and rolled over in pain as he lay on the court for several minutes before walking off and going to the locker room. The freshman guard returned for the second half and showed no effects, though he was a little nervous when he fell.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I tore something,\" said Herro, who previously had surgery for a torn meniscus. \"It hurt really bad, but it was just the way I fell. I put some ice on it and I was good.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWinthrop: Outmatched in size by Kentucky, the Eagles found consolation from behind the arc in shooting 13 of 28 (46 percent) and outscoring the Wildcats' bench 39-27. They shot 54 percent in the second half with six 3s, their only answer to all that length.\n\n\"I tell these guys, they block it with their armpit hairs,\" Winthrop coach Pat Kelsey said of trying to penetrate against Kentucky. \"Their DNA is to protect the rim, and what we were telling our guys was to spray the ball. You're not going to finish against trees, against towers in there like that.\"\n\nKentucky: The Wildcats' perimeter defense still has work to do after Winthrop found long-range success, though it wasn't like the 19 3s that VMI dropped on them on Sunday. Turnovers were a problem as well, as Winthrop converted 19 miscues into 27 points.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWinthrop hosts Warren Wilson College on Saturday.\n\nKentucky hosts Tennessee State on Friday night, looking to go 5-0 against the Tigers.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college basketball coverage: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The rectangular medal with the Notre Dame leprechaun etched on it along with the inscription \"Effort Toughness Leadership Commitment\" is on a chain around the neck of 65-year-old Keith Penrod, a gift from linebacker Drue Tranquill.\n\nPenrod, familiar to many fans for his lifelong devotion to Notre Dame athletics, has battled cerebral palsy since birth but has also recently been rehabbing a broken ankle that has kept him away the team and players he loves.\n\n\"Tell Drue I love him,\" Penrod said recently with a laugh on his angled face, with his crooked fingers caressing the gift he received from Tranquill, who received it from Matt Balis, the team's director of football performance, for his work prior to the 2017 season.\n\nThe gift and friendship between the 23-year-old team captain and the elderly fan doesn't surprise Tranquill's teammates or his coach, Brian Kelly. Tranquill's emergence as a team leader in his final season at Notre Dame has been compelling to watch. He's had to work hard, too.\n\n\"I think what people don't recognize is his growth as a teammate from last year to this year has been amazing,\" Kelly said. \"It's hard to imagine being Drue Tranquill \u2014 an engineering student, a great player, a great citizen (who is) great in the community (and) spiritually. He was almost too hard to imagine and almost too hard to mirror.\n\n\"This year he's still that, but he's so close to his teammates. They see the same guy every day. He comes in, he works out, he trains, he fights through injuries. They don't see all those other things. They see a guy that is so committed to being successful that they can mirror that.\"\n\nDo they ever.\n\n\"Drue has instilled his toughness in all of us,\" junior cornerback Julian Love said.\n\n\"On a high day or a low day, you're going to get the same guy,\" fellow linebacker Te'von Coney said.\n\n\"Drue and I came in together,\" center Sam Mustipher said. \"I know the things he's been through, the adversity he's fought through. He deserves it.\"\n\nIt has been quite a year for the third-ranked Irish (11-0, No. 3 CFP) and Tranquill, who married his Fort Wayne Carroll High School sweetheart, Jackie Gindt, in July. A few weeks later, Tranquill and fellow captains Mustipher, Alex Bars and Tyler Newsome led the Irish through five hot days of preseason workouts at Culver Academy and now 11 straight victories to set the table for a possible spot in the playoff. A single regular-season game remains, against longtime rival Southern California on Saturday at the Coliseum.\n\n\"This season has gone fast \u2014 you blink your eye and it's over,\" Tranquill said Tuesday after practice. \"The days are long, but the season is short. Now we're playing our last game of the regular season, so let's go out and win a ball game.\"\n\nLast week at Yankee Stadium against then-No. 12 Syracuse, Tranquill had perhaps his best game of the season with seven tackles, including two sacks, despite leaving the game twice with an injured ankle. It's been a familiar if unwelcome theme for Tranquill.\n\nAfter arriving on campus as a freshman safety, in 2014, he tore the ACL in his left knee against Louisville and the following year against Georgia Tech he tore the ACL in his right knee. Following a 4-8 season in 2016, Kelly restructured his staff and new defensive coordinator Mike Elko moved Tranquill to the rover spot in Notre Dame's 4-2-5 defense.\n\nTranquill responded with 85 tackles (44 solos) and three fumble recoveries for the 10-3 Irish and then decided to return for a fifth season that's had more bumps and bruises. Despite suffering a broken hand on the first series against Stanford on Sept. 29 and then having his ankle rolled in Notre Dame's win over Navy on Oct. 27, the 6-foot-2, 235-pound Tranquill is tied with free safety Alohi Gilman with 66 tackles, 52 of them unassisted, trailing only Coney for the team lead.\n\n\"This season has been a dream of mine,\" Tranquill said. \"To be in this position, to still have the dream, to still have that dream within reach is special.\"\n\nA May 2018 graduate with a 3.73 grade-point average in mechanical engineering, Tranquill is one of 13 finalists for the National Football Foundation's William V. Campbell Trophy and $25,000 postgraduate scholarship. He's also a finalist for the Wuerffel Trophy presented to the player who combines community service with athletic and academic achievement. Tranquill, who has made mission trips to the Dominican Republic, works with Dream Teams, a mentoring program with South Bend's elementary schools.\n\nPenrod, who once rode a Greyhound bus to Pittsburgh to help inspire Gerry Faust's Irish to their 31-16 upset of quarterback Dan Marino's No. 1 Panthers in 1982, lives a short cart ride from the Notre Dame practice fields. He has been unable to visit the last eight weeks after a hit-and-run driver broke his ankle, sending Penrod to a hospital and now a nearby rehabilitation facility.\n\nTranquill has visited Penrod and the two stay in touch via text message.\n\nOne of the first texts Tranquill received following his injury against Navy, while still in San Diego, was from Penrod. The latest came after Saturday's 36-3 win over Syracuse.\n\n\"Praying Christ continues healing your body,\" Penrod texted.\n\n\"Getting treatment which is helping,\" Tranquill texted back. \"Miss you brother . praying for healing on your end as well.\"\n\n\"I met Keith my freshman year here \u2014 he's an angel from God,\" Tranquill said. \"There's a prophetic tone that Keith speaks with. At fall camp, he pulled me aside and said, 'Drue, this team is special. It's something I haven't seen here in a long time.' I thought like, 'That's great, man, but we've got a lot to prove.' Keith saw this happening way before it happened.\"\n\nOne more win and the two will have even more to talk about.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This year is no exception. (AP Photo/Nell Redmond, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) \u2014 During an NFL season in which wild, high-scoring games have become increasingly commonplace, one constant from the past remains unchanged: The Baltimore Ravens own the best defense in the league.\n\nEver since Ray Lewis anchored the middle of a record-breaking defense that carried the Ravens to a Super Bowl win in 2000, Baltimore has prided itself in playing rugged, relentless and in-your-face defense.\n\nThis year is no exception.\n\nThe Ravens rank first in the NFL in total defense (300 yards per game) and fewest points allowed (18.1). While these numbers don't necessary stack up well against the 2000 team that surrendered only 247.9 yards and 10.3 points per game, the current unit can point to that 54-51 game between the Rams and Chiefs last Monday as proof that this year is unlike any other.\n\nSo, being known as the top-ranked defense still carries some weight in Baltimore.\n\n\"It's on our minds. It's one of the goals we set out to do,\" safety Eric Weddle said Wednesday. \"We pride ourselves in how we work to try to end up being the No. 1 defense. So now we've got six weeks to continue to prove ourselves being one of the best.\"\n\nDespite the play of the defense, Baltimore (5-5) is scrambling to end a three-year playoff drought. The Ravens limited Cincinnati to 255 yards last week in a 24-21 victory, and they'll seek to build on that Sunday against the Oakland Raiders (2-8).\n\n\"I really like the way they play,\" Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. \"They have multiple fronts, multiple pressures and multiple coverages. And they have a lot of really good players.\"\n\nBaltimore currently ranks third against the run, second against the pass and fourth in third-down efficiency at 36 percent.\n\n\"We stop the run most of the time and we cover tight most of the time. We keep pressure on quarterbacks most of the time,\" coach John Harbaugh said. \"We do a good job of getting off the field, all in all.\"\n\nWhat more could a coach ask?\n\n\"One of the biggest things is turnovers. That's something we focus on,\" Harbaugh said. \"And we want to stop people in the red zone. Those are two areas we've been great at in the past.\"\n\nThis year, not so much. The Ravens have only five interceptions and two fumble recoveries, which leaves them with a minus-5 turnover differential.\n\nAlso, opponents have scored touchdowns on 63 percent of their trips inside the Baltimore 20.\n\n\"When those things start coming along, and if we continue to play at a high level in all the other areas, it's got the making of being a special defense,\" Weddle said.\n\nBaltimore's defense works because first-year coordinator Don Martindale has been calling the right schemes for a unit that has strength on the line, in the middle and at the back end. Brandon Williams clogs the middle for linebackers C.J. Mosley and Terrell Suggs, and there's depth at cornerback with Brandon Carr, Marlon Humphrey, Tavon Young and Jimmy Smith.\n\n\"Guys on the front stop the run let our linebackers run, and we have guys that are able to cover,\" Weddle said. \"This is the most veteran cornerback group that we've had here in a long time. It makes it fun. It's easy for us safety guys. We just roam around and help out the guys.\"\n\nThe key is that everyone knows their role and follows it.\n\n\"One of the things you have to do to be a top defense is communication,\" Mosley said. \"If you have guys in the wrong spot, it won't work out.\"\n\nThat's not been an issue for a defense that brought Lewis to his feet last week in the owner's box.\n\n\"We've done a lot of good things,\" Martindale said. \"Let's wait until after the season is over to see where we stand.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY)\n\nNormally restrained Chief Justice John Roberts took issue on Wednesday with President Donald Trump's characterization of a federal judge who ruled against his administration as an \"Obama judge.\"\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts said in a statement. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n\n\"That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nRoberts issued the statement in response to a request from The Associated Press after Trump's comments about the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco, who on Monday blocked the Trump administration's effort to keep migrants trying to enter the U.S. from applying for asylum.\n\nThe president, who is spending time in Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday, disagreed and posted a response on Twitter Wednesday afternoon detailing his complaints with the court.\n\n\"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,\" Trump posted on Twitter.\n\nHe continued in another post, asking if the 9th Circuit was an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d why so many border cases were filed in that circuit and why were the \"vast number of those cases overturned.\"\n\n\"Please study the numbers, they are shocking,\" the president said. \"We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\"\n\nSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u201cObama judges,\u201d and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d but if it is why...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nTigar's ruling stated the administration's new policy of cutting off asylum to immigrants who enter the country illegally appears to run afoul of U.S. law that specifically allows them to do so.\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" said Tigar, who was nominated by then-President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\n\"This was an Obama judge,\" Trump said Tuesday after a reporter asked him about Tigar's decision.\n\nThe statement rejecting Trump's label was surprising coming from Roberts, a President George W. Bush appointee who has been reluctant to respond to Trump's bellicose comments about the judiciary.\n\nRoberts has previously been a target of Trump's criticisms; in 2016, the then-candidate called the chief justice a \"disaster because of his rulings in favor of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHis statement comes as many legal experts have stressed the need for judicial independence in the Trump era. Others have worried the divisive confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh damaged the court's reputation as being above the political fray.\n\nMore: With Brett Kavanaugh confirmed, Trump's poison touch infects the Supreme Court\n\n\"I think especially in this time when the rest of the political environment is so divided, every single one of us has an obligation to think about what it is that provides the court with its legitimacy,\" Justice Elena Kagan said last month.\n\nWednesday's statement was not the first time Roberts has called a president out. In 2013, Roberts wondered why President Obama continued to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act if he supported same-sex marriage.\n\n\"I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions,\" Roberts said.\n\nIn addition to his attack on Tigar, Trump on Tuesday called the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a \"disgrace\" and vowed to \"put in a major complaint,\" although he did not offer specifics.\n\nMore: Federal appeals court rules against Trump administration effort to end DACA program\n\n\"Every case that gets filed in the 9th Circuit, we get beaten. And then we end up having to go to the Supreme Court, like the travel ban, and we won,\" Trump said, referring to his administration's struggle to implement restrictions on travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe appeals court has been a target of Trump's since that ruling, and the president has suggested breaking up the 9th Circuit, which is the largest appeals court in the U.S.\n\nIts jurisdiction includes nine western states, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands \u2013altogether comprising about 20 percent of the nation's population. And its 29 full-time judges hear more than 12,000 appeals a year \u2013 almost twice as many as other appeals courts.\n\n\"It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts,\" Trump tweeted in January.\n\nIt just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 10, 2018\n\nTrump has long railed against judges, justices and courts that have issued rulings against him.\n\nIn 2016, Trump questioned the impartiality of Judge Gonzalo Curiel \u2013 a U.S.-born federal judge \u2013 because of his \"Mexican heritage\" after Curiel ruled against him in a lawsuit against Trump University\n\nAnd after a ruling against his travel ban by Judge James Robart, Trump denounced the \"ridiculous\" opinion of \"this so-called judge.\"\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nBut even one of Trump's own appointees to the highest court in the land has questioned the criticisms. As he sought confirmation last year, Justice Neil Gorsuch told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that he found Trump's attacks on judges \"demoralizing\" and \"disheartening.\"\n\nContributing: Alan Gomez and Richard Wolf, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/21/john-roberts-trump-statement/2080266002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "Chicago food bank gets hand from Barack Obama with Thanksgiving prep", "description": "Obama pops in to help out at Chicago food bank", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/11/21/obama-food-bank-thanksgiving/2077872002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.khou.com/assets/GANNETT/images/8bdca62c-3247-4050-9c45-901370bd4686/8bdca62c-3247-4050-9c45-901370bd4686_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:26:34Z", "content": "Former President Barack Obama popped in to visit volunteers at a Chicago food bank on Tuesday, helping out as the charity prepares to feed people in need on Thanksgiving.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions and Chicago Bears will meet for the second time in 12 days \u2014 yet this matchup already looks a lot different.\n\nMitchell Trubisky, Chicago's starting quarterback, is doubtful for Thursday's rematch with the Lions because of a right shoulder injury.\n\nThat means Chase Daniel, who has barely played in the NFL since 2014, may take the field for the NFC North-leading Bears under the Thanksgiving spotlight.\n\n\"We're on a short week. So regardless, there's not a lot you can do. The nice thing about having a guy like Chase, regardless of which direction you go, is I was Chase's quarterback coach in Kansas City for three years,\" Bears coach Matt Nagy said.\n\n\"So, I know Chase inside out and he knows me. And so, that's why you bring in a guy like Chase, is not only for his expertise in this offense, but in the way he handles his position each and every week.\"\n\nTrubisky threw for 355 yards and three touchdowns in Chicago's 34-22 win over the Lions on Nov. 11. Now the teams face each other again less than two weeks later. The Bears (7-3) have won four straight.\n\nDetroit (4-6) is in the middle of a three-game homestand that began with a victory over Carolina last weekend, but rookie running back Kerryon Johnson left that game with a knee injury. He won't play Thursday.\n\nSo both teams have health concerns coming into this game \u2014 and they haven't had much time to adjust to any potential lineup changes. The 32-year-old Daniel has started two games in his NFL career, and he hasn't attempted a pass since the 2016 season.\n\n\"The guy is very versed in the system. He's played in it for a while,\" Detroit coach Matt Patricia said. \"A little bit different than Trubisky, but as far as the operation of the offense, none of that really will change.\"\n\nHere are a few other things to know about Detroit's matchup with Chicago:\n\nEVEN QUICKER TURNAROUND\n\nThe Lions haven't had much time to prepare for this game after playing last weekend, but the Bears had even less time to recover, since their Sunday game against Minnesota was at night.\n\nSo when Thursday's game kicks off around 12:30 p.m. local time, Chicago will have had about 3\u00bd days since the end of its previous game.\n\n\"Our guys, once we knew it, we prepped them on what our game plan is as far as making sure they're mentally and physically strong and how they have to treat it,\" Nagy said.\n\n\"So, it's a positive to be flexed into a night game like we were last week, but now we have to make sure that we handle our business.\"\n\nTHANKSGIVING HISTORY\n\nOnly Green Bay has faced the Lions more times on Thanksgiving than the Bears. Chicago and Detroit have split their previous 16 Thanksgiving meetings. The Lions lost to Minnesota last year, ending their four-game winning streak on Thanksgiving.\n\nHIGHLIGHT REEL\n\nKenny Golladay has a long way to go before approaching Calvin Johnson's accomplishments, but the 6-foot-4 receiver has already made his share of acrobatic catches in his young career, including the winning touchdown against Carolina.\n\n\"His ball skills are really good. He makes play after play,\" Nagy said. \"He's somebody that I was aware of, but the more you watch him, you really appreciate his game.\"\n\nGolladay became even more important for Detroit after the Lions traded Golden Tate \u2014 and now that Marvin Jones has missed time with a knee injury. Jones has been ruled out of Thursday's game.\n\nIMPROVING\n\nDetroit is ranked 24th in the league against the run, but the Lions held Carolina to 56 yards on the ground, and the Bears had only 54 the previous week.\n\nFRANCHISE QB\n\nDetroit's Matthew Stafford has a passer rating of 100.8 in his past six Thanksgiving games, but he'll have his work cut out for him against a talented Chicago defense \u2014 and with Johnson and Jones unavailable.\n\n\"You just have to do what you do and do it well,\" Stafford said. \"Obviously, they have really good players, they have a really good scheme. There are strengths at all three levels of the defense. Their front is playing as good as any front in the league right now. I think they have two really good linebackers and their secondary is playing great, too.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sokolowski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 Tristan Thompson has been here before with the Cleveland Cavaliers post-LeBron James. And he\u2019s here again.\n\nThe common theme: When James leaves the Cavaliers \u2013 as he did in 2010 and 2018 \u2013 the franchise is left in his wake facing serious issues.\n\nCleveland was 19-63, 21-45, 24-58 and 33-49 in the four seasons following his departure eight years ago, and Thompson was there for three of them, joining the Cavs as a rookie in 2011.\n\nThis season, after James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency, the Cavs started 0-6 and fired coach Tyronn Lue. Interim coach Larry Drew wanted to restructure his contract, All-Star forward Kevin Love is out long term with a toe injury, former assistant coach Jim Boylan filed an age discrimination lawsuit against the team, veterans bickered about rookie Collin Sexton, and JR Smith wants out. He may get his wish; the Cavs said Tuesday that Smith is no longer with the team as they try to move him.\n\nSo, things are not going well for the 2-13 Cavaliers, who have the worst record in the NBA and Wednesday play host to James and the Lakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here long enough so I\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCleveland is trying to find bright spots, all of them in the future. The team is going through a transformation. They are renovating Quicken Loans Arena and rebuilding the team, and the NBA just rewarded the franchise with the 2022 All-Star Game.\n\nThe Cavs hope to be in a much better place by then. They drafted Sexton with the No. 8 overall pick in June, and if they continue to play this way, they will have a good chance at drafting one of Duke\u2019s trio of talented freshmen \u2013 R.J. Barrett, Cam Reddish and Zion Williamson. And with Love locked into a contract extension through the 2022-23 season, Cleveland may trade him at some point for another first-round pick.\n\nThis is Cleveland\u2019s \u2013 and owner Dan Gilbert\u2019s \u2013 chance to rebuild without the idea of in-his-prime James returning to guarantee a contending team.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s tough because you want to win every game,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cBut this season, it\u2019s bigger than wins and losses, and you want to see the development. You want to see guys getting better.\u201d\n\nMORE:\n\nThompson was once the young player trying to find his way in the NBA. Now, he\u2019s the veteran trying to help the young players, including Sexton, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.\n\n\u201cYou have to be patient,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cYou look at it as baby steps trying to get better. That\u2019s how I approach it. When you\u2019re trying to figure it out or going through ruts, the most important (thing) is playing the game the right way and developing winning habits.\u201d\n\n'We're going to take bumps and bruises'\n\nThat\u2019s what Drew, 60, is here to do. He\u2019s a veteran NBA coach, and combined with his playing days, is a basketball lifer. He\u2019s not rattled by Cleveland\u2019s chaotic situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this thing for a few years, and I can say I\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d Drew said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this situation before. The most important thing is you understand this business side of it. As far as questioning why certain things happen, I learned years ago to stop doing that. Just try to move on as fast as you can. Given what our situation has been, that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of Smith\u2019s disgruntlement is the playing time allocated to veterans, including Kyle Korver. Smith wants minutes, and that\u2019s just not going to happen with any consistency.\n\n\u201cWe want to develop our younger guys,\u201d Drew said. \u201cHow do you develop? By playing and we\u2019re going to take some bumps and bruises with those guys as far as mistakes are concerned and we\u2019re willing to do that.\u201d\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nSo, the Cavs are focused on the future. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the hand-wringing about James\u2019 second departure. In a story on The Athletic, James said he opposed the team\u2019s decision to trade Kyrie Irving before the 2017-18 season. The Cavs\u2019 front office wanted a long-term commitment from James before going in that direction, and James would not do that. Given that, Cavs general manager Koby Altman and Gilbert didn\u2019t see a resolution to Irving\u2019s adamant desire to get out.\n\nThe Cavs\u2019 run of Finals appearances was bound to end. Was there a way to squeeze out one more title before it fell apart? That\u2019s hard to argue considering how dominant the Golden State Warriors have been, with three titles in four years.\n\nRegardless, the walls started to crumble well before Irving wanted out and James decided to leave. Following Cleveland\u2019s loss to Golden State in the 2017 Finals and just before the draft, Gilbert decided he wouldn\u2019t bring back general manager David Griffin. At the time, Griffin was working to add another player who could potentially help the Cavs better compete with Golden State.\n\nIt never happened. James is gone. So is Irving, Smith and Griffin.\n\nThe Cavaliers are picking up the pieces once again.\n\nWorkers remove the Nike LeBron James banner from the Sherwin-Williams building near Quicken Loans Arena. (Photo: Jason Miller, Getty Images)\n\nJames' departure hurts more than Cavs\n\nThe Cavaliers remain in the top 10 in NBA attendance, checking in at No. 8 with an average of 19,423 fans per game. The Cavs were No. 2 last season at 20,562 per game. Several NBA teams, including the Cavs, persuade fans to commit to the following season\u2019s ticket plan in order to get the current season\u2019s playoff tickets.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where the Cavs are next season -- and the season after that.\n\nThe Cavs dropped from second to third in James\u2019 first season with Miami but fell to 19th in 2011-12 and 22nd in 2012-13. When he returned in 2014, the Cavs vaulted to No. 2.\n\nJames\u2019 loss impacts more than the team, too. When a team is bad, there is a lack of interest. James was appointment viewing, and not only did he put fans in seats, he put fans in downtown bars and restaurants.\n\nWinking Lizard Tavern co-owner John Lane went through it when James left in 2010 and is going through it again. His place, which has a stellar beer selection and fun food options, is just steps from Quicken Loans Arena.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose a player like that, there\u2019s not really a substitute, and we\u2019ve only won two games, so it\u2019s going to have an impact,\u201d Lane said.\n\nHe estimates the Winking Lizard is seeing a 25 percent decrease on game nights without James playing for the Cavs.\n\n\u201cWhen we first went downtown, we always figured events were icing on that cake,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the cake first. You have to have that regular business first. When you have a great player like LeBron, that\u2019s the icing.\u201d\n\nDavid Gilbert is the president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission. Since 2000, the commission has brought more than 190 sporting events to northeast Ohio, which have generated nearly $670 million in economic impact, according to the commission.\n\nGilbert doesn\u2019t deny the impact James has had on the identity of the city and region.\n\n\u201cIn a broad sense, LeBron\u2019s identity for the past 12 or more years has a strong tie to Cleveland and northeast Ohio,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cWhen you have one of, if not the most, recognizable and talented athletes on the planet, he\u2019s tied to the community not just because he plays there but he\u2019s from there. What LeBron may have done more than anything is help elevate local pride.\u201d\n\nWhile the commission brings mostly amateur events to the area, it is working with the Cleveland Indians on the 2019 All-Star Game and the Cavs, which was just awarded the 2022 NBA All-Star Game.\n\nGilbert and his staff will continue to attract events regardless of where James plays. The area has the infrastructure (arenas, hotels, convention space) to accommodate.\n\n\u201cThe community rallies around these events in order to make them successful as any place in the country,\" Gilbert said. \"... In the NCAA and Olympic worlds, Cleveland punches way above its weight in terms of quantity and quality of events.\u201d\n\nLane said he\u2019s making up for some lost business with a long-dormant revenue stream.\n\n\u201cThe positive is the Browns,\u201d Lane said. \u201cWe have interest in football again so our Sunday business is way up.\u201d\n\nFollow Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 1 Duke faces No. 3 Gonzaga in Maui title game", "description": "The Maui Invitational has a marquee matchup for its title game", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/no-1-duke-faces-no-3-gonzaga-in-maui-title-game/38581989/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4adf3d63124520b7c8600fddef6ae3b981e77f62/c=0-1141-3319-3008/local/-/media/2018/11/21/USATODAY/usatsports/2e6ac112532c416eb0cb351c11098fdd.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:03:28Z", "content": "Auburn forward Anfernee McLemore (24) and guard J'Von McCormick (12) try to stop Duke forward RJ Barrett (5) from going to the basket during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Maui Invitational, Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2018, in Lahaina, Hawaii\u2026 [+775 chars]", "fulltext": "Duke forward RJ Barrett (5) celebrates after his team scores over Gonzaga during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Maui Invitational, Wednesday, Nov. 21, 2018, in Lahaina, Hawaii. (AP Photo/Marco Garcia) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) \u2014 Gonzaga found itself in the same position as Duke's first five opponents: appearing helpless as the Blue Devils and their rim-rattling freshmen ran past and flew over them.\n\nThe Zags never panicked, never looked up in awe at the bouncy Blue Devils. They have too much experience to get rattled, even against college basketball's most talked-about team.\n\nPlaying with poise and grit down the stretch, No. 3 Gonzaga turned back top-ranked Duke's late-game charge to win the Maui Invitational title game 89-97 on Wednesday.\n\n\"Experience plays a big role in this,\" said Gonzaga guard Zach Norvell Jr., who had 18 points. \"We came down the stretch and got some stops. We knew we were winning it on the defensive end.\"\n\nGonzaga (6-0) put on an offensive show in the first half and battened down on defense after Duke made a second-half charge, blocking four shots in the final 46 seconds to win its second Maui title.\n\nRui Hachimura scored 20 points and the Zags beat a No. 1 team for the first time while ending the Blue Devils' unbeaten streak on the Valley Isle (17-1).\n\nDubbed a Final Four contender when Killie Tillie returns, Gonzaga already looks like one \u2014 even with one of their best players on the bench in a walking boot.\n\n\"The lights were on us tonight and we played good, which you have to against Duke,\" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. \"You have to pretty much play great. I thought we played great.\"\n\nFive-time Maui champion Duke (5-1) made it look easy the season's first five games, its fantastic freshmen soaring through the spotlight, not cowering away from it while looking all but unbeatable.\n\nThe experienced Zags gave them a lesson in ball movement, orchestrating a master class in free-flowing, position-less basketball while building a 14-point first-half lead.\n\nDuke's Maui run, done.\n\nWell, not just yet.\n\nThe Blue Devils fell behind by 16 in the second half before firing up the Blue Devil express with a series of head-above-the-rim dunks and drives.\n\nTaking advantage of Gonzaga big man Brandon Clarke's fourth foul, Duke pulled within a basket as Blue Devils fans sent an earthquake of noise off the rafters of tiny Lahaina Civic Center.\n\nHachimura put Gonzaga up 89-87 with a strong move at the basket with 75 seconds left, but the Zags kept giving Duke chances by missing four free throws. Clarke clanked two with 30 seconds left and Hachimura came up empty on two more with 10 seconds left.\n\nGonzaga's defense made up for it.\n\nHachimuru and Clarke each had two blocked shots in the final minute, capped by Clarke's swat of R.J. Barrett's driving attempt at the buzzer.\n\nA seated Barrett raised his arms, wondering why no foul was called. The Zags leaped in celebration after a game with a Final Four feel packaged in a small-town rec center.\n\nBarrett had 23 points and Zion Williamson scored 22 for the suddenly humbled Blue Devils.\n\n\"We finally started to fight in the last 14 minutes, whereas before we had just come to play and we weren't as emotionally ready as Gonzaga,\" said Duke's Javin DeLaurier, who had six points and six rebounds.\n\nThis was the game everyone expected when the Maui Invitational got another marquee title game between the what-will-they-do-next Blue Devils against the electrically efficient Zags.\n\nDuke and its future lottery picks steamrolled San Diego State and outlasted No. 8 Auburn to reach its sixth Maui title game in six years. Gonzaga survived Illinois' frenetic attack and put on a second-half show to beat Arizona in the semifinals.\n\nThe Blue Devils ran roughshod over one top-5 team to open the season, making then-No. 2 Kentucky look like a JV team.\n\nThe Zags not only didn't back down, they threw the first punch.\n\nForcing Duke defenders through one ball screen after another, Gonzaga played the position-less basketball game better than the Blue Devils. The Zags all but took Duke big man Marques Bolden, who had seven blocked shots in the semifinals, out of the game with their ball movement and created numerous open looks for themselves.\n\n\"They were just dictating the flow,\" Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \"I mean we were not playing good defense, but they were playing great offense.\"\n\nWhen Clarke went to the bench with his fourth foul midway through the second half, Gonzaga went into a stall. Duke put together a run, a sixth Maui title within reach.\n\nThe Zags swatted Duke's bid away.\n\n___\n\nNO. 8 AUBURN 74, ARIZONA 57\n\nBryce Brown scored 19 points, Malik Dunbar added 15 and No. 8 Auburn pulled away from Arizona to win the Maui Invitational third-place game 73-57.\n\nAuburn (5-1) gave top-ranked Duke its first real test of the season in the semifinals before losing by six. The Tigers built a 10-point lead against Arizona, allowed the Wildcats to pull within one and took control with an 11-0 second-half run to go up 14.\n\nBrandon Randolph had 18 points and Justin Coleman 16 for Arizona (4-2).\n\n___\n\nIOWA STATE 87, SAN DIEGO STATE 57\n\nMarial Shayok scored 21 points, Michael Jacobson added 19 and Iowa State blew out San Diego State 87-57 to win the Maui Invitational fifth-place game.\n\nThe Cyclones (5-1) jumped on the Aztecs early, building a 14-point halftime lead and kept pushing to close out the tournament on a positive note.\n\nMatt Mitchell led San Diego State (3-2) with 14 points.\n\n___\n\nXAVIER 83, ILLINOIS 74\n\nQuentin Goodin scored 15 points, Elias Harden added 14 and Xavier dominated the second half to beat Illinois 83-74 in the Maui Invitational seventh-place game night.\n\nThe Musketeers (3-3) lost in overtime to No. 8 Auburn and another close game to San Diego State in their first two Maui games. Xavier had 17 turnovers against Illinois' frenetic style of play, but made up for it by shooting 57 percent.\n\nAyo Dosunmu had 19 points and Trent Frazier scored 18 for the Illini (1-4).\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Since 2010, Goose Island has made its release of the original Bourbon County Brand Stout and additional flavor variants into a nationwide Black Friday morning event.\n\nUnder Anheuser-Busch, Goose Island has added production and storage capacity to make more of the much sought-after stouts, which are usually premium-priced at $10 and up. And this year, Goose Island has more flavors \u2013 eight total \u2013 available than in any previous year.\n\nHowever, few beer retailers will get the complete lineup and usually shoppers are limited to how many bottles they can purchase. Notably, the Proprietor's Bourbon County Brand Stout, made with dark chocolate and cocoa nibs, will be sold only in Chicago.\n\nShould you have to make a decision on which beer to snatch up, some beer journalists got preview tastes of the beer line-up.\n\nThe Reserve Bourbon County Stout (15.2 percent ABV), which is aged in \"Elijah Craig Barrel Proof\u201d bourbon barrels and may be the hardest to find, \"boasts more oak, cherry liqueur, and whiskey flavor than the original Bourbon County stout, with complex bourbon notes as well,\" wrote Vinepair's Cat Wolinski.\n\nAmong the new offerings, Bourbon County Midnight Orange Stout, made with Spanish Orange zest, is \"loaded with flavor,\" wrote Josh Noel, a beer writer at the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Barrel-Aged Stout and Selling Out: Goose Island, Anheuser-Busch, and How Craft Beer Became Big Business.\" The beer, he said, \"boasts a relatively understated nature that I enjoyed.\"\n\nBlack Friday means the annual release of Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout beers. This year, there's a new flavor: Bourbon County Midnight Orange Stout. (Photo: Goose Island Beer Co.)\n\nAnother of the new flavors, Bourbon County Wheatwine Ale, isn't even a stout. \"Oozing with caramel and butterscotch notes, it\u2019s boozy, but finishes clean,\" wrote Chris Morris in Fortune. \"This was a gamble that paid off for the brewer.\"\n\nThe original Bourbon County Brand Stout, aged mainly in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels, \"lacks the viscosity of a few years ago, but it\u2019s still full of chocolate, leather and vanilla flavors,\" he says. \"As always, it\u2019s a prime candidate to age as well.\"\n\nIn addition to retail sales, the Goose Island stouts will be available at tasting events at many bars and restaurants: Check Goose Island's website for a schedule.\n\nThis was the scene last Black Friday.

USA TODAY\n\nLisa Dennis of Regent Square selects a head of green lettuce from the vegetable shelves at the East End Food Co-op Federal Credit Union on Tuesday in Pittsburgh. Due to a recent consumer alert regarding a multi state E.Coli outbreak the Co-op has replaced their fresh and bagged romaine lettuce with blue signs reading, \"The CDC has issued a Consumer Alert for romaine lettuce due to a multi state E.Coli outbreak.\" The most-recent outbreak affects mostly women and girls, according to the CDC. (Photo: Jessie Wardarski, AP)\n\nThere's a striking aspect of the recent E. coli outbreak tied to romaine lettuce: 66 percent of those affected are female.\n\nSimilarly, when romaine was the culprit of an E. coli outbreak earlier this year, 67 percent of the 210 people infected were women or girls, the same ratio as an outbreak tied to leafy greens in late 2017.\n\nMedical experts have wondered why women and girls seem to be the victims of E. coli more often than men and boys. Dr. Bruce Lee, an associate professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, explains three potential reasons for the trend.\n\nThe most likely contributing factor involves women's diets, which tend to include more vegetables. A 2012 study of nearly 15,000 men and women published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found a higher rate of men ate meat and some poultry than women, who ate fruits and vegetables in higher proportions.\n\nE. coli: Why washing romaine lettuce won't kill E. coli that's already sickened 32 people\n\nThat might explain why an E. coli outbreak stemming from Cargill ground beef this summer affected men in 67 percent of the cases, while a 2016 outbreak in alfalfa sprouts affected women 73 percent of the time, CDC statistics show. Yet, women made up the majority of those affected by a 2015 outbreak tied to Costco rotisserie chicken salad. All of these outbreaks affected fewer people compared to this year's E. coli outbreaks.\n\nBritish officials also suggested women's diets could be the reason behind the slanted number of E. coli infections. More women than men fell ill during a 2011 E. coli outbreak involving cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes, The Guardian reported.\n\n\"We can't say with complete certainty why women have been disproportionately affected,\" Bob Adak, chief of the U.K. Health Protection Agency, told the newspaper in 2011, \"but in previous outbreaks around the world associated with salad vegetables we have seen women and adults more severely affected than men and children, so it's possible that this could be an indicator of food preference.\"\n\nAnother factor, Lee said, could be the difference between how men and women report their symptoms to their doctors. The high numbers for women could be a result of more of them relaying information to medical professionals. Lee said studies show men are less likely to report symptoms of any type of disease.\n\nThanksgiving: Turkey and romaine lettuce recalls, food safety concerns loom this Thanksgiving\n\nFinally, it's been proposed women react more to E. coli because of differences in their gastrointestinal tracts. Although, Lee said there is no strong evidence to support this. Different outcomes between sexes and races, he added, often are driven by social and behavioral differences, not biological characteristics.\n\nLee, also executive director of Johns Hopkins' Global Obesity Prevention Center, stresses that's not an excuse to not eat vegetables.\n\nThis story is an updated version of an article published on April 21, 2018.\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/21/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-affects-mostly-women-heres-why/2079220002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Charles Curtis", "title": "Kevin Durant on fans heckling him: 'That's corny, that's weak'", "description": "Durant responds to the $25,000 fine he received.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-fan-heckling-response-video", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/epa-usa-basketball-nba-e1542827249940.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:31:43Z", "content": "While taping a podcast, Yahoo\u2019s Chris Haynes had the honor of informing Kevin Durant that the Golden State Warriors forward was getting fined $25,000 for cursing out a heckling Mavericks fan.

(Photo: Provided)\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2013 Workers at Bayada Home Health Care have something extra to be thankful for this year.\n\nThe company's founder, Mark Baiada, shocked his employees Tuesday with a $20 million gift from his personal funds.\n\nThe windfall will range from $50 for new hires to tens of thousands of dollars for longtime employees, the company said.\n\nBaiada revealed his contributions at a luncheon for some 100 unsuspecting employees, who responded with tears, hugs and a standing ovation.\n\nThe funds will go to workers in the 22 states where Bayada operates.\n\n\u201cIt was an overwhelming experience,\u201d said Nicole Green of Mount Laurel, a Bayada field nurse who attended the luncheon with co-workers from across the nation.\n\nGreen said employees were asked not to divulge the size of individual gifts.\n\n\"But it was very generous,\" the three-year employee said.\n\nThe gifts are part of the firm's expected transition to nonprofit status early next year and a way to show gratitude to employees, Baiada said.\n\nThe founder of Moorestown-based Bayada Home Health Care on Monday announced a $20 million gift for his employees. (Photo: Courier-Post file photo)\n\n\u201cI have spent a lot of time reflecting on what has gotten us to this point and what I am particularly thankful for,\" he said.\n\nGreen said Baiada's appreciation for his employees was even more meaningful than the financial gain.\n\n\"It meant a lot to be recognized,\" she said. \"He's very sincere, and everything is just done from the heart.\"\n\nThe ceremony took place at Bellevue Hotel in Philadelphia, just a block away from where Baiada opened his firm\u2019s first service office in 1975, the company noted.\n\nIt said Baiada tapped $16,000 in savings to launch the home health care company. Today, the firm employs more than 26,000 people.\n\nThe move to nonprofit status is designed to protect Bayada from sale and to direct the firm\u2019s profits into its \u201cmission and culture,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe chairman's gifts were announced as Bayada faces two lawsuits alleging home health care aides were improperly denied overtime pay.\n\nOne suit demands additional pay for client service managers. The other seeks to represent nurses, occupational therapists and other home health care aides.\n\nFederal judges have granted conditional certification to each lawsuit, which still await final certification.\n\nBayada contends its pay policies are consistent with state and federal laws.\n\nJim Walsh: @jimwalsh_cp; 856-486-2646; jwalsh@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/11/21/bayada-home-health-care-founder-shocks-workers-20-million-gift/2077404002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Broncos promote Langley to replace Jones on roster", "description": "The Denver Broncos have promoted second-year cornerback Brendan Langley to replace veteran Adam Jones", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/broncos-promote-langley-to-replace-jones-on-roster/38581579/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:25:47Z", "content": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo.

(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe body of the San Francisco 49ers fan who went missing during a Monday Night Football game earlier this month was found in a saltwater pond several miles north of Levi's Stadium, officials confirmed in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe Santa Clara Police Department confirmed that the coroner's office had positively identified the man as Ian Powers, a 32-year-old from Spokane, Washington. The statement came a little more than two days after a group of duck hunters found his body.\n\nThe coroner's office determined that Powers died of saltwater drowning, and his death has been ruled an accident, according to the statement. But it remains unclear how or why he wound up in the water about a mile north of a nearby dock and roughly two miles north of the 49ers' stadium.\n\nAuthorities had been searching for Powers since he went missing Nov. 12, when he paused his trip from Spokane to Los Angeles to attend the 49ers' game against the New York Giants. Powers, who was wearing a red 49ers T-shirt and hat, told his girlfriend that he was leaving to use the restroom and never returned, according to police. She reported that he was missing the following morning.\n\nAfter multiple days of searching, police said Tuesday they had closed the investigation into his disappearance due to the findings of the coroner's office.\n\n\"Please respect everyone's grieving process, and only offer condolences, not stories, or theories on how he died,\" Sean Patrick Powers, who identified himself as the man's uncle, wrote on Facebook on Monday. \"The speculation just makes things worse.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "The Latest: Oklahoma tops Florida to start Battle 4 Atlantis", "description": "The Latest: Christian James scores 18 points to help Oklahoma hold off Florida 65-60 in 1st round of Battle 4 Atlantis in Bahamas", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/the-latest-oklahoma-tops-florida-to-start-battle-4-atlantis/38581419/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:14:57Z", "content": "PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) The Latest on the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas (all times local): 2:05 p.m. Christian James scored 18 points to help Oklahoma hold off Florida 65-60 in Wednesday's first round of the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahama\u2026 [+1546 chars]", "fulltext": "PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas (all times local):\n\n11:35 p.m.\n\nDe'Andre Hunter had 15 points, nine assists and eight rebounds to help fourth-ranked Virginia beat Middle Tennessee 74-52 in the last first-round game at the Battle 4 Atlantis on Wednesday night.\n\nKyle Guy also scored 15 points and Braxton Key added 13 for the Cavaliers (4-0), who never trailed but didn't put the game away until midway through the second half. Virginia led 9-0 and 30-9, only to see the Blue Raiders claw to within 38-30 early in the second half.\n\nGuy answered with a 3-pointer to start a 9-0 run that stretched the lead back out.

Coach Tony Bennett didn't sound sure beforehand about whether Salt would be ready to go for the start of the Battle 4 Atlantis, saying it would depend on how he came through practices on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nBut Salt subbed in at the 15:28 mark Wednesday night in the last of four first-round games. He grabbed an early rebound and scored inside. He also felt well enough to stretch out and dive on the floor for a loose ball with about 12\u00bd minutes left.\n\nSalt averages 3.5 points and 3.0 rebounds on the season.\n\n___\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nJalen Crutcher scored 20 points to help Dayton beat Butler 69-64 in Wednesday night's first round at the Battle 4 Atlantis.\n\nJosh Cunningham added 18 points for the Flyers (4-0), who shot 54 percent and never trailed.

That set a tournament record and tied a program record for Wisconsin.\n\nReuvers said Gard had talked before the game about players knowing when \"to cover for each other\" if a teammate makes a defensive mistake. Gard said Reuvers is \"a heck of an eraser back there\" after he repeatedly swatted away shots, primarily by rotating to help at the rim.\n\nThe previous Atlantis record was seven blocks, first set by Connecticut's Andre Drummond against Florida State in November 2011 and matched by Kansas' Joel Embiid against UTEP two years later.\n\nHe also matched the Wisconsin single-game record set by Brad Sellers against Toledo in November 1982.\n\n___\n\n4:35 p.m.\n\nEthan Happ had 16 points and 12 rebounds before fouling out late, and No. 25 Wisconsin beat Stanford 62-46 in Wednesday's first round at the Battle 4 Atlantis.\n\nSophomore Nate Reuvers had a tournament-record nine blocked shots for the Badgers (4-0), a total that also tied the longtime Wisconsin single-game record.\n\nD'Mitrik Trice added 16 points for Wisconsin, which shot just 35 percent after halftime yet came up with a critical 9-0 burst to seize control after the Cardinal had gotten within a basket with 6:53 left.\n\nKZ Okpala's 3-pointer pulled Stanford (2-2) to within 44-42.

Stanford faces Florida on Thursday in the consolation bracket.\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nChristian James scored 18 points to help Oklahoma hold off Florida 65-60 in Wednesday's first round of the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas.\n\nAaron Calixte hit two clinching free throws with 5.0 seconds left for the Sooners (4-0), who led by 11 in the first half and 63-54 with 3:38 left. The Gators got back in it with 3-pointers from KeVaughn Allen and Noah Locke to make it a one-possession game, then had a final possession to pull within one or tie it in the final 15 seconds.\n\nBut Allen's driving shot missed, setting up Calixte's free throws to advance the Sooners in the winners' bracket.\n\nOklahoma helped itself by taking a 48-34 rebounding advantage, including 15-7 on the offensive glass.\n\nDontay Bassett had 14 points off the bench to lead the Gators (2-2), who hit a season-high 11 3-pointers after struggling from behind the arc entering the tournament.\n\n___\n\n1:30 a.m.\n\nThe Battle 4 Atlantis opens play Wednesday with four games in the Bahamas, including contests for fourth-ranked Virginia and No. 25 Wisconsin.\n\nThe tournament features five power-conference teams, including Florida, Oklahoma and Stanford.\n\nThe Gators and Sooners meet in the first game, followed by the Cardinal against the 25th-ranked Badgers.

(Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY)\n\nNormally restrained Chief Justice John Roberts took issue on Wednesday with President Donald Trump's characterization of a federal judge who ruled against his administration as an \"Obama judge.\"\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts said in a statement. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n\n\"That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nRoberts issued the statement in response to a request from The Associated Press after Trump's comments about the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco, who on Monday blocked the Trump administration's effort to keep migrants trying to enter the U.S. from applying for asylum.\n\nThe president, who is spending time in Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday, disagreed and posted a response on Twitter Wednesday afternoon detailing his complaints with the court.\n\n\"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,\" Trump posted on Twitter.\n\nHe continued in another post, asking if the 9th Circuit was an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d why so many border cases were filed in that circuit and why were the \"vast number of those cases overturned.\"\n\n\"Please study the numbers, they are shocking,\" the president said. \"We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\"\n\nSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u201cObama judges,\u201d and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d but if it is why...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nTigar's ruling stated the administration's new policy of cutting off asylum to immigrants who enter the country illegally appears to run afoul of U.S. law that specifically allows them to do so.\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" said Tigar, who was nominated by then-President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\n\"This was an Obama judge,\" Trump said Tuesday after a reporter asked him about Tigar's decision.\n\nThe statement rejecting Trump's label was surprising coming from Roberts, a President George W. Bush appointee who has been reluctant to respond to Trump's bellicose comments about the judiciary.\n\nRoberts has previously been a target of Trump's criticisms; in 2016, the then-candidate called the chief justice a \"disaster because of his rulings in favor of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHis statement comes as many legal experts have stressed the need for judicial independence in the Trump era. Others have worried the divisive confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh damaged the court's reputation as being above the political fray.\n\nMore: With Brett Kavanaugh confirmed, Trump's poison touch infects the Supreme Court\n\n\"I think especially in this time when the rest of the political environment is so divided, every single one of us has an obligation to think about what it is that provides the court with its legitimacy,\" Justice Elena Kagan said last month.\n\nWednesday's statement was not the first time Roberts has called a president out. In 2013, Roberts wondered why President Obama continued to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act if he supported same-sex marriage.\n\n\"I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions,\" Roberts said.\n\nIn addition to his attack on Tigar, Trump on Tuesday called the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a \"disgrace\" and vowed to \"put in a major complaint,\" although he did not offer specifics.\n\nMore: Federal appeals court rules against Trump administration effort to end DACA program\n\n\"Every case that gets filed in the 9th Circuit, we get beaten. And then we end up having to go to the Supreme Court, like the travel ban, and we won,\" Trump said, referring to his administration's struggle to implement restrictions on travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe appeals court has been a target of Trump's since that ruling, and the president has suggested breaking up the 9th Circuit, which is the largest appeals court in the U.S.\n\nIts jurisdiction includes nine western states, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands \u2013altogether comprising about 20 percent of the nation's population. And its 29 full-time judges hear more than 12,000 appeals a year \u2013 almost twice as many as other appeals courts.\n\n\"It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts,\" Trump tweeted in January.\n\nIt just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 10, 2018\n\nTrump has long railed against judges, justices and courts that have issued rulings against him.\n\nIn 2016, Trump questioned the impartiality of Judge Gonzalo Curiel \u2013 a U.S.-born federal judge \u2013 because of his \"Mexican heritage\" after Curiel ruled against him in a lawsuit against Trump University\n\nAnd after a ruling against his travel ban by Judge James Robart, Trump denounced the \"ridiculous\" opinion of \"this so-called judge.\"\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nBut even one of Trump's own appointees to the highest court in the land has questioned the criticisms. As he sought confirmation last year, Justice Neil Gorsuch told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that he found Trump's attacks on judges \"demoralizing\" and \"disheartening.\"\n\nContributing: Alan Gomez and Richard Wolf, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/21/john-roberts-trump-statement/2080266002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Doyle Rice, USA TODAY", "title": "A side dish from Siberia?

(Photo: KARIM JAAFAR, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUSA Gymnastics has not voluntarily given up its status as the sport\u2019s national governing body, triggering a hearing that could lead to the organization's demise.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland said she is moving forward with the process to revoke USA Gymnastics' NGB status. The next step is to select the three-person panel to hear the USOC's complaint against USA Gymnastics.\n\nThe panel will be chaired by a USOC board member and have representatives from the NGB and athlete advisory councils. USA Gymnastics will have the opportunity to \u201cpresent factual evidence and legal argument regarding the allegations of the complaint,\u201d the bylaws state.\n\nAfter the hearing, the panel will issue a report and make a recommendation to the USOC\u2019s board of directors. The board then makes the final decision.\n\nThere is no timeframe in the USOC bylaws for the process, and Hirshland said it could take \"several weeks, perhaps a few months.\"\n\n\"As I\u2019ve said before, the path is not crystal clear, but our motives are \u2013 put simply, to ensure the NGB for gymnastics in the United States is the type of organization each gymnast and the coaches, trainers and club owners who support them, deserve,\" Hirshland wrote in an open letter to the gymnastics community.\n\nThe move does not come as a complete surprise. Despite being informed by the USOC on Nov. 5 that it was beginning the process to revoke its NGB status, known as a Section 8 complaint, USA Gymnastics has continued to operate as if it plans to be around for the long-term.\n\nEarlier this week, it announced it was seeking nominations for its board of directors. In an open letter published Tuesday, board chair Karen Golz said USA Gymnastics was progressing in its search for a new CEO.\n\n\"As we\u2019ve said before, this is a situation in which there are no perfect solutions,\" Hirshland said Wednesday. \"Seeking to revoke recognition is not a decision that the USOC came to easily, but we continue believe it is the right action.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics will continue to operate as usual so long as the revocation process is ongoing. Should it be stripped of its NGB status, the USOC would take control of the elite programs until a new NGB is identified.\n\nUSA Gymnastics could continue to exist, but its members would likely migrate to whatever new group becomes the NGB.\n\nThe USOC is known to have revoked NGB status or cut off funding only three times, with taekwondo, team handball and modern pentathlon. But Hirshland said earlier this month that the USOC had no choice but to step in with USA Gymnastics because of its repeated missteps in trying to move beyond the Larry Nassar scandal.\n\nNassar, the longtime team physician for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State, is serving an effective life sentence after pleading guilty to child pornography and sexual abuse charges. More than 350 girls and young women have said he abused them under the guise of medical treatment, including Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Jordyn Wieber, Kyla Ross and Madison Kocian.\n\nUSA Gymnastics has been through three CEOs since Rachael Denhollander told The Indianapolis Star in September 2016 that Nassar had abused her, prompting hundreds of other women to come forward. Steve Penny was forced out by the USOC in March 2017. Kerry Perry resigned under pressure in September after being roundly criticized during her nine-month tenure for being both aloof and inept.\n\nMary Bono lasted just five days after heavy criticism from Biles and other gymnasts about her fitness to lead and what message her hiring sent to survivors. Bono previously worked at Faegre Baker Daniels, a law firm the IndyStar said had helped USA Gymnastics craft a cover story for Nassar after he was fired.\n\nBono worked for the firm\u2019s consulting arm and was not part of the discussions with Nassar. But the association was considered tone deaf.\n\nThe federation also remains mired in mediation with survivors. It has lost all of its major sponsors, and its national championships were held in August without a title sponsor, almost unheard of for one of the premier Olympic sports in the United States.\n\nAnd in what was the final straw for the USOC, USA Gymnastics said it recently located medical records from the Karolyi ranch that two executives had told Congress were nowhere to be found. Penny, who ordered the removal of the records, was indicted in Walker County, Texas, in September, on a count of tampering with evidence, a third-degree felony.\n\nUSA Gymnastics has defended itself by saying its board inherited \u201can organization in crisis\u201d when it was seated in June, and said it is taking steps to reform. It finally parted ways last week with Ron Galimore, the longtime chief operating officer who, according to emails obtained by IndyStar, helped provide the cover story for Nassar.\n\nBut the moves might have come too late."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "UTSA gets 1st win of season, beats FGCU 76-65", "description": "Jhivvan Jackson made five 3-pointers and scored 21 points in just 15 minutes, Keaton Wallace added four 3s and 19 points and UTSA beat Florida Gulf Coast 76-65 in the Gulf Coast Showcase for its first victory of the season", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/utsa-gets-1st-win-of-season-beats-fgcu-76-65/38581281/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:49:21Z", "content": "ESTERO, Fla.

Oklahoma won 55-40. (AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Les Miles understood the inherent awkwardness of the situation the moment he accepted the job at Kansas, and he made every effort to keep from compounding it during his first week on campus.\n\nYet he also wanted to meet the young men who might soon form the foundation of his turnaround.\n\nSo limiting himself to just a few minutes, he popped into the team room at the Anderson Family Football Complex this past week. He complimented the Jayhawks on a gutsy performance in a road loss to Oklahoma, wished them luck on Friday against Texas and quietly stepped aside.\n\nBecause until that game is over, the Jayhawks still belong to David Beaty.\n\n\"They're preparing with another coach to play a very quality Texas team, so we did not want to distract,\" Miles explained, \"but when I walked in I saw that familiar smile. The enjoyment they're having in college football. They're buddies, looking at each other like, 'Who is this guy?' Which is fine. But that was a wonderful day for me. I enjoyed it greatly.\"\n\nIt is rare enough that a school hires the next head coach before a season is complete, but it is exceedingly rare when that move is made with the predecessor still occupying the corner office.\n\nBut it's not as if both coaches earning paychecks from Kansas don't have their hands full.\n\nMiles has spent much of his first week calling around to prospective assistant coaches, and he promised to interview Beaty's current staff if they have interest in remaining. He also took a deeper look at the current roster and no doubt began to formulate a plan for recruiting.\n\nThe early signing window in December is fast approaching, a big reason athletic director Jeff Long moved so quickly with the hiring. Kansas has exactly one known commitment.\n\n\"The reception we've had as we polled some of the key candidates has been very strong,\" Miles said. \"Get on the phone and touch base, qualified coordinators first, shrink the list, go see them and have them see us. As soon as you finish with the coordinators, you take up the assistant coaches very quickly, because those guys that know the coordinators and recruiting areas.\"\n\nAll the while, Beaty will be trying to prepare the Jayhawks to beat Texas. Again.\n\nIt was just two years ago that he had arguably the biggest highlight of his four seasons with the Jayhawks, when Kansas upset the Longhorns at Memorial Stadium. It seemed at the time as if it might boost his rebuilding job to the next level, though it never quite worked out that way.\n\nBeaty still has just six wins heading into his final game on the sideline.\n\n\"I haven't spoken with him and we probably won't speak, but that's OK,\" Beaty said. \"I'm going to be the coach here through the rest of the week and then it's going to be time for a change.\"\n\nSo what about the players, all those kids that were recruiting and sweated and bled for Beaty over the past few years, and now look ahead with equal parts trepidation and excitement?\n\nYes, they said, there is a bit of awkwardness this week. But not as much as you might think.\n\n\"I'm excited for him and this program here. It's promising,\" said Jayhawks defensive tackle Daniel Wise, who will be playing his final game Saturday. \"We know Les Miles, we know what he can do with the guy like Pooka (Williams), obviously. We know he loves Pooka already, he's a Louisianimal. I'm just happy for him and the future, the direction they're headed.\"\n\nWilliams is certainly familiar with Miles having grown up in Louisiana, and so is Corione Harris, a four-star cornerback who Beaty managed to pluck from the bayou this past recruiting cycle.\n\nThe pair of freshmen could be important building blocks for Miles going forward.\n\n\"I'm happy he got the job, but I really don't really know Les Miles like that. I don't have like a relationship with him,\" Jayhawks safety Mike Lees said. \"Corione has more of a relationship with him than me. I just know him as a LSU head coach. That's where I know him from. When he was there, he wasn't recruiting me. After he left, then they started recruiting me.\"\n\nWhat did Harris tell him about Miles?\n\n\"Not really much,\" Lee said. \"All he told me was he eats grass. And I was just like, wow.\"\n\nHe also wins games. He did it at Oklahoma State, turning around that Big 12 also-ran over four seasons in Stillwater, and he did it with the Tigers, winning a national championship.\n\nMore than Miles' diet, that pedigree is what has Kansas players optimistic about the future.\n\n\"I'm excited in the direction I think he's going to move this program,\" Kansas linebacker Joe Dineen Jr. said. \"Obviously, I owe all of my stuff to Coach Beaty and my successes to Coach Beaty, but I'm excited to see what he can do with this program. And I think \u2014 I hope \u2014 the Jayhawk Nation gets behind him, and I think they will. I'm excited to see what he can do.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Following a few simple, important steps can help caregivers make the trip as safe, pleasant and comfortable as possible for their loved one.\u201d\n\nHere's what the AFA suggests:\n\nTalk to the person's doctor to make sure it's OK for the patient to travel.\n\nPlan the trip, while keeping the family member's needs in mind. Make sure to pick the options that causes the least amount of stress and anxiety.\n\nTake plenty of breaks along the way for snacks, restrooms or resting.\n\nLet the airlines and/or hotels know beforehand that one of its passengers or guests will have memory impairment and adjustments might be necessary.\n\nTry to maintain the person's routine as much as possible, including their eating and sleeping schedule. Small or unfamiliar changes could be overwhelming, especially to those with dementia.\n\nBring important health and legal documents, a list of medications and physician information. An identification bracelet could be helpful or clothing tags with the full name of the person and caregiver on it.\n\nFor more information or questions about traveling with someone who has Alzheimer's, call the AFA's national toll-free helpline (866-232-8484) or visit its website.\n\nMore: 9 insanely affordable winter vacation destinations for 2018-19\n\nMore: Holiday travel with children: Follow this checklist to keep kids safe and smiling\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/2018/11/21/holiday-travel-tips-passengers-alzheimers/2078733002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Seahawks WRs lead league in TD celebration creativity", "description": "The Seahawks' wide receivers may not come close to leading the league in catches because of Seattle's run-first offense", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/seahawks-wrs-lead-league-in-td-celebration-creativity/38581253/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a2df851cdf614a1c9b81d1826b3c9fc5c22bda4/c=0-285-5472-3363/local/-/media/2018/11/21/USATODAY/usatsports/ba344bb054ec4f269287927e6237029e.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:42:13Z", "content": "Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin (89) takes part in a touchdown celebration with Tyler Lockett, left, and Nick Vannett, right, after Baldwin caught a pass for a touchdown against the Green Bay Packers during the first half of an NFL football game, \u2026 [+3966 chars]", "fulltext": "Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin (89) takes part in a touchdown celebration with Tyler Lockett, left, and Nick Vannett, right, after Baldwin caught a pass for a touchdown against the Green Bay Packers during the first half of an NFL football game, Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) \u2014 The conversation takes place throughout the week inside the Seattle Seahawks training facility. A group of four or five throwing out suggestions and discussing whether their idea can actually be executed.\n\nBy the time Friday rolls around, a final decision has been made and the group spends part of the day seeing if they can pull off the plan successfully if the opportunity presents itself on game day.\n\n\"They're actually a group effort. We all put our two cents in and come up with something,\" Seattle wide receiver David Moore said. \"(We'll) come up with something, 'Hey we can throw this in, maybe this will look good,' and then there you go.\"\n\nThe talk isn't about a play or scheme. Instead, it's about what has become a must-see event anytime the Seahawks wide receivers find the end zone. Their touchdown celebrations have drawn attention around the NFL and set a standard they're trying to top each week.\n\n\"At first, it was all just about having fun, right? ... It has become an expectation,\" wide receiver Doug Baldwin said. \"Now everybody's asking us what's coming up next, but first and foremost we've got to score so let's take care of the football aspect of it first and then just have fun if it comes along.\"\n\nThe group of receivers \u2014 Baldwin, Moore, Jaron Brown and Tyler Lockett primarily \u2014 may not come close to leading the league in catches because of Seattle's run-first offense. But when any of the four find the end zone, getting past the goal line is just the beginning.\n\nIt started in London when the Seahawks beat Oakland and Brown caught a touchdown on Seattle's opening drive. Brown at first briefly celebrated by himself before being joined by Baldwin, Lockett and Moore with an ode to \"Drumline\" and a fight scene from the movie that was released in 2002.\n\nTwo weeks later after Lockett caught a TD in Detroit, it was an ode to baseball , the World Series and Nolan Ryan when Baldwin, the hitter, charged Lockett, the pitcher, and was knocked out in the process.\n\nAgainst the Chargers, it was \"The Four Heartbeats ,\" which was a tribute to the 1991 movie \"The Five Heartbeats.\" Each wide receiver showed off a bit of his dance moves and Brown \u2014 who caught the touchdown \u2014 ended up getting the \"featured\" role at the end of the routine. It's the celebration most say was the best.\n\n\"I told them from the jump, 'Yeah that's not going to work.' Because you have to be on beat with that and you all aren't going to hear each other,\" running back Mike Davis said. \"It actually looked good. I was surprised by that.\"\n\nAnd last week in the victory over the Packers, tight end Nick Vannett was added to the mix following Baldwin's TD catch. The celebration this time : \"Swag Surfin'.\"\n\n\"I don't think it went as well as we wanted it to,\" Baldwin said.\n\nThere was supposed to be one more celebration thrown into the recent mix, but as Baldwin said, \"Tyler screwed it up.\" After Lockett's 23-yard touchdown reception against the Los Angeles Rams on Nov. 11, there was supposed to be another group performance. But before everyone could gather, Lockett handed the ball to boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was in an end zone suite.\n\nThat celebration was supposed to be specific to the Rams game and was not carried over to the following week. It's another sign of how serious and how much fun this group is having.\n\nAnd no, it's not taking away from their preparation for what's important \u2014 the actual game \u2014 including this week's matchup against Carolina that has major NFC playoff implications.\n\n\"It's minutes, but obviously you guys know when we focus in on something, we get focused in on something so it doesn't take us too long to get it down,\" Baldwin said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Mary Clare Jalonick, AP)\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday urged a judge to deny a request from a former Trump campaign adviser to delay the commencement of his jail sentence, which is scheduled to begin Monday.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts while working for the Trump campaign in 2016. In September, he was sentenced to two weeks in jail, a year of supervised release, 200 hours of community service and a $9,500 fine. His sentence was scheduled to begin Nov. 26.\n\nPapdopoulos is the first former Trump aide to be sentenced in Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nPapadopoulos' lawyers filed a motion on Friday asking a judge to allow their client to stay out of jail until a ruling is handed down in another case, which is challenging the constitutionality of Mueller's appointment as special counsel. They said for Papadopoulos to \"serve a sentence for a conviction that may be void, would be unjust.\"\n\nSome of the arguments made in the case arguing Mueller's appointment was unconstitutional echo those made challenging President Donald Trump's selection of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. They say the process that gave Mueller his authority violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and that his powers make him a \"principal officer\" requiring Senate confirmation.\n\nMueller's team argued Papadopoulos has no appeal pending and that the deadline to file one expired on Sept. 25. They also said his lawyers' point about waiting on the case challenging Mueller's appointment didn't wash because a court issued an opinion on the matter in August.

Though his accuracy still leaves something to be desired on a regular basis, his ability to extend plays and do damage when leaving the pocket has made him highly effective in Nagy's attack.\n\n#Bears Wednesday Injury Report:\n\nDNP: LB Aaron Lynch (concussion); TE Adam Shaheen (concussion); QB Mitchell Trubisky (right shoulder)\n\nGame Status: Lynch (out); Shaheen (out); Trubisky (doubtful)\n\n*The Bears held a walk-through Wednesday; participation reports are estimates \u2014 Chicago Bears (@BearsPR) November 21, 2018\n\nIf Trubisky can't answer the bell, career backup Chase Daniel \u2014 he has an excellent grasp of this offense having worked with Nagy in Kansas City and with Doug Pederson in K.C. and Philadelphia \u2014 would be in line to make just his third NFL start even though this is his 10th season.\n\nWith the Bears playing Sunday Night Football, & then in the early window Thursday on Thanksgiving in Detroit, they will have the fastest Sunday to Thursday turnaround since 2000.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 When Southern California offensive coordinator Tee Martin told incoming freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown to learn all three wide receiver positions, it was intended for his future development.\n\nSt. Brown would stay at one spot in his first season, the same approach Martin used successfully with former Trojan stars Nelson Agholor and JuJu Smith-Schuster as freshmen.\n\nMartin never expected St. Brown to be so advanced that he would capable of playing in the slot or outside, let alone emerge as a main option in the passing game for USC with 50 receptions for 656 yards, both team highs.\n\n\"It's not normal for a young guy to be able to do that,\" Martin said. \"Really haven't seen it.\"\n\nIt was clear from the start that St. Brown would not need to be brought along slowly into college football. He caught a 44-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the fourth quarter in the season opener against UNLV, helping USC to pull away with the win by making seven receptions for 98 yards. It helped that St. Brown had played with freshman quarterback JT Daniels at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California, and the rapport they had built in practices and games gave them a comfort level as they adjusted to a new level of competition.\n\nSt. Brown was rotating with starters Tyler Vaughns and Michael Pittman Jr. early on, with his work in the slot limited to third downs. Martin quickly realized that St. Brown was capable of handling much more than he expected, and St. Brown's usage has continued to grow.\n\n\"I expect things for myself, but to tell you that I would be expecting this, I'd be lying if I said yes,\" said St. Brown, who has three touchdown receptions. \"I worked hard. Worked with Tee, coaches, our teammates, my line, my quarterback. They are doing a great job. A whole team effort I think.\"\n\nMartin remains impressed that St. Brown has been able to execute multiple roles with only player-run summer workouts, training camp and three months of game preparation to understand the offense.\n\n\"Amon-Ra is the first one to grasp it all during the course of a season not being a mid-year (enrollee), not having a spring under his belt and just throughout the course of the year learning, which is very rare and unique,\" Martin said. \"I give him credit for that.\"\n\nThere can be no doubting St. Brown's ability to absorb information. Fluent in French and German, he showed off his foreign language skills in a radio interview with a reporter after practice.\n\nHowever, it was getting the chance to put what he had learned into action on the field that allowed St. Brown to truly process his different roles.\n\n\"Going in, whether it's with the ones or twos, to just get physical reps is what helps it stick to your brain,\" St. Brown said. \"I mean you can read papers all day, but until you go out there and actually do it, it's something different.\"\n\nGoing into what could be the final game of his freshman season, with USC (5-6) needing to defeat No. 3 Notre Dame to become bowl-eligible, St. Brown is looking forward to showing off his improvement in a rivalry he is quite familiar with. St. Brown's oldest brother, Equanimeous, played three seasons for the Fighting Irish and led the team in receptions and yards receiving in 2016-17.\n\nThe third St. Brown brother, Osiris, is a redshirt freshman at Stanford.\n\nEquanimeous St. Brown had 10 receptions for 123 yards and two touchdowns in three games against USC, and Amon-Ra St. Brown is looking forward to making his mark in the famed intersectional rivalry.\n\n\"But no real trash talk as of right now,\" St. Brown said. \"I'm sure he's going to be watching the game. I'm excited, he's excited. It's going to be a good game.\"\n\n\"To add to the rivalry that already exists, I know that's something special between those two,\" Martin said.\n\nEven if St. Brown cannot help USC upset Notre Dame and earn one more game to show off his skills this season, Martin has seen enough to believe St. Brown can be the next great receiver for the Trojans.\n\n\"He has everything,\" Martin said. \"It's really rare that a guy can do what he's been able to do as a true freshman.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It won\u2019t. But it should.\n\nFor a very long time, the consensus view of the foreign policy establishment in both political parties has been that the United States has two fundamental objectives in the Middle East: Protect Israel and keep the oil, particularly Saudi oil, flowing to fuel the world economy.\n\nLately, at least neoconservatives have added a third: Contain and deter Iran.\n\nSubjected to a cold-blooded assessment, none of these constitutes an actionable security interest for America.\n\nThese days, the United States doesn't rely much on Middle Eastern oil imports. Moreover, the Saudis are no longer in a position to weaponize oil exports, as they did against the United States in 1973.\n\nThe House of Saud relies on two things to keep their rickety hereditary monarchy in power. The first is brutish repression. The second is subventions and subsidies to keep the populace sedated.\n\nSimply put, the House of Saud needs the money.\n\nTalker: Ivanka Trump's email usage should be investigated\n\nRelated: Don't believe Donald Trump; we'll be just fine without Saudi Arabia\n\nSign up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nDespite duping U.S. presidents of both parties and virtually all of the foreign policy establishment, Saudi Arabia has never been a U.S. ally. The only interest the House of Saud has ever had regarding America is to get us to fight their fights for them.\n\nIn that, they have succeeded mightily. And never more so than with the neoconservative conviction, embraced fully by President Donald Trump and his administration, that containing and deterring Iran should be a principal U.S. objective in the region.\n\nSaudi Arabia has persuaded U.S. leaders that we should enter its regional competition for influence with Iran fully and unreservedly on the side of Saudi Arabia. And align ourselves completely with the regional Sunni powers, particularly Saudi Arabia and Egypt, irrespective of how reprehensible their domestic policies are or become.\n\nWhich brings us to Israel. Iran does still threaten to destroy Israel, and it also issues threats against the United States. But unlike America, Iran can reach Israel.\n\nBy contrast, Saudi Arabia and the other Sunni regional powers have established a sort of cold peace with Israel.\n\nIsrael is a brave country in a dangerous neighborhood. It is the only true U.S. ally in the region.\n\nThe United States should be willing to sell Israel the armaments needed to protect itself. And defend the country against calumnies in international forums, such as the United Nations.\n\nBut U.S. interests aren't advanced by offering Israel formal or de facto security guarantees. Its fights shouldn't automatically become our fights.\n\nThere is a six-decade history of maladroit U.S. involvement in the snake pit of the Middle East's geopolitics. Not much of an argument can be made that those interventions have made the Middle East better. Or America safer.\n\nU.S. interests lie in being as insulated from the snake pit as possible.\n\nRobert Robb is a columnist at The Arizona Republic, where this column first appeared. You can follow him on Twitter: @RJRobb.\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nIt's sad that Americans fall for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's lies. A journalist was murdered by Saudi Arabia's government, and President Donald Trump praises them.\n\n\u2014 Jeff Sparks\n\nTrump has done nothing? His administration already took the same action as most of our European allies: sanctions. Trump has decided to protect U.S. jobs and keep gas prices lower to help our middle class.\n\n\u2014 Larry Gilbert\n\nThe U.S. moral reputation has just fallen to a new low. Trumps discredits evidence from the CIA for his own benefit, thinking it would help his party. In Trump's world, what is the life of one Washington Post journalist if it helps him win elections?\n\n\u2014 Nobby Grimsby\n\nSaudi Arabia has come a long way under Salman. He has sidelined religious clerics who controlled the kingdom, and he has provided women the right to vote and drive. And perhaps more changes are coming.\n\n\u2014 Tom Ponmalayil\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nUSA TODAY, editorial: \"President Donald Trump has shrank from blaming the 33-year-old Saudi leader, whom Trump sees as a vital ally in countering Iranian influence and in brokering a Middle East peace deal. ... According to the CIA, a crown prince with a history of repressing dissent acted ruthlessly and recklessly to silence a critic, in rank violation of American values. Anything less than severe sanctions \u2014 diplomatic, economic and military \u2014 is tantamount to letting him get away with murder.\"\n\nRichard North Patterson, HuffPost: \"As usual, our presidential apprentice is bargaining against himself: The Saudis need our military hardware, the best in the world, and America is energy self-sufficient. An end to military assistance would ground the Saudi air force; the threatened oil boycott would wind up benefiting America and devastating the Saudi oil industry. Moreover, once King Salman dies, some within the Saudi royal family reportedly hope to replace MBS (the crown prince) with a saner man, his uncle. Given all that, any competent president would figure out how to use our leverage to separate the interests of Saudi Arabia from those of Mohammed bin Salman.\"\n\nChristopher Dickey, Daily Beast: \"Of course we know Trump is a sucker for authoritarian assassins: Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, Rodrigo Duterte, to name a few. But MBS now appears in a class by himself, not for the quantity of his killing (the foolish Yemen war aside) but for the quality of his ineptitude. Trump has scrambled to cover for the crown prince in the Khashoggi affair, wishing it would all just go away, but he continues to be confronted by the growing realization that this murderous Saudi who promised him so much is not only reckless; he\u2019s inept.\"\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/21/trump-should-cut-ties-saudi-arabia-khashoggis-death-talker/2078149002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Clint Eastwood is an elderly drug courier in 'The Mule'", "description": "Clint Eastwood directs and stars as an elderly World War II veteran and horticulturist who works as a courier for a Mexican drug cartel in \"The Mule.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/movies/2018/11/21/clint-eastwood-elderly-drug-courier-the-mule/2080023002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/28911775001/28911775001_5970089262001_5970089901001-vs.jpg?pubId=28911775001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:17:06Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Yanda insists his spit was not directed at Bengals player", "description": "Baltimore Ravens guard Marshal Yanda vehemently denies he spit in the face of a Bengals player at the end of a scrum last Sunday", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/yanda-insists-his-spit-was-not-directed-at-bengals-player/38580939/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:06:35Z", "content": "OWINGS MILLS, Md.

(AP Photo/Brad Tollefson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDavid Beaty has already been replaced at Kansas as he gets ready to coach his final game with the Jayhawks.\n\nFormer Texas Tech quarterback Kliff Kingsbury is again on the hot seat as coach of his alma mater. There is even uneasiness around 79-year-old Bill Snyder, who first got to Kansas State about three decades ago and has twice resurrected the Wildcats program.\n\nBut there still is a lot of stability among Big 12 coaches going into the final weekend of the regular season:\n\nBAYLOR (5-6)\n\nMatt Rhule, second season (6-17). Signed through 2023 season.\n\nThe Bears can get bowl eligible with a win over Texas Tech. Rhule took on quite a task in the wake of Baylor's sexual assault scandal . He was given a seven-year contract and has built a solid foundation in Waco. Still with a young roster, including sophomore quarterback Charlie Brewer, the Bears have gone from 1-11 in Rhule's debut to five wins.\n\nIOWA STATE (6-4)\n\nMatt Campbell, third season (17-18). Signed through 2023 season.\n\nThe question isn't whether Campbell will draw interest from other teams \u2014 even in the NFL. The question is whether Campbell wants to stay in Ames. Iowa State will have its best-ever Big 12 finish if it beats Kansas State . Campbell agreed to a new six-year contract after last season. Iowa State also gave raises to his staff and is about to start on enhancements to its football facilities and stadium.\n\nKANSAS STATE (5-6)\n\nBill Snyder, 27th season (215-116-1). Signed through 2022 season.\n\nKansas State has to win at Iowa State to avoid missing a bowl game for the first time since 2009, the first season of Snyder's second tenure in the Manhattan. Snyder said again this week that he will evaluate after the season whether he will return next year, but there has been growing unrest in the program. Many believe that Snyder, who prefers that his son and special teams coordinator, Sean, eventually replaces him, will retire after this year. The question then becomes whether Snyder will get his wish.\n\nKANSAS (3-8)\n\nDavid Beaty, fourth season (6-31). Fired two weeks ago.\n\nThe Les Miles era begins after the Jayhawks host Texas in Beaty's finale. The former LSU coach, who reached two BCS title games and won one of them, was hired on Sunday to turn around the downtrodden program wrapping up its 10th consecutive losing season. Beaty made some strides even if the win-loss record doesn't show it. He inherited a disaster from Charlie Weis and improved the talent, increased scholarship numbers and will ultimately leave the program in much better shape than he received it.\n\nOKLAHOMA (10-1)\n\nLincoln Riley, second season (22-3). Signed through 2023 season.\n\nThe 35-year-old Riley, who succeeded the suddenly-retired Bob Stoops in the summer of 2017, can probably stay at Oklahoma as long as he wants. He got a raise last year after OU's third consecutive Big 12 title. When the Cleveland Browns' job opened, Riley's name was brought up so frequently that he publicly said he wasn't interested in making the jump to the NFL \u2014 at least for now.\n\nOKLAHOMA STATE (6-5)\n\nMike Gundy, 14th season (120-58). Signed through 2022 season.\n\nGundy will fall short of a fourth consecutive 10-win season, but got decent results out of a rebuilding year at his alma mater after replacing a record-setting quarterback with a fifth-year senior who became a first-time starter. The Cowboys beat Big 12 title contenders West Virginia and Texas, and lost 48-47 to rival Oklahoma after missing a 2-point conversion with a minute left.\n\nTCU (5-6)\n\nGary Patterson, 18th season (165-63), Signed through 2023 season.\n\nTCU has to beat Oklahoma State at home to make a bowl for the 16th time in Patterson's 18 seasons. The Horned Frogs have only three losing seasons under Patterson, and rebounded the following year with at least 10 wins each time. After going to the Big 12 championship game last year, TCU has been decimated by injuries; a fifth-year quarterback is set for his first career start in the regular season finale.\n\nTEXAS (8-3)\n\nTom Herman, second season (15-9). Signed through 2021 season.\n\nWith sophomore quarterback Sam Ehlinger, the Longhorns are a win over Kansas away from playing for their first Big 12 championship since 2009. Texas, whose national title 13 years ago is still the most recent one for the Big 12, was coming off three consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1930s when Herman took over.\n\nTEXAS TECH (5-6)\n\nKliff Kingsbury, sixth season (35-39), Signed through 2020 season.\n\nKingsbury's job was likely saved by winning the regular season finale at Texas last season. While the Red Raiders are clearly a better team, they are 19-34 in Big 12 games under Kingsbury. They are 28-39 overall since starting 7-0 in his debut 2013 season. True freshman quarterback Alan Bowman was the nation's top passer before a partially deflated lung that has sidelined him twice. He missed last week's 21-6 loss at Kansas State when Tech had 181 total yards, its fewest since 2010.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA (8-2)\n\nDana Holgorsen, eighth season (61-39). Signed through 2021 season.\n\nThe Mountaineers will play for the Big 12 title if they can beat No. 6 Oklahoma at home, and need two more wins for Holgorsen's third 10-win season. WVU was 10-3 with an Orange Bowl win over Clemson in his first season in 2011 before going 26-25 in the team's first four years in the Big 12. Holgorsen has built a reputation of landing quality transfers, including quarterback Will Grier.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Cliff Brunt, Luke Meredith, John Raby and Dave Skretta contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Burr-Kirven is No. 2 in the country in tackles heading into Friday\u2019s Apple Cup against No. 7 Washington State. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Of all the impact players on the standout defense for No. 16 Washington, Ben Burr-Kirven might be the most unassuming.\n\nHe doesn't seek attention. Doesn't celebrate every play he makes. All he does is make tackles, and make them at a rate rarely seen at Washington in the past three decades.\n\n\"College football, there's a ton of snaps, offenses go fast, so you end up playing 65, 70 snaps a game on defense and a lot of teams like to run the ball so if you're playing linebacker you're going to get a lot of tackles,\" Burr-Kirven said.\n\nBurr-Kirven will be incredibly important Friday against No. 7 Washington State in the Apple Cup with a berth in the Pac-12 title game on the line. With the way the Cougars use running backs James Williams and Max Borghi out of the backfield, and the amount of underneath routes in the passing game, Burr-Kirven is likely to be busy trying to make tackles in space.\n\nThat means adding to his total of 145 tackles through 11 games. That's second-most in the country, and he's likely to take over the top spot with UMass linebacker Bryton Barr, who has 147, already completing his season.\n\n\"Over the two running backs, they've caught over 100 passes,\" Washington coach Chris Petersen said. \"And he (Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew) gets it out there and it's all about space, creating space. That's what he does, creates space. Space in the flat? That's where the ball's going. Now try and tackle these shifty guys that are hard to tackle. Space downfield? He'll find it. You rush three guys? He'll find the space and throw it in there. It's always a cat and mouse game.\"\n\nBarring something unexpected, Burr-Kirven is going to have more tackles than any other Washington player since 1989. Mason Foster had 163 in 2010, but he's the only one to come close to James Clifford's total of 168 in 1989. Clifford's total came toward the end of an era where multiple players could be awarded a tackle on one play. Rules were changed to where a maximum of two players can be awarded a tackle on one play, and players getting to 100 tackles in a season became an accomplishment.\n\nWhich makes what Burr-Kirven is on pace to accomplish even more remarkable. If he stays with his average through 11 games, Burr-Kirven could finish the season in the neighborhood of 170 tackles.\n\n\"It's just the nature of football. I mean in high school I made a lot of tackles,\" Burr-Kirven said. \"Just how it works out sometimes. It's fun to tackle people. I like tackling, but it's nothing like I'm freaking out about it. I'm just going and playing my game.\"\n\nIt's also a remarkable total considering he plays on a defense filled with several future NFL draft picks. Burr-Kirven has more tackles than the next two players on Washington's defense combined. His current total is 61 more than he recorded last year as a junior, when he led Washington in the category.\n\nFrank Ginda of San Jose State led the country in tackles a year ago with 173, but he is the only player to reach at least 170 since Luke Kuechly had 191 tackles in 2011 to lead the country. If the Huskies beat Washington State, they would get an extra game in playing for the conference title for Burr-Kirven to add to his total. And while he'd be unlikely to reach Kuechly's number, it's not completely out of the question.\n\nPart of the reason Burr-Kirven has so many tackles is the structure of Washington's defense and the fact he doesn't miss. Washington's defensive line regularly eats up blockers, giving Burr-Kirven the freedom to make the stop. It also helps that teams have been leery of throwing heavily against Washington's secondary. The more run plays, the more chances for Burr-Kirven.\n\n\"The way he runs around the field, he literally makes like every play,\" Washington defensive tackle Greg Gaines said. \"He's right there. I don't know how he does it. He's so fast. He has great vision. He's an incredible player.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Quoting the Cincinnati Reds' longtime play-by-play announcer, the Ohio Supreme Court declared Tuesday that \"this one belongs to the Reds.\"\n\nThe state's high court ruled 5-2 that the Major League Baseball franchise is exempt from paying tax on the purchase of bobbleheads and other promotional items the team offers to ticket buyers.\n\nThe opinion written by Justice Patrick Fischer warned that the ruling was specific to the case and might not apply for other sports organizations. But the Department of Taxation's chief legal counsel, Matt Chafin, said the decision essentially shows professional teams how to avoid the \"use tax\" on promotional items.\n\nReds spokesman Rob Butcher said the club is \"happy with the outcome,\" but is still reviewing the opinion.\n\nThe department argued the bobbleheads should be taxed because they're bought by the Reds as giveaways, not sold with tickets. The Reds argued they're exempt because they resell the items as part of the ticket package and Ohio law exempts companies from paying tax on items they buy for resale.\n\nFischer, a Cincinnati resident, led off the opinion with a long summary of Ohio's role in baseball history beginning in 1869, when the Cincinnati Red Stockings became the first all-professional team. There are references to Hall of Famers from Ohio including players Cy Young, Mike Schmidt and Barry Larkin, to the 1975-76 \"Big Red Machine\" champions, and firsts such as Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians becoming the first black American League player and to the first night game being played in Cincinnati.\n\nThen, in explaining the ruling, Fischer wrote that unlike a foul ball or a T-shirt shot into the stands (the Reds use a contraption nicknamed \"Redzilla\" to fire free T-shirts into the crowd) that fans have no expectation of receiving, they buy tickets for games that have been advertised as bobblehead games expecting to get the bobbleheads, which last season included All-Stars Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez.\n\n\"We accordingly conclude that the promotion items constituted things of value in exchange for which fans paid money that was included in the ticket prices,\" the opinion stated.\n\nAfter quoting Reds' broadcaster Marty Brennaman's signature \"this one belongs to the Reds,\" Fischer also quoted Brennaman's late broadcasting partner, Joe Nuxhall, saying the justices were \"rounding third and heading for home.\"\n\nDissenting Justice Mary DeGenaro wrote that the Reds were escaping sales tax or use tax on promotional items that generally apply to similar purchases. She pointed out that the Reds often limit the promotional items, such as free to the first 30,000 fans.\n\nShe said a Reds official had testified that the Reds would \"make accommodations\" to remedy the situation, up to offering refunds to fans who complain about missing out.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kantele Franko contributed in Columbus.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And if somebody hits the right side, where my joystick is, I\u2019m just out of commission.\u201d\n\nOn October 21, 2017, Neil Kelly posted this picture of himself on Facebook. \u201cYesterday, on my way to work,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI was struck by a car on the corner of Main St. and Court St. The result was a nasty road rash on my face, two broken bones in my left leg, and a totaled wheelchair. \u201cI write this not to get sympathy, but as a warning. When you are turning right on a red light \u2013 or anywhere, for that matter \u2013 you must look all around you, even down. \u201cI got very lucky considering all possible outcomes. The next time it happens, I may not be so lucky. I don't want you to be that driver.\" (Photo: Provided/Neil Kelly)\n\nKelly, 28, wears a lap belt, but on that October morning, the nose of the SUV hit him at exactly the wrong angle, unbuckling the belt and throwing Kelly from his chair.\n\nHe went to the hospital in an ambulance, where he learned his left leg was broken in two spots. His wheelchair, worth about $50,000, he said, was totaled. The SUV driver was cited for failure to yield the right-of-way.\n\n\u201cMy memory is literally: Exit sidewalk, see car, see fender, smack car,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI have no idea what happened in between.\u201d\n\nDeath on foot: America's love of SUVs is killing pedestrians\n\n3 years in prison: Woman sentenced for fatal hit-and-run\n\nTech solutions: 5 ways new car tech could save pedestrians\n\nHow common is this?\n\nNearly 6,000 pedestrians in the United States were killed in traffic crashes in 2016, according to the latest data available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Detroit Free Press, in a series called Death on foot, puts it this way: That\u2019s twice the number of deaths tied directly to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nIn Cincinnati, six pedestrians were killed in traffic crashes in 2016. Taking into account population size, Cincinnati pedestrians are faring slightly better than those in Cleveland and slightly worse than those in Columbus. Cincinnati has launched a $500,000-a-year initiative to improve pedestrian safety. That money is largely going toward crosswalks and updated pedestrian-crossing signs and lights.\n\nWhen it comes to crashes involving wheelchairs, fatal or not, data are scant. It's not something the city tracks, nor the state, so it\u2019s tough to know how often people in wheelchairs in Cincinnati are getting hit by people driving cars.\n\nAll Kelly knows is, it\u2019s happened to him three times. Twice at the same intersection.\n\nKelly's second crash was in Symmes Township, Ohio, where he grew up. It was 6:20 p.m. on January 8, and Kelly was on his way home from work. He\u2019d just gotten off the bus and was travelling west on the sidewalk, heading toward his house.\n\nAn SUV was again the culprit. The driver pulled out of a driveway and hit Kelly on his left side. Kelly was too far into the driveway to back up, he said, and not far enough to make it through.\n\n\u201cI was looking up at them. Are they going to stop? Are they going to stop? And, of course, they did not.\u201d\n\nThe impact knocked over Kelly\u2019s chair, though this time he stayed buckled in. He went by ambulance to the hospital, but there were no serious injuries.\n\nThe driver of the SUV was cited for failure to yield.\n\nThe third crash was at 11:15 a.m. on August 27. It was again at the same intersection in downtown Cincinnati, though this time on the opposite side of the road, where a hot-dog cart partially obstructs the view of the sidewalk from the street.\n\nKelly was traveling west on Central Parkway, headed toward Coffee Emporium to meet a friend. He came to the intersection and, when the light changed, he looked both ways and started to cross.\n\nA church van turned the corner and ran into him, again on Kelly\u2019s left. His chair was spun about 90 degrees but stayed upright. Kelly went to the hospital, but there was no serious damage to him or his chair.\n\nThe driver of the van was cited for failure to yield.\n\nHow do we fix this?\n\nCentral Parkway is one of Downtown's busier streets, getting more than 15,000 cars a day in some spots, according to a 2013 traffic count.\n\nWhere Kelly got hit, the parkway is six lanes wide, not including parking lanes, with a large, grassy barrier dividing east- and westbound traffic.\n\nThere are crosswalks and walk signals. Really, Kelly is not sure what else the city could do to ensure his and other pedestrians' safety. His biggest hope is drivers start paying more attention. People take driving for granted, he said, and to some extent, that's understandable. It's the same thing over and over, day after day.\n\n\u201cBut, you know,\" he said, \"I\u2019ve gotten hit three times. I would like to not be hit with a car. I say that jokingly, but, seriously: I would prefer to not be hit with cars.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study from Georgetown University, pedestrians who use wheelchairs are 36 percent more likely to be killed in traffic than the general pedestrian public. Some of that may be attributable to wheelchair design, said John Kraemer, one of the study\u2019s authors \u2013 things like wheelchair height and whether or not the chair has headlights and reflectors.\n\nThen there\u2019s just basic sidewalk design, Kraemer said. Does the architecture favor pedestrians? Are there crosswalks, sidewalk bump-outs and lights? If yes, does the pedestrian light change first, so walkers are well into the intersection before drivers get the go-ahead? At the intersection where Kelly was struck twice, the pedestrian signal changes at the same time as the light for cars.\n\n\u201cSome of it is probably just awareness about who is using the road,\u201d Kraemer said. \u201cA lot of cities have the same issue with cyclists, because drivers just don\u2019t expect bicycles around them.\u201d\n\nCincinnati can do better, said City Councilman Greg Landsman. Landsman, who has been friends with Kelly for several years, said he wants to appoint a \"pedestrian czar,\" someone whose main or only job is to improve pedestrian safety in the city. He said he wants to focus in particular on Central Parkway and Main, where Kelly has been hit twice. He would support looking at changing the timing of the lights. He'd also support heavier traffic enforcement and perhaps even changing the city charter to allow red-light and speed cameras.\n\nIf people got tickets, Landsman said, they might slow down and pay more attention.\n\n\"I'm not looking to spend more money on staff. I'm looking to get better organized and focused,\" he said. \"Making this particular intersection safer for Neil and others needs to be a priority.\"\n\nNeil Kelly at age 5 (Photo: Provided)\n\nForced to change\n\nKelly was paralyzed from an injury at birth, and he\u2019s been using a motorized wheelchair since he was about 4 or 5 years old. He\u2019s been the same level of disabled his entire life, he said, no feeling below his waist and limited feeling from his waist to his chest. His left arm is weak and has limited mobility. His right arm is about 95 percent functional.\n\nHe's never been fearful or timid, and he refuses to let these crashes change that. He still goes to Coffee Emporium. He still takes the same route to work, across Central Parkway. But now, he checks two or three times to make sure no one is coming, and when he hears vehicles on his right side, where his arm still works, he flinches.\n\n\u201cWhich is something I never did before,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the first accident, where Kelly was thrown from his chair and his leg was broken in two spots, his brother bought him a flag to attach to his wheelchair. Kelly is 4\u20196\u2019\u2019 or 4\u20197\u2019\u2019 in his chair; the flag might make him more visible to drivers.\n\nBut Kelly refused to use it.\n\nNeil Kelly at his graduation from Sycamore High School, pictured with his siblings, Greg, Beth and Jennie (Photo: Provided)\n\nHe knows there are some things outside his control, and he accepts that. But as much as it is up to him, he wants to be and look like a regular guy who happens to be sitting down. Waving a flag everywhere he goes would destroy that image.\n\nYes, he got hit. And, yes, he got hurt. But it wasn\u2019t his fault. He followed the rules, and the drivers in each of the three crashes were cited for a reason.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave it to where I\u2019m saying, \u2018Yeah, it was my bad.\u2019 Because it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.\n\n\"But, the third time is the charm.\"\n\nOn August 30, Kelly met with The Enquirer to share his story. He went to Coffee Emporium, just a few blocks from his office. He crossed Main Street, at the same intersection where he'd been hit just three days earlier. But that day, for the first time, he attached the flag to his wheelchair before heading out.\n\nIt's bright orange and sticks several feet above his chair.\n\nHe hates it.\n\n\u201cBut you do what you gotta do,\" he said. \"If I\u2019m not going to be protected, I have to do something for myself.\u201d\n\nThen, just as he did the first time an SUV collided with him in an intersection, he cracked a joke.\n\nAt least it\u2019s not a white flag, he said. Not yet.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/21/man-hit-cars-3-times-10-months-urges-drivers-pay-attention/2076862002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Big 12 breaks out in NFL, can Saints top Chiefs-Rams totals?", "description": "Big 12 breaks out in NFL, can Saints top Chiefs-Rams totals?", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/big-12-breaks-out-in-nfl-can-saints-top-chiefs-rams-totals/38580757/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:46:56Z", "content": "Now that we've seen Big 12 football break out in the NFL Rams 54, Chiefs 51 can we get a college hoops score out of the Saints?

In honor of another installment, we\u2019re celebrating Rocky Week here at For The Win, a look back at the iconic boxing film series that\u2019s made us fans for over four decades. We\u2019ve ranked Rocky\u2019s opponents and asked a real boxing judge to make sure Apollo Creed won his first fight against Balboa.\n\nWhat was it like to work with Sylvester Stallone on a Rocky film? For that answer, we turned to a star of Rocky Balboa: Brian Kenny, currently the host of MLB Now on MLB Network, as well as a blow-by-blow announcer for DAZN.\n\nBack in 2006, Kenny was employed by ESPN. He played himself in a pivotal scene in the flick: On a fictitious show, he and other boxing experts \u2014 including the legendary Burt Sugar and former USA Today scribe Chuck Johnson \u2014 debate whether Balboa would beat Mason \u201cThe Line\u201d Dixon in a fight:\n\nThat starts the wheels in motion to an actual fight between Dixon and Balboa, with scenes filmed at Mandalay Bay before Bernard Hopkins and Jermain Taylor faced off in real life. It was there that Kenny got to hang out with Stallone and watch him work.\n\n\u201cIt was fascinating to see how much came from him,\u201d he told For The Win earlier this week. \u201cYou can tell there\u2019s a lot of love that he puts into it, he really cares about how it all comes together.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s more from Kenny on being a part of the Rocky legacy (this interview has been condensed and edited):\n\nHow did your role happen in the first place?\n\nI got contacted, either it was me or my agent, although later, I heard from Sly himself he wanted me involved.\n\nYou were in the studio for the scene above \u2014 was that set up through ESPN?\n\nIt was in the script there would be this critique of a super-fight. They did in conjunction with us from one of the sets we had. It was easy to conjure up what (an older) Rocky Balboa would be doing and how he\u2019d do against Antonio Tarver as Dixon. It was easy to come up with lines for that.\n\nWas there a script?\n\nThere was but we augmented from there to make it sound natural. We just built off that.\n\nWere you a fan of the film?\n\nOh, of course! There\u2019s no not loving the Rocky films. When Rocky comes out, I\u2019m probably 11 or 12 and of course I see it and everyone\u2019s talking about it, especially if he won or lost in the end. You couldn\u2019t quite tell initially, there were no Internet chats to settle it (laughs).\n\nWhat was your reaction to being a part of the film franchise?\n\nI was very excited. I thought it would be awesome to be one of those guys in the media background. You never know how you\u2019re going to be used. When I was thinking about it, it was, \u201cWell, all of this could hit the cutting room floor.\u201d I\u2019ve been in that role before where I\u2019m a sports commentator and sometimes it hits the cutting room floor, sometimes your shot is on a TV in a bar somewhere. I tried to keep focused on that, that I would do it, it would be exciting, maybe it makes the film or doesn\u2019t. I was in Resurrecting the Champ, I was in a little bar TV. I was thinking I could be on some little TV in Rocky and Paulie\u2019s bar somewhere! When it came out, I was on this huge screen, I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t complain about that.\u201d\n\nDid you meet Stallone?\n\nI saw him on the set a bunch of times, which was fascinating. I\u2019d seen him at fights before here and there. I went up to him one point and said, \u201cI enjoy your work, I\u2019m glad I could do the film.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, I wanted you involved.\u201d\n\nI asked: \u201cIs it okay if I change some of these lines to make it realistic?\u201d\n\n(He said) \u201cThat\u2019s why we have you here. We need to know how it\u2019s supposed to sound.\u201d\n\nIt was great to even speak to him, he has so much charisma and on the set, he\u2019s also directing. All eyes are on him, that\u2019s one of the things I noticed watching them film. He did some scenes at a media conference, a lot hit the cutting room floor. That was the first thing they shot, a press conference for the week of the fight, it was filmed the day before the actual fight in Vegas. When you have your star also directing, that\u2019s a lot of responsibility.\n\nI think I introduced to him to the crowd to tell them, \u201cHey folks, we\u2019re going to film a scene now for Rocky Balboa.\u201d They didn\u2019t use it in the film, but I did, \u201cNow let\u2019s welcome to the ring \u2026\u201d and I bellowed it out with everything I had.\n\nI said, \u201cHey, you\u2019re greeting the former heavyweight champion of the world, Rocky Balboa. We all grew up with Rocky, he\u2019s here and he\u2019s coming into the ring. Give him the proper send-off.\u201d\n\nYou really got a real up-close experience. Do you wish you were in the Creed films or are you satisfied with your 15 minutes of Hollywood fame?\n\nI\u2019m always available (laughs). They\u2019re always fun to do and I\u2019m honored to be in one of them. I also thought the film was really good. I went with my wife and kids to the theaters in Connecticut and I had no idea if I was in or not, so to see myself in it and not a big part of it, but the piece I was in prominently displayed, that\u2019s a thrill you never forget.\n\nThe film holds up. What Stallone does is keep it very human and I thought he brings a lot of humility to Rocky and I thought Rocky Balboa worked on a lot of levels. That was at a time when we thought the franchise was done and he made it work. It\u2019s hard to make it work that many years later."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Erin Jensen, USA TODAY", "title": "Stylish sisters!

Oklahoma won 55-40. (AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Oklahoma wishbone masters Jamelle Holieway and Charles Thompson get nostalgic when they watch Kyler Murray bring an electric quarterback run element to coach Lincoln Riley's Air Raid offense.\n\nHolieway led Oklahoma to a national championship as a freshman in 1985. He rushed for 2,713 yards in his career, the most of any quarterback at the school. Thompson, perhaps the most athletically gifted of coach Barry Switzer's triple-option wishbone wizards, led the Sooners to the verge of a national title in 1987.\n\nMurray may be better. In addition to having one of the most efficient passing seasons in college football history, Murray has rushed for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns this season \u2014 the most rushing yards for an Oklahoma quarterback since Thompson ran for 824 yards in 1988.\n\nThompson sees Murray as the only Oklahoma quarterback who has ever been skilled enough as a runner and accurate enough as a passer that he could have starred in both the wishbone and Air Raid eras.\n\n\"I'm in awe of what I see him doing,\" Thompson said. \"I can very easily see him dragging the toe and riding the fullback like we used to do in the old days.\"\n\nMurray's speed is key; he said Monday that he ran a 4.3-second 40-yard dash earlier in the year. Drafted ninth overall by the Oakland A's in the 2018 Major League Baseball draft, Murray had a 67-yard touchdown run against Texas and a 75-yard scoring run against Kansas.\n\n\"He reminds me of me, but a whole lot faster,\" Holieway said. \"He has that breakaway speed. That makes all the difference.\"\n\nWest Virginia (8-2, 5-2 Big 12) will have to deal with Murray on Friday in a showdown that will determine who plays for the Big 12 title. The 12th-ranked Mountaineers know all about Murray's speed \u2014 he busted loose for a 66-yard run on the first play of Oklahoma's 59-31 win last year .\n\n\"The quarterback's hard to tackle,\" West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen said. \"He's really, really, really quick. I hear he's a good baseball player. If he's better at baseball than he is at football, it's unreal. You've got to contain him. You're not going to stop him. You're not going to get hits on him. You've just got to contain him.\"\n\nMurray doesn't run all the time, either, allowing for the element of surprise. He ran for 99 yards and three touchdowns on just eight carries in the Sooners' 55-40 victory over Kansas last Saturday.\n\n\"For me, my job is to deliver the ball to my teammates through the pocket,\" he said. \"When stuff breaks down, I've got the ability to make something happen.\"\n\nThompson, who averaged 5.9 yards per carry in his career and finished with 1,584 yards rushing in two seasons, said Murray is in the same category of speed as he was.\n\n\"Just his explosion and first-step movement,\" Thompson said. \"And when he makes a decision to go, it's go. It's not, 'I'm going to think about it,' or 'I'm trying to get there.' It's, 'I'm getting there.'\"\n\nMurray's execution of the zone-read option out of the shotgun looks like an updated version of days gone by at Oklahoma.\n\n\"There's times when he has openings or he has a zone-read play where (defenses) collapse on the back and he doesn't pull it,\" West Virginia defensive coordinator Tony Gibson said. \"And there's times where they do account for him and he pulls it and he'll make a guy miss. There's nothing that gives it away when he's going to take off or when he's not.\"\n\nThompson calls Murray's skills \"uncanny.\"\n\n\"It's the ability to have vision and make people miss,\" Thompson said. \"And it's not something you can coach, man. It's natural.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Raby in Morgantown, West Virginia contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Barring a surprise move, 2019 would mark the first time since 2006 that the SEC begins a season with no new head coaches. (AP Photo/Bryan Woolston, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSoutheastern Conference teams may not bother taking a spin on this year's coaching carousel.\n\nWhile at least one coach has been fired already in each of the other Power Five conferences, the SEC doesn't have any coach on the brink of being let go heading into the final weekend of the regular season. Barring a surprise move, 2019 would mark the first time since 2006 that the SEC begins a season with no new head coaches.\n\n\"It's unusual,\" said former Arkansas and Mississippi coach Houston Nutt, who now works as an analyst for CBS Sports. \"Everyone ought to be happy and working even a little bit harder since the ax didn't fall.\"\n\nThe potential lack of coaching movement in the SEC doesn't necessarily mean schools are getting more cautious about making changes.\n\nAfter all, five of the league's 14 members had new coaches this year. The only SEC coaches who started their current jobs before 2016 are Alabama's Nick Saban, Auburn's Gus Malzahn, Kentucky's Mark Stoops and Vanderbilt's Derek Mason. Things had to settle down at some point just to give all these new coaches a chance to prove themselves.\n\nVarious circumstances helped out some coaches whose jobs otherwise might have been in jeopardy.\n\nAuburn (7-4, 3-4 SEC) is out of the Top 25 after being ranked as high as seventh this year, but Malzahn is in the first year of a seven-year, $49 million deal and firing him would be costly.\n\nMalzahn's buyout after this season would be $32 million. Both athletic director Allen Greene and Auburn President Steven Leath have said Malzahn will be back next season.\n\n\"There's no doubt,\" Malzahn said last week. \"I'll be the coach and we'll get this thing turned around. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nMason owns a 23-37 record in five seasons at Vanderbilt. The Commodores (5-6, 2-5) would earn their second bowl bid in three years with a victory over Tennessee this week but will clinch a fifth straight sub-.500 season with a loss.\n\nAlthough Vanderbilt is considered the toughest job in the SEC, Mason inherited a program that had posted back-to-back 9-4 records and Top 25 finishes under James Franklin. Mason still seems safe with Vanderbilt's athletic department in transition.\n\nDavid Williams II announced in September he would step down as Vanderbilt's athletic director once a replacement is hired. It would be rather unusual for a lame-duck athletic director to make a coaching change by removing a guy he'd hired.\n\nSenior quarterback Kyle Shurmur offered his support for Mason, who is seeking a third consecutive victory over Tennessee. The Commodores haven't beaten Tennessee three straight times since the 1920s.\n\n\"Coach Mason has been consistent since day one with his message, and I think we've all grown,\" Shurmur said. \"He's a great coach, and I think he's going to be here a long time.\"\n\nAny questions about Missouri coach Barry Odom's future likely were answered when the Tigers won their last three games to improve from 4-4 to 7-4. Odom has an 18-18 mark in three seasons.\n\nSouth Carolina (6-4, 4-4) is having a somewhat disappointing season, but Will Muschamp is 21-15 and headed to a third straight bowl appearance with a program that went 3-9 the year before his arrival. South Carolina gave Muschamp a new six-year, $28.2 million contract after the Gamecocks went 9-4 last season.\n\nBecause most SEC positions are viewed as destination jobs, most coaching changes in this league come when someone gets fired rather than somebody leaving for a better opportunity.\n\nThat said, Kentucky's emergence this season could cause other Power Five athletic directors to check on the potential availability of Mark Stoops, who owns a 34-39 record in six seasons. A victory over Louisville on Saturday would give Kentucky (8-3, 5-3) its highest regular-season win total since a 10-1 finish in 1977.\n\nThe Wildcats' seventh win this season added another year to the contract extension Stoops signed in March 2017 and makes it now run through June 2024. If Kentucky beats Louisville and also wins its bowl game to finish 10-3, Stoops would get a second year added to his contract extension.\n\n\"Mark has done great work steadily building this program as he set out to do when he became our coach six years ago,\" Kentucky athletic director Mitch Barnhart said via email. \"Over that time, Kentucky has become home for him and his family and he has forged a great connection with our fans and our state. Considering our conference, our facilities and our fan base, UK is a great place to be and we are excited about what the future holds here.\"\n\nAlthough Kentucky's persistence with Stoops through his early struggles paid off this season, Nutt doesn't expect that to cause other SEC teams to become more patient with coaches.\n\nNutt instead believes the likely lack of coaching changes this year virtually assures plenty of moves next season.\n\n\"That's just the way the league is,\" Nutt said. \"It's so competitive, so hard. Everybody wants to win - and to win yesterday - and everybody can't win. So it's just a very, very tough deal.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Gary Graves, Teresa Walker and John Zenor contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nToys have long served as a staple of the holiday gift-giving tradition for children. But you might want to avoid putting certain toys on your shopping list this year.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group's annual \"Trouble in Toyland\" report, 15 of 40 inspected toys could be potential safety hazards for children.\n\nSlime products are prominently featured in the report, making up six of the 15 identified dangerous toys. The report states the products have \"dangerously high boron content\" that can be hazardous if ingested.\n\nThe six products are: Kangaroos Original Super Cool Slime, Kidsco Glow in The Dark Slime, Toysmith Jupiter Juice Slime, iBaseToy Fluffy Slime, Haniex Soft Magic Crystal Slime and Meland Fluffy Slime.\n\nAnother concern flagged by the report is toys that could share private information.\n\nFor example, Dash, Dash, a robot toy sold by Wonder Workshop, connects to Bluetooth, has a microphone and allows kids to interact with it. But the toy also shares information with third parties, according to the report's citing of a separate finding from the Mozilla Foundation.\n\nThe report found the Amazon Fire HD Kids Edition has similar issues: \"The device can share a child\u2019s private information with third parties for advertising purposes, and the tablet does not delete the data it stores on you.\"\n\nThe report also noted products with small parts \u2013 such as Hatchimals and L.O.L. Surprise Toys \u2013 and balloons as choking hazards that did not have proper labelling. With the latter, PIRG found that 87 percent of the latex balloons the group surveyed on Amazon\u2019s website lacked the legally required warning that a toy could be a choking hazard for children under the age of 8.\n\nProducing its \"Trouble in Toyland\" report for more than 30 years, the group says its inspections have \"led to more than 150 toy recalls and other regulatory actions.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY intern Ben Tobin on Twitter: @TobinBen\n\nCLOSE The Monday after Thanksgiving also known as Cyber Monday is a day when consumers can ditch the crowded parking lots and long lines and still get the best shopping deals online.

A Buckeyes victory could be a boon to Oklahoma and Washington State, if the Sooners and Cougars can avoid being upset this weekend.\n\nAlso, is there any path for UCF now that it has cracked the top 10?

(Photo: Goose Island Beer Co.)\n\nWhile many will flock to malls and department stores after Thanksgiving to get a head start on their holiday shopping lists, a legion of beer lovers will line up to secure their own liquid treasure: Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout beers.\n\nThe Chicago brewery, acquired by Anheuser-Busch in 2011, began making its stout aged in bourbon barrels in 1995. Since 2010, Goose Island has made its release of the original Bourbon County Brand Stout and additional flavor variants into a nationwide Black Friday morning event.\n\nUnder Anheuser-Busch, Goose Island has added production and storage capacity to make more of the much sought-after stouts, which are usually premium-priced at $10 and up. And this year, Goose Island has more flavors \u2013 eight total \u2013 available than in any previous year.\n\nHowever, few beer retailers will get the complete lineup and usually shoppers are limited to how many bottles they can purchase. Notably, the Proprietor's Bourbon County Brand Stout, made with dark chocolate and cocoa nibs, will be sold only in Chicago.\n\nShould you have to make a decision on which beer to snatch up, some beer journalists got preview tastes of the beer line-up.\n\nThe Reserve Bourbon County Stout (15.2 percent ABV), which is aged in \"Elijah Craig Barrel Proof\u201d bourbon barrels and may be the hardest to find, \"boasts more oak, cherry liqueur, and whiskey flavor than the original Bourbon County stout, with complex bourbon notes as well,\" wrote Vinepair's Cat Wolinski.\n\nAmong the new offerings, Bourbon County Midnight Orange Stout, made with Spanish Orange zest, is \"loaded with flavor,\" wrote Josh Noel, a beer writer at the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Barrel-Aged Stout and Selling Out: Goose Island, Anheuser-Busch, and How Craft Beer Became Big Business.\" The beer, he said, \"boasts a relatively understated nature that I enjoyed.\"\n\nBlack Friday means the annual release of Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout beers. This year, there's a new flavor: Bourbon County Midnight Orange Stout. (Photo: Goose Island Beer Co.)\n\nAnother of the new flavors, Bourbon County Wheatwine Ale, isn't even a stout. \"Oozing with caramel and butterscotch notes, it\u2019s boozy, but finishes clean,\" wrote Chris Morris in Fortune. \"This was a gamble that paid off for the brewer.\"\n\nThe original Bourbon County Brand Stout, aged mainly in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels, \"lacks the viscosity of a few years ago, but it\u2019s still full of chocolate, leather and vanilla flavors,\" he says. \"As always, it\u2019s a prime candidate to age as well.\"\n\nIn addition to retail sales, the Goose Island stouts will be available at tasting events at many bars and restaurants: Check Goose Island's website for a schedule.\n\nThis was the scene last Black Friday. We\u2019ll be tapping that big, beautiful stout again this Friday @ 9am.

Ranked 15th at the start of the season, USC (5-6) now must upset Notre Dame on Saturday just to become bowl eligible and avoid its first seven-loss regular season since 2000. (AP Photo/Alex Gallardo, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nRivalry week should help sort out the College Football Playoff picture while finalizing the conference championship game matchups.\n\nNo. 3 Notre Dame (No. 3 CFP ) can pretty much wrap up one of the four playoff spots Saturday by winning at Southern California. No. 4 Michigan (No. 4 CFP) seeks to remain in playoff position Saturday when it visits No. 10 Ohio State (No. 10 CFP), with the winner facing No. 20 Northwestern (No. 19 CFP) next week in the Big Ten championship game.\n\nNo. 7 Washington State (No. 8) also still harbors playoff hopes as it prepares to host No. 16 Washington (No. 16 CFP) on Friday, with the winner facing No. 18 Utah (No. 17 CFP) in the Pac-12 championship game.\n\nThe Oklahoma-West Virginia and Texas-Kansas games on Friday will determine the representatives in the Big 12 championship game. If No. 11 Texas (No. 14 CFP) beats Kansas, the Longhorns will face the Oklahoma-West Virginia winner for the Big 12 title. If Kansas upsets Texas, No. 6 Oklahoma (No. 6 CFP) and No. 12 West Virginia (No. 13) would meet for a second straight week in the Big 12 championship game.\n\nHere are some other things to know heading into the final weekend of college football's regular season.\n\nBEST GAME\n\nMichigan at Ohio State\n\nMichigan has lost to Ohio State each of the last six seasons but heads into this year's game as a four-point favorite.\n\nOhio State (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten) has looked more vulnerable than its record suggests, as the Buckeyes got trounced 49-20 by Purdue last month and eked out a 52-51 overtime victory over Maryland last week. Michigan (10-1, 8-0) has won 10 straight since a season-opening 24-17 loss at Notre Dame.\n\nMichigan leads all Football Bowl Subdivision teams in total defense, while Ohio State ranks second in total offense.\n\nHEISMAN WATCH\n\nGardner Minshew, Washington State\n\nMinshew nearly decided to spend this season at Alabama, where he almost certainly would have backed up Tua Tagovailoa the entire year. The East Carolina graduate transfer instead chose Washington State and has emerged as one of Tagovailoa's top competitors for the Heisman Trophy.\n\nAfter throwing for seven touchdowns last week in a 69-28 blowout of Arizona, Minshew leads all FBS players in yards passing (4,325) and is tied for the lead in touchdown passes (36). Tagovailoa ranks first in passing efficiency.\n\nMinshew faces perhaps his toughest test of the season this week as Washington State hosts Washington, which leads the Pac-12 in scoring defense and ranks second in the league in total defense.\n\nHeisman Trophy voters also should keep an eye on the quarterback matchup in the Oklahoma-West Virginia game with Kyler Murray leading the Sooners and Will Grier taking snaps for the Mountaineers.\n\nNUMBERS TO KNOW\n\n3 \u2014 Vanderbilt is seeking to beat Tennessee for a third straight season, something that hasn't happened since the Commodores won six straight over Tennessee from 1920-26. Vanderbilt is 4-2 against Tennessee over the last six seasons after going 1-28 in this series from 1983-2011.\n\n5 \u2014 The number of touchdown runs No. 1 Alabama (No. 1 CFP) has allowed all season, the lowest total given up by any FBS team. Alabama's opponent Saturday is Auburn, which has yielded only six touchdown runs this year.\n\n19 \u2014 Oklahoma has won an FBS-leading 19 straight true road games heading into its game Friday at West Virginia. The Sooners' last loss in a true road game was a 37-33 decision at TCU on Oct. 4, 2014.\n\n22 \u2014 Fresno State hasn't allowed any of its last 22 opponents to reach the 30-point mark. That's the longest such streak of any FBS team.\n\n36 \u2014 Florida State has played in a bowl game each of the last 36 seasons, an NCAA record streak. The Seminoles can become eligible for a 37th straight bowl berth with a victory Saturday over No. 13 Florida (No. 11). Florida State has beaten Florida five straight times, its longest winning streak in this rivalry's history.\n\n302-49 \u2014 No. 2 Clemson (No. 2 CFP) has beaten its last six opponents by that combined margin after rallying for a 27-23 victory over Syracuse on Sept. 29.\n\nUNDER THE RADAR\n\nHouston at Memphis\n\nThis Friday matchup will determine which of these West Division teams will get to face No. 8 Central Florida (No. 9 CFP) in the American Athletic Conference championship game.\n\nEach of the last four Houston-Memphis games has been decided by four points or fewer.\n\nHouston will be playing this game without star quarterback D'Eriq King, who tore the meniscus in his right knee last week in a 48-17 victory over Tulane. Houston defensive tackle and 2017 Outland Trophy winner Ed Oliver has missed four straight games with a knee injury, but his status for Friday's contest is uncertain.\n\nMemphis' Darrell Henderson has rushed for 1,521 yards to rank second among all FBS players, behind only Wisconsin's Jonathan Taylor (1,869).\n\nHOT SEAT WATCH\n\nClay Helton, Southern California\n\nWith angry USC fans chanting for Helton's firing, the Trojans fell 34-27 to UCLA last week for their fourth loss in five games.\n\nRanked 15th at the start of the season, USC (5-6) now must upset Notre Dame on Saturday just to become bowl eligible and avoid its first seven-loss regular season since 2000.\n\nHelton owns a 32-16 record at USC and led the Trojans to a Rose Bowl title two seasons ago. His contract was extended through the 2023 season earlier this year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Hospital and police officials say the death toll could have been much worse if not for the quick response.\n\nMercy held its first ever active shooter drill just weeks before the shooting, and added classroom training and Internet instruction for workers on how to respond if a gunman opened fire at the medical center.\n\n\u201cWith assistance from the Chicago Police Department, our emergency management team will debrief on what happened to see what lessons are to be learned from this,\u201d said Michael Davenport, Mercy\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cWe anticipate there are lessons to be learned...\n\n\"We know life will never be the same for us here at Mercy and things will change.\u201d\n\nMore: Some docs rip NRA, say #ThisIsOurLane after Chicago Mercy Hospital shooting rampage\n\nMore: Chicago hospital shooting gunman was kicked out of fire academy for bullying\n\nMore: Police officer among 4 dead in 'horrific' Chicago hospital shooting\n\nMore: Chicago Mercy Hospital shooting: Two Purdue University graduates slain in attack praised for serving others\n\nConcerns about violence among health care providers, particularly those who work in emergency rooms, has been growing for years.\n\nForty-seven percent of emergency physicians say they have been physically assaulted while at work, and 60 percent of that group say those assaults occurred in the past year, according to an American College of Emergency Physicians survey of 3,500 emergency room physicians published last month.\n\nNearly 7 in 10 say violence has increased in the past 5 years; 25 percent report it is increasing greatly. Forty-nine percent say hospitals can do more by adding security guards, cameras, security for parking lots, metal detectors, and increasing visitor screening inside hospitals, especially in emergency departments.\n\n\u201cMore needs to be done,\" says Vidor Friedman, president of the organization. \"Violence in emergency departments is not only affecting medical staff, it is affecting patients.\"\n\nAbout half of hospitals now have handheld metal detectors that can be used to help spot visitors carrying weapons, the American Society for Health Care Engineering reported in its 2018 Hospital Security Survey. That\u2019s up from 33 percent in 2016.\n\nFifty-six percent of the hospitals said they were spending more to upgrade security systems or increase security staffing. And 96 percent of hospitals now have an active shooter policy on the books.\n\nGabor Kelen, director of emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, set out with colleagues to study hospital shootings following a 2010 incident at the medical center in Baltimore.\n\nPaul Warren Pardus, 50, shot a physician, Dr. David Cohen, in the abdomen. Cohen had delivered bad news about Pardus\u2019 mother, a patient who was undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nCohen survived. Pardus killed his mother before killing himself.\n\nThe sprawling Hopkins medical center, one the world\u2019s renown hospitals, went into lockdown for about four hours.\n\nWhen Kelen and colleagues reviewed more than a decade of hospital shootings, they found that the events were rare and unpredictable, and that forming effective deterrence practices is complicated.\n\nShooters in the 154 hospital shootings between 2000 and 2011 were most often driven by grudges, a desire to commit suicide or kill an ailing relative, or to escape from custody.\n\nForty-one percent of shootings on hospital grounds began or took place entirely outside the hospital building, according to a 2012 Annals of Emergency Medicine paper that Kelen co-authored.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no security that can deal with that,\u201d Kelen told USA TODAY. \u201cIt\u2019s so unexpected. You can\u2019t put a security detail at every entrance at every hospital to be on the lookout for an individual storming in there.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/21/chicago-mercy-hospital-shooting-security-juan-lopez-tamara-oneal/2077530002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 19 Syracuse visits longtime foe Boston College", "description": "No. 19 Syracuse visits longtime foe Boston College in season finale; Orange seeking ninth win", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/21/no-19-syracuse-visits-longtime-foe-boston-college/38580241/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:58:15Z", "content": "No. 19 Syracuse (8-3, 5-2 ACC, No. 20 CFP) at Boston College (7-4, 4-3), noon EST (ESPN) Line: Boston College by 7.

Chinander and Frost have been together all but one year since they first worked together assistants at Northern Iowa a decade ago.\n\nWhile Nebraska's spread-option offense has thrived with freshman quarterback Adrian Martinez, the defense has ranked near the bottom of the Big Ten in most statistics. The defense played its best game last Saturday when it held Michigan State under 300 yards in a 9-6 win, and Chinander said his charges will need to be at least as good against the Hawkeyes (7-4, 4-4).\n\n\"Obviously, it'll be good to go back to that stadium,\" Chinander said. \"I got a lot of friends and family coming and wearing red to the game, so that'll be good. But this is an important game for our team. It's really important to finish strong and really important for the defense to play well this game and get some momentum going into the spring and recruiting.\"\n\nChinander has shared stories with linebacker Luke Gifford about his Iowa days, and Gifford said he senses this game is special to him.\n\n\"I know for us, as a defense, we want to go out there and play as well as we can, especially for him it would mean a lot,\" Gifford said.\n\nChinander is the son of longtime high school coach Gene Chinander, and Erik was a small-school all-state player at Allison-Bristow. He walked on at Iowa and made it onto the field for a handful of games as a backup offensive lineman. He lettered as a senior in 2002, when he also earned the Offensive Team Leader Award.\n\n\"I knew very early that I was much better at helping the other guys get lined up and do what they're supposed to do than actually doing it,\" Chinander said.\n\nChinander knew he wanted to go into coaching after finishing his degrees in history and health, leisure and sports studies. He spoke with coach Kirk Ferentz and other Iowa staff members about becoming a graduate assistant.\n\n\"Those guys all said we'd love to have you when there's an opening, but you probably need to get out and spread your wings and see some other stuff and we'll help you as much as we can,\" Chinander said. \"And they helped me get some opportunities down the road that I got. The advice they gave me to spread my wings has been really good, and we haven't turned back and I'm glad where I'm at.\"\n\nChinander was an assistant at Ellsworth (Iowa) Community College in 2003 and coached the tight ends at Northern Iowa from 2004-09. Frost was on the UNI staff in 2007-08 before heading to Oregon.\n\nChinander was an Oregon intern in 2010 and graduate assistant in 2011-12 and left for a year to work with the Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line. He was back at Oregon as an assistant in 2014 and has been with Frost since.\n\nNaturally, the two liked to reminisce about their college days \u2014 Frost at Nebraska and Chinander at Iowa.\n\n\"Now he's finally on the good side,\" Frost said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThanksgiving is the perfect time to reflect on the year, spend time with loved ones, watch some football, and, of course, The Match between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\n\nAt 3 p.m. ET on Friday at Las Vegas' beautiful and exclusive Shadow Creek, two of the greatest golfers not only of this generation but of all time will square off mano-a-mano in a match-play event for a $9 million prize. Many people, from USA TODAY Sports columnist Christine Brennan to four-time major champion Rory McIlroy, have said they don\u2019t plan to watch The Match.\n\nFor the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out why. This is something we have never seen before and might not see ever again.\n\nThe everyday sports fan will argue it\u2019s $19.99 to watch golf on pay-per-view. They\u2019ll say if an event like this were to happen, it should\u2019ve been 10 years ago, when Woods and Mickelson weren\u2019t well beyond their prime.\n\nSure, $19.99 may be a bit pricey for an event that could end in an hour if Tiger or Lefty dominate (or fall apart). But an event like this has never, and will never, take place again. Picture LeBron James and Kobe Bryant playing one-on-one.\n\nThat\u2019s The Match.\n\nBoth players won a PGA Tour event last season. Mickelson won the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship, an event where only the world's best qualify, and Woods won the Tour Championship, the final event of the Tour season featuring the year\u2019s top 30 players.\n\nWoods had seven top-10 finishes and 12 in the top 25. Mickelson had six and 15, respectively.\n\nNot bad for past their prime.\n\nThe competition itself aside, how about the side bets?\n\nSponsors put up the $9 million prize, but Woods and Mickelson will pony up some of their own money on side bets throughout the competition, with all the money going to charity. On Tuesday, Mickelson baited Woods into a $200,000 bet that he will birdie the opening hole. Expect plenty more just like that.\n\nOther expected bets will be long drive and closest-to-the-pin contests, with both players also likely proposing money challenges on putts and up-and-downs. The bets will likely be in the range of $10,000 to $50,000 per wager.\n\nAs if this match needed any more added pressure.\n\nAnd last but not least, let\u2019s talk about how incredible the broadcast will be.\n\nBoth players and their caddies will be wearing microphones. Drone coverage will deliver \u201ccamera angles that have never been seen before for a live golf event,\u201d according to a Turner Sports press release. Real-time, hole-by-hole statistics on the screen will display the probability of different outcomes.\n\nA one-hour pregame show will feature Charles Barkley, Samuel L. Jackson and PGA Tour player Pat Perez. Ernie Johnson will serve as the play-by-play announcer alongside former players Peter Jacobsen and Darren Clarke.\n\nBarkley and Jackson are pure entertainment on their own. Perez is known on Tour for speaking his mind \u2014 especially about Tiger.\n\nSo while you\u2019re sitting around on Friday afternoon, resting up after Thursday\u2019s feast of food and football, tune in to The Match.\n\nYou won't see anything like it again.\n\nFollow Adam Woodard on Twitter @AdamWoodard."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Nielsen: Criminals and gang members in caravan", "description": "Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited a San Diego beach on Tuesday, examining up close the newly installed razor wire on the US-Mexico border fence.

That in mind, the fans can now turn their attention to the offseason in efforts to figure out what needs to be done to get the Jags back to being the Super Bowl contenders they were.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the Jags will need to invest a lot into their offense in 2019, and that process will begin in free agency. However, with the team projected to be over the cap, it appears they may not be able to be active like they\u2019ve been in the past.\n\nThat then puts the Jags in a predicament where they\u2019ll have to predominately sure up the offense in the draft, and that\u2019s exactly what our comrade Luke Easterling has them doing in his latest Draft Wire mock. In it, the Jags were able to land two much-needed additions to the offense in West Virginia quarterback Will Grier and Kansas State tackle Dalton Risner.\n\n6. Jacksonville Jaguars | Will Grier | QB | West Virginia Much like the Giants, the Jags need to move on from their current starting quarterback by replacing him with a top pick in this draft. Blake Bortles can\u2019t be trusted to take advantage of one of the league\u2019s best defenses, and though he\u2019s not the only problem on offense, he\u2019s the one that has the biggest impact. Grier is as worthy of a top-10 pick as any passer in this year\u2019s class. 38. Jacksonville Jaguars | Dalton Risner | OL | Kansas State\n\nGrier is a name climbing the ranks as a Heisman candidate due to the season he\u2019s put together at West Virginia this year. He\u2019s also someone who Jaguars fans are familiar with and are high on because he formerly played with the nearby Florida Gators. However, his tenure there was cut short after he was suspended for using a banned substance and he eventually transferred. Needless to say, this will be the biggest question and concern for him entering the draft.\n\nAs for his play on the field, the word I\u2019ve often heard associated with him is \u201csmooth\u201d and from the games I\u2019ve seen him play in that appears to be true. While there are some mechanical inconsistencies at times, his release is quick and he has the necessary arm strength to flourish in the NFL. He also puts his receivers in good position and has made some solid placement throws throughout the season.\n\nAdmittedly, I still need to watch more film on him, but he made a throw against Texas that caught the eyes of many and left fans intrigued.\n\nVIDEO: West Virginia in the clutch! \ud83d\ude4c Will Grier hits Gary Jennings for the late TD. \ud83d\udea8 https://t.co/onxRNM7pXx pic.twitter.com/tTUxZ2VXcn \u2014 theScore (@theScore) November 3, 2018\n\nAs for Risner, he\u2019s a player the Jags could desperately use for their struggling offense, too. At 6-foot-5, 308 pounds, he\u2019s a force at the tackle position that can both stonewall defenders on the edge and maul them in the run game. Traits like that would greatly benefit whoever the Jags\u2019 signal-caller is next year, whether that\u2019s Blake Bortles, a free agent addition or a rookie like Grier."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Redskins-Cowboys Preview Capsule", "description": "Redskins-Cowboys Preview Capsule", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/redskins-cowboys-preview-capsule/38580035/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:35:30Z", "content": "WASHINGTON (6-4) at DALLAS (5-5) Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET, Fox OPENING LINE Cowboys by 9 RECORD VS.

For whatever reason, the two personalities clashed and the end result was not pretty. Constant arguing in the locker room ensued and it was enough to throw the team off course, according to former Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of anything like that,\u201d Revis said on WFAN Tuesday. \u201cIt was devastating. I kind of knew in a sense that it was going to be a very long season.\u201d\n\nAs the season progressed, the Jets tried to fight through the locker room drama, but the damage had been done. With two cornerstone players going at it, the dynamic in the locker room had become too toxic for a veteran New York team to overcome.\n\n\u201cThat kind of just broke us, that just broke our backbone as a team,\u201d Revis said. \u201cWe tried to recover and it was an ongoing situation throughout the year, it never died down. We couldn\u2019t bounce back from it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the beef between Marshall and Richardson led to an environment that no player wanted any part of. Throughout New York\u2019s disappointing 5-11 2016 campaign, the Jets seemed lethargic on the field; it was as if they wanted to be anywhere else but playing the game.\n\nOne year after missing out on the playoffs, it had all fallen apart at 1 Jets Drive. Revis was part of the problem in 2016 with his awful play, but the constant fighting in the locker room didn\u2019t do the team any favors.\n\nYou can hear Revis\u2019 full interview below:"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY", "title": "PS4, Xbox One or Nintendo Switch: Which console should you buy?", "description": "PlayStation, Xbox or Switch: Which should you buy?", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/21/playstation-4-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-which-one-should-you-buy/2071010002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/bcc70ec2-ad7e-42f0-9b92-e1fe9c452da7/bcc70ec2-ad7e-42f0-9b92-e1fe9c452da7_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:31:09Z", "content": "One of the biggest staples of holiday sales aren't just the fancy new 4K TVs, it's what you can play on them.

While not as powerful as their One X or PS 4 Pro siblings, both systems can play all the latest games and can even tap into newer TV features such as HDR.\n\nBoth consoles play largely the same games, including recent hits such as \"Red Dead Redemption 2,\" \"Madden 19,\" \"NBA 2K19\" and \"Call of Duty Black Ops 4,\" but some exclusives such as \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" or \"God of War\" are only for PlayStation and franchises such as \"Gears of War\" and \"Halo\" are solely for Xbox.\n\nMore: Six helpful hints for your 'Red Dead Redemption 2' adventure\n\nMore: The best Black Friday Xbox deals of 2018\n\nMore: The best Black Friday PS4 deals of 2018\n\nYou can't really go wrong with either system, but if you are buying as a gift make sure to check with your gamer to find out where their friends play (and remember to pick up a subscription to Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, the respective service needed to play others online).\n\nWith the exception of \"Fortnite,\" playing with friends on a different system is largely nonexistent right now.\n\nIf you have any gamers on your holiday shopping list, Walmart's got savings on consoles and games they'll love. (Photo: Microsoft)\n\nThe most recent PlayStation 4 is largely a cosmetic update to the original PS4 that was released in 2013. So if you already have a PS4 and are happy with it, this model isn't much of an upgrade. Both can play games in HDR.\n\nMore: Buying a new 4K HDR TV this holiday season? Read this first\n\nOriginal Xbox One owners who find that system to be slow will, however, appreciate the One S, which isn't just sleeker but faster and more powerful than the first One and can play games in HDR and Blu-rays and Netflix in 4K.\n\nAs for which bundle \u2013 and there are plenty \u2013 to consider, look to see what each retailer offers. Games such as \"Minecraft,\" 'NBA 2K19\" or \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" are among the current popular titles being bundled, with some retailers also throwing in extra controllers and other perks.\n\nBest for portable gamers: Nintendo Switch\n\nNintendo Switch (Photo: Nintendo)\n\nWhile Nintendo's Switch lacks the graphical power of the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 and big releases such as \"Madden,\" \"Call of Duty\" and \"Red Dead Redemption 2,\" it does have a few perks of its own. The biggest: Portability.\n\nGamers play 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate' on the Nintendo Switch. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT)\n\nWith a built-in touch screen, the Switch can be used on its own or on a big TV when placed in its included docking station. The Joy-Con controllers can even be split up to let two players play a game such as \"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,\" \"Super Mario Party\" and the upcoming \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" right out of the box.\n\nOn certain games, such as \"Smash,\" up to eight players can play off of one Switch, assuming you have enough controllers to pass around.\n\nMore: First look: 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate' brings the classic fight to the Switch\n\nWhile Nintendo still sells its 3DS and 2DS portable systems, the latest lineup of new games \u2013 and the fact that the Switch can play \"Fortnite\" \u2013 make it a better option for many.\n\nFor the more intense gamers: Xbox One X or PlayStation 4 Pro\n\nThe best Black Friday Xbox deals of 2018 (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nIf you just bought a fancy new 4K HDR TV and want to make the most of it, the Xbox One X or PlayStation 4 Pro are the options for you.\n\nMore: Buying a new 4K HDR TV this holiday season? Read this first\n\nWith improved graphical prowess and performance, both systems make games shine, particularly on 4K HDR TVs, which deliver improved resolution and colors over standard high-definition. Most of the more popular games released in 2018, including \"Red Dead 2,\" \"Spider-Man,\" and the latest versions of \"Call of Duty,\" \"Madden\" and \"NBA 2K,\" are optimized for 4K and HDR to make the most of what these systems offer.\n\n(Photo: Sony.)\n\nThe Xbox One X is a bit more powerful, and at the moment is the same price as the PS4 Pro at $399. But again, it comes down to which games you want and what systems your friends use. As with their siblings, both are excellent consoles, and you won't be disappointed with either.\n\nBe aware of 2019\n\nMicrosoft's first-party Xbox controller is still one of the best (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nAs with other products such as AirPods, this year's game purchases have a cloud of uncertainty over them as major upgrades are rumored to be right around the corner.\n\nWhile the Nintendo Switch launched only last year, rumors suggest Nintendo is readying an updated model possibly for next summer.\n\nBoth Sony and Microsoft have made clear that their next generation systems are in the works, with Sony most recently getting the internet talking that its decision to sit out the E3 video game conference next year is, in part, because it is working on the PlayStation 5. Rumors also are circulating that Sony might reveal the PS5 next year at its own event before releasing the new console in 2020.\n\nAt this year's E3, Microsoft's Xbox head Phil Spencer said the company's hardware team was already working on the \"next Xbox consoles.\" Microsoft insider Brad Sams of Thurrott.com says the next-gen Xbox console is also expected in 2020.\n\nBoth consoles were released in November 2013, making each prime for an upgrade.\n\nWhat does this mean for now? Not much in the short term as all current systems will continue to play great, with new games expected to come out for them over the next few years. But it is worth keeping mind what might be on the horizon, and when that horizon might arrive, as you prepare to shop this holiday season.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/21/playstation-4-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-which-one-should-you-buy/2071010002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Scientists found termite mounds so big, you can see them via satellite", "description": "These ancient termite mounds were found in a remote Brazilian forest.

(Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nRivalry week is here which means intense games with College Football Playoff implications or bragging rights at stake.\n\nIn some cases, both are true.\n\nThe best illustration this week is when No. 4 Michigan paying a visit to No. 10 Ohio State. The Wolverines are hoping move closer to their first playoff appearance, while also winning in Columbus for the first time since 2000. But their archenemy stands in their way.\n\nThe Buckeyes, though, have not been playing well in the second half of the season, including last week's narrow win against Maryland. Their fortunes can change in 60 minutes, though, as a win would deny Michigan its first appearance in the Big Ten title game and give them the opportunity to play Northwestern with their playoff hopes still alive.\n\nThe three remaining Power Five unbeatens also have rivalry hurdles to contend with. No. 1 Alabama hosts Auburn. No. 2 Clemson gets a visit from South Carolina. And No. 3 Notre Dame travels to Southern California. All three look like manageable games. However, sometimes these showdowns don't go as expected.\n\nElsewhere, No. 6 Oklahoma and No. 12 West Virginia meet in Morgantown with a berth in the Big 12 championship game on the line. The Sooners still have playoff hopes, while the Mountaineers hope to bounce back from last week's loss to Oklahoma State that knocked them out of contention.\n\nThe Apple Cup has added significance this year as No. 7 Washington State has its sights set on more than just the Pac-12 title. The Cougars can stay in the playoff hunt, but have to reverse their run of disappointments against No. 16 Washington. The Huskies have won the last five meetings in dominant fashion and have the motivation of both denying their rivals their first trip to the conference title game, but also advancing themselves.\n\nThe last matchup of ranked opponents sees No. 15 Utah State and No. 22 Boise State square off for the Mountain division title in the Mountain West.

You were hired to be yourself, so do you think you did that well?\n\nMy booth mates say I\u2019ve come in with some good energy and revitalized them a little bit, and I\u2019m happy hearing those comments and that\u2019s what I wanted to do. I wanted to come in with a real fan type of happiness and joy for what I\u2019m watching, and I feel like I\u2019ve been able to do that. That\u2019s gonna be something that\u2019s important for me to maintain for however many more years I do this. That\u2019s probably the most important attribute I have \u2014 that fandom, that passion for it. So as long as I got that, I think I\u2019ll be in good shape.\n\nBut the nerves have come down, which has allowed me to be a bit more of myself. I\u2019m nowhere near nervous as I used to be.\n\nDid you have an advantage starting in the booth for the second half of the season, as opposed to working with FOX Sports and broadcasting the first half?\n\nMan, I don\u2019t know. Starting with Daytona would have been pretty awesome. I had a chance to go into the FOX booth and work The Clash in 2017, and Speedweeks to me is a really special time of year. So being able to call the Daytona 500 would be a real dream of mine. I think it would be for any of us in the booth \u2014 Rick, Burton and Steve.\n\nI would have been much more nervous than I was going into Chicago, so it\u2019s kind of fun hopping in the middle of the season. And we had an incredible race, which made it a lot easier on me. So I\u2019m glad we get to call the final event, I\u2019m glad we call the playoffs. It really emphasizes the responsibility you have as a broadcaster to build up those storylines and carry the fans all the way to the finish, talking about what\u2019s happening and who\u2019s doing what. You\u2019re invested in it because you know you\u2019ll be there for the final race.\n\nNothing quite like @NASCAR racing.

Less than 33 laps remaining on NBC. #NASCARPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/Fgfwrdy6Zf \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) November 18, 2018\n\nWhat\u2019s been the best part of your first season broadcasting?\n\nThe best part of broadcasting is when we are talking about a battle on the race track. For example, if you go back and watch the Roval (race from September at Charlotte Motor Speedway), there was a moment where Brad Keselowski and Kyle Larson had a battle for a couple laps, and me and Jeff Burton were just talking through the laps with what we were seeing.\n\nAnd those moments when it\u2019s me and someone else in the booth discussing the battle on the track between two competitors and talking about the lines they\u2019re choosing and why they do this and that, and what I expect them to do in the next corner and you get it right \u2014 those are the funnest times. That\u2019s when the adrenaline\u2019s really going, and you\u2019re a fan at that point.\n\nAnd the most challenging part?\n\nThe most challenging part is the front of the show, the produced part. There\u2019s 10 minutes when we\u2019re going through ceremonies and on camera. It\u2019s scripted, and it\u2019s prepared, and that\u2019s when you\u2019re trying to remember your points. And you think about it too much. Instead of just being yourself and reacting to someone else\u2019s comments, you\u2019re preparing what you\u2019re going to say.\n\nAnd it never comes off the way it sounds in your head. It never sounds as good as you hope, but it\u2019s never as bad as it sounds either. That\u2019s one of the funny things I found out about broadcasting.\n\nFor some drivers, tonight might be their last chance to earn their spot in the #NASCARPlayoffs. DAYTONA. NBC.

We have a talk-back button to the producer. So I\u2019ve had to get very comfortable and almost aggressive to hit that button and tell the producer, \u201cI have a point here I\u2019d like to mention. I\u2019d like to come in at the back end of whoever\u2019s talking to add to the point.\u201d\n\nSo when I first got in there, I thought we just talked. But no, I\u2019ve got to tell my producer, \u201cHey, I could add to this,\u201d and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing all day long, because if they don\u2019t know that, they won\u2019t make room for you. They told me when I came in, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get real friendly with this talk-back button. Don\u2019t be afraid to use it.\u201d I didn\u2019t really know what they meant until later on in the game.\n\nWhere would you like to see yourself improve next season and beyond?\n\nIt\u2019s almost like when the green flag drops, you forget you\u2019re on TV. You do, and you\u2019re not nervous. You\u2019re just talking to your buddies about the race. You\u2019re just talking to Jeff about what\u2019s happening. But in the opening when we\u2019re on camera, you can\u2019t shake the feeling that everybody\u2019s watching and you\u2019re on camera and it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that we have a chance to take us to commercial or bring us in from commercial. Rick, obviously, that\u2019s his role. Sometimes the producer will say, \u201cAll right, Jeff, you\u2019re going to take us to commercial.\u201d I don\u2019t get those opportunities because I\u2019m not very efficient at it, but I would love to be able to get comfortable doing those type of things. I told NBC when I got hired, \u201cMan, I really wanna be the kind of guy you could put in any position in that booth and you\u2019d feel comfortable and confident in me.\u201d\n\nI really wanna learn every part of it to where I can be that guy. Like if Rick were to fall ill, and they\u2019re like, \u201cWho\u2019s gonna be the guy?\u201d I wanna be that guy. It\u2019s not gonna happen today or tomorrow, next year or the year after that. But maybe four, five, six years down the road, I would have enough experience and they would have enough confidence in me that I could fill that role if needed.

I wanted to come in with a real fan type of happiness and joy for what I\u2019m watching, and I feel like I\u2019ve been able to do that. That\u2019s gonna be something that\u2019s important for me to maintain for however many more years I do this. That\u2019s probably the most important attribute I have \u2014 that fandom, that passion for it. So as long as I got that, I think I\u2019ll be in good shape.\n\nBut the nerves have come down, which has allowed me to be a bit more of myself. I\u2019m nowhere near nervous as I used to be.\n\nDid you have an advantage starting in the booth for the second half of the season, as opposed to working with FOX Sports and broadcasting the first half?\n\nMan, I don\u2019t know. Starting with Daytona would have been pretty awesome. I had a chance to go into the FOX booth and work The Clash in 2017, and Speedweeks to me is a really special time of year. So being able to call the Daytona 500 would be a real dream of mine. I think it would be for any of us in the booth \u2014 Rick, Burton and Steve.\n\nI would have been much more nervous than I was going into Chicago, so it\u2019s kind of fun hopping in the middle of the season. And we had an incredible race, which made it a lot easier on me. So I\u2019m glad we get to call the final event, I\u2019m glad we call the playoffs.

That\u2019s one of the funny things I found out about broadcasting.\n\nFor some drivers, tonight might be their last chance to earn their spot in the #NASCARPlayoffs. DAYTONA. NBC.

We have a talk-back button to the producer. So I\u2019ve had to get very comfortable and almost aggressive to hit that button and tell the producer, \u201cI have a point here I\u2019d like to mention. I\u2019d like to come in at the back end of whoever\u2019s talking to add to the point.\u201d\n\nSo when I first got in there, I thought we just talked. But no, I\u2019ve got to tell my producer, \u201cHey, I could add to this,\u201d and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing all day long, because if they don\u2019t know that, they won\u2019t make room for you. They told me when I came in, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get real friendly with this talk-back button. Don\u2019t be afraid to use it.\u201d I didn\u2019t really know what they meant until later on in the game.\n\nWhere would you like to see yourself improve next season and beyond?\n\nIt\u2019s almost like when the green flag drops, you forget you\u2019re on TV. You do, and you\u2019re not nervous. You\u2019re just talking to your buddies about the race. You\u2019re just talking to Jeff about what\u2019s happening. But in the opening when we\u2019re on camera, you can\u2019t shake the feeling that everybody\u2019s watching and you\u2019re on camera and it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that we have a chance to take us to commercial or bring us in from commercial. Rick, obviously, that\u2019s his role. Sometimes the producer will say, \u201cAll right, Jeff, you\u2019re going to take us to commercial.\u201d I don\u2019t get those opportunities because I\u2019m not very efficient at it, but I would love to be able to get comfortable doing those type of things. I told NBC when I got hired, \u201cMan, I really wanna be the kind of guy you could put in any position in that booth and you\u2019d feel comfortable and confident in me.\u201d\n\nI really wanna learn every part of it to where I can be that guy. Like if Rick were to fall ill, and they\u2019re like, \u201cWho\u2019s gonna be the guy?\u201d I wanna be that guy. It\u2019s not gonna happen today or tomorrow, next year or the year after that. But maybe four, five, six years down the road, I would have enough experience and they would have enough confidence in me that I could fill that role if needed. I want to work on being the total package."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gabe Lacques, USA TODAY", "title": "Brewers could be a perfect dark horse fit for Bryce Harper", "description": "Coming off a 96-win season and a trip to the NLCS, the Milwaukee Brewers could make a splash by adding another MVP to their lineup.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/11/21/bryce-harper-brewers-free-agent/2077834002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/405fffc9-812b-4b93-8b65-ac34b79d7050-BREWERS-harper-caps-illo-v2.jpg?crop=3322,1876,x0,y896&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:36:06Z", "content": "Harper is one of the top free agents on the market.

(Photo: USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBryce Harper, a National League MVP at 23, is a free agent at 26, peddling his services in an industry that\u2019s grown to nearly $11 billion in annual revenues. His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league franchise.\n\nIncluding the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nHarper, who has 184 career home runs and a lifetime .900 OPS, rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract offer from the Washington Nationals in September, and is a good bet to set a new standard for the most lucrative contract in North American sports history.\n\nIt may take weeks for that process to play out. In the meantime, USA TODAY Sports will examine why every team could use Harper\u2019s services \u2013 some more than others, certainly some better-equipped to procure them.\n\nA case for Harper and the Brewers joining forces:\n\nOn the field\n\nWe all deserve to splurge every now and again. And the Milwaukee Brewers have earned the right to treat themselves.\n\nGeneral manager David Stearns \u2013 and his predecessor, Doug Melvin \u2013 helmed a re-tooling that produced impact players at friendly prices. And in an era where several franchises struggle to extract themselves from \u201ctanking\u201d mode, Stearns hit the afterburners at just the right time.\n\nHis signing of outfielder Lorenzo Cain and acquisition of Christian Yelich last January could not have gone better: Yelich and Cain ranked 1-2 in National League position player Wins Above Replacement. Yelich went on to win NL MVP.\n\nAnd the Brewers\u2019 season lasted all the way to Game 7 of the NL Championship Series, falling just a few innings shy of their first World Series berth since 1982.\n\nMost notably, Stearns assembled this core with a significant amount of cost certainty.\n\nThe five-year, $80 million deal given to Cain now looks like a bargain. For now, the mere cost of prospects to acquire Yelich has not yet come back to bite the Brewers.\n\nAnd for the next four seasons, they will have the 2018 NL MVP in their lineup for the low cost of $12.8 million per season.\n\nIn the big picture, they\u2019d be spending some $35 million per season on Harper \u2013 say, 12 years and $420 million. In the near term, they could view it as paying one of the greatest outfields of all time \u2013 two NL MVPs and a world class center fielder - an average of $21.2 million per man.\n\nNot bad, eh?\n\nMore cash will loosen up after 2020, when the last of the $40 million guaranteed Ryan Braun falls off the books. In the meantime, they can shift Braun to first base and perhaps deal Jesus Aguilar \u2013 at the height of his value - to an American League team.\n\nAnd if Yelich enjoyed the boost in production moving from Marlins to Miller Park, imagine the bounce Harper might receive.\n\nWhile Harper\u2019s Nationals Park rated better last season as a home run haven (1.17 per game, park-adjusted, to Miller\u2019s 1.12), the Brewers\u2019 home stadium is far better for power hitters as the data set grows. Twice this decade it\u2019s led the majors in home run indulgence.\n\nYelich, who also made some key tweaks to his swing, doubled his home run output from 18 to 36 while playing in nine fewer games in 2018. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a 26-year-old Harper toppling his career best of 42 homers \u2013 particularly surrounded by Cain, Yelich, Braun and Travis Shaw.\n\nOff the field\n\nYou\u2019d think nearly making the World Series would\u2019ve let everyone in on this secret, but here it is again: Milwaukee is a phenomenal baseball town.\n\nThe Brewers ranked sixth in the NL in attendance, and 11th overall, drawing 2.85 million and boosting their average crowd by nearly 4,000, to 35,000. Adding Harper to a club coming off 96 wins would surely push them past their franchise record of 3.07 million, set in 2011, and further cement their relevance in an area that also has eyes for Aaron Rodgers and Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nAs for Harper, setting up shop in Milwaukee would certainly test the notion of whether baseball is truly a \u201cnational\u201d sport, and not a collection of regional interests. Harper would be moving from the USA\u2019s sixth-largest media market to No. 36.\n\nAt this point, however, Harper\u2019s brand is well-established. So long as the Brewers continue winning, his exposure will maintain \u2013 and his mere presence would compel the networks to feature them in national broadcasts. (With 19 games per year against the Cubs, you can already see the Kris Bryant-Harper promo graphic, right?)\n\nWhy they could pull it off\n\nWith a franchise value of $1.03 billion and annual revenues of $255 million, according to Forbes, the Brewers have the cash. In fact, they\u2019ve now moved up two slots, to No. 25, in franchise value, and have appreciated nicely since owner Mark Attanasio bought the club for $223 million in 2005.\n\nStill, their market limitations are real. That brings us back to Stearns and his front-office lieutenants: They chased down the Cubs in September with Wade Miley, Jhoulys Chacin, Chase Anderson, Junior Guerra, Zach Davies and others comprising their rotation down the stretch. None made more than $7 million last season.\n\nThey got within one game of the World Series with a m\u00e9lange of Miley, Gio Gonzalez, Chacin and reliever Brandon Woodruff starting playoff games.\n\nIn short, the Brewers know how to contain costs with creativity. A Saks Fifth Avenue lineup paired with a pitching staff purchased at Kohl\u2019s might look odd \u2013 but it can work.\n\nWill it happen?\n\nNot terribly likely. Make no mistake: Dark horses will surely emerge before the Harper sweepstakes wrap up and the Brewers fit that profile \u2013 but probably not as snugly as others."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Rasha Ali, USA TODAY", "title": "The Rock's daughter insists on painting her father's face before he leaves for work", "description": "Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's daughter won't let her dad leave for work without painting his face.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/11/21/rocks-daughter-insists-painting-her-fathers-face/2077641002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/0b0575d4-3ce0-4fd2-8606-3d15e8562c70-XXX_IMG_636410865473745414_7_1_1_VPJM170I.JPG?crop=4732,2662,x0,y294&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:34:42Z", "content": "Dwayne Johnson as Spencer in 'Ballers.'

He and 2016 Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson are the only QBs in school history to rush for at least 100 yards twice. Jackson did it 23 times.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nSnell is Kentucky's career leader in rushing and total TDs with 44. ... The Wildcats rank 12th nationally in scoring defense (16.8 points per game) and 24th in total defense (328.2 yards). ... Louisville will say goodbye to 11 seniors who have gone 27-23 and reached three bowl games in their careers. ...

Here\u2019s why that\u2019s the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nConsumer confusion around cosmetic ingredients has grown in recent years as the clean beauty movement gains momentum. (Photo: Colorblind, Getty Images)\n\nSkincare sets wrapped in millennial pink and eco-green are already filling Instagram ads this season, and with their pore-refining promises these would-be stocking-stuffers also draw attention to \u201ctoxic chemicals\" that\u2019ve been canceled by clean-living proponents in the last few years.\n\nFace masks with parabens? Don\u2019t even think about it, the gospel of Goop preaches. Body lotions with mineral oils? Definitely not on Beautycounter\u2019s \u201cnice\u201d list.\n\nBut trying to understand the rationale behind these decrees can be more complicated than applying liquid eyeliner in an airplane bathroom.\n\nExperts and industry veterans say the muddy reality of the billion-dollar clean beauty movement \u2013 which drove a 27 percent increase in skincare alone this year \u2013 is that terms such as \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d are essentially meaningless and unregulated, and the much-hyped health risks of several chemical ingredients are based on questionable data.\n\n\u201cThere is kind of a chemophobia in the U.S. \u2013 if it's a chemical, a man-made chemical, it must be bad,\" said Curtis Klaassen, former president of the Society of Toxicology and chair of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics at the Kansas University Medical Center.\n\nMore: The truth about talc, parabens and 8 other controversial makeup ingredients\n\nMore: 6 dubious clean beauty claims from Goop and Beautycounter, decoded\n\nThe Environmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit advocacy organization that\u2019s a leader of the clean cosmetics crusade, says that even if it\u2019s impossible to directly prove these ingredients cause cancer, people should believe the most pilloried chemicals are bad for you based on their review of research.\n\nNneka Leiba, EWG's director of healthy living science, argues that outside of smoking, there is rarely \"definitive proof\" that a chemical causes cancer, but there is an overall burden on the body from chemicals in personal care products. Some of these chemicals are also present in the environment, but at least with cosmetics \"you have the choice not to buy that product,\" she said.\n\nThat sensibility confounds those who say the adage \u201cthe dose makes the poison\u201d is one of the basic principles of toxicology. Klaassen compares it to the wind: Gusts of a few miles per hour are harmless, yet those reaching 100 mph can topple a house.\n\n\"The average person wants a yes/no for every chemical, and they don\u2019t think about the dose,\" Klaassen said. \"It turns out that 50 percent of the chemicals in the world we think are carcinogens if you're given enough.\"\n\nThe need for more regulation\n\nThe back and forth on ingredient safety has been enabled in part by the relative low levels of U.S. regulation on the cosmetics industry \u2013 something many industry veterans and activists alike deem problematic.\n\nFor Nicolette Leung, 32, who primarily buys natural products after starting a clean-living transition a few years ago, the difference between the more rigorous regulations of countries such as the European Union and those in the U.S. gave her pause. Leung says she's privileged to be able to make natural products a priority, though she says it hasn't necessarily made navigating beauty aisles any easier.\n\n\"Even with natural beauty products it's confusing,\" Leung said. \"I think the entire industry is confusing and opaque.\"\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there are no regulations around the term \u2018clean beauty,\u2019 \u201d said Paula Begoun, who launched cult-favorite beauty line Paula\u2019s Choice in 1995. \u201cIt typically means minimal to no synthetic ingredients and the absence of any ingredient deemed controversial, even if there\u2019s valid research attesting to the ingredient\u2019s safety as used in cosmetics.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees cosmetics, which legally must be safe for consumers to use as directed and properly labeled. Unlike food and drugs, however, they do not need FDA preapproval before going to market.\n\nMore: Retailer Justice yanks makeup that may contain asbestos\n\nMore: Pallone: FDA should probe for asbestos in makeup sold at Claire's, Justice\n\nGwyneth Paltrow's health and lifestyle brand Goop has entered the supplements world with a variety of curated pill packs. (Photo: Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Goop)\n\nClaims that companies are free to do whatever they want, legally filling products with known harmful ingredients, are not true. Certain ingredients are banned \u2013 lead acetate, which is found in some men's hair dyes, was added to that list late last month. And the FDA has long tracked reports on exposure and \"adverse event\" complaints on products, says Dr. Linda Katz, director of FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors.\n\n\"Most chemicals that have been used in cosmetics have a long history of safe use and have not been the subject of major concern,\" she said.\n\nThe cosmetics industry, through the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), sought to help assuage consumer's concerns by creating the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) committee in 1976 in coordination with the FDA. The independent panel of scientists issues reports on safety risks, which are taken into consideration by the FDA and the industry. (Klaassen is a member of CIR.)\n\nCritics say that self-policing method is not enough. EWG and Breast Cancer Prevention Partners (BCPP) run websites with their own determinations on safety. And EWG, which was among the groups petitioning the FDA to ban lead acetate, points to the fact it took so long for the ban.\n\nThe Goop effect\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop, Jessica Alba\u2019s Honest Company and Beautycounter have made highly publicized movements away from synthetic ingredients to natural alternatives, touting never-use lists of a thousand or more. The strategy has backfired in some high-profile cases, most notably Alba's natural sunscreen that was widely panned because it didn't protect skin from burning and led to lawsuits, and her baby wipes and baby powder, which were recalled last year due to mold and contamination of microorganisms, respectively.

Contamination is a frequent cause of recalls, she says.\n\n\u201cWithout them you would either be keeping products in the refrigerator or rebuying them all the time because you\u2019d be constantly throwing out contaminated products,\u201d Loretz said.\n\nThe FDA says there\u2019s no evidence of human harm from parabens in cosmetics, and CIR has repeatedly found formaldehyde-releasing preservatives to be safe in the very low percentages found in cosmetics. Yet almost all are on \"baddies\" lists, in industry parlance.\n\nJay Ansell, a chemist and board-certified toxicologist who serves as vice president of cosmetic programs at PCPC, says this discrepancy often results from organizations taking data developed for one application \u2013 such as morticians' use of formaldehyde \u2013 and applying it across the board.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really relevant in our opinion to a formaldehyde-releaser, which may result in a few parts per billion in a product, as opposed to an occupational exposure in high concentrations every day for a lifetime,\u201d Ansell said.\n\nConnie Engel, manager of science translation for BCPP, says it should all be taken into account when \u201cmaking a best guess of what is true but also what is potentially protective of people\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nFor consumers such as Leung, shopping decisions are more about peace of mind than a frenetic fear of disease.\n\n\"I kind of look at it as a similar analogy to cooking,\" Leong says. \"Maybe preservatives aren\u2019t going to kill you, but if I can know what all the ingredients are then that just makes me feel more secure.\"\n\nMore: 4 million Americans could be drinking toxic water and would never know\n\nMore: Retailer Claire's pulls makeup from its shelves over asbestos concerns\n\nDriving change: Women of color\n\nThere's industry-wide consensus on the potential harm of some ingredients, including hair-straightening products that release formaldehyde into the air when heated and specific uses of skin-bleaching agents. Those historically have affected women of color disproportionately compared to white women, in part because they are used in products that change hair and skin texture to conform with Western beauty standards.\n\nPart of the rise in natural beauty has been driven by communities of color looking outside mainstream beauty to brands tailored to their skin and hair types and by immigrant communities seeking products of cultural importance, which are often natural.\n\n\"There's a mythology of the Whole Foods soccer mom and affluent white women, but a lot of this is also driven by communities of color who are not necessarily affluent who are making really important choices for themselves and their families,\" said Christine Keihm, senior vice president of marketing for Nubian Heritage.\n\nNubian Heritage co-founders Richelieu Dennis, Nyema Tubman and Mary Dennis have focused their 20-year-old brand on things such as shea butter and African black soap common in their family home of Liberia. There's been a welcome uptick in research around those types of ingredients, making them easier to use in skincare products, said Ozohu Adoh, founder and CEO of Epara, a luxury skincare line tailored to women of color that recently launched in the U.S.\n\n\"The things that our African grandmothers told us, those kind of folklore or folktales, we now are starting to understand the scientific underpinnings of those claims they used to make,\" Adoh said.\n\nRoom for agreement\n\nThe benefit of research on all potential ingredients, and the need for more of it, is another unifier in the beauty world.\n\nThe FDA announced plans this month to conduct a web-based survey about allergens in cosmetics, with aims of helping the agency better understand consumer decisions, perceptions and allergen awareness.\n\nMost people \u201cwant to know what the facts are, and the problem is we don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d said Dr. Lynn A. Drake, a dermatology faculty member at Massachusetts General Hospital and lecturer at Harvard Medical School.\n\nDrake cites the need for more legitimate controlled clinical trials and transparency with ingredients. All of which goes a long way to clear up consumer confusion and build trust.\n\n\"It\u2019s easy to trivialize some things like cosmetics. Is your lipstick as important as the pill for your heart?\" she asks. \"But little do we know that down the line one of these products might have something in it that could harm you.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/11/21/clean-beauty-truth-talc-parabens-makeup-ingredients/1897128002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Nick Schwartz", "title": "The NFL is officially celebrating touchdown antics that players were fined for", "description": "Some fans are confused by the NFL\u2019s newest Twitter account.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/the-nfl-is-officially-celebrating-touchdown-antics-that-players-were-fined-for", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/horn.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:30:17Z", "content": "The NFL relaxed its rules on touchdown celebrations before the 2017 season, which has resulted in a long list of creative and hilarious moments that have gone viral on social media \u2013 but the league has still fined several players in 2018 for celebrations that\u2026 [+1295 chars]", "fulltext": "The NFL relaxed its rules on touchdown celebrations before the 2017 season, which has resulted in a long list of creative and hilarious moments that have gone viral on social media \u2013 but the league has still fined several players in 2018 for celebrations that apparently crossed the line.\n\nThe league officially doesn\u2019t want its players using outside props during TD celebrations, but it has no problem calling Joe Horn a \u201clegend\u201d for doing just that, as recently evidenced by a new NFL twitter account called @GetYaPopcorn.\n\n2003: Joe Horn\u2019s cell phone celebration\n\nJoe Horn's a legend for this one \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcde#GetYaPopcorn pic.twitter.com/KHRv2EXbwQ \u2014 Get Ya Popcorn (@GetYaPopcorn) November 17, 2018\n\nFine: $30,000, though it was Horn\u2019s second violation that year.

The flood watch also targeted areas charred by wildfires earlier this year in Lake, Shasta, Trinity and Mendocino counties.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which has killed at least 83 people, was 85 percent contained Wednesday night, Cal Fire said. It has already destroyed 18,000 structures and almost 240 square miles of forest but still threatens 5,100 structures. Fire officials say it won't be fully contained until at least Nov. 30.\n\nFire officials, who say 563 people remain unaccounted for, also worry that the rain will complicate efforts to find the remains of other victims.

As with their siblings, both are excellent consoles, and you won't be disappointed with either.\n\nBe aware of 2019\n\nMicrosoft's first-party Xbox controller is still one of the best (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nAs with other products such as AirPods, this year's game purchases have a cloud of uncertainty over them as major upgrades are rumored to be right around the corner.\n\nWhile the Nintendo Switch launched only last year, rumors suggest Nintendo is readying an updated model possibly for next summer.\n\nBoth Sony and Microsoft have made clear that their next generation systems are in the works, with Sony most recently getting the internet talking that its decision to sit out the E3 video game conference next year is, in part, because it is working on the PlayStation 5. Rumors also are circulating that Sony might reveal the PS5 next year at its own event before releasing the new console in 2020.\n\nAt this year's E3, Microsoft's Xbox head Phil Spencer said the company's hardware team was already working on the \"next Xbox consoles.\" Microsoft insider Brad Sams of Thurrott.com says the next-gen Xbox console is also expected in 2020.\n\nBoth consoles were released in November 2013, making each prime for an upgrade.\n\nWhat does this mean for now? Not much in the short term as all current systems will continue to play great, with new games expected to come out for them over the next few years. But it is worth keeping mind what might be on the horizon, and when that horizon might arrive, as you prepare to shop this holiday season.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/21/playstation-4-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-which-one-should-you-buy/2071010002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Ashley May, USA TODAY", "title": "Why washing romaine lettuce won't kill E. coli that's already sickened 32 people", "description": "Why washing romaine lettuce won't kill E. coli", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/21/romaine-lettuce-warning-you-cant-wash-off-e-coli/2077052002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/827c0c80-1d02-420f-93f8-6861da1e3e89/827c0c80-1d02-420f-93f8-6861da1e3e89_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:26:34Z", "content": "Washing romaine lettuce won't rid it of E. coli, experts say amid an outbreak that's already sickened 32 people across multiple states.

The gain trimmed its decline from its late August high to 14 percent.\n\nBlue chip stocks, however, ran into late selling, causing the Dow Jones industrial average to finish down by less than a point after climbing more than 200 points earlier in the session. The Dow closed at 24,465, leaving it down 1 percent for the year and 8.8 percent from its October record close. Still even a flat day for the Dow was welcomed by investors after a slide of nearly 1,000 points in the first two days of the week.\n\nIn a sign of just how bad the carnage on Wall Street has been in the recent sell-off, more than 45 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 have fallen more than 20 percent from their highs in the past year, according to Bloomberg data.

Boone, Gannett)\n\nAt least the sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie should be safe.\n\nAs Americans prepare for the traditional Thanksgiving feast Thursday, federal food and health officials have issued warnings about potential bacteria contamination of turkey and romaine lettuce.\n\nTurkey and salmonella concerns\n\nA turkey salmonella outbreak, potentially spread throughout the entire processing industry, has led health officials to advise extra caution to prevent food poisoning as cooks prepare the Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nThe outbreak identified this month has hospitalized 63 people and sickened 164 in 35 states, killing one in California, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nBut health investigators have not been able to identify a single supplier of live turkeys or raw turkey products as the source of the outbreak. That has led them to say the strain involved may be widespread throughout the turkey industry including ground turkey, turkey patties and full turkeys.\n\nE. coli: Why women and girls bear the brunt of the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak\n\nOfficials are not suggesting cooks forego the Thanksgiving turkey, but are advising them to wash their hands before and after handling the turkey. Warm soapy water should be used to thoroughly clean any surfaces that may have come in contact with the raw meat or poultry juices.\n\nRather than thawing the turkey by leaving it on the counter, cooks should thaw it in the microwave or in the fridge in cold water, which is changed every 30 minutes, officials advise. When cooking turkey or any leftovers that contain any turkey, make sure the food hits an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRomaine lettuce E. coli warning\n\nThe CDC on Tuesday also warned the public not to eat any Romaine lettuce \u2013 and retailers and restaurants not to sell or serve it \u2013 over concerns of an E. coli outbreak.\n\nSince October, at least 32 people in 11 states have gotten sick, with at least 13 hospitalized, from the same strain of E. coli in the outbreak, officials say. No deaths have been reported, but one person suffered a kind of kidney failure, the CDC says.\n\nRomaine lettuce contaminated with E. coli has sickened more than 30 people in over 10 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That outbreak killed one person and infected 25 in 15 states.

You're not necessarily in the clear there, either.\n\nThe nation's largest beef processor, JBS USA, this week recalled nearly 100,000 pounds of ground beef for possible E. coli contamination. The ground beef, produced Oct. 24 at JBS USA-owned Swift Beef Co. in Hyrum, Utah, may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the USDA says.\n\nThe 99,260 pounds of ground beef was packaged in 2,000-pound pallets and in plastic wrapped packages of 8 to 10 pounds marked as \"Blue Ribbon Beef\" and sold in varying levels of fat content including \"Ground Beef 81/19 (81% lean) Coarse Grind bearing product code 42410.\"\n\nNo confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of the products have been reported, the agency says.\n\nLong Phung Pork Rolls recalled\n\nLong Phung Food Products of Houston on Tuesday recalled an undetermined amount of ready-to-eat pork products potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the USDA says.\n\nThe ready-to-eat pork patty rolls, produced between May 21, 2018, through Nov. 16, 2018, have led to four confirmed illnesses between July 1, 2017, and Oct. 24, 2018, the agency says.\n\nAmong the Vietnamese sausages recalled are 6-ounce plastic vacuum-packed Long Phung 1988 Gio Lua Vietnamese Brand Cooked Pork Patty Roll Anchovy Flavored Fish Sauce Added and a 32-oz.

The home team has won each of the past five games in the series for the Jeweled Shillelagh. ... USC hadn't lost in 19 straight games at the Coliseum under coach Clay Helton until losing its last two in a row. ... Helton's status with the Trojans is unclear one year after winning the Pac-12, with angry fans agitating for his firing. Helton has a contract through 2023, but USC already has its first six-loss regular season since 2000, the final season before Pete Carroll took over.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tim Ireland) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Just like the politicians, English soccer is divided by Brexit.\n\nWith four months until Britain withdraws from the European Union and no consensus over the terms of the split from the bloc, there is also uncertainty about the players Premier League clubs will be able to recruit.\n\nWith free movement of people from the European single market to work in Britain set to end, players from the continent could become subject to the same soccer-specific immigration requirements as counterparts from the rest of the world.\n\nAfter a quarter-century of growth, the Premier League sees maintaining the free-flowing pipeline of talent from Europe into its clubs as essential for maintaining the appeal of the competition worldwide.\n\n\"It's working,\" West Ham co-owner David Gold said. \"Why would you change it?\"\n\nBut the English Football Association is seizing on Brexit to try to ensure players eligible for its national team gain more playing time in the Premier League and build on the semifinal run at this year's World Cup in Russia.\n\nCurrently, the FA runs the visa system for non-European players in conjunction with the government's Home Office. Unless a deal is reached between the FA and the Premier League, those eligibility requirements could apply to any foreign player after Brexit in March.\n\nPlayers from the top 50 FIFA nations are considered for work permits, with a sliding scale of appearances required \u2014 from 30 percent of games over two years for the 1-10 teams to 75 percent for 31-50 teams. According to FA research seen by The Associated Press, 65 percent of Europeans currently playing in the Premier League would have failed if the criteria were applied to them.\n\nBut for players who don't meet the threshold, clubs can seek an exemption by arguing the case for a work permit in front of a panel. The FA hopes to persuade the Premier League to scrap that system, known as the governing body eligibility endorsement.\n\nUnder the FA's post-Brexit proposals, Premier League clubs would be allowed to sign whoever they want from abroad but only be allowed 13 non-homegrown players in the squad. That number is an average based on the 262 non-homegrown players currently in the 20 teams.\n\n\"Brexit should not be used to weaken playing squads in British football, nor to harm clubs' ability to sign international players,\" the Premier League said in a statement.\n\nMost of the 20 teams do not currently use their full quota of 17 non-homegrown players, a status which means they have not been affiliated to an English or Welsh club for three complete seasons or 36 months before their 21st birthday.\n\nAccording to the FA's research, which was presented to Premier League clubs last week, restricting them to 13 homegrown players last season would have affected only 42 player appearances out of more than 10,000. Only 24 were starts. From Premier League champion Manchester City, only backup goalkeeper Claudio Bravo would have missed out on his three appearances.\n\nThe FA calls this a \"pragmatic\" solution: Clubs could still sign whoever they want from Europe, but the freedom over recruitment is extended worldwide, as long as they abide by new squad limits.\n\n\"The FA believes increasing access, but preventing an increase in current numbers of overseas players, would benefit all of English football,\" the governing body said in a statement.\n\nThe limited opportunities for English talent at home were underscored when Jadon Sancho left Man City last year for Borussia Dortmund in Germany. The 18-year-old winger has since won the Under-17 World Cup and gained regular top-flight experience that saw him fast-tracked into Gareth Southgate's senior England side.\n\n\"I'm just grateful he's seen my progress in the Bundesliga,\" Sancho said. \"My focus was getting minutes as a player and playing first-team football, which is what I've done.\"\n\nFA chief executive Martin Glenn pitched his plans at a meeting of clubs last week but the Premier League remains unconvinced that stronger quotas will have a positive impact on the national team.\n\n\"There is no evidence so to speak to support his proposal,\" said Gold, whose West Ham squad features 16 non-homegrown players. \"We are very supportive of English football. We want it to be successful. But we don't want to be doing things that isn't going to work.\"\n\nThe FA leadership can't even rely on Southgate for support, despite less than a third of the players featuring in the Premier League before the international break being English.\n\n\"Most of the data I have seen suggests quotas on squads would not make a difference because you could still field a team outside the base of British players,\" Southgate said.\n\nLawyers have questioned the merits of the FA's quotas proposal.\n\n\"(It) is completely at odds with the rest of the immigration system which requires employers to only sponsor workers at certain salary levels and to have academic qualifications or skills,\" said Andrew Osborne, head of immigration at London-based law firm Lewis Silkin. \"Non-football employers do not have freedom to recruit who they want subject to a numerical limit.\"\n\nPremier League clubs, like European counterparts, are currently allowed to transfer 16- and 17-year-old players between countries in the region under an exemption from FIFA regulations. But after Brexit, British clubs will only be allowed to sign foreign players over the age of 18, like the rest of the world. Manchester United, a record 20-time English champion, fears European rivals will be handed a competitive advantage.\n\n\"If you have 16-year-olds going to play for them and if we have to wait until 18 there are clearly practical issues there,\" United chief financial officer Cliff Baty has said.\n\nPremier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore endorsed the campaign to remain in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum. That reflected the competition's focus is maintaining the allure to domestic fans and the global television audience, with broadcast rights generating more than $3 billion per season.\n\n\"Access to talented footballers from across Europe has played a key part in the growth of the Premier League, with match attendance and global interest increasing significantly as high quality foreign players have taken their place in the competition with and against the best British and Irish players,\" the league said.\n\nThe government, which wants to end preferential immigration access for workers from the EU, uses the power of the Premier League to project soft power and promote British culture internationally.\n\n\"We have held positive discussions with government about the importance of access to European players for our clubs,\" the league said, \"and the many cultural and economic benefits a globally popular Premier League brings to the U.K.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Noah Berger, AP)\n\nWeek-long heavy rain rolling into Northern California on Wednesday morning could help firefighters battling the raging Camp Fire, but also threaten to trigger floods, mudslides and debris flows in areas of both Northern and Southern California that have been stripped and scarred by wildfires.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for Paradise, the retirement community of 27,000 that was destroyed by the Camp Fire, and nearby communities. The flood watch also targeted areas charred by wildfires earlier this year in Lake, Shasta, Trinity and Mendocino counties.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which has killed at least 83 people, was 85 percent contained Wednesday night, Cal Fire said. It has already destroyed 18,000 structures and almost 240 square miles of forest but still threatens 5,100 structures. Fire officials say it won't be fully contained until at least Nov. 30.\n\nFire officials, who say 563 people remain unaccounted for, also worry that the rain will complicate efforts to find the remains of other victims. Up to 6 inches of rain are forecast through Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe task is arduous,\u201d said Capt. Rick Crawford with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. \u201cAnd the possibility exists that some people may never be found.\u201d\n\nThe heavy rain and 40 mph winds could all but paralyze the effort to search every structure in Paradise a second time, said Jason Solak, rescue-team manager for California Task Force 4. In addition, the water and debris flows from flooding along burned areas could wash away remains that teams like his have not yet detected.\n\n\"Given the weather and the time frame,\" Solak said, \"we\u2019re up against the clock.\u201d\n\nAn undated handout photo made available by the United States Forest Service and the National Wildfire Coordinating Group on Inciweb on November 20, 2018 shows firefighters battling the Camp Fire in Northern California.

That means working to get the burned areas back to pre-fire conditions as much as possible, in part by clearing downed trees and loose branches that could be dislodged in a storm \u2014 they're called widow-makers in fire parlance.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure those are out of the way and that the first responders are out of harm and danger,\" Crawford said. \"That\u2019s why this area is still under mandatory evacuation.\u201d\n\nMore: 3 startling facts about California's Camp Fire\n\nMore: Zinke on wildfires: 'Radical' groups would rather burn down forest than thin one tree\n\nFor residents who survived the fire but are left without shelter or can't get back in their homes, The Salvation Army plans a Thanksgiving luncheon Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to give the evacuees a place to enjoy Thanksgiving and to enjoy a warm meal,\u201d said Lt.

To continue the streak, the nation\u2019s No. 2 offense, averaging 541.8 yards a game, must take down a Michigan team ranked No. 1 in the nation in total defense (234.8).\n\nAs one-loss Power Five teams, the Wolverines and Buckeyes both understand they must win Saturday, and then beat Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game, to have an opportunity to be in the College Football Playoff.\n\nAnd as if that weren\u2019t enough, this year\u2019s game has subplots to add more spice.\n\n\u201cI believe this will be (Ohio State coach) Urban Meyer\u2019s last game coaching in the Shoe \u2013 I think he\u2019s going to retire,\u201d said fan Jeff Hamms who will attend his 39th Ohio State-Michigan game.\n\nMeyer, 54, has shown discomfort coaching on the sidelines, and said earlier this season an enlarged congenital arachnoid cyst on his brain had caused headaches that brought him to his knees during a game against Indiana.\n\nOn Michigan sports talk shows, one topic of conversation is whether Harbaugh can finally beat Ohio State as a coach. He did beat Ohio State as a Michigan quarterback. He\u2019s 0-3 against the Buckeyes since taking over Dec. 16, 2014.\n\n\u201cAs far as fans go, I would say there\u2019s a decent amount, not a majority, who see this game as a referendum on Harbaugh,\u201d said Mike Stone, host of a morning show on 97.1 The Ticket. \u201cIf they lose this game, there will be a segment that says, \u2018He\u2019s still a failure because he hasn\u2019t beaten Ohio State.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Stone said the majority of Michigan fans view the game\u2019s importance as an opportunity to reach the Big Ten championship game for the first time. \u201cThen if they take care of business there, and get to the playoffs, they bring the program back to the prominence it once had.\u201d\n\nMichigan\u2019s leading rusher Karan Higdon (1,106 yards) created a stir this week when he guaranteed a win against Ohio State. But Harbaugh said on Tuesday\u2019s Big Ten Conference call Higdon was badgered into the guarantee.\n\n\u201cWhat Karan was saying was he was confident, believes in his team, his teammates, his coaches,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat\u2019s real. That\u2019s genuine. I thought the reporter was pretty silly with his \u2018Do you guarantee? Do you guarantee? Do you guarantee?\u2019\u201d\n\nCoaches dislike bulletin board material, but fans are into it during Michigan-Ohio State week.\n\nBetts lives in Michigan but grew up in Cleveland. He is going to niece Millicent\u2019s home in Galena, Ohio, 22 miles from Columbus, for Thanksgiving. His brother, Greg, is a Michigan fan, but Greg\u2019s wife Shelley\u2019s family cheers for the Buckeyes.\n\n\u201cWe have endured a lot of abuse over the last number of years, so we hoping this year will be different so we can put an end to the family feud,\u201d Betts joked.\n\nBrian Fogle, 50, owner of a Columbus landscaping business, has one of the largest Ohio State memorabilia collections. It includes a leather jacket signed by more than 300 of Ohio State\u2019s greatest players. He ignores statistics and hype this week.\n\n\u201cThis is a war,\u201d Fogle said. \u201cIt never matters where teams are ranked.\u201d\n\nWhat does matter is how much fans enjoy the rivalry. \u201cIt gets pretty wild,\u201d Fogle said. \u201cI remember in 2002, we were walking down High Street at nine in the morning, and all I could see was a sea of Scarlet and Gray. I remember saying, \u2018That is where I want to be.\u2019\u201d\n\nHamms said he is nervous about this game, and he never is nervous about Michigan-Ohio State game. He\u2019s fretting because Michigan has looked impressive since losing to Notre Dame in its opening game. The Buckeyes, meanwhile, have often strained to win.\n\nBecause of the drama surrounding Meyer\u2019s future, Hamms said: \u201cThis is the biggest game Urban Meyer has ever coached, at any level, for any school, including for the national championship.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say this game is significant for many, including Harbaugh.\n\n\u201cTo us this is as big as it gets,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important thing in our football lives.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Drones have ability to deliver human organs", "description": "There really are all kinds of uses for drones, and now one of those uses is delivering organs.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/tech/science/2018/11/21/drones-have-ability-deliver-human-organs/38578659/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5969985186001_5969983689001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:42:21Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Ben Tobin, USA TODAY", "title": "Toys R Us sets up $20-million severance fund for former employees", "description": "KKR and Bain Capital announced they will each pledge $10 million to the TRU Financial Assistance Fund, which will distribute cash to former employees.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/21/toys-r-us-sets-up-20-million-severance-fund-former-employees/2076823002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/08e858c4-b2e7-4597-8e95-c529167dc65c-Toys_R_Us.jpeg?crop=533,299,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:40:31Z", "content": "Toy company Hasbro will reportedly lay off up to 10 percent of its current employees.

(Photo: Marko Georgiev)\n\nSome former Toys R Us employees will receive severance pay through a $20 million fund in the upcoming months.\n\nKKR and Bain Capital, two of the three private equity firms that bought out Toys R Us in 2005, announced Tuesday they will each pledge $10 million to the TRU Financial Assistance Fund, which will distribute cash to former employees. The third owner of Toys R Us, Vornado Realty Trust, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it plans to contribute to the trust.\n\n\"The confluence of the disruption in retail, the push by the company\u2019s secured creditors to liquidate the company\u2019s U.S. operations, and the fact that we have never experienced something like this in the history of either firm, led us to try and find a way to provide some financial relief for former employees,\" KKR and Bain said in a joint statement.\n\nEmployees must have been working for Toys R Us for a minimum of one year on or after Sept. 18, 2017 \u2013 the day that the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection \u2013 to be eligible for severance pay, according to the fund's draft protocol.\n\nAdditionally, employees must have fallen into one of three categories: global resource center employees, stores and regional office employees and District Center Management and full\u2010time hourly employees. Moreover, eligible employees can have neither an annual income of more than $110,000 nor an annual income of less than $5,000. Lastly, employees who received severance or termination pay are not eligible for payment.\n\nThe amounts individuals receive will vary, with $200 being the minimum. All of the contributions to the fund \"will be paid directly\" to eligible former employees, according to KKR's and Bain's joint statement.\n\nTo help distribute the funds, KKR and Bain hired Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros, who have led similar projects in the past \u2013 most notably, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.\n\n\u201cWe have designed a transparent, straight forward and simple process that should provide some financial relief to eligible former employees,\" Biros said in a statement.\n\nFor the next two weeks, former employees can comment on the draft protocol, either through the fund's website or through upcoming conference calls. The claims process will be launched Dec. 15, and eligible employees will be able to fill out forms to request pay until March 31, 2019. The fund aims to complete the distribution process by April 30, 2019.\n\nFollow USA TODAY intern Ben Tobin on Twitter: @TobinBen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/21/toys-r-us-sets-up-20-million-severance-fund-former-employees/2076823002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Mike Snider, USA TODAY", "title": "Turkey and romaine lettuce recalls, food safety concerns loom this Thanksgiving", "description": "Among the food safety concerns this Thanksgiving: turkey and a salmonella outbreak, plus E. coli contamination linked to romaine lettuce.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/11/21/romaine-lettuce-turkey-recalls-bring-safety-concerns-thanksgiving/2076915002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/0e203f19-3e99-4bc0-a99c-01cb774c10d0-tukey_dinner.JPG?crop=1999,1125,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:38:25Z", "content": "Stores nationwide pull lettuce from their shelves after reports of illnesses due to E.

USA TODAY\n\nHealth officials are stressing food safety this Thanksgiving amid a salmonella outbreak for turkey. (Photo: Regina H. Boone, Gannett)\n\nAt least the sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie should be safe.\n\nAs Americans prepare for the traditional Thanksgiving feast Thursday, federal food and health officials have issued warnings about potential bacteria contamination of turkey and romaine lettuce.\n\nTurkey and salmonella concerns\n\nA turkey salmonella outbreak, potentially spread throughout the entire processing industry, has led health officials to advise extra caution to prevent food poisoning as cooks prepare the Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nThe outbreak identified this month has hospitalized 63 people and sickened 164 in 35 states, killing one in California, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nBut health investigators have not been able to identify a single supplier of live turkeys or raw turkey products as the source of the outbreak. That has led them to say the strain involved may be widespread throughout the turkey industry including ground turkey, turkey patties and full turkeys.\n\nE. coli: Why women and girls bear the brunt of the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak\n\nOfficials are not suggesting cooks forego the Thanksgiving turkey, but are advising them to wash their hands before and after handling the turkey. Warm soapy water should be used to thoroughly clean any surfaces that may have come in contact with the raw meat or poultry juices.\n\nRather than thawing the turkey by leaving it on the counter, cooks should thaw it in the microwave or in the fridge in cold water, which is changed every 30 minutes, officials advise. When cooking turkey or any leftovers that contain any turkey, make sure the food hits an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRomaine lettuce E. coli warning\n\nThe CDC on Tuesday also warned the public not to eat any Romaine lettuce \u2013 and retailers and restaurants not to sell or serve it \u2013 over concerns of an E. coli outbreak.\n\nSince October, at least 32 people in 11 states have gotten sick, with at least 13 hospitalized, from the same strain of E. coli in the outbreak, officials say. No deaths have been reported, but one person suffered a kind of kidney failure, the CDC says.\n\nRomaine lettuce contaminated with E. coli has sickened more than 30 people in over 10 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Photo: TomFoldes, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nConsumers should not only avoid romaine lettuce and any salad mixes that might contain romaine, but also should clean refrigerators where romaine had been stored, the CDC says.\n\nThis strain of E. coli had the \"same DNA fingerprint\" as an outbreak tied to leafy greens in the United States and romaine in Canada late last year. That outbreak killed one person and infected 25 in 15 states. But it is not related to an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from earlier this year \u2013 which killed five people and sickened 210 in 36 states \u2013 the CDC says.\n\nLatest ground beef recall\n\nLet's just say you want to play it safe, skip the turkey and grill some burgers for Thanksgiving. You're not necessarily in the clear there, either.\n\nThe nation's largest beef processor, JBS USA, this week recalled nearly 100,000 pounds of ground beef for possible E. coli contamination. The ground beef, produced Oct. 24 at JBS USA-owned Swift Beef Co. in Hyrum, Utah, may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the USDA says.\n\nThe 99,260 pounds of ground beef was packaged in 2,000-pound pallets and in plastic wrapped packages of 8 to 10 pounds marked as \"Blue Ribbon Beef\" and sold in varying levels of fat content including \"Ground Beef 81/19 (81% lean) Coarse Grind bearing product code 42410.\"\n\nNo confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of the products have been reported, the agency says.\n\nLong Phung Pork Rolls recalled\n\nLong Phung Food Products of Houston on Tuesday recalled an undetermined amount of ready-to-eat pork products potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the USDA says.\n\nThe ready-to-eat pork patty rolls, produced between May 21, 2018, through Nov. 16, 2018, have led to four confirmed illnesses between July 1, 2017, and Oct. 24, 2018, the agency says.\n\nAmong the Vietnamese sausages recalled are 6-ounce plastic vacuum-packed Long Phung 1988 Gio Lua Vietnamese Brand Cooked Pork Patty Roll Anchovy Flavored Fish Sauce Added and a 32-oz.

But after a crazy finale, we had to change up the format. Let\u2019s break down what happened.\n\n1. ASHLEY PULLS A JOHNNY BANANAS\n\nO. M. G.\n\nAshley and Hunter win a super tight final, with Joss and Sylvia finishing just behind them, partially because they had setbacks due to two grenades tossed their way. And it\u2019s Ashley who finished 31 seconds ahead of Hunter, so she got to decide to either split $1 million or keep it all for herself, a throwback to the Rivals 3 moment in which Johnny Bananas could do the same with his vendetta, Sarah.\n\nAnd just like Bananas, Ashley kept it.\n\nFor this entire season, I\u2019ve called Ashley and Hunter one of the strongest teams, but they were held back because they struggled to work together. Well, here you go. The decision was followed by a montage of Hunter saying some pretty awful stuff about Ashley in the past, all of it caught on camera.\n\nIt\u2019s a savage decision, but you could understand it given how much these two never saw eye to eye from the moment they entered as mercenaries.\n\n2. Ashley enters the list of all-time Challenge competitors\n\nShe\u2019s a two-time winner \u2014 that\u2019s as many as Emily and Jodi and one fewer than Evelyn. What a story.\n\n3. Joss and Sylvia blew it\n\nThe decision to jump down \u2014 in exchange for Paulie and Natalie to not use their grenade on them \u2014 from the part of the final in which the pairings had to stand on a small platform was a costly one.\n\nOF COURSE Paulie and Natalie were going to use it on them at some point. As Cara Maria pointed out, this is a final challenge for a million bucks. There\u2019s no wheeling and dealing at a final, even if you think there\u2019s more physically demanding stuff ahead. There\u2019s only your performance. It was pure brilliance that Paulie and Natalie convinced everyone to jump down.\n\nLet\u2019s also add that Paulie and Natalie had a shot if Natalie hadn\u2019t run the wrong way to start the challenge, and Paulie should have stayed with her too.\n\nHow my heart feels when Marie and Cara say they hate each other again \ud83d\udc94 #TheChallenge32 pic.twitter.com/DeqgtifeTb \u2014 The Challenge (@ChallengeMTV) November 21, 2018\n\n4. So much for the Cara Maria and Marie friendship\n\nOne of the sweeter story arcs from this season was these two enemies becoming frenemies and eventual friends. Then Marie jumped off a platform just minutes into the second part of the final and Cara Maria grabbed a bottle of wine from a nearby fridge to drown her sorrows about losing a final. The reunion should be fun.\n\n5. This season was an all-timer \u2026\n\nI\u2019d put it in the top-three seasons ever. There were more twists and turns than ever, rules that threw everyone for a loop, redemption houses that kept teams on their toes and high drama every week. How can MTV top this going forward?\n\n6. \u2026 But the final challenge was not\n\nTo review: There was climbing down from a helicopter, running, standing for a while, eating exotic food, more running and walking over coals.\n\nNo mountain climbing? No puzzles? That\u2019s a let-down. I get that this kind of final challenge levels the playing field in some ways, but we\u2019ve seen better.\n\nSee you all next week for the reunion special."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Ashley May, USA TODAY", "title": "Massive 4,000-year-old termite mounds can be seen on Google Earth", "description": "Huge, ancient termite mounds can be seen on Google Earth", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/21/ancient-termite-mounds-seen-google-earth-brazil/2076674002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/9c40c747-e37b-44dc-b90a-a2096e14d5e7/9c40c747-e37b-44dc-b90a-a2096e14d5e7_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:30:05Z", "content": "Millions of termite mounds believed to be nearly 4,000 years old were discovered in a remote Brazilian forest, according to researchers.

Spending some of your family time helping relatives with their hardware and software has become part of this holiday\u2019s intergenerational bargain.\n\nThis year, however, the biggest source of digital angst may not be not any one app or gadget, but a social network we increasingly love to hate: Facebook.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica data heist, the breach of some 30 million users\u2019 data and Facebook\u2019s belated response to disinformation campaigns by Russians and others all yield ample cause to reconsidering one\u2019s relationship status with Facebook.\n\nI didn\u2019t say \u201cdeleting\u201d: Facebook continues to be a good way to stay in touch with friends and family, and suggesting to relatives that they quit using the service that brings them pictures of grandchildren, cousins, nieces and nephews may lead to awkward silences at the dinner table.\n\nInstead, use this family tech-support time to dampen Facebook\u2019s demands on your relatives\u2019 time and data.

Not ready to unfriend somebody? You can relegate them to Facebook\u2019s lower-profile Acquaintances category.\n\nFacebook Groups and Pages can become a larger time-suck overall, though. Pruning Groups and Pages from the News Feed will leave more time for actual friends and may also cut down on the conspiracy theories in a relative\u2019s feed. You should also limit how many notifications each Group sends \u2013 especially in Facebook\u2019s iOS and Android apps.\n\nThe Screen Time feature in Apple\u2019s iOS 12 can also limit time spent in Facebook or any other app. Google\u2019s Android Pie release offers a similar Digital Wellbeing app you can opt into testing, but that update has yet to reach most Android phones.\n\nLess web tracking\n\nFacebook can make so much money off ads \u2013 $13.5 billion in its third quarter this year \u2013 not just because of the time people spend there, but because it can track their activity at other sites (USA TODAY included) that incorporate its Like and Share buttons and other Facebook features.\n\nYou can disable the resulting ad personalization in Facebook\u2019s ad preferences (facebook.com/ads/preferences): Change \u201cAds based on data from partners\u201d and \u201cAds based on your activity on Facebook Company Products that you see elsewhere\u201d to \u201cNot allowed.\u201d This page also lets you see what interests Facebook has discerned in a user, then edit that list.\n\nRestricting Facebook use to the right desktop browser can stop Facebook\u2019s off-site tracking. The current version of Apple\u2019s Safari disables those Like and Share buttons at other sites by default, while the free Facebook Container extension for Mozilla Firefox also isolates Facebook usage from everyday browsing elsewhere.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to make sure that the relatives you\u2019re helping also have your current email in their contacts lists, so you can still stay in touch during the next Facebook outage.\n\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.

(Photo: Gene Sloan, USA TODAY)\n\nMOORESTOWN, New Jersey \u2013 Julia Mooney stands in front of a classroom of eighth graders wearing her simple gray, button-down dress.\n\nIt\u2019s the same outfit she wore yesterday.\n\nShe also wore it the day before.\n\nIn fact, she\u2019s been wearing it virtually non-stop since early September.\n\nIn a project that's drawing national attention, the 34-year-old art teacher at William Allen Middle School has vowed to wear the dress every day she teaches for the first 100 days of the school year.\n\nWednesday is Day 47.\n\nMooney is trying to raise awareness of what she calls a growing \u201cculture of excess\u201d in America that has filled our closets to overflowing with throwaway garments.\n\n\u201cThere is no rule anywhere that says that we have to wear a different thing every day,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy do we ask this of each other? Why do we require that we each wear something different every day and buy more clothes and feed into this fast-fashion culture?\"\n\nMooney is not alone. She hoped to spark discussion among her students, friends and coworkers about the peer pressure children face to buy the latest fashions and the sustainability of their \u201cconsume, consume, consume\u201d habits. But she hasfound herself at the center of a wider national conversation around what is known as \u201csustainable fashion.\u201d\n\nCall it the antithesis of fast fashion, the inexpensive, quickly made, trend-of-the-moment clothing that has been flooding store shelves in recent years and allowing consumers to expand and quickly refresh wardrobes.\n\nSustainable fashion is about wearing clothing made in an eco-friendly way, buying fewer but better-made pieces of clothing, wearing them more often, and making sure garments eventually are recycled.\n\n\u201cThis is becoming much more of a mass movement,\u201d says fashion consultant Greta Eagan, author of Wear No Evil: How to Change the World with Your Wardrobe. \u201cIt\u2019s spreading beyond people who are \u2018green and clean\u2019 to the general public.\u201d\n\nEagan, who blogs about eco-friendly clothing at fashionmegreen.com, says the sustainable fashion movement is following the path of the organic food and clean beauty movements of recent years, which started on the fringes and eventually went mainstream.\n\nAt first people began caring more about the sustainability and healthfulness of what they put in their bodies. Then they started paying attention to what they put on their bodies. Now they\u2019re thinking more about the sustainability of what covers their bodies.\n\n\u201cFashion, I always like to say, is the last frontier,\u201d Eagan says.\n\nThe clothing industry long has drawn criticism for its wastefulness \u2013 and not just from the outside.\n\nTop American clothing designer Eileen Fisher is famous for calling her industry the second largest polluter in the world, behind only the oil industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really nasty business,\" she said at a 2015 event honoring her commitment to environmental causes. \"It\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nIndustry critics say much clothing is made from materials that cause harm to both people and the environment. Textile makers use water that often is contaminated with bleaches, solvents, acids, alkalis, dyes and resins.\n\nRELATED: REI sets new standards for sustainability of clothing it sells | Reebok pursues Earth-friendly sneakers | Retailers cash in on eco-friendly items\n\nNow the growing volume of clothing being churned out is multiplying the environmental harm. The typical person buys 60 percent more items of clothing each year than the typical person 15 years ago \u2013 and keeps them for about half as long, according to a report commissioned this year by Bellevue, Washington-based thrift store chain Savers.\n\nThere\u2019s been a concurrent surge in the volume of textiles being sent to landfills.\n\nSavers, a \u201cpurpose-driven\u201d company that advocates clothing recycling, says North Americans now are sending 12 million tons of textiles to landfills each year. The chain, which operates Value Village thrift stores throughout the United States and Canada, says 95 percent of the discarded items could be recycled.\n\nGrowing demand for more sustainable clothing is prompting a growing number of fashion brands and retail stores to make changes.\n\nThe global performance brand Under Armour began making NuTech shirts more than three years ago with REPREVE, a brand of recycled fiber made from recycled plastic bottles. The fiber, produced by North Carolina-based Unifi, has worked its way into 2.5 million shirts, diverting the equivalent of about 10 million plastic bottles from landfills, according to Unifi.\n\nOther brands that use REPREVE include Haggar and Patagonia.\n\nOn the retail side, outdoor gear and clothing seller REI this year established social, environmental and animal welfare standards that brands must meet if they want a place on its store shelves. The requirements include a ban on products that contain certain chemicals, a code of conduct for manufacturers, and animal welfare standards for down and wool supply chains.\n\nOutdoor gear and clothing seller REI this year established a set of social, environmental, and animal welfare standards that brands must meet if they want a place on its store shelves. (Photo: Aaron Leitz Photography)\n\nEileen Fisher has long been focused on sustainable clothing. The brand has embraced the use of sustainable fabrics, eco-friendly manufacturing and shipping, and end-of-life recycling for garments.\n\nThrough a program called Renew, Eileen Fisher has taken back more than 1 million garments from customers. It's using the material to create new designs.\n\nTaking back clothing at the end of their lifecycle is a growing trend in the industry. The global retailer H&M, GUESS and Columbia Sportswear have partnered with the textile recycler I:CO recently to take back old clothes from customers via collection at stores.\n\nI:CO processes the clothing for reuse, or recycles it into other products such as cleaning cloths, fibers for insulation or even new clothing.\n\nIn August, the fitness brand Reebok unveiled a new, entirely bio-based \u201cCotton + Corn\u201d line of footwear featuring cotton upper and soles made from a corn derivative instead of the petroleum-based synthetic rubber common in the industry.\n\nThe product is designed, in part, to keep petroleum-based products out of landfills. Reebok\u2019s long-term goal is to have a shoe that is fully compostable.\n\nBill McInnis is head of Reebok\u2019s Future Team, which focuses on creating new products and techniques.\n\n\u201cEvery athletic shoe on every shelf in Foot Locker or Finish Line or wherever you happen to go is made using petroleum products, and everybody knows that\u2019s not a sustainable material,\u201d McInnis says. \u201cThe idea was to replace the petroleum products with something that grows.\u201d\n\nMcInnis notes Reebok, like other companies, has tried developing and marketing eco-friendly products in the past, only to see little interest from consumers.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear now that the times have changed.

In early November, the company unveiled a second round of the \u201cCotton + Corn\u201d shoes with a twist: In addition to being bio-based, they\u2019re vegan, too.\n\nA tiny bit of vegetable-tanned leather that had been on the first version was replaced with a vegan-friendly material, McInnis says.\n\nMooney is documenting her \u201cOne Outfit, 100 Days\u201d project on Instagram. Her @oneoutfit100days account gives credit to fashion brands that are making it a mission to offer sustainable clothing.\n\nShe bought the dress at Thought Clothing, a London-based company that uses natural, organic and recycled fabrics including wool, hemp and wood pulp-based Tencel.\n\nThought, which calls it approach \u201cslow fashion,\u201d says the clothing is designed for long-term use. The company encourages customers to wear garments more than once before washing, to fix worn pieces and to find new users for unneeded or unwanted articles to give them a longer life.\n\nWhen teaching art at Moorestown, New Jersey's William Allen Middle School, art teacher Julia Mooney often covers her One Outfit, 100 Days project dress with an apron to keep it clean. (Photo: Gene Sloan, USA TODAY)\n\nMooney says consumers shy away from better-made clothing that will last longer because it costs more. But the thinking is flawed: Better-made clothing can end up being cheaper in the long run.\n\nMooney paid about $50 for her dress. Over the 100 days she\u2019ll wear it during the project, that works out to just 50 cents a day.\n\n\u201cBecause we have to wear something different every day, (we think) it can\u2019t be expensive,\" she says. \"So we buy more cheap clothing that isn\u2019t really high-quality, and that uses a lot of natural resources to produce. And then we throw it out.\u201d\n\nMooney says she buys used clothing from thrift stores and other venues to give them a second life. All of her three young children\u2019s clothing is bought used, she notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper, but even if it wasn't cheaper, I don\u2019t care, because I feel good that I\u2019m reusing something that\u2019s perfectly good,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd (the kids) don\u2019t care. They think they\u2019re perfectly new.\u201d\n\nMooney recently bought a sewing machine and is teaching herself to make her own clothes \u2013 something she says we all should do. She's also learned to knit.\n\nMooney thinks her middle school students are at the perfect age to start thinking about such issues.\n\n\u201cMiddle schoolers are trying to define themselves, to figure out their identity,\" she says. \"And just naturally \u2013 partly because of their age but also because of the culture \u2013 they are defining themselves and judging each other based on the brands that they are wearing.\u201d\n\nMooney didn\u2019t talk about the project with her students at the outset.\n\n\u201cI kind of let it go at the beginning to see who would notice and who would bring it up,\u201d she says. \u201cSome kids noticed on the second day, and some didn\u2019t notice at all.\u201d\n\nWhen she finally had a class discussion about the project a few weeks into the school year, she says, the students were very receptive.\n\n\u201cNone of them have reacted like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s so gross. You\u2019re so weird,\u201d she says, and laughs. \u201cSome of them understand it on a surface level, because they\u2019re 12. But I think even on a surface level the ideas are important, so whatever they\u2019re getting out of it I think is positive.\u201d\n\nStudent Nate Bunting says Mooney's example has prompted him to consider wearing the same clothes for more than one day in a row.\n\nNot for 100 days, though.\n\nMaybe \"for two,\" he says.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s really cool how she is doing it for a bigger cause,\" Bunting says.\n\nAdults in Mooney's world have been mostly on board, too, she says. A few have joined her in wearing the same outfit for 100 days.\n\nAmong them is Mooney's husband. Patrick Mooney, a teacher at nearby Moorestown High School, has been wearing the same khaki pants and dark blue shirt to classes since the school year began in September.\n\n\"It seemed like a pretty simple way of promoting something that most people probably overlook,\" says Patrick Mooney, 38. \"I was a little intimidated by the prospect of re-wearing the same thing every day, but it's really become quite simple.\"\n\nMoorestown High School teacher Beth Glennon was inspired by Mooney's project to create her own 100-day wardrobe challenge.\n\nWhen her triplet sons went off to college a few months ago, they left a closet full of shirts behind. Now she's wearing a different one of her boys' shirts to school every day.\n\n\"With so many clothes left behind, there was no need for me to do any back-to-school shopping,\" Glennon says. \"For me it's not just (about) wearing their hand-me-downs. It\u2019s a fun way to keep the boys on my mind instead of missing them every day.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m forced to clean out their closet.\"\n\nThe idea also has spread to Moorestown's George C. Baker Elementary School.\n\n\"I thought if there\u2019s a chance for me to be more sustainable, I\u2019m gonna take it,\" Baker student Sofia Rubich says.\n\nRubich, a 7-year-old at the grade school, decided to join Mooney in wearing the same outfit for 100 days after reading about her in a local paper.\n\n\"You shouldn't be buying new clothes when you should be using the ones you have,\" she says.\n\nShe thinks her effort is making an impact on the Earth.\n\n\"It was kind of hard when I started out, because you want to make your own ideas and let your style be free,\" she says. But \"then the fun part about it is that it is so easy to get dressed in the morning, and I can add my own style to it with leggings and different accessories. So my style still shines through.\"\n\nMoorestown, New Jersey second grader Sofia Rubich, 7, celebrates her 40th consecutive day wearing the same outfit to school as part of the One Outfit, 100 Days project. (Photo: Ana Cafengiu)\n\nBoth Rubich and Mooney say they do get one question about the project over and over.\n\n\"The first thing a lot of people ask me is, 'do you wash it?',\" Mooney says. She chuckles.\n\n\u201cOf course I wash it!\u201d\n\nShe often wears an apron over the dress in art class to protect it from stains. She wears other clothes on weekends.\n\n\u201cThis is not a project about hygiene,\u201d she says. \u201cI always come to work clean.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/21/teacher-julia-mooney-sustainable-fashion-one-outfit-100-days/1917538002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Cara Kelly and Jayne O'Donnell, USA TODAY", "title": "The murky truth of clean beauty: 'Natural' makeup labels are meaningless, experts say", "description": "Face masks with parabens?

Here\u2019s why that\u2019s the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nConsumer confusion around cosmetic ingredients has grown in recent years as the clean beauty movement gains momentum. (Photo: Colorblind, Getty Images)\n\nSkincare sets wrapped in millennial pink and eco-green are already filling Instagram ads this season, and with their pore-refining promises these would-be stocking-stuffers also draw attention to \u201ctoxic chemicals\" that\u2019ve been canceled by clean-living proponents in the last few years.\n\nFace masks with parabens? Don\u2019t even think about it, the gospel of Goop preaches. Body lotions with mineral oils? Definitely not on Beautycounter\u2019s \u201cnice\u201d list.\n\nBut trying to understand the rationale behind these decrees can be more complicated than applying liquid eyeliner in an airplane bathroom.\n\nExperts and industry veterans say the muddy reality of the billion-dollar clean beauty movement \u2013 which drove a 27 percent increase in skincare alone this year \u2013 is that terms such as \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d are essentially meaningless and unregulated, and the much-hyped health risks of several chemical ingredients are based on questionable data.\n\n\u201cThere is kind of a chemophobia in the U.S. \u2013 if it's a chemical, a man-made chemical, it must be bad,\" said Curtis Klaassen, former president of the Society of Toxicology and chair of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics at the Kansas University Medical Center.\n\nMore: The truth about talc, parabens and 8 other controversial makeup ingredients\n\nMore: 6 dubious clean beauty claims from Goop and Beautycounter, decoded\n\nThe Environmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit advocacy organization that\u2019s a leader of the clean cosmetics crusade, says that even if it\u2019s impossible to directly prove these ingredients cause cancer, people should believe the most pilloried chemicals are bad for you based on their review of research.\n\nNneka Leiba, EWG's director of healthy living science, argues that outside of smoking, there is rarely \"definitive proof\" that a chemical causes cancer, but there is an overall burden on the body from chemicals in personal care products. Some of these chemicals are also present in the environment, but at least with cosmetics \"you have the choice not to buy that product,\" she said.\n\nThat sensibility confounds those who say the adage \u201cthe dose makes the poison\u201d is one of the basic principles of toxicology. Klaassen compares it to the wind: Gusts of a few miles per hour are harmless, yet those reaching 100 mph can topple a house.\n\n\"The average person wants a yes/no for every chemical, and they don\u2019t think about the dose,\" Klaassen said. \"It turns out that 50 percent of the chemicals in the world we think are carcinogens if you're given enough.\"\n\nThe need for more regulation\n\nThe back and forth on ingredient safety has been enabled in part by the relative low levels of U.S. regulation on the cosmetics industry \u2013 something many industry veterans and activists alike deem problematic.\n\nFor Nicolette Leung, 32, who primarily buys natural products after starting a clean-living transition a few years ago, the difference between the more rigorous regulations of countries such as the European Union and those in the U.S. gave her pause. Leung says she's privileged to be able to make natural products a priority, though she says it hasn't necessarily made navigating beauty aisles any easier.\n\n\"Even with natural beauty products it's confusing,\" Leung said. \"I think the entire industry is confusing and opaque.\"\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there are no regulations around the term \u2018clean beauty,\u2019 \u201d said Paula Begoun, who launched cult-favorite beauty line Paula\u2019s Choice in 1995. \u201cIt typically means minimal to no synthetic ingredients and the absence of any ingredient deemed controversial, even if there\u2019s valid research attesting to the ingredient\u2019s safety as used in cosmetics.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees cosmetics, which legally must be safe for consumers to use as directed and properly labeled. Unlike food and drugs, however, they do not need FDA preapproval before going to market.\n\nMore: Retailer Justice yanks makeup that may contain asbestos\n\nMore: Pallone: FDA should probe for asbestos in makeup sold at Claire's, Justice\n\nGwyneth Paltrow's health and lifestyle brand Goop has entered the supplements world with a variety of curated pill packs. (Photo: Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Goop)\n\nClaims that companies are free to do whatever they want, legally filling products with known harmful ingredients, are not true. Certain ingredients are banned \u2013 lead acetate, which is found in some men's hair dyes, was added to that list late last month. And the FDA has long tracked reports on exposure and \"adverse event\" complaints on products, says Dr. Linda Katz, director of FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors.\n\n\"Most chemicals that have been used in cosmetics have a long history of safe use and have not been the subject of major concern,\" she said.\n\nThe cosmetics industry, through the Personal Care Products Council (PCPC), sought to help assuage consumer's concerns by creating the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) committee in 1976 in coordination with the FDA. The independent panel of scientists issues reports on safety risks, which are taken into consideration by the FDA and the industry. (Klaassen is a member of CIR.)\n\nCritics say that self-policing method is not enough. EWG and Breast Cancer Prevention Partners (BCPP) run websites with their own determinations on safety. And EWG, which was among the groups petitioning the FDA to ban lead acetate, points to the fact it took so long for the ban.\n\nThe Goop effect\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop, Jessica Alba\u2019s Honest Company and Beautycounter have made highly publicized movements away from synthetic ingredients to natural alternatives, touting never-use lists of a thousand or more. The strategy has backfired in some high-profile cases, most notably Alba's natural sunscreen that was widely panned because it didn't protect skin from burning and led to lawsuits, and her baby wipes and baby powder, which were recalled last year due to mold and contamination of microorganisms, respectively. Beautycounter also recalled it\u2019s Nourishing Day Cream due to bacteria last year.\n\nActress and Honest Company co-founder Jessica Alba (Photo: Mat Hayward, Getty Images for Nordstrom)\n\nMore: Jessica Alba\u2019s Honest Co. recalls organic baby powder\n\nMore: 10 mildly pretentious commandments from \u2018beauty bible\u2019 \u2018Goop Clean Beauty\u2019\n\nGoop and Beautycounter say they err on the side of caution with their products.\n\n\"We believe that you can make beautiful, efficacious products without customers needing to worry about unsafe levels of toxins in their products,\" said Susan Beck, Goop's senior vice president of science and research.\n\nLindsay Dahl, vice president of Social and Environmental Responsibility at Beautycounter, argues the demand for hard causation of cancer or hormone disruption is misguided.\n\n\"If there\u2019s opportunity for us to prevent exposure to some of these ingredients we should do everything we can to do so,\" Dahl says.\n\nMuch of the focus of clean beauty proponents such as Beautycounter has been on preservatives, namely parabens, a family of chemicals used to prevent the growth of mold or bacteria, and formaldehyde-releasers, a type of preservative that slowly releases a small amount of formaldehyde in products to kill or prevent the growth of bacteria and microorganisms.\n\nLinda Loretz, PCPC\u2019s chief toxicologist, says preservatives have an important safety function that\u2019s gotten lost in the discussion. Contamination is a frequent cause of recalls, she says.\n\n\u201cWithout them you would either be keeping products in the refrigerator or rebuying them all the time because you\u2019d be constantly throwing out contaminated products,\u201d Loretz said.\n\nThe FDA says there\u2019s no evidence of human harm from parabens in cosmetics, and CIR has repeatedly found formaldehyde-releasing preservatives to be safe in the very low percentages found in cosmetics. Yet almost all are on \"baddies\" lists, in industry parlance.\n\nJay Ansell, a chemist and board-certified toxicologist who serves as vice president of cosmetic programs at PCPC, says this discrepancy often results from organizations taking data developed for one application \u2013 such as morticians' use of formaldehyde \u2013 and applying it across the board.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really relevant in our opinion to a formaldehyde-releaser, which may result in a few parts per billion in a product, as opposed to an occupational exposure in high concentrations every day for a lifetime,\u201d Ansell said.\n\nConnie Engel, manager of science translation for BCPP, says it should all be taken into account when \u201cmaking a best guess of what is true but also what is potentially protective of people\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nFor consumers such as Leung, shopping decisions are more about peace of mind than a frenetic fear of disease.\n\n\"I kind of look at it as a similar analogy to cooking,\" Leong says. \"Maybe preservatives aren\u2019t going to kill you, but if I can know what all the ingredients are then that just makes me feel more secure.\"\n\nMore: 4 million Americans could be drinking toxic water and would never know\n\nMore: Retailer Claire's pulls makeup from its shelves over asbestos concerns\n\nDriving change: Women of color\n\nThere's industry-wide consensus on the potential harm of some ingredients, including hair-straightening products that release formaldehyde into the air when heated and specific uses of skin-bleaching agents. Those historically have affected women of color disproportionately compared to white women, in part because they are used in products that change hair and skin texture to conform with Western beauty standards.\n\nPart of the rise in natural beauty has been driven by communities of color looking outside mainstream beauty to brands tailored to their skin and hair types and by immigrant communities seeking products of cultural importance, which are often natural.\n\n\"There's a mythology of the Whole Foods soccer mom and affluent white women, but a lot of this is also driven by communities of color who are not necessarily affluent who are making really important choices for themselves and their families,\" said Christine Keihm, senior vice president of marketing for Nubian Heritage.\n\nNubian Heritage co-founders Richelieu Dennis, Nyema Tubman and Mary Dennis have focused their 20-year-old brand on things such as shea butter and African black soap common in their family home of Liberia. There's been a welcome uptick in research around those types of ingredients, making them easier to use in skincare products, said Ozohu Adoh, founder and CEO of Epara, a luxury skincare line tailored to women of color that recently launched in the U.S.\n\n\"The things that our African grandmothers told us, those kind of folklore or folktales, we now are starting to understand the scientific underpinnings of those claims they used to make,\" Adoh said.\n\nRoom for agreement\n\nThe benefit of research on all potential ingredients, and the need for more of it, is another unifier in the beauty world.\n\nThe FDA announced plans this month to conduct a web-based survey about allergens in cosmetics, with aims of helping the agency better understand consumer decisions, perceptions and allergen awareness.\n\nMost people \u201cwant to know what the facts are, and the problem is we don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d said Dr. Lynn A. Drake, a dermatology faculty member at Massachusetts General Hospital and lecturer at Harvard Medical School.\n\nDrake cites the need for more legitimate controlled clinical trials and transparency with ingredients. All of which goes a long way to clear up consumer confusion and build trust.\n\n\"It\u2019s easy to trivialize some things like cosmetics. Is your lipstick as important as the pill for your heart?\" she asks. \"But little do we know that down the line one of these products might have something in it that could harm you.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/11/21/clean-beauty-truth-talc-parabens-makeup-ingredients/1897128002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "Trump on Time's 2018 'Person of the Year': 'I can't imagine anybody else other than Trump'", "description": "\"I can't imagine anybody else other than Trump.

The 49ers are Raiders are racing for the top pick, and they\u2019re both in desperate need of an impact player who can wreak havoc on opposing quarterbacks off the edge. Neither Bosa\u2019s core muscle injury nor his decision to leave school early to prepare for the draft should keep him from being the top pick.\n\n2. Oakland Raiders | Quinnen Williams | DL | Alabama\n\nIf the Raiders miss out on Bosa, Clemson\u2019s Clelin Ferrell could make sense here, too. That said, I\u2019m not sold on Ferrell being good enough to justify passing on Williams, who has been the most disruptive player in all of college football this season. This year\u2019s EDGE class is fairly deep, and the Raiders have three more picks in the top 35, which means they can afford to prioritize value over need here.\n\n3. Arizona Cardinals | Jonah Williams | OT | Alabama\n\nThe Cards have their franchise quarterback in Josh Rosen, and now they need to improve the protection around him. There have been questions about Williams\u2019 length, but the rest of his skill set can overcome any measurements he may be lacking. He\u2019s far and away the top tackle prospect in this class, and the perfect fit for Arizona here.\n\n4. New York Jets | Clelin Ferrell | EDGE | Clemson\n\nThis is a pretty ideal scenario for the Jets, who land one of the draft\u2019s top prospects at one of their biggest positions of need. Ferrell\u2019s explosiveness and athleticism should make him a constant headache for opposing tackles, and he could make an immediate impact in the Big Apple.\n\n5. New York Giants | Justin Herbert | QB | Oregon\n\nNo matter where the Giants end up picking, they desperately need to find an eventual successor to Eli Manning. This year\u2019s quarterback class is still begging for a true front-runner, but the consensus at the moment still seems to favor Herbert, even if by default. Like most of this year\u2019s top passers, Herbert\u2019s consistency has been an issue, but all the tools are there.\n\n6. Jacksonville Jaguars | Will Grier | QB | West Virginia\n\nMuch like the Giants, the Jags need to move on from their current starting quarterback by replacing him with a top pick in this draft. Blake Bortles can\u2019t be trusted to take advantage of one of the league\u2019s best defenses, and though he\u2019s not the only problem on offense, he\u2019s the one that has the biggest impact. Grier is as worthy of a top-10 pick as any passer in this year\u2019s class.\n\n7. Tampa Bay Buccaneers | Greedy Williams | CB | LSU\n\nBucs fans might hate passing on Houston\u2019s Ed Oliver here, but this team needs a true No. 1 corner more than they need an interior defensive lineman, and Williams is the top cover man in this year\u2019s class. With Brent Grimes likely headed elsewhere (if not retirement) in 2019, Williams would join a promising young secondary, making life easier for Tampa Bay\u2019s struggling front seven.\n\n8. Buffalo Bills | Ed Oliver | DL | Houston\n\nThere are much bigger needs on offense, but there\u2019s not an offensive tackle or wide receiver still on the board worthy of passing on Oliver. He\u2019s been banged up for much of the 2018 season, and his heated sideline exchange with coach Major Applewhite could be a concern for some NFL decision-makers, but there\u2019s no denying his rare talent and limitless potential.\n\n9. Cleveland Browns | Deandre Baker | CB | Georgia\n\nAnother team that could use an upgrade at offensive tackle, the Browns will find much better value elsewhere. It already looks like they hit a grand slam with Denzel Ward in last year\u2019s draft, but they still need to upgrade the other corner spot. Baker is a talented playmaker in his own right, and would give the Browns a dynamic young tandem at a premium position.\n\n10. Philadelphia Eagles | Raekwon Davis | DL | Alabama\n\nFletcher Cox is still among the league\u2019s elite defensive linemen, but the rest of his unit has lost much of its depth and punch. Davis is a massive force one one of the nation\u2019s most dominant defensive fronts, and he\u2019s still just barely scratching the surface of his lofty potential."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Prosecutor requests arrest of Peru soccer federation head", "description": "A Peruvian prosecutor has requested the arrest of the president of the country's soccer federation in a case that links him to two murders", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/21/prosecutor-requests-arrest-of-peru-soccer-federation-head/38578657/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:05:11Z", "content": "LIMA, Peru (AP) A Peruvian prosecutor has requested the arrest of the president of the country's soccer federation in a case that links him to two murders.

It's always been some take on Santa, Well, what about Saint Nicholas, the guy?\u201d Russell says. \u201cHe's now living in modern times in the North Pole, but one night a year, he comes out. Let's face it, the guy knows when you're asleep or when you're awake.

This could be unbelievably bad.\" But it worked, and it changed the path of my career as it were. And now it's the opposite: \"Kurt Russell? Hey, yeah!\" A lot of things in between made that possible but, yes, I agree with you.\n\nQ: Is it a trip playing a Santa who has to do his thing in the digital age?\n\nRussell: He\u2019s out there with a purpose and it's not just to give gifts away. He's got an issue with lost believers. It's an interesting dynamic that just around your teenage years, when you stop believing in Santa Claus, your life becomes much more complicated. But perhaps it has nothing to do with innocence. You had no problem believing at one time. It was totally real to you. So when you're faced with seeing the real person, it's back.\n\nYour ultimate Thanksgiving movie guide: A slam dunk for every holiday scenario\n\nPreview: 10 movies you must see this holiday season, from 'Fantastic Beasts' to 'Mary Poppins'\n\nQ: What was important to you about finding the right look?\n\nRussell: You have to look at it from the point of view of the two kids. When they see Santa Claus, he should look like the iconic image but slightly different, more workman-like, more lumberjack-y, if you will. I always felt there was a little Captain Morgan to this guy, got a little pirate to him. And then I knew that we'd be doing a lot of stuff with wind and whatnot so it had to be my beard primarily.

When I was on the set, parents and kids would wander by and little kids would inevitably stare at me. In between takes, I'd motion for them, and as the kids would come over, their eyes would drop.

I was mindful of the fact that if we were not careful, he would be a caricature.\u201d\n\nBana has also \"played worse, for sure,\u201d says the actor, who starred as the military policeman jailed for committing atrocities in 2017's \u201cThe Forgiven.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t restrain myself in that regard.\u201d\n\nBritton found Newell \u201cuniversally relatable\" because \"the idea of a con man being able to be that effective in somebody\u2019s life, to me that feels really resonant right now, in the culture where we\u2019re doing a lot of questioning about what\u2019s the truth.\"\n\nConnie Britton and Eric Bana are in character, arm-in-arm on the set of \"Dirty John.\" (Photo: Bravo)\n\nTo get the nuances of her protagonist just right, she went straight to the source, even calling her during filming to understand her motivation. \u201cDebra was very generous with her time,\u201d Britton says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that classic thing where sometimes the quality that is the most wonderful and lovely is the quality that can be the most destructive,\u201d Britton says of Newell, who was too trusting of Meehan when even her family members warned he didn't seem genuine. \u201cHer generosity of spirit, (that) she always sees the best in everyone, is beautiful and also got her into trouble.\u201d\n\nThe four-times-divorced Newell meets Meehan online and is smitten with the man in dirty scrubs who regales her with stories (mostly falsified) of his work as a doctor and injuries sustained in Iraq. She doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s just one of several women Meehan has scammed.

You\u2019re going to make life even more difficult for the real nice guys out there.\u2019\"\n\nAdds Britton, 50: \u201cI have lots of friends who have done online dating.

Its goals were to boost exports, remove tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and open access to more markets.\n\nIt was a turn toward protectionist measures. By abandoning a deal that would give American companies an opportunity to seek cheap labor abroad, Trump signaled that his priority is to reduce the number of jobs leaving the country.\n\nIn a memorandum announcing the move, Trump favored bilateral negations and said they were to be pursued whenever possible to \u201cpromote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages.\u201d\n\nThe Paris Agreement\n\nOn June 1, 2017, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, an international climate accord that the U.S. signed under the Obama administration that aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which come from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.\n\nTrump cited \"onerous energy restriction\u201d on the U.S. and the possible job losses it could cost as reasons for dropping out of the deal. Industrial sectors such as cement, coal, and iron and steel, Trump said, could be affected by America\u2019s inclusion in the accord. He said there were plans to begin negotiations to reenter the deal or enter an \u201centirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.\"\n\nTrump said the deal \"punishes the United States,\" which he claimed was the world leader in environmental protection, without imposing any \"meaningful obligations\" on the world's leading polluters. Historically, the U.S. has ranked as one of the worst emitters of carbon dioxide, but it\u2019s been noted as recently as this year that its contribution to CO2 levels globally has been on the decline.\n\nAfter Syria signed on to the accord in 2017, the U.S. became the only country in the world that wasn\u2019t a party to the landmark deal.\n\nThe Iran Deal\n\nThroughout the 2016 presidential election campaign, then-candidate Trump promised that once he was in office he would tear up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran \u2014 better known as the Iran nuclear deal. The president called it the \u201cworst deal ever.\u201d Pushed into passage by the Obama Administration, the Iran nuclear deal reduced economic sanctions against Iran as long as the country ended its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn May, the White House announced that because the JCPOA \u201cfailed to protect America's national security interests\" it would be pulling out of the historic deal.\n\nThe White House accused the Iranian regime of archiving its past nuclear weapons work and continuing to enrich uranium and develop ballistic missiles. The administration left some room for a new deal to be struck but said that a return to the negotiating table would depend on a number of preconditions such as the Iranian regime completely abandoning their intent to develop nuclear weapons\u2014something Trump alleges they never stopped pursuing.\n\nIn the meantime, the administration has renewed sanctions against Iran. These measures, according to the White House, would target several of the country\u2019s economic sectors such as energy, petrochemical, and finance.\n\nUNESCO\n\nIn Oct. 2017, the State Department announced that the U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO, which serves a number of functions around the globe such as promoting literacy and protecting historic and cultural sites through the World Heritage Centre.\n\nIt was a symbolic gesture on part of the Trump administration, seeing as the Obama White House cut off funding for UNESCO in 2011, after the group voted to include Palestine as a member. The reasons the State Department gave for leaving the organization include what it views as mounting debt within the organization, a need for \u201cfundamental reform,\u201d and continuing bias against Israel.\n\nMexican President Enrique Pena Nieto takes a selfie with the next negotiator of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Jesus Seade Kuri (R) during the 17th Mexico Business Summit 'Facing the strategic challenges of Mexico and the Region', at the Guadalajara Expo, in Jalisco, Mexico, Monday.

(Photo: Francisco Guasco/EPA-EFE)\n\nNAFTA\n\nOn Aug. 27, President Trump ended nearly 25 years of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, the trade pact linking U.S., Canada, and Mexico. He announced a new, bilateral agreement with Mexico known as the U.S.-Mexico Trade Agreement.\n\nCanada was initially left out of the new deal, which was designed to replace the NAFTA, an agreement that Trump says carried bad connotations. Signed in 1993, NAFTA eliminated tariffs on most goods traded among the continent's three largest countries and made it easier for companies in those countries to move goods across borders. The old trade pact is often blamed for the flight of U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico and the deindustrialization of the American economy.\n\nThe new deal includes controversial stipulations such as the \u201crule of origin,\u201d which requires that cars must be built with at least 75 percent parts made in North America (up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA) and that 40 to 45 percent of an automobile must be manufactured by employees earning at least $16 an hour.\n\nIn September, little more than a month after the U.S. and Mexico struck their deal, Canada announced it was joining the agreement. The text of the new deal is expected to be signed by the end of November.\n\nTRUMP USMCA (Photo: WHITE HOUSE)\n\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty\n\nOn Oct. 20, Trump announced to reporters his intention to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a 1987 pact between the United States and Russia that required both countries to destroy ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of between 310 and 3,400 miles, along with any supporting equipment.\n\nTrump claims that Russia has violated the Cold War-era treaty, set to expire in two years, and said that the U.S. will begin weapons development unless Russia and China\u2014who is not a party to the pact\u2014agree to a new deal.\n\nDays after the announcement, White House National Security Advisor John Bolton met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin and said there was no chance the Trump administration would reverse its decision. Bolton suggested the INF treaty was outmoded.\n\n\"There's a new strategic reality out there,\" Bolton said. \"This is a cold war bilateral ballistic-missile-related treaty \u2014 in a multipolar ballistic-missile world.\"\n\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council\n\nCalling it a \"cesspool of political bias,\" Nikki Haley, then-Ambassador to the United Nations, announced in June that the United States was pulling out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, leaving the U.S. without a vote and sidelined from the Geneva-based group that aims to promote human rights around the world.\n\nThe Trump administration made the move amid criticism surrounding its practice of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border. The Human Rights Council called on the White House to end the practice because it \"runs counter to human rights standards.\"\n\nUNRWA\n\nIn August, the Trump Administration said that it would halt U.S. contributions to the United Nations\u2019 aid program for Palestinian refugees. The decision is part of the administration\u2019s efforts to rein in foreign aid and restrict assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. The move came one week after the White House revoked more than $200 million in economic aid to the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe U.S. is \"no longer willing to shoulder the very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA\u2019s costs,\" said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, referring to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. The U.N. agency provides health care to approximately 3 million Palestinians, education assistance to 500,000 children, micro-loans to another 400,000 beneficiaries, among other aid.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/21/donald-trump-foreign-policy-iran-nafta-russia-mexico-canada-trade/1732952002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "'Trippy' psychedelic jellyfish spotted by underwater researchers", "description": "NOAA researchers spotted a unique medusa jellyfish hovering above the seafloor with its stinging tentacles extended off the coast of Puerto Rico.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/have-you-seen/video/2018/11/21/trippy-psychedelic-jellyfish-spotted-underwater-researchers/2077010002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/e02a4ec9-2b29-4962-b7ec-6e75baaad098-VPC_PYSCHADELIC_JELLYFISH_wide_noaa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:57:43Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, David Jackson, USA TODAY", "title": "President Trump thanks Saudis for lower oil prices, a day after he defended kingdom over Khashoggi murder", "description": "The thank-you tweet came a day after Trump said he saw no reason to hold the Saudis accountable for the death of Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/21/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi/2076902002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/d150f270-c757-4816-8e21-ab653908054b-AP_Trump_15.JPG?crop=5043,2832,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:53:45Z", "content": "President Donald Trump defended his decision not to punish Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or cut arms sales to Saudi Arabia for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. insisting it would be \"foolish\" to cut ties.

Unlike food and drugs, cosmetics do not have to be approved before going to market and recalls are voluntary.\n\nHowever, claims that companies are allowed to do whatever they want are misleading.\n\nIt\u2019s against the law for a cosmetic to contain any ingredient that makes it harmful for customers when used according to directions on the label, or in a way that should reasonably be expected by consumers.\n\nThe FDA regulates cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), passed in 1938 and 1967, respectively. Under the law, adulterated or misbranded cosmetics are prohibited. That includes:\n\nif a cosmetic or its packaging \"contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to users under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling thereof, or under conditions of use as are customary and usual\"\n\nif a cosmetic \"consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance\"\n\nif a cosmetic \"has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health\"\n\nThe FDA can pursue enforcement action through:\n\nthe Department of Justice in the federal court system to remove adulterated and misbranded cosmetics from the market\n\na federal district court to issue a restraining order against manufacturers or distributors to prevent further shipments of an adulterated or misbranded product\n\nseizing cosmetics that are not in compliance with the law\n\ninspections of cosmetic manufacturing facilities to assure cosmetic product safety and determine whether cosmetics are adulterated or misbranded\n\nThe FDA has specifically prohibited or restricted the use of certain ingredients. See the full list here.\n\nGoop\u2019s senior vice president of science and research, Susan Beck, points to the fact that there's been little change since the FD&C Act was passed as a reason they've worked with advocacy groups promoting more regulation.\n\n\"It has had iterations of amendments since, but cosmetics regulations have been largely unchanged,\" Beck said.\n\nLindsay Dahl, Beautycounter's vice president of social and environmental responsibility, says the point is that compared to other consumer industries, beauty and personal care is one of the least regulated.\n\n\"A broken beauty industry is not because the FDA is bad, it's because Congress hasn\u2019t passed regulation to give them authority in the same way.\"\n\nClaim: The U.S. has regulated a fraction of ingredients banned in the EU\n\nOver the past two decades, the European Union has banned close to 1,400 chemicals in the product formulas of personal care products and restricted the levels of over 250 more in such products. The United States has only partially banned 30 to date. - Beautycounter\n\nThe EU has restricted or banned more ingredients from use in cosmetics than the U.S. But the comparison is misleading, says Linda Loretz, chief toxicologist at the Personal Care Products Council.\n\n\"The way their chemical regulation works, when things hit a certain list they are banned in cosmetics. That doesn\u2019t mean they were ever used or ever considered or even appropriate for cosmetics, like industrial byproducts and jet fuel,\" Loretz says. \"That\u2019s why the number is so very, very high.\"\n\nLoretz says that while there are a few ingredients banned by the EU that have some limited use in the U.S., most big cosmetic companies have international formulas so they can be sold across markets and therefore do not have many differences.\n\nOne common misconception is that the EU bans parabens and phthalates. The most common types of parabens (methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and ethylparaben) in cosmetics are allowed in certain percentages in cosmetics in the EU Similarly, the most common phthalate used in cosmetics and personal care products, diethyl phthalate (DEP), has been reviewed by the Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS), the EU Commission\u2019s independent panel of experts, which approved its safety.\n\n\"There has been a large amount of media attention surrounding the safety of parabens, however there has been no causal link found between the use of parabens and breast cancer,\" says Emma Meredith, director of science for the Toiletry & Perfumery Association a U.K. trade group. In January 2005, the SCCS \"came to the conclusion that in light of current knowledge there was no demonstrable risk for the development of breast cancer caused by the use of underarm cosmetics including those containing parabens.\"\n\nDahl acknowledges that ingredients on EU's list may not be regularly used in cosmetics.\n\n\"I don't think that diminishes or negates the fact that the EU and Canada passed stronger and more consumer-friendly pieces of legislation than the United States,\" she said.\n\nClaim: Antifreeze in moisturizers\n\nDo you want antifreeze (propylene glycol) in your moisturizer? We\u2019re going to guess no. - Goop\n\nMichael Holsapple, founding director of the Center for Research on Ingredient Safety at Michigan State University and a past president of the Society of Toxicologists, says the clear answer to Goop's rhetorical question is no. But the reality is it's already in most people's bodies. Propylene glycol is generally recognized as safe as a flavor additive in food by the FDA.\n\n\"Antifreeze is going to be picked up in practically any human being in the U.S. that has any bodily fluid analyzed,\" Holsapple said. \"The presence doesn\u2019t really mean a whole lot.\"\n\nHolsapple says it all goes back to the dose \u2014 it is not considered harmful in the small amounts found in cosmetics.\n\n\"The lack of transparency and enforcement means that consumers can\u2019t know how much propylene glycol they\u2019re putting on their skin,\" Beck said. \"And since most consumers use multiple products a day, this combined exposure makes it hard for us to know how much propylene glycol we\u2019re exposing our skin to, so here at Goop, we avoid it along with other ingredients linked to health hazards.\"\n\nClaim: Skin absorbs the majority of what's put on it\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe artificial fragrances and synthetic dyes should be used in personal care products at all: The skin absorbs over 60% of what\u2019s placed on it.\u201d - Juice Beauty CEO Karen Behnke via Goop\n\nCurt Klaassen, former president of the Society of Toxicology and chair of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics at the Kansas University Medical Center, says that supposed rate of absorption is incorrect.\n\n\"It's a scientific misstatement. Nobody that knows anything about absorption of any kind of chemicals through the skin would say that 60 percent would get through the skin,\" Klaassen says. \"What would happen if we take a shower, if 60 percent of water went through the skin? We\u2019d never take a shower again.\"\n\nBeck says dermal absorption rates vary based on multiple factors, but one study (from 1984), found that it may be higher than we expect.\n\nEach day, the average American woman uses about a dozen personal care products containing more than 100 chemicals that we ingest, inhale, and absorb through our skin, so they end up inside us. - Goop\n\nKlaassen says there's significantly less reason for concern about absorption of cosmetics than things we ingest like food and drugs.\n\n\"If you think back a little bit, to general biology, why do we have skin? The reason we have skin is to separate us from our environment. So it turns out that things, chemicals, don\u2019t go across the skin very easily,\" he says. \"So that's quite in contrast to the intestine. The intestine is made for the absorption of chemicals.\"\n\nHe says some chemicals do get through the skin, but most are eliminated quickly.\n\n\"Just because you find it in the body, does not mean that it has accumulated over a long period of time.\"\n\nClaim: The FDA doesn't limit lead in lipstick\n\nLead, aluminum, cadmium (a groundwater contaminant that\u2019s found in breast cancer tumors and known to be carcinogenic), and other heavy metals are regularly found in lipstick; the FDA doesn\u2019t have a set limit on how much lead can be in a given lipstick, and its recent (2007, 2009, and 2012) studies actually show an increase in the amount of lead present. - Goop\n\nThe FDA has issued guidance to the industry on limiting lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics to a maximum of 10 parts per million. The FDA analyzed lipsticks and other cosmetics in 2007, and expanded its analysis to several hundred 2010, and found that more than 99 percent contained less than 10 parts per million.\n\nBeck points to the fact the FDA set the limit after the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics \"brought the lead issue to light, and what it offers today is guidance, as opposed to enforcement.\"\n\nClaim: Low doses and rising risks\n\nFor example, current science tells us that even low doses of certain chemicals can contribute to cancer, birth defects, learning disabilities and other health problems that are on the rise. - Goop\n\nThe National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society have found that rates of cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths continue to decline each year, though it is still a leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n\"I can tell you there is more carcinogen in the water you drink than the cosmetics you put in your skin,\" Klaassen said. \"So if you try to avoid being exposed to any carcinogen you\u2019re going to have a tough life.\"\n\nWith billions spent on clean beauty this year alone, some people, it seems, are up to the challenge.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/11/21/goop-beautycounter-juice-beauty-toxic-claims-truth/1983333002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Mistakes income earners should avoid in order to be wealthier", "description": "Having a moderate income doesn\u2019t mean you have lesser chances to save money, but it does mean that in order to do so you have to do more planning and be more patient than a high-income earner of course!

Ehlinger hurt his shoulder in last week's win over Iowa State, but coach Tom Herman was hopeful that he would be able to play against the Jayhawks.

(Photo: Hani Mohammed, AP)\n\nSANAA, Yemen \u2013 An estimated 85,000 children under age 5 may have died of hunger and disease since the outbreak of Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015, an international aid group said Wednesday.\n\nSave the Children based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in young children. The U.N. says more than 1.3 million children have suffered from SAM since a Saudi-led coalition went to war with Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in March 2015.\n\nThe group said its \u201cconservative estimate\u201d was that 84,701 children may have died, based on historical studies that find that 20 to 30 percent of untreated cases lead to death. It says it calculated the figure based on the number of cases reported in areas where aid groups were unable to intervene.\n\n\u201cFor every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it\u2019s entirely preventable,\u201d said Tamer Kirolos, Save the Children\u2019s Yemen director. \u201cChildren who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop.\u201d\n\nMore: Trump administration to curtail military support for Saudi-led war in Yemen\n\nMore: \u2018Stop starving people as instrument of war.' One Republican\u2019s blunt message to Saudis \u2014 and Trump\n\nThe war has given rise to the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Three-quarters of Yemen\u2019s people require life-saving assistance and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the fighting.\n\nSave the Children blamed the widespread starvation on a Saudi-led blockade that was tightened a year ago after the Iran-aligned rebels fired a ballistic missile at the Saudi capital, Riyadh.\n\nThe charity also cited recent fighting in and around the port city of Hodeida, a lifeline through which Yemen imports some 70 percent of its food and humanitarian aid.\n\nIt said commercial imports through the rebel-held port have fallen by more than 55,000 metric tons a month \u2013 enough to meet the needs of 4.4 million people. Save the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the northern Yemen through the southern port of Aden, slowing aid deliveries.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/21/yemen-children-hunger/2076683002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "'I bet you'd be on my side if I had killed a journalist': Michelle Wolf claps back at Trump", "description": "Michelle Wolf was far from the only person on Twitter deriding President Donald Trump for his response to columnist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/11/21/reactions-trump-statement-khashoggi-murder/2076801002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/7117ba17-5487-4976-b03a-d2e10d6cf14f-GTY_1038083266.JPG?crop=4495,2528,x0,y270&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:24:37Z", "content": "President Donald Trump defended his decision not to punish Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or cut arms sales to Saudi Arabia for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. insisting it would be \"foolish\" to cut ties.

Mississippi State is trying to improve its bowl resume while Ole Miss is trying to finish with a .500 record. The Rebels are ineligible for postseason play because of NCAA sanctions.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nThe Ole Miss passing game vs. Mississippi State's defense. Ole Miss has the most productive passing game in the SEC, averaging more than 364 yards through the air. QB Jordan Ta'amu's favorite target is WR A.J. Brown, who ranks fifth nationally with 1,259 yards receiving. Mississippi State counters with the SEC's best pass defense, giving up just 165.3 yards per game. The Bulldogs also have some of the best defensive linemen in the league with DE Montez Sweat and DT Jeffery Simmons.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nMississippi State: QB Nick Fitzgerald.

The 6-foot-5, 230-pounder is fifth in the SEC with 901 yards rushing this season.\n\nOle Miss: RB Scottie Phillips. If he's healthy, Phillips could give the Rebels a run-game boost.

Utah State survived a scare last week at Colorado State when a desperation touchdown on the final play by the Rams was nullified by a penalty and the Aggies escaped with a 29-24 win. Boise State has won six straight.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nUtah State QB Jordan Love vs. Boise State's defense. Colorado State proved a week ago it's possible to slow down the Aggies. The 29 points scored by Utah State its second fewest all season \u2014 it had scored at least 30 in every game \u2014 and had topped 60 in two of the three previous games. Love has been the leader of that offense, but he was limited to 169 yards passing against Colorado State a week after throwing for 491 yards. Boise State's defense has been stingy enough since giving up 38 points in a win over Air Force. But the Broncos have shown they can be vulnerable to the pass.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nUtah State: RB Darwin Thompson. He doesn't get a ton of carries, but when Thompson does he has a knack for big plays. Thompson has 14 rushing touchdowns on 121 carries this season.\n\nBoise State: QB Brett Rypien.

It's the second time in three seasons the Apple Cup decides the North Division champ. Washington has won five straight over its rivals and the last three have not been close with the Huskies outscoring the Cougars 131-41. But it's been a magical season on the Palouse led by QB Gardner Minshew, the national leader in passing, and coming off a record-setting seven-touchdown performance last week against Arizona.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nWashington State's pass game vs. Washington's secondary. Since coach Chris Petersen has arrived at Washington he's found the recipe for slowing down Washington State's Air Raid offense. The Cougars have not scored more than 20 points against the Huskies since a 31-28 overtime win in 2012, largely because Washington has shut down the passing game. Minshew is averaging 393.2 yards per game, but will face his biggest defensive test of the season as the Huskies are allowing 192.8 yards per game through the air.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nWashington: RB Myles Gaskin. The senior needs 94 yards rushing to become the first player in Pac-12 history with four 1,000-yard rushing seasons in his career.\n\nWashington State: RBs James Williams and Max Borghi. Washington State's run game is having some of its best success since Leach's arrival, but Williams and Borghi's true danger is as receivers out of the backfield. Williams has a team-high 69 receptions for 530 yards, while Borghi has another 40 catches for 303 yards.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nThird straight year and eighth time all-time both teams are ranked in The AP Top 25. ...

(Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAfter a tumultuous postseason, Manny Machado is doing his best to answer lingering questions that hang over his free agency.\n\nMachado was criticized during the National League Championship Series for not running out a ground ball, which he later explained by saying, \"I'm not the type of player that's going to be 'Johnny Hustle' and run down the line and slide to first base.\"\n\nWith Machado on the open market for the first time in his career, critics have used the comment against him. In an interview with MLB.com published Wednesday, the 26-year-old clarified what he was trying to say at the time.\n\n\"When I was asked that question, I was definitely on the defensive, and I was wrong to answer it the way that I did, because looking back, it doesn't come across how I meant it,\" Machado said.\n\n\"For me, I was trying to talk about how I'm not the guy who is eye wash. There's a difference between fake hustle for show and being someone who tries hard to win. I've always been the guy who does whatever he can to win for his team.\"\n\nMORE MLB:\n\nThe original \"Johnny Hustle\" line raised eyebrows, but it was taken a bit out of context. Machado admitted at the time that he should have run the ground ball out and that it looked \"terrible.\"\n\nMachado can see how his comments were misinterpreted and plans to explain himself during meetings with potential suitors.\n\n\"I know how I said it and how that came across, and it's something I take responsibility for. I look forward to talking with each GM and owner that we meet with about that, or any other questions they have.\"\n\nIt's an issue that's already come up, with Yankees owner Hank Steinbrenner stating that Machado's comments were \"troubling\" but the club would let him explain himself.\n\n\"If we\u2019re interested in any player, to sit down with them face to face and ask him, 'Where did this come from?

Melissa Rorech, Reviewed.com\n\nOver the past decade, Roku has helped millions of users join the streaming video movement.\n\nNow, the Los Gatos, California-based media company wants to connect its consumers with better sound.\n\nRoku has just begun shipping new wireless speakers, specially designed to work with Roku TVs. Regularly priced at $199.99 a pair, the speakers are available now at Roku.com for $149.99 through Cyber Monday.\n\nThe two speakers come with a Roku TV Voice Remote and the Roku Touch tabletop remote you can use to control the TV when you aren't sitting on the couch.\n\nEconomically priced Roku TVs, made by makers such as TCL, Hisense and Sharp, capture about 25 percent of all smart TV sales, too, according to research firm IHS Markit.\n\nRoku TV Wireless Speakers, regularly priced at $199.99, will be available at a Black Friday price of $149.99 through Cyber Monday, November 26 at www.Roku.com. The speakers come with a Roku TV Voice Remote and the Roku Touch, which has press-to-talk microphone that makes it easier to control your TV when you\u2019re not directly in front of it. (Photo: Roku)\n\nMore: Black Friday 2018: Best Buy's ad is a must-see for electronics gifts\n\nMore: The best pre-Black Friday deals you can get right now\n\nBut to achieve those attractive prices \u2013 for example, a 55-inch 4K HDR model Black Friday-priced at less than $400 \u2013 manufacturers must make some sacrifices, and speakers are a popular target. So, a strategy to bring better sound to Roku TVs makes sense.\n\nRoku's easy-to-use approach has helped it remain the dominant net device maker with about one-third of all those who watch net-delivered TV using a Roku device, more than use Amazon, Google or Apple TV devices, according to market tracking firm eMarketer.\n\nThe new Roku TV speakers do not stray from that simple-to-set-up approach. After plugging both of the 7.7-inch-tall speakers into a power outlet, you simply go into the Settings menu on your Roku TV and add a device. (You will do the same for the Touch remote, too).\n\nThat completes a wireless connection between the TV and speakers and, subsequently, the sound automatically emerges from the paired speakers. (Remember, these only work with Roku TVs, so if you are looking for wireless speakers to supplement any other TV look elsewhere.)\n\nImproved sound definitely boosts overall enjoyment of TV watching. In place of the flat sound field emitted by the TV's own speaker, the Roku TV speakers created a dynamic soundscape that added urgency and dimensionality to the battle royal that wrapped up the third season of \"Marvel's Daredevil.\"\n\nThe speakers' richer, more accurate sound brought more bounce to an NBA game and added majesty of the ice dragon's assault on the Wall in \"Game of Thrones.\" Watching news programming also benefited from the better, crisper sound.\n\nRoku TV Wireless Speakers, regularly priced at $199.99, will be available at a Black Friday price of $149.99 through Cyber Monday, November 26 at www.Roku.com. The speakers come with a Roku TV Voice Remote and the Roku Touch, which has press-to-talk microphone that makes it easier to control your TV when you\u2019re not directly in front of it.

Since it's wireless, you can place it anywhere nearby, such as the kitchen. You can use your voice to give the Roku TV commands such as \"Turn on classic rock\" to launch music on Spotify, or to launch radio news app TuneIn. You can store frequently used voice commands in the remote's two preset buttons.\n\nThere's plenty of strategies to evolve a home theater around your Roku TV, including soundbars and speakers from well-regarded companies such as Sonos, Bose and TV makers such as LG, Samsung and Sony.\n\nBut Roku undercuts most of the speaker competition at this sub-$200 price point. And the Roku TV speakers' easy setup and performance should make the speakers a sound investment for current customers.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/21/roku-wireless-speakers-bring-bigger-sound-roku-tvs/2026089002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Michael Collins, USA TODAY", "title": "Food fight: Trade deal between Mexico, European Union creates stink for U.S. cheese makers", "description": "Other countries are negotiating new trade agreements without the United States, often with costly consequences for American companies.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/21/trade-war-other-countries-forge-new-trade-agreements-without-u-s/1694283002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0af2024aad0c49c86cd4e2f9bab1643900ce344e/c=0-5-800-457/local/-/media/2016/01/07/WIGroup/Sheboygan/635877857471559568-Sartori-Cheese-Wheels.png?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:08:28Z", "content": "Labeling restrictions included in a new trade deal between Mexico and the European Union mean that some popular U.S.-made cheeses, including asiago, parmesan and feta, must be sold under a different name in Mexico.

(Photo: Photo courtesy John Mitchell)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The asiago cheese sitting on the shelves in Mexico still looks the same as it has for years.\n\nThe wheels and the wedges are the same. The familiar packaging is the same. What\u2019s different is the name.\n\nIn Mexico, asiago cheese can no longer be labeled and sold as asiago unless it comes from the alpine region of northern Italy where the mild, nutty-flavored formaggio originated.\n\nThe labeling restrictions are part of a new trade deal that Mexico signed in April with the European Union \u2013 one of several trade pacts that countries around the globe have been pursuing with each other, often with ramifications for U.S. companies.\n\nOther nations have been driven to form their own trade pacts in part, analysts say, because of the Trump administration\u2019s focus on slapping tariffs on imports and updating a 25-year-old agreement with Canada and Mexico instead of negotiating new deals that would expand markets for U.S. goods.\n\nThe European Union has been particularly aggressive \u2013 signing new deals with Mexico and Canada, finalizing another agreement with Japan and announcing plans to hold separate talks with Australia and China. But other countries also are pursuing deals of their own.\n\n\u201cMost of these countries continue to view trade as beneficial to their economic growth, to job creation and to attract direct foreign investment,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a top official in the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office under President Barack Obama.\n\nBut many also \u201care trying to reduce their dependence on the United States now, viewing the U.S. as an unreliable trading partner,\u201d she said.\n\nTrade deals that exclude the U.S. can still have costly consequences for U.S. companies. Hence, the asiago imbroglio.\n\nBlocks of cheese make its way from the conveyor to be packed at Sartori Cheese in Wisconsin. (Photo: T'xer Zhon Kha/USA TODAY NETWORK-WISCONSIN)\n\n\u201cWe make asiago, we sell asiago, we\u2019ve done that in Mexico for years,\u201d said Blair Wilson of Sartori Cheese, a family-owned company in Plymouth, Wisconsin, that makes asiago, parmesan and artisanal cheeses and exports them to 49 countries around the world.\n\nBut the asiago that Sartori exports to Mexico now must be sold under a different name because of labeling restrictions under the new trade agreement between Mexico and the European Union.\n\nThe restrictions are part of a global push by the EU to stop foreign products from being sold under a name identified with a particular region in Europe, in the same way that a bottle of sparkling wine can be labeled champagne only if it comes from the Champagne region of France.\n\nSartori now markets the asiago that it sells in Mexico as \u201cSartiago\u201d \u2013 a hybrid of asiago and the company brand.\n\nIt\u2019s the same cheese that has been on store shelves, restaurant menus and dinner tables for years. But Sartori\u2019s sales of asiago, or \u201cSartiago,\u201d have fallen in Mexico by 20 to 30 percent since spring, when the new labeling took effect.\n\nConsumer confusion\n\nConsumers are confused by the new name, Wilson said. He blames the EU for demanding that the labeling restrictions apply to names commonly used around the world, such as asiago, parmesan and feta.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing is trying to go against decades of trademark law, forcing us and others who have created these markets in other countries to try to come up with a new name for what is the standard product,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nOther U.S. dairy producers agree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d said Jaime Castaneda, senior vice president of trade policy for the U.S. Dairy Export Council and the National Milk Producers Federation. \u201cIt\u2019s all about (the Europeans) being noncompetitive, trying to take away the markets that others have created \u2013 not the Italians, not the French \u2013 the markets that others have created. And they want to take that away.\u201d\n\nThe competitive pressures on U.S. companies may grow even worse as other countries bypass the U.S. and forge trade deals of their own.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 11 remaining countries, including Canada, Japan, Australia, Vietnam and New Zealand, decided to go ahead with the trade agreement on their own. The countries, which represent 13 percent of the global economy, signed the new deal in March.\n\n\u201cI think there was profound shock and disappointment and a view that they can\u2019t rely on the United States, but they got over their disappointment and shock and banded together to go ahead with the agreement without us,\u201d said Cutler, who helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership and now serves as vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, a nonprofit group.\n\nSeveral Asian countries also are negotiating a deal with the Latin American countries that make up the Pacific Alliance \u2013 a trade bloc that includes Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.\n\nMany of the deals have been under negotiation for years. But in some cases, the talks have escalated in recent months.\n\nAnalysts attribute that to the Trump administration\u2019s policies, such as the tariffs on imports including steel and aluminum, the ongoing trade tensions with China and the decision to focus primarily on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico instead of forging new deals to open up new markets.\n\n\u201cI do think there are some instances where governments have proven eager to move forward with trade negotiations as a way to counter some of the uncertainty in the global trading system today,\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nU.S. companies pay the price when other countries sign trade agreements that don\u2019t include the United States. Countries often reduce or eliminate tariffs as part of such trade deals, but American companies still must pay the higher rates because the U.S. isn\u2019t part of those agreements. That places U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, Cutler said.\n\nChris Garcia, former deputy director of the Commerce Department under Trump, agrees that Trump probably helped escalate the trade talks between other nations. But he sees that as a positive thing.\n\n\u201cI think the president has really shaken up much of the status quo as he pushes his \u2018America First\u2019 policies, which I believe have been adopted by many other nations who now understand, \u2018Let\u2019s see if we can get a better deal with some of the other nations that we trade with,\u2019 \u201d Garcia said.\n\nTrump\u2019s leadership \u201cin reassessing and re-evaluating how these deals look \u2013 have they truly been free and fair trade or just free trade in name only \u2013 I think that has prompted many other nations to also reprioritize,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of a free market,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWhen parties are interested in themselves first, this is how efficient deals are generated. That\u2019s how efficient agreements are made.\u201d\n\nNow that the trade talks with Canada and Mexico have concluded, the U.S. is turning its attention elsewhere. The Trump administration announced in late October it intends to negotiate separate deals with the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan in a bid to expand U.S. trade and investment.\n\nBut Murphy said it\u2019s uncertain how comprehensive those talks will be. The talks with the European Union, for example, are expected to address trade only in industrial goods, not agriculture or autos, so any agreement could have limited reach, he said.\n\nIn Mexico, meanwhile, Sartori and other U.S. companies fear the market for their cheeses will continue to melt away under the labeling restrictions imposed under Mexico\u2019s new trade deal with the European Union.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve invested in that market \u2013 we\u2019ve built that market,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBut unless the labeling restrictions are lifted, \u201cit\u2019s going to make it very difficult to invest in Mexico\u201d in the future, he said.\n\nMore: New trade deal with Canada, Mexico borrows heavily from pact that Trump abandoned\n\nMore: In the farm belt and manufacturing hubs, tariffs and trade turn into election issues\n\nMore: Tariffs on imported cars, parts could harm U.S. economy and auto industry, experts warn\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/21/trade-war-other-countries-forge-new-trade-agreements-without-u-s/1694283002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Tom Schad, USA TODAY", "title": "Kevin Durant says Draymond Green spat won't affect his future with Warriors", "description": "Warriors star Kevin Durant told Yahoo Sports his recent argument with Draymond Green will not factor into whether he decides to remain with Warriors.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/warriors/2018/11/21/kevin-durant-spat-future-draymond-green-warriors/2076825002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1acc9586a1f2a75aa9c22ee1c6baa6b61e3afba0/c=0-62-4163-2404/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/usatsports/durantfreeagency-e1542401283592.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:06:42Z", "content": "OAKLAND, CA - NOVEMBER 13: Kevin Durant #35 of the Golden State Warriors looks on during the game against the Atlanta Hawks on November 13, 2018 at ORACLE Arena in Oakland, California.

Durant, who has a player option for next season, appeared frustrated that Green did not pass him the ball at the end of regulation. Green used a series of expletives during their conversation and was subsequently suspended for one game.\n\n\"I never really felt like it was a problem, because I know Dray and he says some crazy (expletive) out his mouth all the time,\" Durant told Yahoo Sports. \"But on top of that, it was just that there was so much coming with it from the outside, and so much stuff that we have to answer now.\"\n\nDurant, who had not spoken at length about the argument prior to Tuesday's story, said he's been perhaps most frustrated by the questions that have followed the spat, including doubts about the Warriors' chemistry and his own future with the franchise. Durant has a player option for 2019-20 and could choose to become a free agent at the end of the season.\n\n\"I was upset, but I know that I can\u2019t hold on to something like this,\" Durant said. \"I know that I\u2019ve got to make a choice with myself, like how long are you going to be upset about this to the point where you\u2019re going to let it affect what you do on the floor or how you approach the game?\n\n\"Once it gets there now, I got to make a grown-man decision and tell myself, \u2018Look, man, no matter what, you still got to come to work every single day.

Delays were a bigger problem, with about 40 percent of the day's overall schedule there behind schedule, according to FlightAware's count.\n\nTo the east, the busy airports around New York City and Philadelphia could see sporadic delays develop by afternoon because of strong winds forecast in that region. The FAA had reported sporadic delays at Newark, where about 20 percent of flights were late.\n\nAt American Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, a \"connectivity issue'' briefly affected check-in at airport kiosks, but the carrier said it was resolved before schedules were affected.\n\nUSA TODAY TRAVEL: Holiday travel: 6 things to know if you haven't been on a plane since last year\n\nUSA TODAY TRAVEL: Thanksgiving travel: American Airlines computer glitch briefly hampers travelers\n\nWednesday marks the second consecutive day of mostly tranquil travel weather in the lead-up to Thanksgiving.

That\u2019s the average annual fee for major credit cards, and it\u2019s a fee that you won\u2019t find on any Discover card. But what does that look like in real life?\n\nWe asked Rue Norman, a Minneapolis native, to take us around her hometown on an $88 budget to see just how far it would take her.\n\nFor college student Rue, our $88 challenge allowed her to explore her city. The larger of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis is home to a bevy of singularly special neighborhoods that, with $88 in hand, can take a person from waterfalls to karaoke without blowing the budget.\n\n\u201cI loved learning more about my city,\u201d says Rue. \u201cMinneapolis has so many undiscovered treasures to be excited about. The more I uncovered, the more I wanted to explore.\u201d\n\nPeace Coffee, a Minneapolis home-away-from-home, serves up espresso concoctions to folks across the Twin Cities.\n\n(Photo: Peace Coffee)\n\nPeace Coffee, a Minneapolis home-away-from-home, was the first stop on Rue\u2019s itinerary. \u201cWhen new people come in, I always tell them to order what they normally order at coffee shops,\u201d says head barista Jackson O\u2019Brien. \u201cIf you're a cappuccino person, get a cappuccino. If you drink something big and creamy and sweet get something big and creamy and sweet from us. You\u2019ll love it!\u201d Possibly the best thing you\u2019ll find at Peace Coffee is the advice of baristas who know and love the city of Minneapolis.\n\nAs a native who also knows a ton of locals (baristas know everyone!), O\u2019Brien has plenty of ideas of where a person might spend a great day.\n\nCity Salvage in Northeast Minneapolis is a place where you could easily spend a couple hours of your day getting lost.\n\n(Photo: GET Creative)\n\n\u201cEvery neighborhood is its own unique little community with distinctive quirks and charms,\u201d he says, \u201cIn my neighborhood there's a store that sells nothing but metal detectors. I don't think I'll ever need or want one, but I love the fact that I can walk to the metal detector store.\u201d\n\nMaybe metal detectors aren\u2019t your thing either. Maybe 19th-century antique carved wooden mantels are your thing, though. With one-of-a-kind furniture, milk glass light fixtures, reclaimed bars, and more, City Salvage, in Northeast Minneapolis, is a place where you could easily spend a couple hours of your day getting lost. This place feels like a cross between a speakeasy, a retro movie set, and your grandpa\u2019s garage. You could score a vintage AMF bowling pin for less than $30, or take home a glass pop bottle-turned-vase, new-to-you salt and pepper shakers, or maybe new knobs for a quick re-do of your dresser. This place has been around for two decades for a reason. But one thing\u2019s certain -- after milling around rare finds, one needs food.\n\nLive music is commonplace at Sea Salt, and so are a rotating selection of beers to help you while away an afternoon.\n\n(Photo: Camille Lizama)\n\nAfter working up an appetite, Rue took us to one of her favorite Minneapolis spots, Minnehaha Falls, for some scenic views and vegetarian tacos at Sea Salt Eatery, located in the park. For $6, Rue fueled up with two tacos for the rest of her day and took in views of the falls where the fresh air and people watching are always included! Live music is commonplace at Sea Salt, and so are a rotating selection of beers to help you while away an afternoon.\n\nEvery Minneapolis trip should include a stop at Milkjam for their signature Jam Bun, a scoop of ice cream nestled within a Glam Doll glazed donut sandwich.\n\n(Photo: GET Creative)\n\nAfter a healthy lunch, Rue insisted on hitting up Milkjam Creamery for one of her favorite treats \u2014 the shop\u2019s famous Jam Bun, a scoop of ice cream nestled within a Glam Doll glazed donut sandwich. For $6, Rue had a Thai tea ice cream sandwich in her hands and could hardly stop smiling about it. Other sweet treats to excite the taste buds? Try a Champagne ice cream float or rose sundae. With Milkjam in her system, and $41 to go, Rue\u2019s adventure in Minneapolis was just getting started.\n\nBut first? A stop at Caf\u00e9 Meow. Life in the dorms makes pet ownership a tricky thing. Fortunately, Rue discovered this quirky little caf\u00e9 filled with real meows from the cats up for adoption who snuggle up with patrons. Five dollars gets Rue 15 minutes to get her cat fix before meeting up with friends.\n\nIt isn\u2019t every day you get to sing karaoke with a roomful of friends while eating sushi. Encore Karaoke on Franklin Ave. will gladly allow you to do just that. After grabbing a quick $16 spider roll, Rue and friends took over one of Encore\u2019s karaoke rooms at $20/person for a night of music and laughs. Dinner and entertainment: check, check.\n\n\u201cKaraoke was hands down the most memorable! I had forgotten how much fun it is,\u201d says Rue. \u201dSinging, dancing, and forgetting about my worries for some time with so many fun people made a stellar close to the day.\u201d\n\nNo matter where the day leads you, the Minnesotans you meet will not lead you astray. So, take a cue from the places here, or ask a local. Whether it\u2019s your barista at Peace Coffee, your ice cream scooper at Milkjam, or the person listening in while you\u2019re belting at Encore Karaoke, you can always find your way to a great day in Minneapolis -- especially when you do not have to spend $88 on a credit card annual fee.\n\nWith her Discover card, Rue isn\u2019t spending money on a credit card annual fee, which gave her freedom to explore her own city. \u201cI felt empowered to be adventurous. I met amazing people and saw some really awesome things.\u201d\n\nFrom her first sips of coffee to a fun night out, Rue packed a lot into her day. Here\u2019s a look at how it all shook out:\n\nPeace Coffee, $5 for one soy vanilla latte\n\nCity Salvage, $30 for a vintage lamp and set of 6 cups for Rue\u2019s dorm\n\nMilkjam, $6 for the ice cream shop\u2019s famous Jam Bun\n\nSea Salt Eatery, $6 for vegetarian tacos\n\nCaf\u00e9 Meow, $5 for quality cat snuggles\n\nEncore Karaoke and Sushi Bar, $16 for sushi and $20 for a night of singing\n\nDiscover is the only major credit card company that does not charge an annual fee on any of their cards.

I buy most of my jewelry, interesting housewares and many gifts in museum stores. The merchandise is interesting, attractive and surprisingly affordable. I love knowing I\u2019m not only supporting a local cultural institution, but an individual artist. And I know I\u2019m going to get compliments.\n\nYou can find a list of museums participating in Museum Store Sunday at https://museumstoresunday.org/participating-museums/. Many are offering significant discounts.\n\nMore: These 8 retailers can't afford a disappointing 2018 holiday shopping season\n\nMore: Store credit cards: How to get the most out of them during the holidays\n\nMore: Picture your small business on Instagram: Here are some best practices\n\nLots of retail stores like to throw around the term \u201ccurate\u201d when describing how they choose products for their stores. The people behind museum stores literally are curators. So they know how to find items that are unique, appealing, useful. You\u2019ll find something for everyone on your gift list at museum stores: jewelry, clothing and scarves, housewares and home d\u00e9cor, books, desk accessories, postcards, artwork, games and puzzles.\n\nHere are just a few examples:\n\n\u2022 A beautiful apron packed in a pie pan ($29.95) at the Oakland (California) Museum, https://shop.museumca.org/collections/home/products/apron-in-a-pie-dish;\n\n\u2022 A child\u2019s astronaut suit ($49.99) from the Cosmophere Space Museum in Hutchinson, Kansas, http://shop.cosmo.org/space-suits-and-jackets/orange-astronaut-suit-child;\n\n\u2022 A cobalt and cream bead necklace ($54.95) at the Detroit (MI) Institute of the Arts https://diashop.org/manabi-tagua-necklace-cobalt-cream/\n\nYou can get a better idea of some of the types of products at the Museum Store Sunday gallery page, which includes information about how to get a 25 percent discount, https://museumstoresunday.org/product-gallery/\n\nLet\u2019s clear up three myths about museum stores:\n\n1. Museum stores are for the elite only.\n\nNinety-five percent of museum stores don\u2019t charge admission, according to the Museum Store Association.\n\n2. Museum stores are expensive.\n\nMuseums have gotten smart; they have products at all price points. The top-selling items are at the lower end of the price scale. Of course, you will find some handmade, one-of-a-kind items, such as unique jewelry and other objects made of precious materials among the small handful of items that command big prices.\n\n3. Museum stores sell only \u201cartsy\u201d stuff.\n\nNot all museums are art museums. On Museum Store Sunday, you can choose from a wide range of museums: history or natural history, nature or botanical gardens, science and technology, performing arts, military, air and space, anthropology, ethnic/cultural, zoos and aquariums and more.\n\nLet\u2019s say you need to buy something for your brother-in-law, who wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in an art museum. You might give him a Campbell\u2019s soup can decoy safe ($12.99) from the International Spy Museum http://spymuseumstore.org/campbells-chicken-noodle-soup-decoy-can-safe/\n\nWhen you shop at a museum store, you support not only the important work of museums, but also the local artisans and small producers that supply these small shops.\n\n\u201cMuseum Store Sunday pairs with Small Business Saturday because both events encourage shoppers to support the local community, whether at an indie bookstore or museum,\u201d says Stuart Hata, chair of the MSA\u2019s marketing and communications committee.\n\n\u201cMuseum stores are indies because we all are independent and unique to each of our institutions. Whether we\u2019re the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco or the New York Historical Society or the Columbia River Maritime Museum in Washington state, we are all a fabric of the local community. And by supporting your local institution, you are supporting your local community,\u201d Hata says.\n\nRhonda Abrams is author of \u201cSix-Week Start-Up\u201d just released in its fourth edition and other books for small business owners.

(AP Photo/David J. Phillip) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDan Mullen is gone. So is the Egg Bowl bravado.\n\nFirst-year Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead will experience his first \"Battle of the Golden Egg\" on Thursday when the 22rd-ranked Bulldogs make the short trip to face Ole Miss in Oxford.\n\nSo far, he's shown little interest in continuing the trash-talking gamesmanship that Mullen \u2014 who left for Florida last year after nine seasons in Starkville \u2014 clearly enjoyed. Mullen never called Ole Miss by its name, instead referring to \"The School Up North,\" and he rarely missed an opportunity to needle the Rebels.\n\nMoorhead said he doesn't have much use for emotional rhetoric because the benefit is fleeting. The Bulldogs (7-4, 3-4 Southeastern Conference) are a 10-point favorite on the road against the Rebels (5-6, 1-6), who have lost four straight games.\n\n\"That is going to last for about a series or a half of a quarter, but ultimately, when that wares off, you are going to fall back on your preparation and you are going to win the game because of your effort and your execution,\" Moorhead said.\n\nLike Moorhead, Ole Miss coach Matt Luke isn't big on taking verbal potshots at his school's rival. Both coaches said the game is always emotional because of the rivalry's high stakes, but there's no need to for insults.\n\n\"It doesn't take away from the importance,\" Luke said. \"You can handle things the right way and it still be an important game. You can do things the right way and it still mean a lot to you.\"\n\nThe rivalry has been remarkably even over the past few decades, with both teams winning 14 times since 1990. Ole Miss has won four out of the past six, including last year's 31-28 upset in Starkville.\n\nHere are a few more things to watch when the Rebels host the Bulldogs on Thanksgiving night:\n\nFOR OLE MISS, THIS IS IT\n\nOle Miss can get to six wins with a victory against Mississippi State, but there will be no bowl game for the Rebels. The program is ineligible for the postseason for a second straight season as part of its punishment from an NCAA infractions case. Luke said he's proud of the senior class for playing hard despite the sanctions.\n\n\"Every one of these seniors had an opportunity to go somewhere, to transfer, but they chose to stay here and do this together knowing they weren't going to a bowl game,\" Luke said. \"It's been very impressive with their fight.\"\n\nTA'AMU'S BIG SEASON\n\nOle Miss quarterback Jordan Ta'amu needs just 212 yards in the Egg Bowl to break the school record for passing yards in a season. Right now, he's behind Chad Kelly, who threw for 4,042 yards in 2015. If Ta'amu has an average game, he should break the mark easily. He's averaging nearly 350 yards passing per game.\n\nSCOTTIE'S HEALTH\n\nOle Miss hopes Scottie Phillips will be able to play in Thursday's game after missing the Vanderbilt loss with an ankle injury. Phillips has run for 927 yards this season and 12 touchdowns while averaging 6.2 yards per carry. If he can't play, the bulk of the carries will likely go to Isaiah Woullard, who has 365 yards rushing and four touchdowns.\n\nTFL MACHINE\n\nMississippi State has 85 tackles for a loss this season, which is 13 short of the school record set in 2015. With two games remaining, the Bulldogs have a good chance at breaking that mark. Jeffery Simmons leads the team with 12\u00bd tackles for a loss while Montez Sweat has 12. Nine different players have at least four tackles for a loss.\n\nFITZ BACK IN EGG BOWL\n\nMississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald is back in the Egg Bowl one year after suffering a gruesome dislocated ankle in the first quarter of last year's game between the two schools. He managed to recover and has had another quality season, throwing for 1,504 yards and running for 901 yards.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Yellow Jackets lead the nation in rushing offense (353.7 yards per game) and hope to use it to control the clock and keep the Bulldogs offense on the sideline as much as possible.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nGeorgia Tech: QB TaQuon Marshall. A gutty senior who is willing to take a beating as the conductor of the triple-option, he leads the Yellow Jackets in rushing with 857 yards while scoring 11 touchdowns. His backup, redshirt freshman Tobias Oliver, has 808 yards rushing and 12 touchdowns.\n\nGeorgia: RB D'Andre Swift. After an injury-plagued season, the sophomore has really hit his stride late over the last month. He had three straight 100-yard games, including a career-best 186 yards rushing in a victory over Auburn.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nThe Yellow Jackets are 5-5 over the past two decades at Sanford Stadium, including upset victories the last two times the teams met between the hedges. By comparison, the Bulldogs haven't lost to Georgia Tech in Atlanta since 1999. ... Georgia is trying to complete its second straight perfect season at home. The Bulldogs have won 12 in a row in Athens since a 28-27 loss to Georgia Tech to close the 2016 regular season. ... Georgia Tech has thrown only 15 passes in its last four games. The Yellow Jackets have averaged nearly 36 yards on six completions. ... Both teams feature accurate kickers.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFor Aleksander Ceferin, the UEFA Nations League was an overwhelming thumbs up.\n\nAcross the continent, skepticism seems to have been replaced by positivity as European soccer's latest innovation replaced many unpopular friendly games in a busy calendar.\n\n\"The Nations League is even more successful than we thought,\" Ceferin, the president of UEFA, said after group play ended Tuesday.\n\nMost Nations League games were taken seriously and some, like the Netherlands' dramatic comeback draw against Germany on Monday, provided real drama. What initially appeared to be a complex format started to make sense.\n\nThe competition involves all 55 European national teams, playing in small groups and separated into four tiers using promotion and relegation. A champion will emerge from a Final Four after a mini-tournament in June.\n\nThe Nations League will also award at least one place at the 2020 European Championship to one of the lowest-ranked teams on the continent.\n\nA look at the Nations League's impact:\n\nFINAL FOUR\n\nWith World Cup finalists France and Croatia failing to win their groups \u2014 while Spain, Germany and Belgium also missed out \u2014 the Final Four in June will take place without several top teams. Instead, the surprise lineup of finalists includes Portugal, England, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nCan Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo win another trophy? That's if he plays, of course. The Juventus forward, who will be 34 in February, has been absent from international duty since the World Cup and faces a rape allegation in the United States.\n\nKathryn Mayorga filed a civil lawsuit in September in Nevada claiming Ronaldo raped her in his Las Vegas hotel room in 2009. Police reopened an investigation into the allegation at her request. Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWill Harry Kane-led England capture its first international title since the World Cup in 1966? The debate over whether winning the Nations League would genuinely end the title drought will ramp up in the coming months but coach Gareth Southgate will view it as another important step for a young team which also reached the World Cup semifinals.\n\nIs this the start of a new, exciting era for the Dutch after the dark days when they failed to qualify for the 2016 European Championship and the 2018 World Cup? Highly rated youngsters Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt are key members of the team and Memphis Depay is seemingly fulfilling his potential.\n\nCan Switzerland, which hasn't reached the quarterfinals of a major tournament since 1954, continue to upset the odds after ousting Belgium in group play? The Swiss will be the outsiders.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nThe Final Four, as well promotion and relegation in the four leagues, are easy enough to understand. However, the Nations League is also a backdoor into the 2020 European Championship.\n\nThat's where things can get confusing.\n\nThere will still be a typical European Championship qualifying campaign, but 16 teams get a second chance through playoffs.\n\nIn spring 2020, the 2018 Nations League results will be dusted off as the qualifying criteria for the playoffs, handing places to the four best-placed teams from each Nations League tier who missed out in qualifying.\n\nCurrently, that means Kosovo is guaranteed a playoff spot but World Cup champion France isn't \u2014 although the French are almost certain to qualify for 2020 the usual way.\n\nMEANINGFULL MATCHES\n\nEurope's smallest teams finally have something to play for.\n\nThe likes of Georgia, Macedonia and Kosovo usually spend their time scrambling to organize barely watched friendlies. The Nations League gives them meaningful games and, since all three won their League D groups, a shot at qualifying for a European Championship \u2014 something that's normally all but impossible.\n\nGone are the days when several of the tiniest nations waited years to earn a single point. The Nations League division system means UEFA's smallest member, Gibraltar, was playing comparable opponents and earned two rare wins, while Luxembourg came within four points of winning its group.\n\nNo change for perennial struggler San Marino, though. It still lost all six of its games without scoring a goal.\n\nFANS UNSURE\n\nThe games may be exciting, but they're rarely sold out.\n\nThere were more than 20,000 empty seats in Gelsenkirchen for Germany's dramatic 2-2 draw with the Netherlands, while Tuesday's game between World Cup quarterfinalists Sweden and Russia was roundly criticized for its flat atmosphere even though promotion was at stake.\n\nFor Scotland's 3-2 home win over Israel \u2014 a promotion decider billed as the host nation's biggest game in a decade \u2014 Hampden Park was less than half full.\n\nThat shows that some European soccer fans have been slow to fall in love with the new Nations League format, though the old friendlies weren't always crowd pleasers.\n\nFIFA is sure to be watching, since president Gianni Infantino \u2014 formerly of UEFA \u2014 is looking to build a worldwide Nations League clone.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nLSU wide receiver Terrace Marshall Jr. carries the ball past the Rice defense during their game at Tiger Stadium. (Photo: Stephen Lew, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn an utterly predicable season, it\u2019s only fitting that the College Football Playoff rankings feature none of the chaos, debate or drama that greeted the postseason format\u2019s first four season of existence.\n\nIn a playoff first, there were no changes at the top for the third week in a row: Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan lead the way in the hypothetical four-team field. And with two weeks left to go until the postseason, it\u2019s easy to envision a scenario where the semifinals unfold in uncontroversial fashion \u2014 this would be another first.\n\nAny outrage is tepid at best. Yes, the selection committee continues to place a shockingly amount of value on second-tier teams from the SEC. In the committee\u2019s defense, however, there simply aren\u2019t enough worthy teams from the remaining Power Five leagues to slid into the spots held by LSU, Florida, Kentucky and Mississippi State.\n\nIf suspense exists at all, it\u2019s in the knobby pileup of teams just outside the playoff picture jostling for position in the New Year\u2019s Six race. There may be more intrigue in the Group of Five race for an access bowl, but only if Central Florida loses one of its last two games.\n\nWith two weeks left until the College Football Playoff field is decided, here\u2019s what the selection committee got right and wrong in Tuesday\u2019s rankings:\n\nRight\n\nUCF leapfrogged Ohio State. It\u2019s difficult to watch No. 10 Ohio State barely survive against Maryland and imagine this team somehow carving its way into the top four. Yet the road does exist: OSU needs to beat Michigan, beat Northwestern and get some help. It\u2019s not so far-fetched as to be a completely unrealistic scenario, even if it\u2019s difficult to imagine a team that has struggled since late in September finding the sort of performance needed to beat Michigan in Saturday\u2019s rivalry matchup in Columbus.\n\nWhether caused by Ohio State\u2019s struggles with the Terrapins or No. 9 UCF\u2019s easy victory against nine-win Cincinnati, the committee made a smart move in swapping the Buckeyes and Knights in this week\u2019s rankings. Unlike OSU, the Knights seem to be improving at the right time; Saturday\u2019s 38-13 win against the Bearcats was the team\u2019s best showing of the season, and in prime time, no less.\n\nNot that it means anything, really. UCF is and has been an afterthought in the chase for the top four, lost behind a swath of one- and two-loss teams from the Power Five, and regardless of their ranking the Knights are playing for only one thing \u2014 an unbeaten season and another New Year\u2019s Six bowl. Moving ahead of Ohio State is only a welcome piece of recognition for what is again turning out to be the best team in the Group of Five conferences.\n\nWrong\n\nThis ongoing fascination with the SEC. Alabama is a no-doubt, no-brainer pick for the top seed, with little argument to the contrary. There\u2019s even a case for Georgia at No. 5, again due to the dearth of accomplished contenders for the first spot outside the four-team field \u2014 Oklahoma\u2019s defense is an abomination, Washington State doesn\u2019t have the resume, Ohio State has been average and UCF is, unfortunately, part of the Group of Five and thus essentially ineligible.\n\nLSU at No. 7 is silly. Florida at No. 11 is strange. Kentucky at No. 15 is borderline laughable. Mississippi State at No. 18 is so ludicrous that it boggles the mind. Even if you follow the logic that says LSU, Florida and Kentucky are among the best teams in college football, Mississippi State lost to all four by a combined score of 84-16.\n\nThe committee\u2019s embrace of the SEC is built on a house of cards so precarious that just one contrary viewpoint would cause the whole structure to collapse upon itself. For example, saying that Mississippi State is merely average invalidates wins over the Bulldogs by the Tigers, Gators and Wildcats. Saying that Florida isn\u2019t deserving of being No. 11 in the rankings would then mean LSU isn\u2019t worthy of being seventh, since the Tigers lost in Gainesville in early October.\n\nAnd questioning LSU\u2019s credentials then takes a bite out of Georgia\u2019s reputation, since the Tigers tore through the Bulldogs by 20 points a week after falling to the Gators. In other words, it\u2019s worth asking whether the committee has manufactured the value of certain SEC teams to fulfill a preconceived notion of the league\u2019s strength beyond Alabama."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Mistake income earners should avoid in order to be wealthier", "description": "Having a moderate income doesn\u2019t mean you have lesser chances to save money, but it does mean that in order to do so you have to do more planning and be more patient than a high-income earner of course!

I believe my wife will receive near $0 in spousal benefits because she\u2019s a member of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. I also believe that because her pension is about 1.5 times my calculated Social Security benefit of $25,000 she wouldn\u2019t receive a Social Security survivors benefit if I should die.\n\nIf she would outlive me by several years, is it better for me to start the Social Security benefit now, and save some of it for the expected difference, or reduce 401(k) withdrawals until required? We do not currently need the income as we can draw down our substantial 401(k)s. However, I would like to make the best decision in case she should outlive me by, say, 10 years.\n\nAnswer: If the wife's government pension is large enough that the Government Pension Offset (GPO) would completely eliminate her benefit as a widow regardless of when he files, then he should make the decision based on his single life expectancy \u2013 without considering hers, says Mike Piper, author of \"Social Security Made Simple.\"\n\n\u201cThe Social Security strategy that will allow them to spend the most over their lifetimes would be the strategy that pays out the most benefits over his lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cOr, more precisely, it would be the strategy that has the highest \u2018present value\u2019 of benefits over his lifetime \u2013 to account for the fact that claiming benefits earlier allows additional retirement savings to stay invested.\u201d\n\nMore Money: How results of midterm elections will impact your money and 401(k)\n\nMore Money: Teen girls just wanna have fun--designing games for your mobile phone\n\nMore Money: Aldi wine and cheese Advent calendars now on sale in US\n\nIf you are in good health, that would point in favor of waiting, says Piper. But if you\u2019re in poor health, that would point in favor of filing earlier.\n\nThe writer notes that his wife's government pension is roughly 1.5-times his Social Security benefit. \u201cDepending on what (he) means by that - and depending on whether she qualifies for a Social Security retirement benefit of her own - she may still qualify for a benefit as a widow,\u201d says Piper.\n\nIf he means that her pension is 1.5 times the monthly amount of his benefit at full retirement age, that means she would still get a benefit as a widow, if he were to wait beyond full retirement age, says Piper. \u201cThis is assuming she has no Social Security retirement benefit of her own, since (he) did not mention that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere may be a very compelling reason for you to wait -- likely until 70, unless you are both in poor health.\u201d\n\nOne last note: You might benefit from using an online Social Security calculator.\n\nQ: I am a retired, disabled veteran and was charged $147 per month for Medicare Parts A and B. I get full medical and Veterans Administration Choice when needed. Please tell me if keeping Medicare is necessary. I believe it is not.\n\nA: Veterans Administration (VA) health care and Medicare are mutually exclusive, says Katy Votava, president of Goodcare.com and author of \"Making the Most of Medicare: a Guide for Baby Boomers.\" \u201cTherefore, you do not need to have Medicare to receive VA health care,\u201d she says.\n\nThat said, without Medicare Parts A and B you cannot get care from a non-VA hospital, doctor or clinic unless they\u2019re willing to pay in full, says Votava. \u201cIn the current environment, many VA facilities and clinics are not keeping up with the demand for health care,\u201d she says. \u201cAdditionally the VA does not provide all types of care folks might need. People with Medicare can go elsewhere as needed. Those without cannot.\u201d\n\nVotava\u2019s advice: If Medicare costs are a stumbling block, look into the Medicare Savings Program. That program provides assistance with Medicare premiums, co-payments. Note, she says, that a person must meet income and asset requirements.\n\nThis Medicare website, www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/medicare-savings-program/medicare-savings-programs.html, has more information.\n\nRobert Powell is the editor of TheStreet\u2019s Retirement Daily www.retirement.thestreet.com and contributes regularly to USA TODAY.

The parents stayed in Bali for about 10 days and Stasio gave birth on the island in September after her parents had left Indonesia.\n\n\u201cShe refused to answer when they (the parents) asked about her baby\u2019s father,\u201d Wiarajaya said, quoting information from the driver and tour guide who accompanied the family since they arrived.\n\n\u201cBut she gave the impression that she was unmarried and her family preferred that she give birth to a child abroad, like wanting to avoid something,\u201d he said.\n\nThe driver, Wayan Siaja, and the guide, Made Arimbawa, told police they had taken Stasio and her daughter to Bali\u2019s international airport on Tuesday evening but Stasio changed her mind about returning to the U.S. and told them to take her back to Ubud, a town popular with tourists for its traditional crafts and culture.\n\nThey said she sat silently in the car before the tragic events unfolded, according to Wiarajaya.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/21/baby-dies-bali-us-woman/2076655002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Busy travel day ahead of Thanksgiving", "description": "U.S. Airports are busy on Wednesday morning, ahead of Thanksgiving.

(Photo: Gregory Shamus, Getty Images)\n\nA dozen years ago at the British Open, a kind innkeeper in Liverpool regaled his sports journalist guests with stories of the most intense sports rivalry he knew: Liverpool vs. Everton. A fierce love for one or the other of those Premier League teams divided families, caused arguments in school hallways and provoked fistfights in local pubs, he told us.\n\nThen he smiled sympathetically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest thing in sports,\u201d he said. \u201cToo bad you don\u2019t have anything like that in America.\u201d\n\nI smiled back. \u201cSure we do. It\u2019s called Michigan-Ohio State.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve told that story before, and I\u2019m sure I will tell it again, because to me, there is nothing in sports quite as sublime as the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry.\n\nI grew up in Ohio as a fervent Michigan fan. I can explain. Home was, and in many ways still is, Toledo, which is located 45 minutes from Ann Arbor and three hours from Columbus. It might as well be called Toledo, Michigan. I was born there. So were Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh and Ohio State coach Urban Meyer \u2014 seven months apart in the same hospital.\n\nMy introduction to the greatest rivalry in sports came early. My father took my siblings and me to the 1969 UM-OSU game, the first Big Ten game we little kids ever attended. The defending national champion Buckeyes were undefeated under the legendary Woody Hayes but could not return to the Rose Bowl because of a no-repeat rule that was in place at the time in the Big Ten.\n\nThis drove Hayes nuts. \u201cThe best team in the country can\u2019t go to the Rose Bowl,\u201d he whined all week, pretty much assuming he was going to beat a 7-2 Michigan team with a rookie head coach named Bo Schembechler.\n\nWoody\u2019s pomposity turned off my father, so on the drive up to Ann Arbor, he started mimicking Hayes. \u201cThe best team in the country \u2026 blah, blah, blah, blah \u2026 what a bunch of bellyaching. Kids, we\u2019re going to see who the best team in the country is today.\u201d\n\nWe giggled and nodded in agreement. Even though we had no connection to either school, then or now, we were all in for the underdog. We had become Michigan fans.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how it began. We sat in packed Michigan Stadium that cold November day and witnessed the absolute best that sports can provide, throwing our hearts into a team and watching it reward us with the most wonderful result imaginable. In one of the greatest upsets in college football history, Michigan defeated Ohio State 24-12.\n\nI never missed another UM-OSU game in Ann Arbor until I went away to Northwestern, but that early joy soon melted into heartache. Everyone knows all about Archie Griffin, the two-time Heisman Trophy winner and great ambassador for Ohio State who ended up starting in four consecutive Rose Bowls. That was great for him, but that means those were four consecutive Rose Bowls the Wolverines missed, even though they were consistently ranked in the top five in the nation. The four Michigan-Ohio State games from 1972-75 that preceded those Rose Bowls were decided by a total of 12 points. Ohio State won three, with the other ending in a 10-10 tie, which I remember as if it were yesterday.\n\nI finally met Griffin last year. Even though I instantly realized how well we would get along, I knew I first had to break the news to him that he pretty much ruined the 1970s for me. He smiled and said he understood.\n\nThe rivalry ebbed and flowed for a while, with Michigan having its day and Ohio State answering with its own. Over the past 33 years, though, there has been serious domination by one school, then the other. From 1985-2000, the Buckeyes won only three times. Since then, the Wolverines have won only twice.\n\nWhich brings us to this Saturday\u2019s game in Columbus. While Ohio State, ranked 10th in the nation, has stumbled its way through the past month, No. 4 Michigan has been brimming with confidence and is favored to win for the first time since 2011, a 40-34 victory in Ann Arbor.\n\nBut this game isn\u2019t at home, and that could be a problem for Michigan. The Wolverines haven\u2019t beaten the Buckeyes in Columbus since 2000, and Meyer has never lost to Michigan since becoming OSU\u2019s head coach in 2012.\n\nSo Harbaugh and Michigan are due for a big win. Logic says it finally will happen. History says not so fast. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is certain in this game of all games. Trust me on that one."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Busy travel day ahead of Thanksgiving", "description": "U.S. Airports are busy on Wednesday morning, ahead of Thanksgiving.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nQuestion: I\u2019m trying to decide when to claim Social Security. I am 63 and my wife is 62. I believe my wife will receive near $0 in spousal benefits because she\u2019s a member of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. I also believe that because her pension is about 1.5 times my calculated Social Security benefit of $25,000 she wouldn\u2019t receive a Social Security survivors benefit if I should die.\n\nIf she would outlive me by several years, is it better for me to start the Social Security benefit now, and save some of it for the expected difference, or reduce 401(k) withdrawals until required? We do not currently need the income as we can draw down our substantial 401(k)s. However, I would like to make the best decision in case she should outlive me by, say, 10 years.\n\nAnswer: If the wife's government pension is large enough that the Government Pension Offset (GPO) would completely eliminate her benefit as a widow regardless of when he files, then he should make the decision based on his single life expectancy \u2013 without considering hers, says Mike Piper, author of \"Social Security Made Simple.\"\n\n\u201cThe Social Security strategy that will allow them to spend the most over their lifetimes would be the strategy that pays out the most benefits over his lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cOr, more precisely, it would be the strategy that has the highest \u2018present value\u2019 of benefits over his lifetime \u2013 to account for the fact that claiming benefits earlier allows additional retirement savings to stay invested.\u201d\n\nMore Money: How results of midterm elections will impact your money and 401(k)\n\nMore Money: Teen girls just wanna have fun--designing games for your mobile phone\n\nMore Money: Aldi wine and cheese Advent calendars now on sale in US\n\nIf you are in good health, that would point in favor of waiting, says Piper. But if you\u2019re in poor health, that would point in favor of filing earlier.\n\nThe writer notes that his wife's government pension is roughly 1.5-times his Social Security benefit. \u201cDepending on what (he) means by that - and depending on whether she qualifies for a Social Security retirement benefit of her own - she may still qualify for a benefit as a widow,\u201d says Piper.\n\nIf he means that her pension is 1.5 times the monthly amount of his benefit at full retirement age, that means she would still get a benefit as a widow, if he were to wait beyond full retirement age, says Piper. \u201cThis is assuming she has no Social Security retirement benefit of her own, since (he) did not mention that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere may be a very compelling reason for you to wait -- likely until 70, unless you are both in poor health.\u201d\n\nOne last note: You might benefit from using an online Social Security calculator.\n\nQ: I am a retired, disabled veteran and was charged $147 per month for Medicare Parts A and B. I get full medical and Veterans Administration Choice when needed. Please tell me if keeping Medicare is necessary. I believe it is not.\n\nA: Veterans Administration (VA) health care and Medicare are mutually exclusive, says Katy Votava, president of Goodcare.com and author of \"Making the Most of Medicare: a Guide for Baby Boomers.\" \u201cTherefore, you do not need to have Medicare to receive VA health care,\u201d she says.\n\nThat said, without Medicare Parts A and B you cannot get care from a non-VA hospital, doctor or clinic unless they\u2019re willing to pay in full, says Votava. \u201cIn the current environment, many VA facilities and clinics are not keeping up with the demand for health care,\u201d she says. \u201cAdditionally the VA does not provide all types of care folks might need. People with Medicare can go elsewhere as needed. Those without cannot.\u201d\n\nVotava\u2019s advice: If Medicare costs are a stumbling block, look into the Medicare Savings Program. That program provides assistance with Medicare premiums, co-payments. Note, she says, that a person must meet income and asset requirements.\n\nThis Medicare website, www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/medicare-savings-program/medicare-savings-programs.html, has more information.\n\nRobert Powell is the editor of TheStreet\u2019s Retirement Daily www.retirement.thestreet.com and contributes regularly to USA TODAY.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Laid-back in everyday life, Yannick Noah is meticulous when it comes to being a tennis coach.\n\nSo over the last 10 days, the France captain has been paying close attention to anything that could derail his team's chances of winning an 11th Davis Cup title against Croatia this weekend.\n\n\"The most important thing was to spend as much time as possible together thinking about this final,\" said Noah, who summoned his players for a demanding training camp in northern France about two weeks ahead of the final.\n\n\"We could have imagined a training camp in Paris. Once the day is over, everybody gets back home,\" Noah said. \"In fact, you lose your focus. Here, as soon as we woke up, we were in the final. When we started to run in the morning, it was still dark, but we were already in the final. During our meals, we thought about the final.\"\n\nNoah guided France to Davis Cup titles in 1991, 1996 and 2017, but he will step down after this weekend and Amelie Mauresmo will take over.\n\nSince he returned to captain France in 2016, Noah has been rewarded with success. Despite a drop in individual performances, Noah's players have reached the Davis Cup semifinals every year during his most recent stint, losing only once to Croatia in 2016. They won the title against Belgium last year and now have the chance to conquer the last final played in its traditional format. Beginning next year, the top team event in men's tennis will be decided with a season-ending, 18-team tournament at a neutral site.\n\n\"We've got a unique chance, which will never happen again, to play a Davis Cup final at home,\" Noah said. \"We fought for this chance throughout the year. Not only for the team, but also for the event. Most of us have been obsessed by (this final). We want to make sure we are on top of all the things that can be controlled. Then there will be the craziness of the match.\"\n\nThe Croats are favored to claim a second title after their team became the first unseeded nation to win the 2005 Davis Cup by defeating Slovakia.\n\nWhile French players have been struggling individually over the last 12 months \u2014 Lucas Pouille is the best ranked Frenchman in Noah's team at No. 32 \u2014 Croatia will be led by seventh-ranked Marin Cilic, who qualified for the ATP Finals this month after a consistent season. In singles, Cilic will be backed by No. 12 Borna Coric.\n\nThe final will be played on clay under the retractable roof of the Pierre Mauroy Stadium in Lille and Cilic might struggle to adapt to the slow surface, having competed on hard court last week in London.\n\n\"I will be ready,\" Cilic said. \"We had Davis Cup ties already on clay immediately after hard court tournaments. I believe I'm going to be fine, adjusting my play, a bit more of sliding, running. The conditions (on) indoor clay are slightly faster than outdoor clay. I will be fine.\"\n\nPouille wrapped up France's 10th Davis Cup title last year by winning the decisive point against Belgium in the final. In the absence of Richard Gasquet, Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon, he will play in singles while Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who has been sidelined with a knee injury for most of the season, is likely to be used as France's No. 2. Noah has also the option of fielding Jeremy Chardy.\n\nIn doubles, France has the better team with French Open champions Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert, who reached the final at the ATP Finals.\n\nThis year's Davis Cup final has a familiar ring to it, at least for fans of soccer. France defeated Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup final in July.\n\nCroatia captain Zeljko Krajan said his team did not receive any encouraging messages from the country's soccer players but added \"they will be happy if we (avenge) the World Cup final.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The U.N. says more than 1.3 million children have suffered from SAM since a Saudi-led coalition went to war with Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in March 2015.\n\nThe group said its \u201cconservative estimate\u201d was that 84,701 children may have died, based on historical studies that find that 20 to 30 percent of untreated cases lead to death. It says it calculated the figure based on the number of cases reported in areas where aid groups were unable to intervene.\n\n\u201cFor every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it\u2019s entirely preventable,\u201d said Tamer Kirolos, Save the Children\u2019s Yemen director. \u201cChildren who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop.\u201d\n\nMore: Trump administration to curtail military support for Saudi-led war in Yemen\n\nMore: \u2018Stop starving people as instrument of war.'

Three-quarters of Yemen\u2019s people require life-saving assistance and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation.

(Photo: Sarah Prince, AP)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 The first time American John Allen Chau made it to the remote North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean, he came bearing gifts that included a football and fish.\n\nHe interacted with some of the missionary \u2014 who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants and are known for attacking anyone who comes near with bows and arrows and spears \u2014 until they became angry and shot an arrow at him.\n\nIt struck a book Chau was carrying, and the 26-year-old adventurer and Christian missionary swam back to a boat of fishermen that was waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his adventures and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to the island the next day, on Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn't known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as the tribesmen dragged Chau's body along the beach.\n\nDependera Pathak, director-general of police on India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, said Wednesday that the seven fishermen have been arrested for helping the American reach North Sentinel Island. Visits to the island are heavily restricted by the Indian government, and officials were working with anthropologists to recover the body.\n\n\"It was a case of misdirected adventure,\" Pathak said.\n\nNov. 16: Community mourns North Carolina teacher authorities say was killed by Mexican cartel\n\nOct. 30: Daredevil couple dies while taking Yosemite selfie, report says\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can't be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak told The Associated Press.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \"beloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\" The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\"He ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\" the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed in a hotel while he prepared to travel to the island. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016. North Sentinel is part of the Andaman Islands and sits at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired the seven fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, which also towed the kayak Chau used to reach the island the first time, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they broke the news to Chau's friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said. Police charged the seven fishermen with endangering the life of the American by taking him to a prohibited area.\n\nOne of Chau's friends said the adventurer spent a month at his home in Cape Town, South Africa, before going to India.\n\nCasey Prince, 39, declined to discuss what Chau told him about his upcoming travel plans, saying he'd rather talk about the kind of man his friend was.\n\n\"If he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\" Prince said, recalling the time Chau told him about being bitten by a rattlesnake.\n\nThe two first met about six years ago, when Chau was a manager on the soccer team at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma. Chau and others on the team traveled to South Africa to volunteer at a soccer development and social leadership program Prince founded, Ubuntu Football Academy.\n\nPrince described him as easy to like, kind, joyful and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\n\"He was an explorer at heart,\" Prince said. \"He loved creation and being out in it, I think having probably found and connected with God that way, and deeply so.\"\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with some of his relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\n\"He was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us,\" The Chau family wrote in its Instagram post. \"To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer. He loved God, life, helping those in need, and he had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese and other Andaman tribes.\n\n\"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survives. So the Sentinelese fear of outsiders is very understandable,\" Stephen Corry, the group's director, said in a statement.\n\nShiv Viswanathan, a social scientist and a professor at Jindal Global Law School, said North Sentinel Island was a protected area and not open to tourists. \"The exact population of the tribe is not known, but it is declining. The government has to protect them,\" Viswanathan said.\n\nPoachers are known to fish illegally in the waters around the island, catching turtles and diving for lobsters and sea cucumbers. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/21/american-believed-killed-isolated-tribe-north-sentinel-island-india/2076608002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Ashley May, USA TODAY", "title": "What's open and closed on Thanksgiving day?", "description": "Most businesses will be closed Thanksgiving day, including many retail stores.

USA TODAY\n\nThe wrong cost-of-living barometer and rising healthcare and housing costs are cutting into seniors' quality of life.\n\nMoney changing hands (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nMany seniors rely on Social Security benefits for a substantial portion of their income in retirement. This is a problem for a few reasons, including the fact that the program is only designed to replace about 40 percent of pre-retirement income.\n\nThe biggest problem for most seniors, though, is that the buying power of Social Security benefits is eroding very quickly. In practical terms, this means your benefits will be worth much less later in your retirement, when you will likely need the money most.\n\nThe practical costs of losing purchasing power\n\nA recent report from The Senior Citizens League revealed just how much the value of Social Security benefits has eroded for retirees.\n\nAccording to the report, since 2000, benefits have lost a full 34 percent of buying power. This means that for every $100 worth of goods purchased by a Social Security recipient in 2000, that same person can now only buy $66 worth of goods and services.\n\nMore: Here's how much interest income Congress owes Social Security over the next decade\n\nThis is a big problem with major practical implications.\n\nThe Senior Citizens League gave the example of buying home heating oil. In 2000, a homeowner with a 500-gallon oil tank would pay $575 to fill the tank for winter. The average monthly Social Security benefit in 2000 was $844.60, so that senior could have filled the tank and been left with about $270 in monthly benefits.\n\nBut by 2018, the cost to fill a 500-gallon oil tank had risen to around $1,610. That same senior's $844.60 monthly benefit would have become just $1,193.10. The retiree would now need an additional $417 on top of that monthly benefit to fill the same oil tank.\n\nWhy are benefits losing buying power?\n\nSocial Security benefits are losing buying power for a simple reason: cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) that are used to determine the raises seniors receive each year don't accurately reflect rising expenses that they face. So, annual benefits increases are too small to maintain seniors' buying power.\n\nIn fact, Social Security benefits have increased just 46 percent since 2000, while there's been a 96.3 percent increase in expenses seniors incur.\n\nThe raises seniors receive due to COLAs are too small because adjustments are calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This index tracks the rise in prices on the things urban wage earners most often spend money on.\n\nMore: Is Social Security ballooning the federal deficit?\n\nUnfortunately, seniors tend to spend differently than urban wage earners and clerical workers, so many experts believe the CPI-W doesn't accurately reflect seniors' rising costs.\n\nAnd it's only getting worse, as the things seniors purchase go up in price rapidly. In 2018, for example, Social Security benefits have lost 4 percent in buying power thanks to big increases in housing and medical expenses.\n\nWhen buying power declines because COLAs don't keep pace with rising costs, a senior's standard of living declines the longer the senior is retired. This is an especially serious problem because seniors often become more reliant on Social Security as they get older, their savings dwindle, and they get sicker and need more care.\n\nIs there anything you can do?\n\nUnfortunately, seniors can't do much about the erosion in buying power caused by COLAs that are too low.\n\nThey can lobby their lawmakers to change the way raises are calculated. One common proposal is to change the rules so COLAs are tied to the CPI-E, a pricing index designed to track how costs rise on goods and services most often consumed by the elderly.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no guarantee this will be a successful strategy amid Washington's climate of political dysfunction.\n\nMore: Social Security: 5 smart ways to get more benefits\n\nInstead, you need to take care of yourself by ensuring you don't rely on Social Security to provide too big a share of your income. Save as early as possible and as much as possible to ensure you have other money besides Social Security as a senior.\n\nIf you expect you'll need to rely more on Social Security, you can delay benefits to raise the monthly amount you receive. And try to refrain from drawing down savings too early because you may be more reliant on them later in retirement, when the value of your Social Security benefits has substantially eroded.\n\nBenefits aren't enough\n\nWhile you'll probably need Social Security to get by as a senior, these benefits simply aren't enough to live on \u2013 especially as buying power is eroding. Start saving today so you'll have other funds.\n\nAnd if you already depend on Social Security, look for ways to cut living expenses.

A 43-inch Toshiba 4K Fire TV with HDR for $129.99 at Best Buy? It has plenty of flashy tech terms, most notably the popular TV buzzwords: 4K and HDR.\n\nWhen buying a new TV in 2018, nearly any set above 40 inches will feature both technologies, even ones normally priced below $300. But don't let the acronyms fool you. It is important to know what you're buying and where you might actually benefit from this technology.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind.\n\nHDR\n\nAlso known as high dynamic range, HDR automatically adjusts the colors and contrasts of a picture, making scenes more realistic. For instance, with richer colors and a sharper picture, you'll notice HDR when watching really bright or really dark scenes in movies, with those moments looking more realistic.\n\nOften synonymous with 4K and Ultra HD, which are roughly four times the resolution of HD, or high definition, HDR often will be the more appreciated of the two technologies, especially for movie lovers and gamers, who appreciate the added sharpness.\n\nBut in order to see HDR shine, you'll need the right shows to stream, movies to watch or game systems to play. Not all programming has it. More on this below.\n\nWhen it comes to HDR, in 2018 there are two main options: industry standard HDR 10 (also listed as HDR) and Dolby Vision. Dolby Vision is the more premium of the two, offering more colors and sometimes better brightness than traditional HDR. Televisions that support Dolby Vision also support HDR 10.\n\nContent\n\nWatching Alien: Covenant in 4K/HDR on this TV legitimately made me uneasy\u2014in a good way. (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nJust like HD, you won't see the true benefits of 4K and HDR without the proper content that capitalizes on the technology. Whether it's in 4K HDR Netflix or Amazon shows, Blu-ray movies or games played on a new Xbox One or PlayStation 4, without the proper video, it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe Xbox One S and regular PlayStation 4 can both output video games with HDR, while their more powerful siblings the One X and PS4 Pro can do so in 4K HDR.\n\nNetflix requires that you subscribe to its $13.99 \"Premium\" plan to stream in 4K and HDR. Content that is available in 4K HDR or Dolby Vision usually includes a logo by their description, assuming you pay for Premium. The company also recommends an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps for streaming.\n\nMembers of Amazon's Prime expedited shipping and entertainment service get HDR video as part of the $119 yearly fee \u2013 you'd just need to watch on a device that supports HDR to take advantage of that. With Amazon, look for the section in its menu that showcases UHD and HDR content.\n\nA number of popular devices have 4K HDR, including Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube; Roku's Streaming Stick+, Premiere, Premiere+ and Ultra; Google's Chromecast; and Apple's Apple TV 4K.\n\n'Red Dead Redemption 2,' a Mature-rated game from Rockstar Games (for Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One) is a massive open-world adventure set in the Old West. Your character Arthur Morgan is part of an outlaw gang that's on the run and faces encroaching law and order. (Photo: Rockstar Games)\n\nOne other thing to note: Some TVs will need you to go into the picture settings to enable HDR. This sometimes is referred to as HDMI UHD Color (on Samsung TVs), HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color (on LG TVs) or making sure the TV input is set to HDMI 2.0 (on Roku TVs). When in doubt, a quick search on how to enable HDR on your device and TV of choice should help to get things promptly set up.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIf what you are mainly doing is watching traditional television through a cable box, antenna or streaming service, you likely won't see the difference as most of those broadcasts are in traditional HD, not even 4K.\n\nLikewise, if you don't pay for Netflix's Premium plan or rent movies in 4K from a service such as Vudu. Things will stream in HD and that is fine. HD videos still look great and will continue to do so on your new TV.\n\nRoku's Ultra is one of the many devices capable of streaming 4K HDR content to a compatible TV.

(Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nEvery Wednesday during the NFL season, USA TODAY Sports will assess everyone's favorite topic: quarterbacks. Who's hot? Who's not? Who has the most exciting matchups?\n\nHere's this week's QB Hot Sheet:\n\nFive to watch this week\n\n1. Colt McCoy, Redskins: Starting for the rest of the season after Alex Smith broke his fibula and tibia, McCoy is Washington\u2019s lone hope to stay in first in the NFC East. Given his knowledge of the system and mobility, the coaching staff has confidence in him. In a battle for first place against the Cowboys, will he prove them right?\n\n2. Ryan Tannehill, Dolphins: Making his first start after missing five games with a shoulder injury, all Tannehill has to do is keep pace with the Colts and the red-hot Andrew luck. He played well in spurts before he got hurt but was far too inconsistent. In his best games this year, Tannehill wasn\u2019t afraid to run. Look for him to use his legs to settle in against Indy.\n\n3. Josh Allen, Bills: He missed four games with an elbow issue and is set to reclaim the starting job against the Jaguars. This won\u2019t be an easy re-introduction into his rookie year, as the Jags are fresh off a game in which they intercepted Ben Roethlisberger three times. Protecting the ball will be key.\n\n4. Jameis Winston, Buccaneers: He\u2019s clearly the more talented of the two QBs on Tampa\u2019s roster and \u2013 again \u2013 coach Dirk Koetter made a switch, naming Winston the starter against the 49ers. He played well against the Giants in relief of Ryan Fitzpatrick last week, but as always, the question is whether Winston will take care of the ball.\n\n5. Lamar Jackson, Ravens: After Jackson\u2019s first career start \u2013 a victory against the Bengals \u2013 coach John Harbaugh said \u201cit will be tough\u201d for Joe Flacco (hip) to return against the Raiders. That means Jackson should get another shot to flash his athleticism. Jackson rushed 27 times last week, but it's unclear if Baltimore will keep up that pace while he looks to become more comfortable as a passer.\n\nThree trending up\n\n1. Drew Brees, Saints: He still has thrown just one interception against 25 touchdowns. If the season ended today, he\u2019d break Aaron Rodgers\u2019 record of top QB rating in a season (122.5) with his mark of 126.9.\n\n2. Eli Manning, Giants: He misfired on just one incompletion against the Bucs and had 231 yards and two touchdowns. In fact, over his last two games \u2013 both victories \u2013 Manning has thrown for 419 and five TDs with no picks.\n\n3. Jared Goff, Rams: Though his production wasn\u2019t as gaudy as that of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes in their epic showdown, Goff was efficient, protected the football and still racked up 413 yards and four TDs.\n\nThree trending down\n\n1. Carson Wentz, Eagles: Much of Philly\u2019s problems aren\u2019t his fault, but Wentz looks like a quarterback who feels like he needs to force throws to make plays happen. The Saints grabbed three interceptions, which tied a career high for him.\n\n2. Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers: It\u2019s tough to put him here since he scored the game-winning touchdown against the Jaguars in the closing seconds, but the Steelers found themselves down most of the game in large part due to Roethlisberger\u2019s carelessness with the ball. Three interceptions (two of which came near the red zone) put Pittsburgh in an early hole.\n\n3. Alex Smith, Redskins: You have to feel for Smith. A broken fibula and tibia and emergency surgery means faces a lengthy rehab.\n\nSeason rankings\n\n1. Brees (last week: 1): He\u2019s the leader in the clubhouse for the league MVP and is playing at historic levels of efficiency.\n\n2. Mahomes (2): His 37 passing touchdowns are eight more than the next closest player. Still, he needs to improve some of his gunslinging ways, as evidenced by the five turnovers against the Rams.\n\n3. Andrew Luck, Colts (4): He hasn\u2019t been sacked in five games and has three or more TD throws in his last seven games. Borderline MVP candidate.\n\n4. Philip Rivers, Chargers (3): Three interceptions in his last two games drops him one spot, but Rivers is still on pace for career highs in completion rate (67 percent) and QB rating (112.1).\n\n5. Goff (5): He may be somewhat of a product of a great supporting cast and excellent system, but Goff is efficiently managing the game and hitting open targets in stride.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Janna Herron, USA TODAY", "title": "Black Friday 2018: Should you get a personal loan for holiday shopping this year?", "description": "Americans are forecast to spend more than $1,000 during the holidays.

Melissa Rorech, Reviewed.com\n\nFour retailers face a crucial holiday season. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe holiday season doesn\u2019t come cheap. This year, Americans are forecast to spend more than $1,000 on gifts, travel, food and clothing.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a small sum, especially since two in five people say they can\u2019t cover a $400 emergency.\n\nIt\u2019s little surprise, then, that many people turn to debt to finance their holiday cheer. Those who prefer a predictable payment schedule and want to avoid the high interest that comes with credit cards are turning to holiday loans, which are just unsecured personal loans in small amounts.\n\nThese have become increasingly popular in the last four years, with the largest share of new loans handed out in the fourth quarter, according to TransUnion. The volume of new loans under $2,500 increases markedly in November and December versus September and October, according to Experian data.\n\nMore: Holiday budgeting tips: 3 ways to give thoughtful gifts without overspending\n\nMore: Target's push into Toys R Us territory, and investments online and in store woo shoppers\n\nMore: As stocks skid, worries mount for 401(k) investors who can't 'stand the pain'\n\nWhat is a holiday loan?\n\nHoliday loans typically come with a fixed interest rate and installment repayment plan that starts as soon as the loan funds are distributed. The loan amount generally ranges between $500 and $5,000, with terms between a year and five years. Funds can be used for any purpose.\n\nYou can often apply for these loans online, and some require no credit check before approval. Banks, online lenders and credit unions all offer personal loans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for credit unions to advertise a special holiday loan which has a low rate that is only available on Black Friday or for a set time,\u201d said Mike Schenk, chief economist of the Credit Union National Association.\n\nKey factors to consider\n\nDon\u2019t take the first offer you see. It\u2019s important to compare different features, because not all holiday loans are the same. \u201cShop around for a loan as aggressively as you would a holiday flight,\u201d said Brian Karimzad, vice president of research at LendingTree.\n\nRate: The interest rate on personal loans are often lower than what you pay on your credit cards. That means if you must finance your holiday spending, a loan may be the cheaper way to do it. To get the lowest rates, you must have a good-to-excellent credit score, usually 680 or higher.\n\nFees: Don\u2019t forget to factor in any upfront fees, which is often calculated as a percentage of the amount you borrow. Typical origination fees range from 1 percent to 5 percent of the total amount.\n\nAPR: The best way to compare loan offers is to look at the annual percentage rate, or APR. This factors in both the interest rate and any fees you must pay, so it\u2019s a more accurate reflection of the cost of the loan.\n\nPrepayment penalty: If part of your payback plan is to use your tax refund to eliminate the debt early, make sure there are no penalties for prepaying the loan.\n\nWho should get one?\n\nTo get the best rates, you must have credit between 680 and 850. You also should have low monthly debt payments relative to your monthly income. If that ratio is too high, you may be rejected for a loan.\n\nBefore taking a loan, make a list of your expected spending for the holiday season. Don\u2019t borrow more than you expect to need. If you can\u2019t stay financially disciplined, skip the loan.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re chronically in debt, if you haven\u2019t been able to pay off your credit card for three months or more in the last year, you need to get that in control first,\u201d Karimzad said. \u201cYou should think about scaling back your spending for the holidays.\u201d\n\nCLOSE The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree has been cut down in upstate New York and is being readied for transport to Manhattan where it will be erected this weekend.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIt may have been a while since you've seen Kevin Jonas, who was part of the Jonas Brothers until the hit band parted ways in 2013.\n\nOf course, you've heard a lot recently about his brother Nick Jonas and his engagement to actress Priyanka Chopra.\n\nBut you'll see this father of two daughters and his wife, Danielle, Thursday as they announce the Paw Patrol balloon at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Once again, the balloon will feature one of the popular kid's show heroic rescue pups named Chase.\n\n\"It's a huge family tradition to watch the event,\" Jonas told All the Moms.\n\nPaw Patrol Chase is pawing its way into the 2018 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Photo: Macy's, Inc.)\n\nJonas, 31, and wife, Danielle, 32, are parents to Elena Rose, 4, and Valentina Angelina, 2. This will be the first time they all have a front seat for the parade and they're all about Paw Patrol.\n\n\"Oh my gosh \u2014 we went on a family vacation and I took two DVDs for them and that's all Valentina kept yelling: Paw Patrol, Paw Patrol, Paw Patrol!\"\n\nJonas said he likes the PAW Patrol theme song. (They didn't make him say that.)\n\nUnlike other parents who hate on the Nickelodeon theme song, like actor Ryan Reynolds, who told it to \"get outta my head\" on Instagram. Jonas said as a musician he \"appreciates\" a catchy tune.\n\nMusic will always be in his life, but for now Jonas is living in New Jersey and working as a contractor and raising his daughters.\n\nThe biggest surprise about being a dad\n\nHis daughter Elena Rose was born in 2014 and Jonas found himself thrown off balance. Her birth came shortly after the Jonas Brothers decided to disband.\n\n\"I found I had to find my place. I had lost my focus, I had lost my groove. I didn't know where I fit in. I thought I was doing something wrong.\"\n\nEvery parent has thought that. And sometimes it doesn't go away. We usually just accept we're doing the best can, if we're lucky.\n\nBut by the time his second daughter was born in 2016, he had found his rhythm.\n\nSo how did Jonas get his groove back?\n\n\"You know, it was really just about paying attention to the moment. I stopped being distracted by what the world was throwing at me and took a step back to really enjoy the moment. As every parent knows, not every moment is going to be super exciting. But I just tried to understand that their yours and this is your time together now.\"\n\nJonas said weekend mornings are his time with the little ladies. He's in charge of breakfast. Sometimes that means bagels. It doesn't much matter what's served as long as his wife gets a break. The girls know what weekend breakfast means.\n\n\"It's just us. And we get to chill.\"\n\nLike All the Moms?

Together we win.\n\nI\u2019ve written about our national education coverage initiative, partnering with CBS News. Now we have added a financial supporter to broaden the exposure to our work.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded the USA TODAY Network a grant of nearly $500,000 to bolster coverage of education issues. Funds from the two-year grant will help establish a national education reporting team at USA TODAY to partner with our education writers across the country.\n\nLeading the team is Chrissie Thompson, USA TODAY\u2019s national education editor. The Gates grant allows Thompson to add two reporters, who join a group of seasoned education writers who will chart their own independent course in covering education issues. Thompson and her team already produced a poignant series in which reporters followed 15 teachers to get a sense of their daily lives.\n\nWe want education solutions for better decisions\n\n\u201cThis investment will allow us to devote two top reporters to the kinds of education stories that make a difference,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll watchdog schools and systems that are failing our children, excluding some from the promise of an education. We\u2019ll share stories about what\u2019s working so parents can advocate and make decisions for their children.\u201d\n\nThe team aims to bring critically important context and understanding to education coverage that will help students, parents, teachers, policymakers and elected leaders make better decisions now, and for future generations.\n\nThe ambitious plan not only delves into the daily lives of students and teachers, but is created to also find solutions to ultimately help students from pre-K to post-secondary education.\n\nMore: USA TODAY partnering with CBS to find education solutions across America: Standards editor\n\nWriting wrongs: Our investigative journalists do mission work\n\nVeterans sacrificed enough: USA TODAY investigations of VA health care help our heroes\n\n\u201cWith reporters at the local level working with the enhanced national team made possible by the Gates Foundation grant, our reporting will provide an extensive view of the state of education in the U.S,\u201d Randy Lovely, vice president for community news at the USA TODAY Network, said in a news release.\n\nWe have many \u201cangels\u201d like the Gates across the nation who support our mission to strengthen communities.\n\nIn Florida, the Pensacola News Journal formed a unique partnership with philanthropist Quint Studer to create an immersive project called CivicCon, based on the principle that great cities begin with great dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe partnership developed over hours of conversations regarding the state of our community and a shared belief that we could be so much more if stakeholders had access to best practices around the country,\u201d said Executive Editor Lisa Nellessen Savage.\n\nThese angels support our work without fanfare\n\nNellessen Savage said that before the partnership, the News Journal lacked the resources to actively engage with residents to the degree that would move the needle in a transformative way, and that Studer\u2019s nonprofit, the Studer Community Institute, lacked the reach.\n\n\u201cThe News Journal helps people understand why it matters and why these lessons can help make our community better,\u201d Studer said.\n\nThe partnership hosts monthly public engagements with national experts on what it takes to build strong communities. The events are accompanied by stories, videos, podcasts and roundtable tactical discussions with stakeholders that explore how to improve Pensacola and the lives of residents.\n\nThe foundation has invested more than $350,000, with $150,000 planned for 2019. And the results are impressive:\n\n\u25baStuder also committed $190,000 to bring in world renowned urban planners to work with residents to create a blueprint for how the best ideas can be put into action specifically in Pensacola.\n\n\u25baActive, engaged citizens led the fight to stop a controversial government fish hatchery that environmentalists argued would have destroyed the future of the downtown waterfront.\n\n\u25baThose same residents rallied the city to restore the beachfront property, opening the beach to kayaking, paddle boarding and other activities.\n\nAnd these are just two examples of philanthropic efforts to support our journalism. Across the USA TODAY Network, families and foundations each year fund training and projects so our reporters can dig deeper, expose wrongdoing, and make our communities better.

We outline the details on each so you can decide which is the best fit for your family holiday tradition. (Photo: Courtesy Elf on the Shelf and Reindeer in Here)\n\nThanks to Elf on the Shelf and Reindeer in Here, families have more options than ever when it comes to establishing a new holiday tradition.\n\nBut which is the best fit for you?\n\nTo help you decide, we laid out the details for your side-by-side comparison. But first, a little background:\n\nElf on the Shelf is the established option. Since it debuted in 2005, more than 11 million have been sold, according to CNN.\n\nIt was created by twin sisters Chanda Bell and Christa Pitts and their mother, Carol Aebersold, and was based on their own family tradition of putting an elf around their house during the holidays.\n\nReindeer in Here is the newcomer, but it\u2019s rapidly growing in popularity.\n\nBilled as a low-maintenance, less-stern tradition, it sold out when it debuted last year. It received awards by a slew of parenting organizations, including Mom\u2019s Choice Awards, National Parenting Product Awards and The Toy Insider.\n\nWhat are the major differences?\n\nReindeer don\u2019t hide like the elves do (which means no panicking to remember to hide him in a new spot before the kids wake up). Kids are encouraged to take their reindeer wherever they go. Elves aren\u2019t allowed to be touched because they might lose their Christmas magic.\n\nMORE: 25 places to hide your Elf on the Shelf this holiday season\n\nWhile elves are scouts for Santa and report on children\u2019s behavior, reindeer are friends of Santa and children and share wishes between the two.\n\nReindeer in Here is billed as the more feel-good alternative to Elf on the Shelf. (Photo: Courtesy of Reindeer in Here)\n\nAnd now, here\u2019s everything else you need to know:\n\nElf on the Shelf\n\nStory: Santa has Scout Elves that help him with his naughty and nice lists. Families adopt an elf, who watches while kids are awake and then flies back to the North Pole each night to give Santa a report on their behavior. When the elf returns home, he finds a new hiding spot and waits for children to find him. But, kids aren\u2019t allowed to touch the elf or he/she will lose its magic.\n\nThe catch: First, parents need to remember to move their elf each night. They\u2019re also tasked with finding new \u2013 and more intricate \u2013 hiding spaces. It\u2019s more difficult than you think. But isn\u2019t the kid\u2019s excitement worth all the effort?\n\nCost: $29.95 for the starter kit, which includes an elf doll and a hardcover book about the tradition.\n\nLTSOrnament (Photo: Mike Marano)\n\nWhen it starts: Many elves return from the North Pole the last week of November, leading up to Dec. 1 (a time known as Scout Elf Return Week). But, all elves are different and some wait until the second week of December.\n\nAccessories: Let us count the ways! Not only do elves come in male and female and with different skin tones, you can buy them clothes, paper crafts and shrink-and-send letters to Santa. They also have pet helpers, including a reindeer and a Saint Bernard puppy.\n\nReindeer in Here\n\nStory: The reindeer is the first Christmas gift of the year from Santa. He can go everywhere with your child: The playground, the store and to bed. Each night, the reindeer communicates your child\u2019s wishes to Santa. On Christmas Eve, children put their reindeer under the tree so Santa can take him or her back to the North Pole, where they\u2019ll live until early next December.\n\nThe catch: Not much. Maybe that the reindeer will get dirty from going everywhere with your kid. And there\u2019s a chance it could get lost. But other than that, it\u2019s a special tradition that requires almost no effort from parents.\n\nCost: $29.99 in stores and $32.99 on Amazon for the starter kit of reindeer plush doll and storybook.\n\nReindeer in Here kits are sold at retail stores, Amazon and online. (Photo: Courtesy of Reindeer in Here)\n\nWhen it starts: Dec. 1 through Dec. 24.\n\nAccessories: Though Reindeer in Here is new, he comes with a lot of extras.

One day in February, residents of Bennington County in Vermont gathered to discuss an influx of refugees into far-away New York City that had brought headlines of dislocated, suffering children.\n\nDespite icy roads and bitter cold, the meeting hall was standing room only. The Vermonters, who generations earlier spirited fugitive slaves from farmhouse to farmhouse until they reached Canada, cooked up a plan to help: They would invite 60 of the children to Vermont that summer to learn the language and customs of their new home while their parents in New York put their lives together.\n\nAny lingering doubts about welcoming refugees from a foreign country into American towns were swept away when the children piled off the train from New York. To quote from the piece we published, \u201cWhy they were just children!\u201d\n\nAfter eight weeks of playing outside, bonding with Vermont families, and learning the language and American civics, the children were ready to go home. A final corn roast capped by a singalong with s\u2019mores under the stars was followed the next day by tearful goodbyes on both sides.\n\nThe year? It was 1939. The refugees? Europeans escaping the atrocities of the Holocaust.\n\nSharing meals in a 'safe place' for 'all types'\n\nFor 96 years, Reader\u2019s Digest has told stories of everyday Americans who come together to do good things \u2014 and it\u2019s both astonishing and telling how often those tales involve a community welcoming outsiders into the fold. One such community is Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were murdered last weekend by a gunman who resented their welcoming spirit toward refugees.\n\nAs we mourn this tragedy, it is heartening to know there are places in America where love is blooming in place of hate. We became acquainted with many of them in our annual search for the \u201cNicest Place in America\u201d and announced the winner last week.\n\nThere\u2019s no more classic American tale than that of Yassin\u2019s Falafel House in Knoxville, Tennessee. Its proprietor, Yassin Terou, is a refugee from a horrific civil war in Syria who came here in 2011 with almost nothing but a gift for preparing Syria\u2019s signature food, the falafel. Just six years later, his well-loved restaurant is a place where Knoxvillians of all faiths, preferences and political persuasions come together to share meals in a \u201csafe place\u201d for \u201call types,\u201d as signs around the restaurant proudly declare.\n\nInspired by his openness and generosity, Yassin\u2019s neighbors and customers nominated his restaurant for our contest. Then Reader\u2019s Digest editors and a panel of outside judges, including \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts, chose it as one of 10 finalists from among nearly 450 other places in 49 states where trust and civility are winning. After a public vote (63,000 votes were cast), Yassin\u2019s Falafel House emerged from the pack.\n\nMore: Bring more refugees to America. They'll fill vacant jobs and boost our economy.\n\nGOP should support work visas. They'd help business and ease the caravan problem.\n\nMike Pompeo: We remain the world\u2019s most generous nation\n\nEach of the 10 finalists shared something important with Yassin\u2019s and the Vermonters. At a time when our government is cutting the number of refugees we admit to our country and trying to change the way we welcome immigrants, they all demonstrate the American instinct to offer help and open arms to neighbors in need, no matter how or when they arrive.\n\nFor instance, in Ellijay, Georgia, a hamlet in the Smoky Mountains, folks scootch over to make room when someone new comes into town, including Hispanic migrants who work the region\u2019s apple farms. When Maria Gonzalez Santos\u2019s father was picked up on his way home from work by immigration agents, the community rallied around the family and made sure his legal status was renewed.\n\nIn the small Chicago suburb of North Riverside, residents have over decades created a self-governing system of volunteer \u201cblock captains\u201d responsible for making sure no one gets left behind, including immigrants with complicated statuses. After a neighbor from Poland told her block captain that she was having trouble sorting out her citizenship paperwork, the captain told the committee, who told the mayor, who enlisted the help of her local congressperson, and soon everything was in order.\n\nYou can read the inspiring stories of each of the finalists in our November issue, but before you do, here\u2019s one more classic Reader\u2019s Digest story that I hope will remind you of how welcoming America can be.\n\n'When you break bread, you break hate.'\n\nThis one is also set in winter, in the days before Christmas, when a small group of locals gathered at the First Baptist church for an annual holiday event called Welcome the Stranger. It\u2019s a Christian ritual with Jewish roots, where neighbors greet neighbors, friends, and anyone else who passes by with warmth and compassion, celebrating the season.\n\nBut this year, not everyone was in the spirit.\n\nAs the speakers organized by local churches stood before the crowd to share their holiday thoughts, a man draped in an American flag began yelling that he was out of a job and immigrants were to blame.\n\nAs it happened, a local businessman who himself was an immigrant took the stage, preparing to speak. He invited the man onstage so immigrant and native-born American could hold the flag together. The man refused. So the immigrant waded into the crowd, invited the man to dinner and offered him a job. When they parted, they shook hands.\n\n\u201cWhen you break bread,\u201d the businessman later explained, \u201cyou break hate.\u201d\n\nAs you may have guessed, that immigrant businessman is Yassin Terou, whose restaurant is the 2018 Nicest Place in America.\n\nBruce Kelley is the editor in chief of Reader's Digest.

(Photo: Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWe may refer back to the NFL's 2018 campaign as one of the more memorable in the league's 99-year history. (Perhaps you caught Chiefs-Rams on Monday night?)\n\nAt a time when so many strong teams seem headed for (hopefully) more memorable encounters once the playoffs roll around, we've also seen a variety of fresh and still-not-fading stars track toward unprecedented regular-season performances. Some seem destined to rewrite the record book, while others will require a Herculean push over the next six weeks to stake a claim.\n\nHere are just a few league marks that could come crashing down by season's end:\n\nTouchdown passes\n\nChiefs phenom Patrick Mahomes remains in striking distance of Peyton Manning's single-season record (55 in 2013) after adding six Monday night and pushing his total to 37 through 11 games. At his current rate, Mahomes is on track to fire 54 TDs, though December's weather could be an obstacle given he'll play three games at Arrowhead Stadium and another in Seattle. Still, decent shot at ketchup nirvana for the youngster.\n\nCompletion percentage\n\nDrew Brees has broken this record three times since 2009, most recently last year when he reclaimed it from Sam Bradford by becoming the first quarterback to hit the 72 percent plateau for a single season. But apparently the Saints standout is tired of messing around and really wants to put it way out there. He's currently at 76.4 percent, a number that might have once seemed unattainable.\n\nPasser rating\n\nThis goes hand in hand with completion rate to a significant degree, so Brees might take this one down, too. He pushed it up to 127.3 on Thanksgiving, well ahead of Aaron Rodgers' seven-year-old high-water mark (122.5).\n\nCompletions\n\nMinnesota's Kirk Cousins has 289, putting him on pace for 462. Coach Mike Zimmer would surely like to see Cousins throw fewer passes, but he'll likely remain a threat to overtake Brees' standard (471 in 2016) for the foreseeable future.\n\nMost 5,000-yard passers\n\nDan Marino first crossed this threshold in 1984. Brees did it next in 2008, and it's become fairly commonplace since. Still, of the nine times it's happened, Brees has done it five, while no one else has done it even twice. The only year with multiple 5,000-yard passers was 2011 (Brees, Tom Brady, Matthew Stafford).\n\nThat should change very soon as Mahomes, Matt Ryan, Jared Goff and Ben Roethlisberger are all on pace to blow by 5K. Rodgers, who's on track for 4,900-plus yards, could make it a quintet with one big game.\n\nNow operating a far more-balanced attack, Brees is looking at a pedestrian (by current measures) 4,560 yards.\n\nSacks\n\nThe Rams' Aaron Donald is sitting on a career-high and league-leading 14\u00bd. On a per-game basis he should hit 21 by season's end, a figure that would tie for fifth-best ever but leave him 1\u00bd shy of Michael Strahan's controversial record. However, Donald has really picked up his production after going sack-less in his first three games. He has 10\u00bd in his last five outings, a clip that could easily vault him past Strahan if he can maintain it.\n\nTeam scoring\n\nThe Saints were virtually in a dead heat with the record-breaking 2013 Denver offense (37.88 ppg) but \"dipped\" to 37.2 after posting \"just\" 31 points Thursday against Atlanta. The Manning-led Broncos finished with 606 points while New Orleans is currently on pace for 595. The Saints have already reached 40-plus points in six games, and no team has done it seven times in one season.\n\nYards allowed\n\nTo date, only the 2012 Saints \u2014 yup, that was the year Sean Payton was suspended for Bountygate \u2014 have allowed as many as 7,000 total yards to their opponents.\n\nBut this year's Bengals \"defense\" could bring even more joy to New Orleans by potentially displacing the Saints for this dubious distinction. Already the first team to allow 500 in three consecutive games, Cincinnati is giving up yards at an unprecedented rate: 449.4 per week. That has the Bengals steaming toward 7,200, well beyond the Saints' 7,042 six years ago.\n\nReceptions\n\nMinnesota's Adam Thielen and New Orleans' Michael Thomas have come back to earth after scalding starts. Both remain on pace to eclipse 125 catches \u2014 that level has only been reached four times \u2014 but will need more double-digit days if either is to seriously threaten Marvin Harrison (143 in 2002).\n\nReceptions by a tight end\n\nThis is in major peril. The Eagles' Zach Ertz currently has 77 grabs (fourth in the league), putting him on pace for 123. Jason Witten has the record at the position with 110 in 2012.\n\nReceptions by a running back\n\nKnow who owns this one? How about Matt Forte with 102 (2014). He, Larry Centers and LaDainian Tomlinson are the only backs to crack the century mark for catches in a season. But look out \u2014 New England's James White (66 receptions) and Giants rookie Saquon Barkley (64) could both overtake Forte. Christian McCaffrey (60) also has a plausible opportunity.\n\nReceiving yards\n\nThis category's Holy Grail is 2,000 yards for a season. Calvin Johnson got closest with 1,964 in 2012. He's one of only four players to steam past 1,800 in one year. However Julio Jones could be the first to hit that milestone twice (he had 1,871 in 2015) and is currently in line for 1,898. But remember, Jones also has three 250-yard-plus games in his career, and one more this year \u2014 what else do the Falcons have to play for now? \u2014 could allow him to approach 2,000.\n\nBears passing marks\n\nNo Chicago quarterback has ever surpassed 4,000 yards or 30 TD passes in a season. Ever. (To give that some context, Blake Bortles posted 4,428 yards and 35 TDs in 2015.)\n\nHowever Mitchell Trubisky, whom some regard as the Midwestern version of Bortles, could change that, even after a shoulder injury prevented him from playing on Thanksgiving (he's expected back in Week 13). Trubisky still has 2,469 yards and 20 TDs, putting him right on target to hit 30 touchdowns but now behind the 4K trajectory.\n\nAnd lastly, because we know you're curious ...\n\nTouchdowns\n\nTodd Gurley entered Monday night with a league-best 17 scores. Yet, amazingly, in a game that featured 14 TDs, he didn't register one after finding the end zone at least once in his first 10 games. Gurley would need 15 TDs in his final five games \u2014 three per week \u2014 to overtake LaDainian Tomlinson's 2006 mark (31), so this is almost surely a quest Gurley will have to reboot in 2019.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, George Schroeder, USA TODAY", "title": "Stuck at No. 8, Washington State piles up evidence to try to convince playoff skeptics", "description": "Stuck at No. 8 in the College Football Playoff Top 25, Washington State hopes to provide evidence to convince skeptics in the debate.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/columnist/george-schroeder/2018/11/21/college-football-playoff-rankings-washington-state-position/2076375002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/8954fc2e-4957-4df3-86d3-16b628d02d34-USATSI_11691903.jpg?crop=1739,978,x0,y248&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:56:13Z", "content": "USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken and Paul Myerberg react to the latest College Football Playoff rankings and ponder the chaos that could ensue if Georgia can upset Alabama in two weeks.

Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY\n\nVizio M-Series (2018) TV Review (Photo: Reviewed.com)\n\nLook through early Black Friday ads at Best Buy and Target, and you'll find plenty of eye-catching TV deals.\n\nA 50-inch Philips 4K UHD HDR TV for $249.99 at Target? A 43-inch Toshiba 4K Fire TV with HDR for $129.99 at Best Buy? It has plenty of flashy tech terms, most notably the popular TV buzzwords: 4K and HDR.\n\nWhen buying a new TV in 2018, nearly any set above 40 inches will feature both technologies, even ones normally priced below $300. But don't let the acronyms fool you. It is important to know what you're buying and where you might actually benefit from this technology.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind.\n\nHDR\n\nAlso known as high dynamic range, HDR automatically adjusts the colors and contrasts of a picture, making scenes more realistic. For instance, with richer colors and a sharper picture, you'll notice HDR when watching really bright or really dark scenes in movies, with those moments looking more realistic.\n\nOften synonymous with 4K and Ultra HD, which are roughly four times the resolution of HD, or high definition, HDR often will be the more appreciated of the two technologies, especially for movie lovers and gamers, who appreciate the added sharpness.\n\nBut in order to see HDR shine, you'll need the right shows to stream, movies to watch or game systems to play. Not all programming has it. More on this below.\n\nWhen it comes to HDR, in 2018 there are two main options: industry standard HDR 10 (also listed as HDR) and Dolby Vision. Dolby Vision is the more premium of the two, offering more colors and sometimes better brightness than traditional HDR. Televisions that support Dolby Vision also support HDR 10.\n\nContent\n\nWatching Alien: Covenant in 4K/HDR on this TV legitimately made me uneasy\u2014in a good way. (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nJust like HD, you won't see the true benefits of 4K and HDR without the proper content that capitalizes on the technology. Whether it's in 4K HDR Netflix or Amazon shows, Blu-ray movies or games played on a new Xbox One or PlayStation 4, without the proper video, it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe Xbox One S and regular PlayStation 4 can both output video games with HDR, while their more powerful siblings the One X and PS4 Pro can do so in 4K HDR.\n\nNetflix requires that you subscribe to its $13.99 \"Premium\" plan to stream in 4K and HDR. Content that is available in 4K HDR or Dolby Vision usually includes a logo by their description, assuming you pay for Premium. The company also recommends an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps for streaming.\n\nMembers of Amazon's Prime expedited shipping and entertainment service get HDR video as part of the $119 yearly fee \u2013 you'd just need to watch on a device that supports HDR to take advantage of that. With Amazon, look for the section in its menu that showcases UHD and HDR content.\n\nA number of popular devices have 4K HDR, including Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube; Roku's Streaming Stick+, Premiere, Premiere+ and Ultra; Google's Chromecast; and Apple's Apple TV 4K.\n\n'Red Dead Redemption 2,' a Mature-rated game from Rockstar Games (for Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One) is a massive open-world adventure set in the Old West. Your character Arthur Morgan is part of an outlaw gang that's on the run and faces encroaching law and order. (Photo: Rockstar Games)\n\nOne other thing to note: Some TVs will need you to go into the picture settings to enable HDR. This sometimes is referred to as HDMI UHD Color (on Samsung TVs), HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color (on LG TVs) or making sure the TV input is set to HDMI 2.0 (on Roku TVs). When in doubt, a quick search on how to enable HDR on your device and TV of choice should help to get things promptly set up.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIf what you are mainly doing is watching traditional television through a cable box, antenna or streaming service, you likely won't see the difference as most of those broadcasts are in traditional HD, not even 4K.\n\nLikewise, if you don't pay for Netflix's Premium plan or rent movies in 4K from a service such as Vudu. Things will stream in HD and that is fine. HD videos still look great and will continue to do so on your new TV.\n\nRoku's Ultra is one of the many devices capable of streaming 4K HDR content to a compatible TV. (Photo: Reviewed / TJ Donegan)\n\nBut with more content being made available with 4K and HDR support all the time (all Netflix Originals are now shot in 4K), getting the right TV this Black Friday will not only get you a deal today but grant you the flexibility to take advantage of the technology in the future.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/11/21/buying-new-tv-holiday-season-whats-4-k-hdr/1942046002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY", "title": "Which tech toy or tool ranks as the best new gadget of 2018?

As a dietitian, I know better than to overpay for meaningless \"GMO free\" labels.\n\nThanksgiving table. (Photo: Thanksgiving.com)\n\nLet\u2019s face it, Thanksgiving can be more than a little stressful. After all, it\u2019s probably the No. 1 American holiday celebrating family, friends and, of course, food.\n\nLike you, I suspect, I want everyone coming to my house to have the best, most satisfying meal I can manage. As a parent, I want my children to understand the traditions, appreciate and be thankful for great food and have fun. As a dietitian, well, let\u2019s just say \u2014 without being neurotic about it \u2014 I want everything I serve to taste great and be healthful. It\u2019s a lot to juggle.\n\nWith Thanksgiving just a day away, however, one thing concerning the mom-me and the dietitian-me is the confusion over what food labels and designations even mean. Products with \u201cGMO free,\u201d \u201cpesticide free,\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d labels crowd grocery shelves. And I worry that shoppers will feel shamed into purchasing food that is often more expensive or will get so overwhelmed they might skip the produce section altogether.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to let label confusion frighten you away from perfectly safe, healthful, nutritious foods. I\u2019m not scared. My focus is on including more fruits and vegetables in my meals, not on hyped imaginary risks. Whether conventionally grown or organic, if it is the product of a commercial American farm or food maker, I know it is going to be safe.\n\nRelax \u2014 \"organic\" doesn't mean \"better\"\n\nI say this knowing that many consumers today avoid some produce out of fear of pesticides or GMOs. You may have heard of a list called the \u201cDirty Dozen.\u201d I\u2019ve seen how this list scares consumers away from produce.\n\nA 2016 study published in Nutrition Today highlighted how researchers found that simply naming certain fruits and vegetables as dirty made low-income shoppers less inclined to buy any fruits and vegetables. I can\u2019t tell you how frustrating that is when study after study shows how important it is to your health to consume fruits and vegetables daily.\n\nMore: Why so busy? Our flawed college system takes toll on families years before tuition is due\n\nMy 'bottom' was being drunk on TV. But I'm grateful I hit it before I killed myself or others\n\nAm I the only mom who secretly wishes my kid won't play football?\n\nHer are a couple of things I think can help you make good Thanksgiving choices for your family.\n\nFirst, buy what looks and tastes good and fits your budget. The USDA, FDA and credible experts have concluded that no significant health, nutritional or qualitative differences exist between conventionally-grown foods and organic foods.\n\nSometimes the best looking apple is conventionally grown and sometimes it\u2019s the organic one. If you feel a particularly great looking apple or celery stalk is worth the average 47 percent organic price mark-up, by all means, purchase it. But if you\u2019re making a pie, casserole or stuffing mix, where the shape, color and size doesn\u2019t really matter, cheaper might just be better.\n\nNext, know that commercial farms, including organic farms, use pesticides. By definition pesticides are \u201ctoxic\u201d and can leave residues. However, as with all chemicals \u2014 including water and oxygen \u2014 it is the amount (or \u201cdose\u201d) that matters. USDA- and EPA-approved pesticide levels are set well below anything that could possibly pose a risk to human health or environmental safety.\n\nI pick my produce because of its look, taste, nutritional value and price and don\u2019t avoid healthy fruits and vegetables out of baseless fear. No matter where produce comes from, it should always be thoroughly washed.\n\nFinally, \u201cGMO free\u201d labels really don\u2019t tell you very much. Food producers are utilizing these labels hoping consumers will think a product is safer or healthier. It\u2019s not.\n\nAfter more than 30 years study, analysis and review, USDA, EPA and FDA have repeatedly concluded that no meaningful differences between approved GMOs and non-GMO foods exists. In fact, these labels often end up on food that couldn\u2019t be GMO. For example, I saw the label on orange juice, yet there is no such thing as GMO oranges. So, don\u2019t be conned and don\u2019t pay more than you need to serve a healthy meal.\n\nAt the end of the day, there\u2019s going to be a lot of variety on my Thanksgiving table. Traditional family favorites, one or two new recipes and a good, balanced mix of fresh produce, frozen, canned and prepared foods. And, by knowing what the labels mean and don\u2019t mean, everything I serve \u2014 affordable, conventional or even organic \u2014 will, be safe, nutritious and healthful.

Sundra Rajoo's lawyer tells The Associated Press his client was detained by the Malaysian Anti\u2026 [+749 chars]", "fulltext": "BERN, Switzerland (AP) \u2014 The credibility of FIFA's reshaped ethics committee took a hit Wednesday after a leading judge was arrested on suspicion of corruption in Malaysia and later removed as deputy chairman.\n\nSundra Rajoo has been taken off cases while under investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission for financial wrongdoing in his job leading an arbitration service.\n\n\"(Rajoo) will not be involved in any further activities of the adjudicatory chamber (while under investigation),\" FIFA said in a statement.\n\nThe decision was imposed \"with immediate effect\" by judging panel chairman Vassilios Skouris, FIFA said.\n\nSkouris was picked 18 months ago to replace German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, whose ouster was engineered by FIFA President Gianni Infantino after falling out of favor with the new leadership. FIFA's lead ethics prosecutor, Cornel Borbely, was also forced from office in May 2017.\n\nOne year ago, Rajoo passed an integrity check to be appointed as one of two deputy chairmen of the judging panel. He was proposed by the Asian Football Confederation, which is based in Kuala Lumpur along with the Asian International Arbitration Centre, led by Rajoo until Wednesday.\n\nAlthough Rajoo is currently hanging on to his FIFA role, he resigned from his position with the arbitration service on Wednesday, his lawyer, Cheow Wee, told The Associated Press.\n\nRajoo's lawyer said his client had been detained by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission after returning from FIFA business in Zurich the previous evening. A court refused a request for a seven-day remand order against Rajoo, and he was later released unconditionally, Cheow said.\n\n\"The judge agreed with our position that he (Rajoo) has diplomatic immunity and privileges,\" Cheow said. \"He cannot be arrested nor detained, and isn't subjected to our criminal jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe MACC sought Rajoo's remand to protect and continue its investigation into allegations the ethics judge accepted and used his office for financial favors.\n\nThe MACC could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nSince Rajoo joined FIFA, ethics judges have passed several life bans on soccer officials implicated in bribery by a sprawling U.S. Department of Justice investigation.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee has struggled to gain credibility and demonstrate its statutory independence since wholesale changes in personnel in 2017. While Skouris is a former president of the European Court of Justice, FIFA lead prosecutor Maria Claudia Rojas has been criticized in a European lawmaker's report for lacking experience in leading investigations.\n\nIn the May 2017 changes, Infantino also oversaw the removal of the head of FIFA's governance panel, who oversaw integrity checks on senior officials.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee also was tainted by corruption prior to Infantino's perceived purge. In 2016, Uruguayan lawyer Juan Pedro Damiani resigned as an ethics judge after being implicated in the Panama Papers corruption case. He had been a holdover from FIFA judicial bodies during Sepp Blatter's 18-year presidency.\n\n___\n\nNg reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Paradise could see up to four inches of rain Wednesday to Friday. Because of the precipitation, hundreds of workers who are scouring the areas are looking for remains of victims before the rain washes them away. Other problems include slippery roads and downpours, along with flash floods, ash flows and mudslides because the blackened earth won't be able to absorb the water. Still, the rains are expected to provide a huge boost for firefighters battling the historic Camp Fire, which was 70 percent contained as of early Tuesday.\n\nLeBron returns to Cleveland for first time since joining Lakers\n\nWhen LeBron James left the Cleveland Cavaliers and took his talents to South Beach to join the Miami Heat in 2010, fans were understandably upset. When he made his first return to Cleveland\u2019s Quicken Loans Arena on Dec. 2, 2010, it was an unforgettable night for all the wrong reasons. James left the Cavaliers for a second time this summer, this time for the Los Angeles Lakers. The four-time MVP returns to Cleveland again Wednesday night as the Lakers take on the Cavaliers (8 p.m. ET, ESPN). It will be the Lakers\u2019 only game in Cleveland this year.\n\nInterpol elects new president, thwarting Russian bid to lead\n\nInterpol elected South Korea's Kim Jong-yang as its new president Wednesday. Kim's election - during Interpol's annual general assembly in Dubai - averted a crisis because it thwarted efforts by Russia to lead the international police body. Russian national Alexander Prokopchuck, a senior general who for the past 12 years has been the head of Moscow\u2019s national Interpol bureau, was widely tipped to win the post. Prokopchuck is close to the Kremlin and has been accused of routinely abusing Interpol's Red Notice system \u2013 global arrest warrants \u2013 to target critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The prospect of a Russian sitting atop the international police organization raised red flags in Washington and among critics of the Kremlin who believed Putin would have further tried to aggressively influence Interpol to go after his political opponents. Kim, 57, was previously an Interpol vice president for Asia. Until his election, he was serving as acting Interpol president following the disappearance of Meng Hongwei, who ran Interpol before vanishing in China two months ago.\n\nMichael B. Jordan is back for round two\n\nJust in time for a family-filled weekend, \"Creed II,\" the sequel to Ryan Coogler\u2019s surprise 2015 hit and 1985\u2019s \u201cRocky IV,\u201d hits theaters nationwide on Wednesday. There are jabs, hooks and haymakers aplenty, but the drama outside the boxing ring packs the most punch in the film, starring Michael B. Jordan alongside his grizzled mentor, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). One thing that may stand out on the big screen: Jordan's chiseled physique. The newest \"Rocky\" spinoff features Jordan's body even more ripped than in \"Black Panther\" and the first \"Creed.\" And it took a lot of work to get there.\n\nCLOSE Michael B. Jordan was in great shape for \"Black Panther,\" but switched up his routine for the \"Creed II,\" the latest \"Rocky\" film with Sly Stallone.

(Photo: Bastiaan Slabbers/epa-EFE)\n\nDemocrats are understandably overjoyed at retaking the House of Representatives. Although Republicans retained the Senate, it was only due to an unusually favorable lineup of races that made a Democratic takeover virtually impossible. If Donald Trump runs for re-election, however, he promises to be an albatross around every Republican\u2019s neck, given his dismal and declining approval ratings. The Democratic nominee will have the wind at his or her back even with the traditional benefits of incumbency Trump will enjoy.\n\nBut there are many factors that can easily be seen on the horizon that are certain to impact the 2020 race and affect both parties.\n\nFirst, obviously, is the Mueller investigation. Even if the president himself escapes indictment, it is almost certain to ensnare many of those close to him, both now and during the 2016 campaign. I think the indictments themselves are perhaps less important than the evidence behind them, which may paint a picture of corruption that will burden the entire Republican Party as Watergate did.\n\nRushing into investigations could be disastrous\n\nSecond, Democrats now have control of the House\u2019s investigative machinery. Republicans have used their control of congressional committees for several years to smear Democrats like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, giving official credence to crackpot conspiracy theories originating in the internet cesspool. They have also used their control to cover up and bottle up investigations of Trump and the widespread corruption in his Cabinet.\n\nDemocrats expect to begin their investigations of the Trump regime as soon as Congress reconvenes in January. But they should not expect too much, too soon, for several reasons. One is that the House's committee staff has been severely cut since the days of Watergate, and it will take time to hire experienced investigators and let them do their job. Just look at how long special counsel Robert Mueller has taken.\n\nRushing into hearings and issuing subpoenas without adequate preparation could be disastrous for Democrats. Remember how the Ollie North hearings backfired in 1987? Good hearings must be based on thorough research in advance \u2014 ideally you don\u2019t want members asking any questions they don\u2019t already know the answers to. That means taking all the time necessary for a thorough investigation by competent professionals first.\n\nMore: Democrats should drop 'subpoena cannon' talk about Trump, learn from Republican mistakes\n\nReady for big drama over spending and debt? Next two years will be brutal.\n\nNew Democratic House of Representatives will soon learn the limits of its power\n\nAdditionally, Democrats should not be sanguine about their newly acquired subpoena power. Trump can and probably will assert \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d to withhold documents and prevent administration officials from testifying. The Department of Justice will undoubtedly fight many subpoenas in court, and newly confirmed Republican judges may rule favorably for Trump. Even if such efforts fail, they will eat up a lot of time. Therefore, it will probably take many months at least before House investigations bear political fruit.\n\nThird, it is beginning to look almost certain that there will be a recession before 2020. Whatever stimulus there was in the tax cut is already wearing off, and there wasn\u2019t much to begin with. The expansion is long past its sell date, by historical standards. It began in June 2009 and has lasted 113 months, making it the second longest expansion in history. While expansions don\u2019t necessarily die of old age, there is no reason to believe that the business cycle has been repealed.\n\nGOP will hamstring Dems with bad economy\n\nThe next recession could be a particularly bad one, too, because Republicans will be loath to take even the modest countercyclical measures that President George W. Bush supported in 2007 and 2008. Especially if it looks likely that a Democrat will win in 2020, Republicans might intentionally sabotage the economy so that they can blame the downturn on Democrats, just as they blamed the last one on President Barack Obama, even though it began in December 2007, according to the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nNor can the economy expect much help from the Federal Reserve. Interest rates are still low by historical standards, so there is little potential stimulus available from cutting them. And Trump has foolishly appointed several inflation hawks to the Federal Reserve Board who will resist monetary expansion of the sort that mitigated the last recession.\n\nFourth, Democrats will be hamstrung by the budget deficit Republicans have bequeathed to them, courtesy of a tax cut that will drain $1.9 trillion in revenue while simultaneously jacking up interest on the debt. It\u2019s a sure thing that Republicans will gin up another budget crisis the minute Democrats have some power. Trump\u2019s veto pen and Senate control mean that taxes cannot be raised. Therefore, Democrats will be forced into a budgetary corner where cutting Social Security and Medicare will appear to be the only options available.\n\nIt\u2019s very likely that even if Democrats are successful at the polls in 2020, they could inherit an economic situation so dire it will be impossible to turn around before 2022, when Republicans can start to pick up the pieces again as they did in 2010.\n\nI\u2019m not sure there is a way out of this trap, but knowing it is there is the first step toward heading it off.\n\nBruce Bartlett worked on Capitol Hill, at the Treasury Department and the White House for many years.

The government has to protect them,\" Viswanathan said.\n\nPoachers are known to fish illegally in the waters around the island, catching turtles and diving for lobsters and sea cucumbers. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/21/american-believed-killed-isolated-tribe-north-sentinel-island-india/2076608002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Vic Open on LPGA Tour next year, also on men's European tour", "description": "Golf Australia says the 2019 Vic Open, which features both men and women playing simultaneously, will be co-sanctioned by the LPGA Tour", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2018/11/21/vic-open-on-lpga-tour-next-year-also-on-mens-european-tour/38577925/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T07:55:01Z", "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) Golf Australia says the 2019 Vic Open, which features both men and women playing simultaneously, will be co-sanctioned by the LPGA Tour.

Now, we average 1,000 guys a year activating benefits,\" says Bahati VanPelt, the executive director of The Trust. \"The average increases every year by the month. We saw a surge and then it was steady and now we're in the next wave.\"\n\nFormer players have gone from virtually unaware to heavily involved in The Trust, which according to the NFL Players Association, \"provides transitioning football players with the support they need to ensure their success off the field and in life.\"\n\nHow did the flow of knowledge happen?\n\n\"We have the resources designed to meet the former players' needs,\" VanPelt explains. \"Referrals from guys who already are participating in The Trust have been significant. Players' association reps on teams and the executive committee and players' directors are getting the message out and providing information about The Trust. It's mentioned at every team meeting with the NFLPA.\n\n\"And the high player referrals indicate we are serving former players in the correct way.\"\n\nThe Trust, which started with seven full-time employees and now has 22, serves those players who earned two or more credited seasons in the NFL in dozens of ways. Most critical are such programs as:\n\n\u2014Medical/Wellness ; Brain and Body Assessments.\n\nBrain and Body Assessments are provided for men who played in the league in the past 15 years. Such prestigious partners as Cleveland Clinic, Tulane University, Massachusetts General Hospital, The Pickup Family Neurosciences Institute, and Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, offer a set of screenings and tests designed to helping develop and maintain a healthy brain and body.\n\nEvaluations with a sports medicine psychiatrist, sports psychology counseling, and cognitive and neuropsychological consults are also available. Similar to Brain and Body Assessments, Milestone Wellness Assessments are designed to assess the health needs of former players who have been removed from the NFL for 15 or more years.\n\n\"With the assessments, we opened the door to the guys who are after the window of 15 years, which is a lot of players; a majority is outside that window,\" says former NFL tight end Anthony Becht, now a \"captain\" who mentors and advises former players on transition issues. \"They have needs and we have provided them with a great opportunity to get that head to toe, a medical a la carte opportunity.\n\n\"From cognitive to heart to colon at very established medical institutions, these guys can see a way to have a baseline of good health for their private use.\"\n\n\u2014Education\n\nThe Trust has programs for undergraduate and graduate degree completion and vocational training, and includes a scholarship for meeting those goals. Former players can identify and target their educational options and goals and set a road map to successful completion.\n\n\"What are you interested in and how can you go about it?\" asks NFLPA President Eric Wharton, who currently is attending Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania through a Trust scholarship. \"We always had this path in football: If I play well in high school, I will go to college. If I play well in college, I can got to the pros. And if I play well, I can, stay there. Now, it's sort of like what is this next path?\n\n\"The Trust is trying to create those paths. If I want to be in 'X' industry, I can go back to school and get placed there, whatever it might be. We're still trying to make it bigger, be more successful in getting guys back to school and creating initiative for the rest of their lives.\"\n\n\u2014Careers\n\nThe Trust has partnered with AthLife, Babson College, and Lee Hecht Harrison to help former NFLers \u2014 whether they already have finished their educations or utilize the scholarship program \u2014 to move into other fields of endeavor.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be some executive role,\" Winston notes. \"They could start or get into a niche business, too. And it gives them a lot of purpose and flexibility, and keeps them busy and provides so much self-worth.\"\n\n\u2014Financial\n\nThrough partnerships with Financial Finesse, The Trust provides financial education on a variety of levels. Don't think this isn't critical. Yes, many players \u2014 though not the majority \u2014 have earned huge salaries in the league. That doesn't mean they've acquired the skills to manage their money properly.\n\nThe key for The Trust is assisting with the management of the money they made.\n\n\"Whether you have money saved or successful stuff off the field or kind of played several years and made decent money, whatever your angle may be \u2014 even guys who never saved anything,\" Becht says, \"they all go through a withdrawal period and they are not sure about the future ... the finances. How do you turn the page and get your life on a new schedule? We try to help them see it from every avenue.\"\n\n\u2014Lifestyle\n\nOne thing pro athletes are accustomed to is being in shape. And trying to stay in shape.\n\nThe Trust has partnerships with EXOS and the YMCA to help the former players remain fit.\n\nEach year, The Trust's budget increases by 5 percent due to an escalator in the collective bargaining agreement, which expires in early 2021. All of it gets spent yearly.\n\n\"We are nonprofit based,\" VanPelt says. \"What comes in must be spent on benefits, services and resources for former players.\"\n\nVanPelt expects those services and resources to continue being expanded annually. The Trust has made big steps with a free agency program that helps players no longer on rosters but still hoping to continue their careers.\n\n\"The numbers have exploded out in terms of engagements,\" Winston says. \"The Trust offers a full suite of services ... and when you count up and see what guys are using ... 1,500 scholarships, over $12.2 million for guys just to go back to school.\n\n\"I can't stress enough how difficult it is to run a full suite of services like that. Just think about only trying to help transition, and then another program with scholarships and then to get placed from there, that's not an easy task.\n\n\"We all use our resources to try to amplify the positive effects we can create. It is a grind, not easy work.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Maisha Scott thought she and her husband, former NFL defensive back Bryan Scott, handled the end of his playing career very well.\n\nThey invested in franchises, including a boxing club. Bryan Scott appeared on the TV show \"Shark Tank\" and got Mark Cuban to invest in a business, and he also took part in a Breakfast Club program that helps former players stay healthy.\n\nThen the Scotts went to an NFL Player Engagement program called Bridge to Success.\n\n\"I wish I would've known what we would have gotten out of it when my husband first came out of the league,\" Maisha Scott said. \"And I probably wouldn't drop the ball in some of the areas where I thought, 'Oh you know, he's fine. He's fine because he's busy, and he's active and he's doing something else that he loves, and you know I didn't really realize that he needed that brotherhood of support and other guys needed to hear his story as well.\"\n\nMore than 150 former NFL players and their spouses or partners attended the fourth annual Bridge to Success Oct. from 26-29 in Orlando.\n\nBridge to Success features panel discussions, breakout sessions, networking and personalized mentorships to help create individual game plans for each couple. Men receive help making the transition from being players to the next career, financial planning, learn about their NFL benefits and other available resources. Seminars even cover building a better LinkedIn profile and interviews with more than 40 Fortune 500 companies on the final day.\n\nWives and significant others also attend the sessions and receive the support often lost for themselves when a husband or boyfriend's NFL career ends. No more NFL games also means no more Bible studies or charity events with the other wives on a team.\n\n\"The transition is a process for significant others as well as for the players,\" said Rachel Terrill, whose husband Craig played seven seasons with Seattle. \"So letting the other significant others know that they were not alone in their transition and that we were there for them as well, and that we, too, experienced that shift of identity in football or that I, too, experienced a shift of identity when football was over, helps them feel more connected.\"\n\nThe Terrills signed up to attend the first Bridge to Success in 2016. Then Terrill was asked to speak as a professor with a Ph.D in communication from South Florida. She now has presented sessions for wives and significant others at the past two Bridge programs, and they have their own Facebook page now to stay in touch.\n\n\"Couples who attend together, they get to dream together,\" Terrill said. \"They get to reflect together, they learn about new ideas and new career paths and new options. They get to dream of their future, plan their future. And also we give them the relationship tips that can help keep their marriage strong, so they're leaving closer than ever, turning toward each other and looking forward toward the future.\"\n\nA second-generation former NFL player, Freddie Scott is among eight transition coaches with the program. Each went through more than a year of training and certification in areas including mental health issues and identifying depression, and they lead breakout sessions working with former players.\n\nScott said the Bridge program is a lifeline many players didn't know existed after being released. Some attend not knowing what they want to do next, including one man on crutches recovering from knee surgery. Scott helped identify careers that fit the man's personality.\n\n\"And just a look on his face of finally finding something that makes sense was just a breath of fresh air for him,\" Scott said.\n\nScott knows personally how challenging leaving the NFL can be. He watched his father, Freddie, play 11 seasons with the Baltimore Colts and Detroit Lions and sign one of the first contracts with Nike. Scott expected a similar career before a torn hamstring ended his after three seasons and two teams.\n\n\"I didn't know that that was my last day in the locker room, and that's what makes it so difficult,\" said Scott, who now lives in Tennessee.\n\nSome men who attended the program hadn't fully accepted that their careers truly were over, so many come back again to catch up.\n\n\"That's what unlocks the path to be able to transition,\" Scott said. \"If you don't connect with that you're going to be stuck emotionally in that place, and nothing else is going to make sense because you never really connected with anything. So I think that's the fact, that it is so difficult. But it's difficult for everyone has given us the best practice of how to be able to walk almost anyone through that process of transition.\"\n\nMaisha Scott is among those helping spread the word about Bridge to Success, and she wants to return for a \"tuneup.\" She says she and her husband might not have made some mistakes in business if the Bridge to Success had been available when they started. They also went home to Georgia with a new plan from re-evaluating their franchises to the time they spend with family and stay healthy.\n\nAside from the money-saving tips, Bridge to Success' biggest benefit easily is personal.\n\n\"I heard so many wives say, 'My husband hasn't opened up this much, I haven't seen my husband this happy, I haven't seen my husband this excited,'\" Maisha Scott said. \"And I know that that program is saving marriages. I know that it's saving lives. It is that rich and that incredible.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Associated Press polled a panel of WNBA coaches and general managers for a mock draft of the first round this spring. Panelists were limited to college seniors and eligible foreign players, and they could not offer a pick for their own team. While last season there was a clear-cut No. 1 in A'ja Wilson, there is no consensus top pick this year.\n\nThe AP will periodically update the draft board.\n\nFirst Round:\n\nLas Vegas: Teaira McCowan , Mississippi State. The Aces franchise has the No. 1 pick for the third year in a row and can add a dominant post player to complement Wilson.\n\nNew York: Asia Durr , Louisville. The Liberty have many holes to fill. Getting a scoring guard who can create her own shot would help.\n\nIndiana: Kalani Brown , Baylor. The Fever could use a big post player, and the 6-foot-8 Brown would fill that role well.\n\nChicago: Napheesa Collier , UConn. New coach James Wade could add another strong wing to the young nucleus the Sky are building.\n\nDallas: Katie Lou Samuelson , UConn. Would give Dallas a much-needed consistent threat from the outside to potentially complement Liz Cambage and Skylar Diggins.\n\nMinnesota: Arike Ogunbowale , Notre Dame. Definitely knows how to hit the big shot after connecting on game-winners in the Final Four and NCAA title game last season.\n\nLos Angeles: Sophia Cunningham , Missouri. The 6-foot-1 Cunningham was an All-SEC pick last season who averaged 18.5 points and 4.7 rebounds. She could provide another offensive spark.\n\nPhoenix: Kristine Anigwe , California. Would give Phoenix an athletic post player who knows how to score and rebound. She has had a dynamic start to her senior year, putting up 61 points and 35 rebounds combined in the first two games.\n\nConnecticut: Xu Han , China. The 19-year-old Chinese star had 20 points against the U.S. in the FIBA World Cup in September. She's 6-foot-9 and only starting to tap into her talent. She might be a few years away for coach Curt Miller, but could be a nice find.\n\nWashington: Ezi Magbegor , Australia. Decided to play professional basketball at home instead of going to a U.S. college. She's 6-foot-4 and athletic and will be a difficult guard for opposing teams. She'd give coach Mike Thibault another solid post player to go along with LaToya Sanders.\n\nAtlanta: Jessica Shepard , Notre Dame. A terrific rebounder and scorer, Shepard showed last season at Notre Dame she can compete against elite-level players. She was instrumental in the Irish winning the national championship.\n\nSeattle: Caliya Robinson , Georgia. A 6-foot-3 shot blocker who can also score would give Seattle another solid post player to go with Natasha Howard.\n\n___\n\nOthers receiving consideration: Kenisha Bell , Minnesota; Cierra Dillard , Buffalo, Megan Gustafson , Iowa; Anriel Howard , Mississippi State; Brianna Turner , Notre Dame.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But we just kept at it,\" Dickerson said.\n\nDickerson overcame his early misses around the rim to score a season-high 24 points, Jaylen Nowell added 14 points, and Washington overcame foul trouble and terrible shooting in the first half to rally for a 71-67 win over Texas A&M on Tuesday night.\n\nTrailing by as many as 13 in the first half, Washington (4-1) found its shooting touch in the second half and its zone defense started to cause problems for the Aggies. The Huskies shot 50 percent in the second half and held Texas A&M to just three made baskets over the final 11 \u00bd minutes. Texas A&M led 55-48 after Christian Mekowulu's dunk, but the Aggies scored just 11 points the rest of the way.\n\n\"We took it upon ourselves to make sure they couldn't gap and get into the paint and once we stopped that they had a hard time scoring,\" Dickerson said.\n\nDickerson was a menace both scoring and on the glass. He finished with 17 rebounds, 11 at the offensive end. Dickerson made 7 of 19 shots and was 10 of 17 at the free-throw line.\n\n\"He just kept playing and he didn't get frustrated if he didn't make it. It was just keep battling, keep going at it and he did,\" Washington coach Mike Hopkins said.\n\nBut Dickerson missed a chance to seal the victory missing a pair of free throws with seven seconds left and the Huskies leading 69-66.\n\nThe Huskies fouled Jay Jay Chandler with 3.3 seconds remaining. He made the first free throw, intentionally missed the second but a lane violation by Chandler gave possession to Washington. Matisse Thybulle was fouled and hit both free throws to seal the victory.\n\nChandler led Texas A&M (1-4) with 21 points and TJ Starks added 17. The Aggies led by as many as 13 in the first half, their guards able to penetrate Washington's zone defense and either score at the rim or find open shooters. But those lanes closed in the second half and Washington was better offensively.\n\n\"We really struggled guarding Dickerson and once we missed some easy shots at the free-throw line we got a little bit tighter in our shot selection,\" Texas A&M coach Billy Kennedy said.\n\nWashington shot a putrid 23 percent in the first half but were still within five at the break after Dominic Green's corner 3-pointer at the buzzer. Its big rally started after Mekowulu's dunk, with Green banking in a 3-pointer to begin a 11-0 run Dickerson's three-point play gave Washington its first lead at 56-55 and David Crisp followed with a 3-pointer.\n\nBut the final minutes became a challenge for the Huskies. Washington was 8 of 15 on free throws over the final 6 \u00bd minutes. Washington extended its lead to 66-62 after Nowell's free throw and Thybulle made a huge defensive play off a Washington turnover, chasing down Chandler's layup attempt, blocking the shot off Chandler and out of bounds to the Huskies. The sequence and turnover forced by Thybulle proved critical in the Huskies holding on.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTexas A&M: The Aggies had a forgettable trip to the Northwest. After losing to No. 3 Gonzaga and dropping the opening game to Minnesota in Vancouver, they were hoping to salvage at least one game of the trip. The Aggies have lost four straight.\n\n\"We just played three really good teams when you look at Gonzaga ... Minnesota and Washington. Very few people play that type of schedule and our team got better,\" Kennedy said.\n\nWashington: Dickerson approached his career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds. He's scored 28 points twice and had 22 rebounds last season against Eastern Washington. But aside from Dickerson and Nowell no other Washington player scored more than eight points.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexas A&M: The Aggies return home to host South Alabama on Friday.\n\nWashington: The Huskies face Minnesota in the final game of the tournament on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Spencer Dinwiddie is wearing art on his feet this season.\n\nIt's for a good cause.\n\nThe Brooklyn guard is planning to have a different set of sneakers in every game this year, paying tribute to either various people or causes on that particular night. On Tuesday in Miami, his shoes were an homage to Heat guard Dwyane Wade \u2014 and Dinwiddie proudly got one of his childhood idols to sign the kicks afterward.\n\nAnd they were truly one-of-a-kind: The words \"One Last Dance\" were across the tongues of the shoes, a nod to what Wade is calling his 16th and final NBA season. There were images of palm trees, a Miami signature, as well as the No. 3 that Wade has worn on his jersey for the entirety of his time with the Heat.\n\n\"I knew when the schedule came out and he had said this is his last year, that we had to do something special,\" Dinwiddie said after Brooklyn's 104-92 victory.\n\nDinwiddie isn't keeping the Wade-themed shoes or any others this season. They're all getting auctioned off for charities that support causes that help children.\n\n\"Tribute to a legend that deserves his farewell tour!\" Dinwiddie wrote on Instagram when he posted an image of the Wade shoes. \"And the only current player that will be a part of this journey this season.\"\n\nWade was moved by the gesture.\n\n\"They were cool,\" he said after meeting with Dinwiddie postgame.\n\nDinwiddie and Wade were briefly teammates in Chicago two seasons ago, and the Nets guard considers the Heat star one of the three greatest shooting guards in NBA history. Dinwiddie expressed his admiration to Wade again in their postgame chat.\n\n\"I said you deserve everything and thank you for allowing me to do this,\" Dinwiddie said.\n\nHe's already had some memorable ones this season \u2014 \"Purple Rain\" sneakers for a game at Minnesota in a tribute to legendary singer Prince, other pairs that were tributes to Colin Kaepernick (for a game against Golden State, which certainly got noticed in the Bay Area where Kaepernick played for the 49ers) and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, a pair for Muhammad Ali , even ones that celebrated the accomplishments of Cheryl Miller.\n\nHe even had a pair that celebrated the logos of various media outlets. And last week, when comic legend and Marvel icon Stan Lee \u2014 a huge figure in the entertainment world \u2014 died, Dinwiddie had sneakers to honor him as well.\n\nAdding Wade to that list was an easy call.\n\n\"It was kind of a no-brainer,\" Dinwiddie said.\n\nDinwiddie is doing all of this in conjunction with his family's foundation.\n\n\"Our focus is the youth and our family's legacy has been entrenched in supporting the youth we encounter for generations now,\" he wrote earlier this season. \"So I honor the legacy of my family as well with every pair. Whether I'm sneaker king at the end of this season or not this thing is so much bigger than basketball.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That was the program's worst scoring defense since the 1994-95 season and worst field-goal percentage defense since 1992-93. Not coincidentally, those Badgers won 15 games and missed the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1998.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wisconsin (4-0) held the Cardinal to 27 percent and didn't allow a field goal in the last 6:53 of a game when they didn't shoot well themselves (43 percent, 1 for 8 from 3-point range). That last basket was a 3-pointer by KZ Okpala to pull the Cardinal (2-2) to within 44-42, but the Badgers scored 18 of the final 22 points to pull away.\n\nIt was the lowest shooting percentage allowed by Wisconsin against a power-5 or Big East opponent since holding Virginia to 23.4 percent in December 2013.\n\n\"They do a nice job of packing it in,\" Stanford coach Jerod Haase said. \"They did a nice job of being physical on our drives. And when we did get to the paint, I would say there were a variety of times where we shot challenged shots where we really didn't have to.\"\n\nThat's where Wisconsin's 6-foot-10 sophomore Nate Reuvers came in, blocking a tournament-record nine shots \u2014 tying a program record \u2014 primarily by rotating to help at the rim.\n\n\"Before the game, Coach was talking about if a guy has a mistake on defense, we had to cover for each other,\" he said.\n\nHe listened. So did the rest of the Badgers, for that matter.\n\n\"You talk about these things all the time,\" Gard said, \"but then when they have a game play out that way, it cements the belief in how we're doing things and allows their confidence. Everybody always talks about confidence in an offensive end ... but that can be flipped to the other end of the floor too.\"\n\nNO. 4 VIRGINIA 74, MIDDLE TENNESSEE 52\n\nDe'Andre Hunter was everywhere for fourth-ranked Virginia, finishing with 15 points, eight rebounds and a career-high nine assists.\n\n\"I thought De'Andre's completeness showed offensively and defensively,\" Virginia coach Tony Bennett said.\n\nThe 6-7 sophomore's size and athleticism caused problems for the Blue Raiders on the perimeter.\n\n\"We really spaced the floor (against) the 1-3-1 press,\" Hunter said. \"And I was just looking for my shot when the guys kicked it to me in the corner.\"\n\nKyle Guy also scored 15 points for the Cavaliers (4-0), who led 9-0 and 30-9. But they needed Guy's 3-pointer to start a 9-0 run after the Blue Raiders had clawed to within 38-30 early in the second half.\n\nAntonio Green scored 11 points to lead Middle Tennessee (3-2), which shot 39 percent.\n\nThe Cavaliers advanced to Thursday's semifinals to face Dayton, while the Blue Raiders will face Butler in the consolation bracket.\n\nOKLAHOMA 65, FLORIDA 60\n\nChristian James scored 18 points to help Oklahoma earn a matchup with Wisconsin in the semifinals.\n\nAaron Calixte hit two clinching free throws with 5.0 seconds left for the Sooners (4-0), who led by 11 in the first half and 63-54 with 3:38 left before holding off the Gators' late rally. And Oklahoma helped itself by taking a 48-34 rebounding advantage.\n\nReserve Dontay Bassett had 14 points for the Gators (2-2), who hit a season-high 11 3-pointers. But Gators had to work awfully hard to find any offensive flow and made 3 of 11 free throws.\n\n\"I don't think we're a team with a bunch of swagger right now,\" Florida coach Mike White said. \"I think confidence is a big issue with this team right now. It's something that we've got to get to the bottom of.\"\n\nFlorida will face Stanford in Thursday's consolation bracket.\n\nDAYTON 69, BUTLER 64\n\nJalen Crutcher scored 20 points and Josh Cunningham added 18 to help the Flyers advance to face Virginia in Thursday's semifinals. Dayton (4-0) never trailed and shot 54 percent against the Bulldogs (3-1).\n\nPaul Jorgensen and Sean McDermott each scored 18 points to lead Butler, but high-scoring guard Kamar Baldwin finished with 11 on 5-for-17 shooting after coming in averaging 23.3 points.\n\nButler will face Middle Tennessee in Thursday's consolation bracket.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Puskar) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPeter Chiarelli didn't feel like he could wait another day.\n\nThe Edmonton general manager didn't sleep well after another tough loss, put the wheels in motion to replace coach Todd McLellan with Ken Hitchcock and made the move on Tuesday \u2014 a game day. After no in-season coaching changes around the NHL last season, there have now been four in less than three weeks.\n\nThe standings are still so close and volatile that it's almost never too soon to decide to fire an NHL coach.\n\n\"Unfortunately as it is, that's the way it's trending,\" Chiarelli said. \"The margins are thin and you look for edges and that's one of them.\"\n\nLos Angeles fired John Stevens on Nov. 4, Chicago fired three-time Stanley Cup winner Joel Quenneville two days later, St. Louis dismissed Mike Yeo late Monday and Edmonton followed suit with McLellan on Tuesday morning. The Kings had played 13 games, the Blackhawks 15, the Blues 19 and the Oilers 20, but it is no longer surprising to see such a drastic move before the quarter mark of the season.\n\nHall of Fame defenseman Scott Stevens, now an NHL Network analyst, won the Stanley Cup as a player after a late-season coaching change and took over as co-head coach with New Jersey during the 2014-15 season. He said he was only caught off-guard by Quenneville's firing and understands why so many GMs are pulling the trigger so early.\n\n\"I think a lot of times the GM has the pulse of everything that's going on and knows when the time's right to make that move,\" Stevens said. \"I believe every team thinks they have a chance to win the Stanley Cup. ... Everyone feels they have a chance to win, and sometimes you just need a little luck.\"\n\nOr at least a big change.\n\n\"You can't trade every player, so they fire the coach to try to get everybody's attention,\" NBC Sports analyst Pierre McGuire said.\n\nThe calendar got Chiarelli's attention because Thanksgiving typically serves as a barometer of which teams will make the playoffs. It's an uphill climb for Hitchcock, the Kings' Willie Desjardins , Blackhawks' Jeremy Colliton and Blues' Craig Berube to try to lift their teams out of rough starts and make it.\n\nSometimes, interim or replacement coaches are wildly successful after arriving during the season. The Penguins in 2009 with Dan Bylsma and 2016 with Mike Sullivan and the Kings in 2012 with Darryl Sutter won the Cup. The Flyers in 2010 with Peter Laviolette reached the final.\n\nMcGuire, himself a midseason replacement with the Hartford Whalers in the 1990s, said he believes this recent run of firings has something to do with the Vegas Golden Knights reaching the final last season as an expansion team, causing frustration around the league about quick results. Still, early-season coach firings are a time-tested part of the NHL.\n\n\"Coaching changes right around this time made huge differences,\" McGuire said. \"People look at this over history and they say this can happen. Pittsburgh and L.A. are good examples of that.\"\n\nUPPER HAND SHORTHANDED\n\nThe Arizona Coyotes have killed off a league-best 91.7 percent of power plays, and their 10 short-handed goals are six more than the next-closest team. Michael Grabner has four, Brad Richardson three and Arizona has only allowed five power-play goals through its first 19 games.\n\nCoach Rick Tocchet said Grabner, Richardson and his other penalty killers have done an excellent job of applying pressure with three players and the fourth making smart reads to take it the other way.\n\n\"Especially for PK guys, they really have a good hockey IQ on knowing when to attack pressure,\" Tocchet said. \"The guys have done a nice job, like Richardson and Grabner especially, of making really good reads on when there's a time to pressure and where that read is going to be.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nIt's almost time for reflection in season-long fantasy leagues, but not in daily.\n\nAs the playoff races heat up, so do the prize pools in daily fantasy and we can still gain an edge by looking in-depth at some of the teams in the best position to succeed in Week 12. Leveraging Vegas implied team totals we can look at some of the offenses expected to score the most points with a filter on which teams have more heavily concentrated offenses.\n\nWhile a balanced game plan can be fruitful for NFL teams, fantasy owners are looking for value from more concentrated attacks. There are four spots this week to key on that each have their own puzzle to solve.\n\nThe New England Patriots have a 28-point implied total and yet not a single player projects as a top value on DailyRoto relative to their daily fantasy salary. While the Patriots have funneled 50 percent of the passing targets to James White and Julian Edelman, the offense projects to be very diverse coming off the bye week. The emerging role of Josh Gordon plus returns for Sony Michel and Rob Gronkowski should all improve New England's on-field performance, but could frustrate fantasy owners. Despite the strong brand names, the Patriots are not a must-have fantasy attack for Week 12.\n\nThe Chargers have a 28-point team total and should offer more a more concentrated offense. Wide receiver Keenan Allen and running back Melvin Gordon represent nearly 50 percent of Philip Rivers' passing targets, with Gordon also commanding 60 percent of the ground attack. In the three games since the bye, Gordon has received more than 20 opportunities via the ground or passing attack with Allen averaging double-digit targets over the same stretch. Both Gordon and Allen are exceptional Week 12 daily values in a high total game with a heavily concentrated attack and can be paired up with Philip Rivers in tournaments, as all three project for 20 or more fantasy points. The Chargers are a good target for single entry DFS players.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts both have team totals around 30 points and the highest projected team scoring on the entire Sunday slate of games. On top of this, both teams are projected to run nearly 65 plays each and feature a high volume passing attack. Jameis Winston and Andrew Luck are in perfect positions to put up massive fantasy scores and project as the QB1 and QB2 in DailyRoto NFL projections. The challenge with both of these offenses is their diversity can be a challenge if trying to build one DFS lineup.\n\nMike Evans and T.Y. Hilton average around 20 percent of their team's targets but that is not the same dominant market share we expect from No. 1 receivers on other teams like Michael Thomas, Deandre Hopkins or Odell Beckham Jr. Instead, the Colts spread the ball with seven different options receiving 10 percent or more targets, while the Bucs attack is distributed through five primary receivers. The Colts and Bucs are perhaps better saved for DFS owners who are looking to build multiple lineups. By mixing and matching Luck and Winston with different sets of receivers, you are able to capture exposure to their team total and fantasy upside without having to hone in on one spot.\n\nVegas totals can be a great indicator of where there is fantasy goodness, just make sure you peel back the layers when setting your Week 12 DFS lineups.\n\n___\n\nFor more daily fantasy advice and tools, visit DailyRoto: https://dailyroto.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers responded the right way to a wakeup call after coach Todd McLellan was fired just hours before they took the ice.\n\nMcDavid scored his 100th career goal and set up Leon Draisaitl's game-winner 51 seconds into overtime to give the Oilers a 4-3 victory against the San Jose Sharks in Ken Hitchcock's first game as coach Tuesday night.\n\n\"That's what it has to be,\" McDavid said. \"Anytime you bring in a new coach, that's kind of the last option I would say before shipping everyone out. This is a chance for us to come together and turn this around.\"\n\nThe Oilers started that process by overcoming three deficits to earn just their second win in eight games.\n\nMcDavid set up Drake Caggiula's tying goal early in the third period and then the winner in overtime when his pass ricocheted off defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic before hitting Draisaitl's skate and trickling past goalie Martin Jones.\n\n\"I was more worried that it was past my bedtime and I wasn't going to be able to stay up,\" Hitchcock said. \"I don't think I've seen a third period all year out West. But for me, we just got better and better as the game went on. We got better in the second; we were really good in the third. We really got on the grind.\"\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins added a short-handed goal and Mikko Koskinen made 22 saves.\n\nJoe Thornton assisted on Marcus Sorensen's goal in the first period to tie Mario Lemieux for 11th place all-time with his 1,033rd helper. Joonas Donskoi and Logan Couture also scored for San Jose.\n\n\"Tonight's a disappointing one because I thought if we had gotten a little bit better effort from everybody, from 20 guys, we should have gotten two points,\" coach Peter DeBoer said. \"We didn't have enough participants tonight. We didn't play well enough for long enough stretches. It wasn't one or two guys, it was almost everybody.\"\n\nThe Sharks took a 3-2 lead in the final minute of the second period when Couture deked Adam Larsson on the rush and beat Koskinen for his first goal in 11 games.\n\nBut the Oilers responded early in the third when McDavid set up Caggiula on an odd-man rush for the equalizer less than four minutes into the period.\n\n\"There are too many odd-man rushes,\" Couture said. \"It wasn't horrible tonight. It was better than it has been, but still too many. Especially when you are out there against Connor. You can't give them that many chances. He's their best player.\"\n\nThe Hitchcock era got off to a rough start for the Oilers, who allowed a goal in the opening minute when Donskoi was left alone in front of the net after a faceoff win by San Jose. Brent Burns' shot from the point was stopped by Koskinen, but Donskoi was able to backhand the rebound in.\n\nMcDavid got the equalizer midway through the period when he beat Burns down the slot to take a feed from Draisaitl and knocked it in for his milestone goal. McDavid reached the mark in his 230th game. Only Wayne Gretzky (145 games), Glenn Anderson (183) and Jari Kurri (214) got there faster for the Oilers.\n\nThornton then reached his milestone later in the period when he fed Sorensen from behind the goal line for a one-timer that beat Koskinen.\n\nEdmonton tied the game early in the second when Nugent-Hopkins converted a 2-on-1 off a feed from Kyle Brodziak after the Sharks turned the puck over in the offensive zone on a power play.\n\n\"Obviously it says something about your team, that you need to start playing better,\" Nugent-Hopkins said. \"We need to make a push here now. Our last eight or so games haven't been good enough. I felt tonight we responded well, so we just have to keep that going.\"\n\nNOTES: McDavid has 31 points, becoming the first Oilers player to reach 30 in 21 or fewer games since Mark Messier did it in 19 games in 1989-90. ... Thornton needs seven assists to tie Marcel Dionne for 10th place. ... F Tomas Hertl returned to the Sharks lineup after missing two games with a lower-body injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOilers: Visit the Anaheim Ducks on Friday.\n\nSharks: Host the Vancouver Canucks on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSome things to know about the final weekend of the regular season in the Big 12 Conference. Two games Friday should determine who plays in the league's championship game, and three games Saturday will determine bowl eligibility for four teams:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma (10-1, 7-1, No. 6 CFP) at No. 12 West Virginia (8-2, 6-2, No. 13 CFP), Friday night. The winner goes to the Big 12 championship game. The loser would need help to set up an immediate rematch Dec. 1 between Heisman Trophy-contending quarterbacks \u2014 OU's Kyler Murray (301 yards passing per game, 34 TDs) and WVU's Will Grier (333 yards passing per game, 33 TDs). Three-time defending Big 12 champion Oklahoma has averaged 53 points its last seven games, including a five-game winning streak since its 48-45 loss to Texas. West Virginia is coming off a 45-41 loss at Oklahoma State. The Sooners have won all six meetings since WVU became a Big 12 member, though Oklahoma is the only team Grier hasn't faced as the Mountaineers starter. He missed last year's game with a broken finger.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK APPETIZER\n\nNo. 11 Texas (8-3, 6-2, No. 14 CFP) at Kansas (3-8, 1-7), Friday. The Longhorns get to play for their first Big 12 title since 2009 if they beat Kansas. Lose, and Texas will need help. The Jayhawks, wrapping up their 10th consecutive losing season, play their last game for outgoing fourth-year coach David Beaty, who is being replaced by Les Miles after the finale. The Longhorns are more than two-TD favorites and are 14-2 in the series, but lost in their last trip to Lawrence two years ago before coach Tom Herman arrived.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nOklahoma State offense vs TCU defense. Oklahoma State is second in the Big 12 with 520 total yards per game while scoring 40 points a game \u2014 and is coming off that big home win over West Virginia to get bowl eligible. The Horned Frogs are at the top of the league in total defense, allowing 350 yards per game. TCU held Baylor to a season-low nine points last week.\n\nINSIDE THE (BOWL) NUMBERS\n\nThe Big 12 has five teams bowl eligible, and could add as many as three more since all three league games Saturday include 5-6 teams. Two of those, Baylor and Texas Tech, play each other at the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, the site of the Big 12 title game a week later. Kansas State has to win at No. 25 Iowa State or miss a bowl for the first time in nine years. TCU has to win at home against Oklahoma State to reach a bowl for the 16th time in coach Gary Patterson's 18 seasons.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nTCU senior defensive end Ben Banogu is coming off a 10-tackle performance at Baylor, where he had four tackles for losses and a sack. Banogu has 6 1/2 of his 7 1/2 sacks in Big 12 play, along with 15 of his 16 tackles for loss in conference games.\n\n___\n\nCompiled by AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The usual shouting and gesticulating, the ripping off of his headset, those are often followed by a hand moving up to the left side of his head because of severe headaches.\n\nJust last week, TV cameras captured his pained reactions as his team slogged through a mistake-filled overtime victory over Maryland, adding to the speculation that health problems could lead to his early retirement \u2014 something he has repeatedly denied.\n\nOn the eve of the biggest game of the year, No. 10 Ohio State's showdown with No. 4 Michigan this weekend, it is easy enough to wonder if Meyer is still suffering through one of the more difficult stretches of his storied career.\n\nThis season, his seventh in Columbus, was tumultuous bordering on absurd even before the first game kicked off on Sept. 1.\n\nMeyer weathered a scandal involving a now-fired assistant coach that led to his suspension for the first three games and a series of public apologies and explanations. He has had a flareup of the arachnoid cyst in his head that causes debilitating headaches, one of which dropped him to a knee during a game on Oct. 6.\n\nHe lost star defensive end Nick Bosa to an early season-ending injury, and the Buckeyes' defense never fully recovered. The problems led to a shocking blowout by unranked Purdue on Oct. 20 that pushed Ohio State to the fringe of the playoff picture. Other injuries have been a plague all year.\n\nJust last week, Meyer had to stop preparations for the Maryland game and address another off-the-field issue, this one involving a report that a former player left the program because of bad treatment. Everyone at the university issued denials, but Meyer had to talk to the team and the media about it while trying to keep it from becoming a distraction.\n\n\"All that stuff is foolishness,\" insisted Ryan Day, the co-offensive coordinator who ran the show during Meyer's suspension. \"This team right here knows what a great person coach Meyer is, and the rest of that stuff we're not even focused on. There have been a lot of things that have been said this year, and it hasn't bothered this team.\"\n\nIt is safe to say that nothing has personally hurt Meyer more in his career than people saying his lax treatment of now-fired assistant coach Zach Smith made him culpable in the domestic abuse allegedly suffered by Smith's ex-wife. Meyer said he knew about the accusations against Zach Smith \u2014 grandson of former Ohio State coach Earle Bruce \u2014 but wasn't sure they were true and kept Smith on his staff because no criminal charges were filed. The university cited that lapse when it suspended Meyer .\n\nA chronic worrier and control freak, Meyer had lost control of certain things in his world and, by all accounts, that knocked him off-kilter. His wife, Shelley, a psychiatric nurse, pulled the curtain back recently when she responded to a Twitter user who was inquiring about Urban's \"most difficult personality trait.\"\n\n\"(I) think he would be ok if I said his 'control/perfection' issues are the most difficult to deal with \u2014 as we know LOGICALLY, a person can't control everything, and being perfect is REALLY hard when (you) can't control ALL,\" she wrote.\n\nMeyer won two of his three national championships at Florida but retired twice because of stress-related poor health, leading to chatter recently that he might be close again to doing something else. He already has experience as an ESPN broadcaster. He's a grandfather now, and he and Shelley are empty-nesters. He will make $7.6 million this year, with a contract that runs through 2022.\n\nThere have been reports that the 39-year-old Day \u2014 who moved from the press box to the sideline with Meyer this season \u2014 is being groomed as the coach-in-waiting, although Ohio State has denied it.\n\nMeyer, who acknowledged depression and anxiety issues late in his six-year tenure at Florida, said he is not close to giving it all up. He told reporters recently he plans to be Ohio State's coach for \"as long as I can,\" without saying exactly what that means. As long as his health will allow it? Until he starts losing?\n\nUntil he's no longer having fun?\n\nWinning, of course, makes everything better. Meyer has done a lot of it and is paid handsomely. He is 80-9 at Ohio State.

(Photo: Eric Gay, AP Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Using thousands of military troops to help secure the Southwest border will cost an estimated $210 million under current plans, the Pentagon told Congress on Tuesday, even as questions arose about the scope and duration of the controversial mission.\n\nThe total includes $72 million for approximately 5,900 active-duty troops providing support to Customs and Border Protection, plus $138 million so far for 2,100 National Guard troops who have been performing a separate border mission since April, according to a report sent to Congress on Tuesday but not released by the Pentagon.\n\nA copy of the report was obtained by The Associated Press. After the AP published its story the Pentagon released a statement confirming the active-duty portion of the deployments is estimated at $72 million. It did not mention the $138 million in National Guard costs.\n\nThe total would grow beyond the current combined estimate of $210 million if the active-duty mission is extended beyond the current completion date of Dec. 15. Officials said an extension appeared likely but had not yet been agreed upon.\n\nThe Pentagon also was working on a potential adjustment to the mission that would give the active-duty troops who are operating in Texas, Arizona and California the authority to defend Customs and Border Protection personnel if necessary. The troops, who include military police, are currently authorized to defend themselves.\n\nAbout 2,800 of the active-duty troops are in South Texas, far from the main migrant caravan in Tijuana, Mexico, south of California. The movement of the Central American migrants into Mexico in October was the stated reason that President Donald Trump ordered the military to provide support for Customs and Border Protection.\n\nTrump, who called the migrant caravan an \u201cinvasion,\u201d has been accused by critics, including some retired military officers, of using the military deployment as a political tool in the run-up to the Nov. 6 midterm elections.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said Tuesday the Pentagon\u2019s cost report shows the mission was a \u201ccharade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese soldiers spent weeks away from home and the Pentagon wasted millions of taxpayer dollars so President Trump could stoke fears of asylum seekers and try to influence election results,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing our military men and women as political pawns to support an anti-immigrant agenda is a low point, even for this president.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he was sure the troops are happy to be on the border mission, even though it means being away from home over Thanksgiving.\n\nMore: Federal judge blocks Trump's new asylum rules: 'He may not rewrite the immigration laws'\n\nRelated: Protesters march against migrant caravan in Tijuana, chanting \u2018yes to migrants, no to invaders!\u2019\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the Thanksgiving. These are tough people,\u201d Trump told reporters before flying to Florida for the holiday. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing and they\u2019re great and they\u2019ve done a great job. You\u2019re so worried about the Thanksgiving holiday for them. They are so proud to be representing our country on the border where if you look at what\u2019s happening, Mexico, the people from Tijuana are saying, wow these are tough people. They\u2019re fighting us.\u201d\n\nIf, as expected, the mission is extended beyond Dec. 14, at least some of the troops are likely also to be away for Christmas.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis has declined to publicly discuss cost estimates for the border mission, saying as recently as last week that he had little confidence in the accuracy of figures he had seen thus far.\n\n\u201cWe can estimate costs all we want, I\u2019d prefer to give you real costs. Right now, I can\u2019t give that to you,\u201d Mattis told reporters last Wednesday when he flew to Texas to see the military\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s the cost of deploying them, it\u2019s the cost of transferring their equipment to the border, it\u2019s fuel costs, it\u2019s all those kinds of costs. So, I just don\u2019t want to get into something I can\u2019t give you what I believe confidently is accurate.\u201d\n\nIn its report to Congress on Tuesday, the Pentagon said it expects the deployment of 5,900 active-duty troops through Dec. 15 to cost $72 million, while adding that the mission, which is now three weeks old, is still being refined. The cost includes $19 million for personnel, $20 million for transportation of personnel, equipment and supplies, $28 in operating expenses and $5 million for concertina wire and other border barrier materials.\n\n\u201cThe total cost of the operation has yet to be determined and will depend on the total size, duration and scope,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt said that as of Nov. 14, about $14 million in actual payments for expenses such as travel, supplies and transportation had been reported by the units involved.\n\nThe National Guard\u2019s border mission, which is being conducted by troops for numerous states, has cost an estimated $138 million as of Tuesday, the Pentagon report said. That mission, involving about 2,100 troops, began in April.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/20/pentagon-troops-migrant-caravan-united-states-mexico-border/2076399002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Howell guides Jackson State past Chicago State 81-68", "description": "Chris Howell scored 12 of his 17 points in a dominant first half for Jackson State and he added 11 rebounds and five assists to propel Jackson State to an 81-68 victory over Chicago State", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/howell-guides-jackson-state-past-chicago-state-81-68/38577817/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T05:48:28Z", "content": "JOHNSON CITY, Tenn.

(AP) \u2014 The stat sheet doesn't lie, and Oregon coach Dana Altman didn't mince words while ticking off the unsatisfactory numbers even after his team won.\n\n\"Our focus, our attention to detail, I didn't think was very good,\" he said, \"and that shows in the percentages, especially in the second half.\n\n\"I hope guys will put pressure on themselves so that we can get better after a win.\"\n\nBol Bol had 21 points and nine rebounds, Payton Pritchard added 18 points and No. 21 Oregon held off Green Bay 83-72 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Ducks (4-1) won the game at the foul line, making 33 of 42 free throws to just 9 of 18 for the Phoenix (3-3). Green Bay had a 27-22 edge in field goals, including 9-6 on 3-pointers.\n\n\"I was disappointed in our focus at times, in our coverage defensively and our toughness,\" Altman said. \"Defensively, we're not making good decisions. We sell out and give up some easy baskets.\n\n\"We've got a tremendous amount of work to do.\"\n\nBol was the catalyst in the first half with 15 points as the Ducks led 38-29, and Pritchard scored 16 in the second half. Paul White and Will Richardson had 10 points apiece.\n\nBol was 8 for 12 from the field, including a 3-pointer, and all nine of his rebounds were on the defensive end before he fouled out late.\n\n\"Bol's a terrific scorer,\" Altman said. \"I just didn't think he posted up very hard. I thought they pushed him around a little bit.\n\n\"I'm going to have to take a look at the film and see, and we played him too many minutes. I don't think he's ready for 33 minutes right now.\"\n\nSandy Cohen III led the Phoenix with 18 points, and ShanQuan Hemphill and JayQuan McCloud added 10 apiece.\n\nThe Ducks trailed once early and the Phoenix made them sweat, trailing by four late in the first half and two more times in the second. Oregon answered both times with scoring runs fueled by 3-pointers that pushed the lead back to double digits.\n\nGreen Bay was back within four again with two minutes left, but the Ducks hit nine of their last 10 free throws to seal the victory.\n\nThe Phoenix went 5 of 12 from 3-point range and were 15 of 31 overall in the second half to stay close.\n\n\"I think they were just getting to the basket too easy. It was just a bad job on our part,\" Oregon's Kenny Wooten said.\n\nOregon had a 40-34 advantage in rebounds. The Ducks blocked seven shots, led by Wooten with four.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSuperior athleticism carried the Ducks to another home win over a mid-major, but the team game Altman relishes wasn't much on display \u2014 particularly on offense. Oregon had just 11 assists, with Pritchard's five leading the way, and 13 turnovers.\n\nMcCloud's firepower off the Green Bay bench wasn't as evident against the Ducks after the junior college transfer went for 44 points in his previous two games. The Phoenix's leading scorer finished with 10 points, four off his season average.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nOregon looks to climb back from dropping eight spots to No. 21 after losing to then-unranked Iowa and beating now-unranked Syracuse in New York City. The schedule favors such a rebound with five of the Ducks' next six games at home.\n\nHIGHLIGHT REEL\n\nOregon sophomore Abu Kigab, a 6-foot-7 reserve forward, grabbed an offensive rebound and flipped it over his head in one motion for a reverse layup to cap the Ducks' 19-8 start. Kigab muscled in two more offensive rebounds in the second half and all seven of Oregon's second-chance points.\n\nSTAR WATCH\n\nThe 7-foot-2 Bol keeps drawing attention in creative ways. His deep 3-pointer in transition drew gasps and capped a 10-2 Oregon run in the first half, but a few minutes later he hammered a two-handed jam off the back iron, with the long rebound leading to a Phoenix fast break.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAfter a one-game trip to the West Coast, Green Bay heads home to host Northern Illinois next Wednesday.\n\nOregon takes a holiday break before hosting Texas Southern on Monday night. The Ducks play their first road game on an opponent's floor at Houston on Dec. 1.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Texas Tech made every possession a grind, fought for every loose ball, dominated in the paint and imposed its will on Nebraska in a throwback to the old days of the rough-and-tumble Big 12.\n\nAll that fight produced a title in the Hall of Fame Classic.\n\nJarrett Culver finished with 26 points, Matt Mooney scored 15 and the Red Raiders overcame a slow start by ramping up the defensive intensity Tuesday night, pulling away from the Huskers in the second half in a 70-52 victory in the first meeting of the former league rivals since the 2011 season.\n\n\"That was an excellent defensive effort on their part,\" Nebraska coach Tim Miles said. \"It seemed like every time we had a chance to make something happen, they came up with the ball.\"\n\nThe Red Raiders (5-0) trailed 15-6 in the opening minutes before going on a 12-0 run to wipe out their biggest deficit. The game remained close until midway through the second half, when Culver and Mooney began to get loose on offense and slowly padded Texas Tech's cushion.\n\nThe crushing blow came with 8 minutes left, when Culver hit 3-pointer from the corner. Miles was given a technical foul at the other end when he thought a traveling call should've been made, and Davide Moretti made both free throws to extend the Red Raiders' lead to 57-42.\n\nThey leaned on their stingy defense the rest of the way.\n\n\"Our team just continues to be a work in progress. Kind of a coaching cliche but so true,\" Red Raiders coach Chris Beard said. \"We challenged ourselves in a one-day prep to play what I think is an NCAA Tournament team in Nebraska, and we learned a lot about ourselves.\"\n\nThey also left an impression on one of their biggest fans.\n\nAfter playing a high-profile Monday night game in Los Angeles, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was courtside for the championship game at the Sprint Center. The Texas Tech alum stood and cheered on just about every made basket, and seemed to lament every miss as much as anyone else.\n\n\"I thought Pat might come to the game,\" Beard said. \"He's just a great ambassador for Texas Tech. We tell our guys not to forget where you come from and he's the perfect example.\"\n\nIsaac Copeland Jr. scored 20 points and James Palmer Jr. had 13 for the Huskers (4-1), who were trying to win their first in-season tournament title since the 2000 San Juan Shootout.\n\nCopeland joined Culver and Mooney on the all-tournament team along with Southern California's Bennie Boatwright and Missouri State's Keandre Cook, who squared off in the third-place game.\n\nCulver was voted the tournament's most outstanding player.\n\n\"Jarrett is a special player,\" Mooney said. \"He's one of the hardest workers I've seen. He's really humble, and when he gets it going like that you're just really happy for him. It was a great game by him. He pushed us to the 'W.'\"\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 99, MISSOURI STATE 80\n\nBoatwright scored 22 points, Jonah Mathews added 21 and USC connected on 17 3-pointers \u2014 its most in 17 years \u2014 to romp past Missouri State in the tournament's third-place game.\n\nKevin Porter Jr. added 14 points, Derryck Thornton had 12 and Nick Rakocevic scored 10 for the Trojans (3-2), who bounced back easily from a turnover-laden semifinal loss to the Red Raiders.\n\nUSC used first-half runs of 13-0 and 16-0 to take control, pushed the lead to 44-27 by halftime and coasted down the stretch with the only question whether the Trojans would top 100 points.\n\n\"Our players made the choice to play together, share the ball, make the extra pass,\" Trojans coach Andy Enfield said. \"When you make the extra pass, usually you get an open shot.\"\n\nRyan Kreklow hit six 3-pointers and had 23 points to lead the Bears (3-2). Cook added 21 points and Kansas City native Jarred Dixon hit five 3s and finished with 17.\n\n\"They were really good, especially from 3, and we didn't defend them well,\" Missouri State coach Dana Ford said. \"You have to give them credit. I thought they played a fantastic offensive game.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexas Tech heads back to Lubbock to face Northern Colorado on Saturday, while Nebraska welcomes a visit from Western Illinois on Saturday. USC returns to the Galen Center to play Cal State Bakersfield on Sunday and Missouri State heads to Murray State on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The facility is currently Mississippi's only abortion clinic (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis/AP)\n\nJACKSON, Miss. \u2013 Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban was overturned Tuesday by a federal judge.\n\nEnacted in March, the ban was temporarily blocked almost immediately after being signed by Gov. Phil Bryant.\n\nWithin six hours of Bryant's signing the bill into law, the lone abortion provider in the state sued. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed the suit on behalf of Jackson's Women's Health Organization; a woman at 15 weeks gestation was scheduled to have an abortion at the clinic and the ban would have legally prohibited her from obtaining an abortion.\n\nThe clinic performs abortions up to 16 weeks.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carlton W. Reeves issued a 10-day restraining order on the ban that was then extended. Tuesday, Reeves ruled in favor of the clinic, striking down the ban.\n\nIn his decision, Reeves wrote that \u201cMississippi\u2019s law violates Supreme Court precedent, and in doing so it disregards the 14th Amendment guarantee of autonomy for women desiring to control their own reproductive health.\u201d\n\nMore: Judge blocks Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban from going into effect\n\nMore: Federal judge strikes down Kentucky restriction on abortion clinics\n\nAs a result of the decision, a nearly identical 15-week ban passed in Louisiana in May will not go into effect, as that law\u2019s effective date depends on the outcome of the lawsuit challenging Mississippi\u2019s 15-week ban, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nNo other state has a 15-week restriction.\n\nCurrent state law prohibits the procedure after 20 weeks of a woman's last period. Six years ago, Mississippi voters rejected an initiative that would have defined life as beginning at fertilization, essentially outlawing abortion.\n\n\u201cOur victory today means that women in Mississippi will maintain the ability to make their own decisions about whether and when to terminate a pregnancy,\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in an emailed statement. \u201cToday\u2019s decision should be a wake-up call for state lawmakers who are continuously trying to chip away at abortion access. Such bans will not stand in a court of law.\u201d\n\nThe law and the responding lawsuit set up a confrontation sought by abortion opponents, who are hoping federal courts will ultimately prohibit abortions before a fetus is viable. Current federal law does not.\n\nBryant was traveling Tuesday and it was not immediately clear whether he would ask a federal appeals court to overturn Reeves' ruling. He has said abortion restrictions are meant to protect women's health.\n\nReeves wrote that \"this Court concludes that the Mississippi Legislature's professed interest in 'women's health' is pure gaslighting.\" He cited the state's high infant mortality statistics and noted that Mississippi has not expanded Medicaid, which is an option most states have taken under the 2010 federal health law signed by then-President Barack Obama.\n\nReeves also wrote that the 15-week abortion ban \"is closer to the old Mississippi \u2013 the Mississippi bent on controlling women and minorities.\"\n\nBryant has said frequently that he wants Mississippi to be \"the safest place in America for an unborn child.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; follow Sarah Fowler on Twitter: @FowlerSarah\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/20/15-week-abortion-ban-mississippi-overturned-federal-judge/2075572002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Cydney Henderson, USA TODAY", "title": "Pusha-T's show in Drake's hometown ends early after people rush the stage, spark brawl", "description": "Pusha-T, who notoriously beefed with Drake, was forced to shut down his sold-out Toronto show after a brawl broke out between fans and his team.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/21/pusha-t-shuts-down-show-drakes-hometown-after-people-rush-stage/2075829002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/ad887415-c6c3-4a18-90d7-55b9c666bdbb-GTY_1026349284.JPG?crop=1899,1080,x0,y1019&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T05:06:30Z", "content": "Rapper Pusha T took to Instagram to post a video of him receiving an autographed jersey from future Hall of Famer Allen Iverson.

That only became official on Tuesday.\n\nThe first black Republican woman elected to Congress in 2015, Love lost her bid for a third term by less than 700 votes against Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, adding to the Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives come January.\n\n\"This race was about connecting with Utah,\" McAdams said while declaring victory on Monday night before the final results were posted by the state. \"This race was about who was best positioned to serve Utah and working to not get it caught up in a national, partisan election.\"\n\nThe race had remained too close to call for The Associated Press for two weeks. State election officials are scheduled to certify results on Monday.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Love said she planned to call McAdams but didn\u2019t indicate if she would concede or congratulate him. She said she\u2019s traveling with family for Thanksgiving and won\u2019t speak about the race until Monday.\n\n\"Regardless of how you voted, I want to express my sincere appreciation to you for engaging in the process,\" Love said. \"It is one of many reasons this is the greatest country on earth.\"\n\nLove was among House Republicans targeted in the hours after the midterms by Trump, who suggested their defeats were at least in part because of their refusal to embrace his presidency.\n\nMore: \u2018I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey\u2019: Trump still sees silver lining in midterms\n\nRelated: Win while losing? Beto O'Rourke, Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum may still be rising voices\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love,\" Trump said. \"And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\"\n\nThis is the second time Love has narrowly lost a bid for Congress. In her first run in 2012, Love lost to incumbent Democrat Jim Matheson by 768 votes. She went on to defeat Democratic challenger Doug Owens in 2014 and again in 2016.\n\nMcAdams is just the fourth Democrat that Utah has elected to the U.S. House since 1990.\n\nHe pitched himself as a solid moderate, a strategy aimed at independent voters who account for nearly 4 in 10 voters in the largely suburban Salt Lake City district and designed to overcome his built-in disadvantage in a district where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by nearly 3 to 1.\n\nThough solidly conservative, Utah voters have long been uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s brash style and his comments about women and immigrants. That anxiety is especially pronounced in the suburbs of blue-leaning Salt Lake City, and McAdams\u2019 mayor position gave him solid name recognition with voters.\n\nWith McAdams' victory, Democrats have flipped nearly 40 seats \u2013 including all seven in Orange County, California, once a GOP stronghold \u2013 to win control of the U.S. House.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/election-2018-mia-love-donald-trump-loses-utah/2075473002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Senator apologizes for 'public hanging' comment", "description": "A white Republican U.S. senator from Mississippi apologizes for complimenting a supporter by saying she would attend a \"public hanging\" if he invited her to one (Nov. 20)", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/20/senator-apologizes-'public-hanging'-comment/38577655/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5969751439001_5969751480001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:11:54Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Today in History for November 21st", "description": "Highlights of this day in history:  Thomas Edison says he's invented the phonograph; Gap revealed on Nixon White House tape; Final victim dies in America's anthrax scare; Jonathan Pollard arrested; 'Anything Goes' opens on Broadway.

They were outscoring the Huskies 12-6 in the paint midway through the first half and a layup by Morgan made it 23-20 Cornell.\n\nBut UConn scored the next 13 points to take control.\n\n\"We had to lock in and keep guys in front of us,\" Adams said. \"We knew we would do a good job guarding them on the ball screens, but the back-door cuts were what was killing us, so we had to eliminate that.\"\n\nA steal by Vital led to a step-back jumper from Adams gave the Huskies a 13 point lead and UConn went into halftime up 48-33.\n\nA 3-pointer from Alterique Gilbert gave UConn its first 20-point lead at 55-33.\n\nCornell was able to cut that to 13 points, thanks in large part to Morgan. But Tarin Smith scored 10 of his 12 points during a second-half run. The Huskies pushed the lead to 87-64 on an ally-oop dunk from Vital to Jalen Adams off a steal by Brendan Adams, which bought the crowd to its feet.\n\n\"If we're going to be successful and surprise people this year in terms of our success, the guards are going to have to, across the board, be consistently really, really good,\" said UConn coach Dan Hurley.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCornell: The Big Red were outscored 44-30 in the paint, after outscoring UConn 18-16 down low in the first half.\n\nUConn: The Huskies had 38 turnovers in their two games last week in the 2K Empire Classic. They had 12 on Tuesday night, while scoring 25 points off 19 giveaways from Cornell.\n\nNBA TALENT\n\nCornell coach Brian Earl believes Morgan has the talent to play at the next level and then become a coach. The Big Red guard hit on 11 of his 15 shots, including 4 of 6 from behind the arc. Earl said his speed, efficiency and intelligence make him a special player.\n\n\"He wants to be an NBA player,\" he said. \"Twenty years ago, when you got knocked around a lot, I don't know if he could have done it. But now things are wide open and he's got a lot of IQ for that, and desire to do it is half the battle.\n\nMOMENT of THE GAME\n\nVital had a breakaway dunk in the second half that bounced off the rim, went into the air then found its way back into the basket. That, and a few other questionable decisions, had his coach shaking his head on the sidelines.\n\n\"He lost his mind with the shot selection a couple of times,\" Hurley said. \"But, he plays so hard. It doesn't make up for it, but you know. Man I wish he wouldn't do that, because he's a good player and he could be a really winning player because he has a lot of heart.\"\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nUConn: The Huskies, who were playing the first of five straight home games, ace another mid-major opponent, hosting New Hampshire Saturday in Hartford.\n\nCornell: The Big Red have more than a week off before visiting Lafayette on Nov. 28.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Garrison Mathews grabbed the rebound and made a game-sealing 3 at the other end.\n\nMathews scored 23 points, Cooper had 17 and Rob Marberry 13 for the ASUN Conference preseason favorites, who had been 0-13 against ranked teams since 2006. All of those losses were by double digits.\n\n\"It's a big win,\" Alexander said. \"We talked about it before the game, we talked about it at halftime \u2014 a chance to give Lipscomb a win that it had never had before, against a ranked team.\"\n\nAlex Robinson had 17 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for TCU (3-1), which lost a November game for the first time since 2015. The Horned Frogs' 18-game winning streak during the month had been the second-longest among Division I programs, behind only Virginia's 21 in a row.\n\n\"We knew how good these guys were,\" TCU coach Jamie Dixon said. \"When we scheduled, we knew they'd be all seniors, they're all back, they were in (the NCAA) Tournament last year, it's early in the season.\"\n\nWhile TCU has played seven newcomers as it prepares for the Big 12 schedule, Lipscomb has one of the most experienced teams in the country, returning 92 percent of its offense from a squad that scored 82 points per game last season. The Bisons started three seniors and two juniors.\n\n\"Moments like this is where you may see that,\" Alexander said.\n\nFIRST-HALF COMEBACK\n\nThe Bisons trailed 22-8 midway through the first half before a tying 16-2 run that included 10 points in a row. Cooper started the spurt with a layup and 3-pointer. TCU had a 30-29 halftime lead only after Robinson hit an off-balance 3 from the top of the key to beat the shot clock in the closing seconds of the first half.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLipscomb: Going into the game, the Bisons had 6,385 career points on their active roster, the most in the country. The second-most: Big 12 team Kansas State with 4,929.\n\nTCU: Point guard Jaylen Fisher played his first game since January. He made his season debut after recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. He missed his only shot and had two fouls while playing just seven minutes before halftime. Noi also played his first game after being sidelined because of a right knee issue.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"Once we got down there and got into a one-possession game, they simply just went at us inside, bigs as well as their guards, and almost overpowered us,\" Dixon said. \"I was surprised with how physical they were compared to us, and we simply got what we deserved.\"\n\nLipscomb outscored TCU 42-26 in the paint.\n\nBIG DFW SWING\n\nLipscomb beat SMU 79-73 only three days earlier, a trip that started after a home loss to rival Belmont last Thursday.\n\n\"We turned around two days later, after a hard day's travel, commercial, not charter now, and then get this trip like we did,\" Alexander said. \"It says a lot about our team.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLipscomb plays the third of five consecutive road games Saturday at Morehead State.\n\nTCU gets a break for Thanksgiving before resuming a six-game homestand to start the season.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Indiana coach Archie Miller searched desperately for answers in the second half Tuesday night.\n\nEventually, Juwan Morgan came through. Again.\n\nHe scored 23 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, had four assists and made play after play in a closing flurry that helped the Hoosiers finally fend off Texas-Arlington 78-64.\n\n\"I thought the last six minutes, five minutes of the game our leadership from Juwan stood out,\" a relieved Miller said. \"Guys started to play with more energy and were able to rally and finish the game, which is what you hope.\"\n\nIt sure wasn't easy, as Miller had warned before tip-off, and there was plenty of angst inside Assembly Hall as the Mavericks (3-2) methodically trimmed a 20-point second-half deficit to one with 6:33 left to play.\n\nThen Morgan took charge.\n\nThe senior forward who asserted himself as the team's unquestioned leader last season spurred the decisive 17-4 run with four points, four rebounds, two assists and one steal in the final 6:13 \u2014 as seven teammates sat out with injuries.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the numbers that impressed Miller. Morgan repeatedly set ball screens, took charge in the huddles and implored his teammates to keep playing hard.\n\nMiller noticed.\n\n\"We just have so much confidence in him being able to come through when we need it, whether it's a basket, catch, rebound, blocked shot,\" Miller said. \"He filled the stat line up tonight, and he didn't even play with the group he's normally accustomed to playing with. He was with Justin (Smith) and (Evan) Fitzner. We've never even practiced with that lineup before.\"\n\nBut Morgan made it work and got just enough help from his teammates.\n\nRomeo Langford finished with 16 points and eight rebounds before leaving with a bloody nose with 4:25 left. He did not return for the Hoosiers (4-1), who have won four straight home games. Smith added 13 points and five rebounds and Rob Phinisee scored eight points and had four assists on a night he played more than 38\u00bd minutes.\n\nEdric Dennis scored 13 of his 19 points in the second half to lead Texas-Arlington. Brian Warren added 14 points in the return to his home state.\n\nThose two each made three 3s to put Texas-Arlington in position for a potential upset.\n\nAfter Indiana extended its 17-point halftime lead to 48-28 with 18:09 to go, Dennis and Warren finally warmed up. Three consecutive 3s cut the deficit to 12 and when Radshad Davis made another 3 with 11:49 to play, the Mavericks were within 55-47.\n\nThey were just getting started.\n\nWarren made 1 of 2 free throws with 7:54 left and Dennis followed that with a layup to get Texas-Arlington within 61-60 before Morgan took the cue and closed it out.\n\n\"We didn't make the couple of plays you have to make to win on the road against a very good Big Ten team,\" coach Chris Ogden said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTexas-Arlington: The Mavericks have shown promise during this early-season stretch and used a gritty second-half performance to challenge Indiana on its home court. Foul trouble, mistakes and a lack of depth eventually took its toll.\n\nIndiana: With seven players unable to finish the game, the Hoosiers managed to survive. Sure, the mistakes could have done them in. But they made just enough plays down the stretch with the crowd behind them.\n\nSTAT PACK\n\nTexas-Arlington: Davis had 12 points and David Azore finished with 10. ... Jabari Narcis had seven points and seven rebounds. ... The Mavericks finished 8 of 29 on 3s after going 1 of 12 in the first half and committed 18 turnovers.\n\nIndiana: Morgan also had three blocks and two steals. ... The Hoosiers were 2 of 12 on 3s, 16 of 23 from the free-throw line and matched their season-high with 18 turnovers after committing 13 in the first half.\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nMiller didn't have a prognosis on either Langford or sophomore guard Aljami Durham, who didn't play in the second half after hurting his back when he was fouled early in the first half.\n\nFive players \u2014 Zach McRoberts (back), Devonte Green (bruised thigh), Jerome Hunter (lower leg), De'Ron Davis (sore Achilles) and Race Thompson (concussion-like symptoms) \u2014 all missed the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTexas-Arlington: Heads to Arkansas on Friday.\n\nIndiana: Will host California-Davis on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: NBC, Ron Batzdorff/NBC)\n\nSpoiler alert! This story contains details from \"This Is Us\" Season 3, Episode 8, \"Six Thanksgivings.\"\n\nJust days before Thanksgiving for the rest of the country, it's Thanksgiving for the Pearson clan \u2013 and it's not going smoothly for everyone.\n\nWhile this Thanksgiving episode is no Pilgrim Rick origin tale, it's full of the sentimental holiday moments (and drama) that butter the \"This Is Us\" bread every season.\n\nRandall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson) are out campaigning and arguing; Miguel (Jon Huertas) is crashing the Pearson family celebrations during the teen era for his first post-divorce holiday; Toby (Chris Sullivan) and Kate (Chrissy Metz) are cooking dinner and taking care of a sick Tess (Eris Baker); William (Ron Cephas Jones) and Jessie (Denis O'Hare) appear in a flashback; and more details emerge about Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Vietnam.\n\nIn the present-day Thanksgiving, Randall and his family are out in Philadelphia for a campaign stop at a soup kitchen, but tensions are high between Beth and Randall's campaign manager, Jae-Won (Tim Jo).\n\nJae-Won questions Beth's role in the campaign, and in Randall's attempt to stand up for his wife, he ultimately upsets her by making her feel that he gave her the job out of pity.\n\nMore: 'This Is Us' recap: Everybody's got history\n\nIn the '90s Thanksgiving, Jack and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) are hosting Miguel following his divorce from Shelly (Wynn Everett), and Rebecca is feeling like a bad friend for having her best friend's ex-husband over for dinner.\n\nTeenage Kevin and Kate joke with Randall about his college admissions essay, which the whole family thinks will be a slam dunk for him if he writes about the firefighter who found him as a baby as the person with the greatest impact on his life. Randall has other ideas on how to answer the \"flawed\" question. (More on that later.)\n\nMiguel gets emotional with Jack, worrying that he chose work over family and that his kids will never forgive him. Jack does what Jack does best, giving a motivational speech to convince Miguel that he chose work in the best interest of his family.\n\nFlash forward to the present, and it doesn't seem that Miguel's kids are calling him Daddy Dearest. Miguel and Rebecca head to his daughter's house for Thanksgiving dinner, our first real glimpse into Miguel's family, and the conversation turns tense when Miguel's son accuses Rebecca of stealing his father from his mother and marrying Jack's best friend.\n\nMiguel shows some teeth, firmly telling his children that he tried to reconnect with them for years and that he won't tolerate disrespect toward his wife. And like all good Thanksgiving arguments, it's temporarily smoothed over.\n\nKevin (Logan Shroyer) and Kate (Hannah Zeile) on \"This Is Us.\" (Photo: Ron Batzdorff/NBC)\n\nEven though they share the Pearson name, Jack's brother Nick (Michael Angarano) is nothing like his older sibling. It's Thanksgiving in Vietnam, too, and Jack is feeling in the giving spirit when he offers leftover turkey to the Vietnamese woman in the photograph, which we see being snapped by one of his fellow soldiers. Nick, on the other hand, has been in a surly mood since his transfer to Jack's unit.\n\nWhen Jack realizes the severity of a cut on the foot of a little boy related to the Vietnamese woman, he springs into action, grabbing his medic brother and asking him to clean and bandage the wound the young boy got from stepping on barbed wire. Nick won't do it because he doesn't trust the family as Jack does, later recounting how his previous sergeant was blown up, in part due to a tip from an elderly woman to her brother in the Viet Cong.\n\nTHIS IS US -- \"18,615\" Episode 308 -- Pictured: Michael Angarano as Nicky -- (Photo by: Ron Batzdorff/NBC) (Photo: NBC, Ron Batzdorff/NBC)\n\nKate gets her first taste of motherhood when she's attempting to cook Thanksgiving dinner with Toby at Randall's house. Tess gets her first menstrual period, and Kate is there to talk her through it in Beth's stead. As Kate lists other firsts that Tess will soon have, Tess hints that her future first relationship might be with a girl instead of a boy.\n\nWould an emotional episode be truly complete without a William flashback? Viewers get to see the beginnings of William's relationship with Jessie. Jessie opens up to Randall's biological father about the truth behind his addiction and his dread of a sober Thanksgiving, before William persuades him to come along for a bit of live music to stay out of trouble.\n\nThe episode wraps with a voice-over from teenage Randall reading his college essay, arguing that his life doesn't just have one important person who made an impact, but instead his life is full of impactful people. We get flashes of all the Thanksgivings, from Randall's kitchen table \u2013 where viewers finally get a glimpse of a virtual Kevin (Justin Hartley) and Zoe (Melanie Liburd) from Vietnam \u2013 to a budding Philadelphia love story.\n\nSpeaking of impactful people and moments, the mystery of the necklace and the Vietnamese woman from Jack's photo is finally (hopefully) solved. The woman gifts Jack the necklace after his help with the little boy's injury. Knowing \"This Is Us,\" there's probably more to the story, but there's a nice, simple bow wrapped around it and everything else for now.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/21/us-recap-its-thanksgiving-pearson-family/2071527002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Steve Gardner, USA TODAY", "title": "Fantasy football rankings for Week 12", "description": "Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger, RB James Conner and WR Antonio Brown are all top-3 fantasy options this week at Denver.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/fantasy/2018/11/20/fantasy-football-rankings-week-12/2075295002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/acd76c8f-6581-4270-b57a-0a1c4622a947-ben-roethlisberger.jpg?crop=3299,1853,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T03:12:47Z", "content": "Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger came on strong in Week 11 to finish with 314 passing yards and two touchdowns.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 The only 3-pointer that the Miami Heat made in the fourth quarter came with just about a minute to go, when Rodney McGruder connected from the right corner.\n\nProblem is, he stepped out of bounds first.\n\nAnd that sums up things right now for the Heat.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets were more than happy to add to Miami's home woes. D'Angelo Russell scored 20 points, Jarrett Allen had 13 points and 14 rebounds and the Nets prevailed 104-92 on Tuesday night \u2014 handing Miami a fifth consecutive home loss.\n\n\"We just played great defense the whole game,\" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. \"I know it wasn't pretty.\"\n\nHe's right.\n\nThen again, the Nets didn't need style points.\n\nSpencer Dinwiddie scored 16 points for Brooklyn, which held the Heat to 36 percent shooting. Joe Harris and DeMarre Carroll each added 11 for the Nets and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 10 as Brooklyn avenged a home loss to Miami last week.\n\n\"We wanted to be the aggressor,\" Russell said. \"Honestly, we owed them one after they came out and gave it to us last time.\"\n\nHassan Whiteside had 21 points and 23 rebounds for Miami. No Heat team has ever had a home losing streak of five or more games and went on to make the playoffs.\n\n\"We still believe in ourselves,\" Whiteside said.\n\nThe Heat couldn't make much of anything all night, especially in the fourth quarter. They were 0 for 7 from 3-point range in the fourth, 7 for 13 from the free-throw stripe in that period \u2014 and were 4 for 19 from the floor overall in those 12 minutes, with the game on the line. And for the game, Miami was just 25 for 60 inside the paint.\n\n\"Missed shots, those will happen,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"Again, that seemed like we missed quite a few in the paint. We had some point-blank opportunities.\"\n\nJosh Richardson scored 16 and McGruder finished with 15 for Miami. Justise Winslow added 10 and Dwyane Wade returned from a seven-game absence because of the birth of his daughter to score five points.\n\nMiami was leading 42-39 at halftime. To say either team was \"winning\" at that point would be a stretch.\n\nIt was the lowest-scoring half of the season for each team. The 81 combined points represented the lowest-scoring first half of any NBA game this season, and both teams went into intermission shooting 33 percent.\n\nThe Heat missed their first eight shots of the game, then opened the second quarter on a 14-0 run while the Nets missed nine consecutive shots. After three minutes of the second quarter, the Heat were shooting 25.7 percent \u2014 which not only had them in the lead, it also outpaced the Nets' 22.2 percent rate to that point.\n\n\"You can definitely see guys not playing just free with their game,\" Wade said. \"We're overthinking at times. In this game, you don't want that. You just want to play.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNets: Brooklyn's first five field-goal attempts were from 3-point range. ... The 13 points allowed by the Nets in the first quarter represented their low for any quarter this season. ... Russell also had nine rebounds and six assists.\n\nHeat: Miami was again without Goran Dragic (knee) and didn't have Tyler Johnson, who strained his hamstring in practice Monday. ... Winslow made his first four shots. ... Whiteside got the 10th 20-20 game of his career.\n\nCHILLY START\n\nThe 81 first-half points between the two teams doesn't even beat three separate quarters (Utah 47, Golden State 37; Minnesota 46, Dallas 37; and Golden State 46, Washington 37) in the NBA this season. And Golden State also had a 92-point half by itself against Chicago earlier this season.\n\nDINWIDDIE'S KICKS\n\nThe sneakers that Dinwiddie wore were a tribute to Wade, part of the Nets guard's seasonlong effort to raise money by playing with artwork on his feet. Tuesday's were a tribute to Wade \u2014 with \"One Last Dance\" written across the tongues, as well as a No. 3 and some Miami-themed palm trees. Dinwiddie is auctioning off his game-worn shoes to benefit various charities that support youth causes all season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNets: Visit Dallas on Wednesday.\n\nHeat: Visit Chicago on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Adam Hunger) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The bad beginning to the road trip is behind them and the Trail Blazers are ready for the rest.\n\nEven if Milwaukee and Golden State are two of the toughest stops on the NBA schedule.\n\n\"Now we got the back end of it, against two of the best teams on their home floor,\" Damian Lillard said. \"Good challenge, good test for us.\"\n\nCJ McCollum scored 31 points, Lillard had 29 points, eight assists and six rebounds, and Portland beat the New York Knicks 118-114 on Tuesday night.\n\nJusuf Nurkic finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds for the Blazers, who have won two straight after dropping the first two games on their trip that now heads to its difficult conclusion. Portland plays Milwaukee on Wednesday and closes it at Golden State on Friday.\n\nBoth teams are 8-1 at home.\n\nPortland's star guards provided most of the offense in a game that was close most of the way, and Evan Turner helped the Trail Blazers finally pull it out when he put back a missed shot with Portland clinging to a two-point lead and 9.5 seconds remaining.\n\n\"Evan's tip at the end was big time,\" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \"They defended Damian well on the shot. It was a hell of a play, especially with the bodies that were down there.\"\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. scored 32 points for the Knicks, who dropped their sixth straight. They were a bit better than the previous games of the skid, when they yielded 126.2 points per game, but not good enough to stop the early Western Conference leaders at 12-5.\n\n\"I've been through a lot of losing streaks. The most important thing is not to fall apart. Stay together and keep fighting,\" Knicks center Enes Kanter said. \"Don't make any excuses. If you're going to lose a game, just make them feel us first.\"\n\nHardaway has scored 30 or more points in three straight games.\n\nThe Knicks changed lineups again, going back to veteran Kanter over rookie Mitchell Robinson at center, and got off to a good start.\n\nThe Knicks' lead was 35-33 after Nik Stauskas threw in a 40-footer to beat the first-quarter buzzer. New York opened a 10-point lead early in the third, and that seemed to wake up the Blazers, who outscored the Knicks 24-10 to end the period and take an 89-85 lead to the fourth.\n\nThe Blazers then opened the fourth with a quick 7-2 spurt, and McCollum had eight straight Portland points as the Blazers took their biggest lead at 104-93 with 7:45 to play.\n\n\"Finishing is our No. 1 priority right now,\" Knicks guard Trey Burke said. \"We're playing teams all the way down to the wire and we're coming up short and that's been the ongoing story all year.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: Nurkic had his career-best fifth straight double-double. ... Portland, which came in shooting an NBA-best 85.4 percent on free throws, was just 12 of 17 (70.6 percent).\n\nKnicks: Mario Hezonja made his first start of the season, scoring two points. Only Ron Baker and Luke Kornet haven't made at least one start. ... Burke scored 19 points and Emmanual Mudiay, who has supplanted him as the starting point guard, had 16.\n\nCHANGING IT UP\n\nKnicks coach David Fizdale said he changed back to Kanter because the 20-year-old Robinson was getting in early foul trouble and having to come out of the games too quickly, affecting the rotations. He said that wouldn't be as much of a problem with Robinson in a reserve role.\n\nPIONEER REMEMBERED\n\nThe Knicks held a pregame moment of silence for John Rucker, a former New York police officer who died recently. Rucker was invited to training camp in 1950 and became the first African-American to wear a Knicks uniform.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTrail Blazers: Visit Milwaukee on Wednesday.\n\nKnicks: Visit Boston on Wednesday.\n\n__\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Danny Green watched helplessly from the paint while Evan Fournier dribbled past and dunked a tying basket with 2.3 seconds left.\n\nFeeding off the confidence of first-year coach Nick Nurse, Green got redemption on the very next play.\n\nGreen made a fade-away jumper with less than a second remaining to lift the Toronto Raptors over the Orlando Magic 93-91 on Tuesday night. He caught Kyle Lowry's inbound pass with 2.3 seconds left, pulled up on the left side of the lane and hit a jumper with 0.5 seconds showing. Orlando's Nikola Vucevic missed on a 67-foot heave as time expired.\n\n\"Most coaches wouldn't go to a guy who makes a mistake at that point in the game, but Nick has 100 percent faith in all of us,\" Green said. \"He continues to encourage us and allows us to play through our mistakes. It was nice to make one after missing quite a few the whole game.\"\n\nKawhi Leonard led Toronto with 18 points, and Pascal Siakam had 15. Serge Ibaka added 14 points and nine rebounds, and Green finished with 13.\n\nFournier led the Magic with 27 points, 22 of them in the second half when he was about the only offense Orlando could generate. Aaron Gordon had 16 points, and Vucevic had 14 points and 18 rebounds for the Magic, who ended a three-game winning streak.\n\nBoth sides struggled offensively much of the game, especially the fourth quarter. Toronto committed eight turnovers in the final period, and Orlando missed 11 straight field-goal attempts during a rough 4-minute stretch.\n\nSome of that had to do with the defense.\n\n\"Our defense was unbelievable the first 24 minutes and the last 12,\" Nurse said. \"We were an absolute disaster in the third quarter, but some of that was our offense's fault.\"\n\nThe Magic outscored the Raptors 38-26 in the third quarter to wipe out what had been an 18-point deficit. Orlando led 77-75 early in the fourth quarter before missing 11 straight field-goal attempts. Its only points during that time were two free throws from Jonathan Isaac.\n\n\"The story of the game was the first six minutes of the fourth quarter,\" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. \"We did a good job fighting at the end and that last shot was a difficult shot and he just knocked it in.\"\n\nToronto didn't take much advantage of the drought. The Raptors could only put together a 3-pointer from Green and a layup by Jonas Valanciunas during that stretch to take an 80-77 lead.\n\nThe teams traded baskets from there until Ibaka drilled a jumper from the top of the key to put Toronto in front 91-89.\n\nToronto led by 18 during a first half when both teams struggled to find or maintain an offensive rhythm. The Raptors made enough shots to jump out to a 40-22 advantage in the middle of the second quarter, as Orlando labored with under 30 percent shooting.\n\nFournier started the second half with a 3-pointer, the first of six 3s in the period for the Magic. Another 3 from Fournier tied it at 59 with 5:05 left, and his free throw gave Orlando a 75-73 lead going into the fourth. Fournier had 14 points in the quarter.\n\nVUCEVIC GETTING NOTICED\n\nVucevic is averaging 25.5 points and 11.7 rebounds the past six games, including five Orlando victories.\n\n\"He's playing better than I've ever seen him play,\" Nurse said. \"It used to be he'd get 20 and 12 or something and it was like you didn't even notice or it didn't matter. But now, it's in the rhythm of what they're doing. He's got this look on his face that says give me the ball and I'm going to score it.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nRaptors: Toronto didn't have a player reach double-figure scoring in the first half. ... Toronto got 17 second-chance points.\n\nMagic: Backup F Terrence Ross, the hottest shooter on the Magic over the last five games, was just 2 of 10 against his old team. ...

(AP) \u2014 After losing one of its captains to a transfer request early Tuesday, Notre Dame appeared like it might also lose on its home court, but a ferocious response down the stretch lifted the Irish to a 67-56 win over Duquesne.\n\nJohn Mooney scored 16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and freshman Prentiss Hubb added 14 points as Notre Dame improved to 4-1. Junior TJ Gibbs chipped in 11.\n\nTrailing 52-51 at 7:09 to go, the Irish went on a 13-0 spree over the next six minutes to take control at 64-52 with 1:19 remaining\n\n\"I really think it comes down to the defensive end,\" said Rex Pflueger, who contributed four points and a drawn charge to the run for Notre Dame. \"That's what gets our offense going. It really gives us more energy when (we) see our guys taking charges ... That carries over to the offensive end from a confidence standpoint, and I think that's why we were able to get that run going.\"\n\n\"I thought our defense again was excellent,\" Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said, whose team has not given up more than 67 points in a game this season. \"We (had) nine straight stops to get out of there.\"\n\nThe win came after Notre Dame announced Tuesday morning that junior tri-captain Elijah Burns would be granted an in-season transfer request.\n\nBurns, a 6-foot-8 forward who was averaging 5.3 points and 3.8 rebounds in 11.3 minutes per outing, could be eligible to play at another school by Jan. 1, given that he's scheduled to graduate from Notre Dame in December.\n\nBrey said Notre Dame would not block such a waiver request.\n\n\"Now they're more minutes to go around,\" Burns said. \"We are committed to a youth movement. It is a youth movement.\"\n\nThe Irish denied a likewise youthful Duquesne club (3-1) its first 4-0 start in nine years.\n\nTavian Dunn-Martin led the Dukes with 14 points. Fellow sophomore Michael Hughes added 10.\n\nSophomore Eric Williams Jr. and freshman Sincere Carry, who went into the game averaging a combined 30.3 points, were held to five, all by Williams, and shot a combined 1 of 16 from the field.\n\n\"I thought Eric had open looks in the first half, and Sincere just never got it going, so we went a different direction,\" Duquesne coach Keith Dambrot said. \"Obviously, you game plan to take guys away and Pflueger's a good defensive player, but Eric had some open looks. They played some zone, too, but we're not going to win many games when Eric goes 1 for 11. No team is going to win when their best player does that.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNotre Dame: On a roster clogged by an array of players who have been earning regular action \u2014 10 players averaging 11 or more minutes each \u2014 the subtraction of Burns gives the Irish fewer combinations to consider, and it is getting more pivotal to establish consistent top options as the schedule toughens.\n\nThe Irish's next five opponents are DePaul (3-0), Illinois (1-3), Oklahoma (3-0), No. 17 UCLA (4-0) and No. 24 Purdue (4-1). The last three are all on the road.\n\nDuquesne: The Dukes lost the first of just three chances they'll get this season against Power Five programs. The others come in the next month against Pittsburgh and Penn State.\n\nNO BRIDGES BURNED\n\nPflueger said the Irish don't harbor any hard feelings toward Burns for his departure.\n\n\"He realizes it's his time (to) go,\" said Pflueger, a fellow tri-captain along with Gibbs. \"It's nothing personal against the team, against the coach or anything. He just thought it would be for the best if he left, not only for himself, but for the team as well.\"\n\nBurns played just 16 minutes over his final two games and did not score.\n\n\"As much as it hurts having him gone,\" said Pflueger, who called Burns one of the most mature human beings he knows, \"we've got to keep moving forward as a team, and we did a great job tonight taking that first step.\"\n\nBrey acknowledged that declining playing time triggered Burns' departure.\n\n\"When I can't (give) the role the guy wants, then everybody should move in a different direction,\" Brey said, adding that Burns told him he \"didn't want to be a bad influence on the team\" by remaining on board when his \"head wasn't in it.\"\n\nWHY CALL IT GOTHAM?\n\nThe event, now in its seventh year, has traditionally contested its showcase game at New York's Madison Square Garden, but this was the second year in the last three that it was held in another state.\n\nNone of the schools in this latest Gotham Classic came from New York, either.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish host DePaul on Saturday in the second-to-last of seven straight home games.\n\nDuquesne: The Dukes begin a staggering streak of nine straight games within the city of Pittsburgh when they host UMass Lowell on Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Terence Davis scored 14 points, added eight rebounds and blocked four shots as Mississippi defeated Nicholls 75-55 on Tuesday night.\n\nBruce Stevens and Breein Tyree scored 13 and 10 points, respectively for the Rebels (2-1), who raced to a 9-2 lead in the opening three minutes and never trailed. Davis added three 3-point shots as the final basket pushed Ole Miss to an insurmountable 50-29 lead early in the second half.\n\n\"One thing that was really important was how we came out defensively. We showed intensity,\" Ole Miss coach Kermit Davis said. \"We had way too many turnovers (16), but our assists to baskets ratio was 21 to 26 and that's about as good as it gets.\"\n\nGavin Peppers scored 14 points, all in the second half, for Nicholls (2-4), who trailed 37-22 at halftime. Jeremiah Jefferson, the team's leading scorer at 19.8 points per game, was limited to seven points, hitting only 3 of 13 from the floor.\n\n\"They can do things to you defensively that not a lot of teams in this country can do,\" Nicholls coach Austin Claunch said. \"The positive for us is we battled in the second half, forced turnovers and we're excited to see what we can do with our games this weekend.\"\n\nOle Miss finished 26 of 54 (48 percent) from the field, including 6 of 17 (35 percent) from 3-point range. The Rebels were 17 of 23 (74) from the free throw line to prevent any serious comeback threat in the second half.\n\nNicholls was 22 of 65 (34 percent) from the field and 7 of 24 (29) from the 3-point line. Ole Miss outrebounded the Colonels 45-29.\n\n\"There are going to be nights that you don't shoot as well you want,\" Tyree said. \"But when you play good defense, then you don't have to score on every possession. Tonight, we held them to 55 and that takes some pressure off of us offensively.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNicholls: The Colonels looked like a stressed team in the middle of a seven-game, 16-day road trip. Difficult non-conference road schedules aren't unusual for the Colonels, a trend continued by Claunch in his debut season. Despite a sub-par shooting performance, the improved second half performance provides hope for a rebuilding Southland Conference team that won 21 games last season.\n\nOle Miss: The Rebels bounced back from a creditable road loss at Butler earlier in the week with a spirited performance. Offensively, Ole Miss had first half scoring runs of 11-2 and 9-0 before adding a 13-7 run to open the second half to seal the win. Defensively, the Rebels forced only14 turnovers, but turned eight in the opening 10 minutes to gain control.\n\n\"I'm always interested to see what any team's reaction is in the game after a loss,\" Davis said. \"That says a lot. We responded in a good way, with good, physical play. I was pleased.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNicholls: The Colonels face North Carolina Central of the MEAC in the Emerald Coast Classic in Destin, Fla., on Friday.\n\nOle Miss: Also playing in the Emerald Coast Classic on Friday, the Rebels face Baylor on Friday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Ohio State beat Samford 68-50. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Don't flinch.\n\nThat was the message Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann had for his young Buckeyes, trailing for the first time at the half against undefeated Samford after shooting just 37.5 percent from the field.\n\nThose words provided the necessary motivation, as Kaleb Wesson scored 17 points and Keyshawn Woods added 14 to help No. 23 Ohio State beat scrappy Samford 68-50 on Tuesday night for its fifth straight victory to begin the season.\n\nOhio State seemed out of sync from the opening tip, with Holtmann benching four starters for being late to \"game-day preparation,\" according to the school. Samford shot 50 percent in the first half and led 32-29 at the break.\n\n\"I thought in the first half we couldn't have stuck to our game plan any better than what we did,\" Samford coach Scott Padgett said. \"We made shots, so we were able to get in our press, which then slowed down the tempo of the game, and kind of brought it to a grinding halt.\n\n\"Watching them on film, that was the only way I thought we had a chance.\"\n\nMomentum shifted with 16:27 remaining, when C.J. Jackson dove into the stands to save a ball headed out of bounds, starting a relay from Luther Muhammad to Woods that ended with Andre Wesson hitting a 3-pointer.\n\nThe play seemed to spark Ohio State (5-0), which went on a 21-3 run that sealed the win. The Buckeyes shot 50 percent from the field in the second half to 24 percent for Samford (5-1).\n\n\"I think it was a momentum play, for sure,\" Holtmann said. \"It was a fantastic series of saves by (Jackson) and Luther, and Key was somehow involved. I had my eyes shut for most of it.\n\n\"It was a fantastic hustle play that I think was critical. It fired up our crowd.\"\n\nJunior guard Myron Gordon led the way for the Bulldogs, shooting 6 for 8 in the first half and finishing with 18 points.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOhio State came in ranked for the first time this season but had to fight hard for the win.\n\nSamford is rebuilding after losing 10 players, including all five starters, from last season's 10-22 team. But the Bulldogs showed they have the talent to keep pace for a half with a nationally ranked Big Ten opponent.\n\nPLAN B\n\nBoth teams had to make do without much from their leading scorers. Jackson, who averages 12.8 points per game, shot 2 for 11 and finished with eight points. Samford center Ruben Guerrero averages 17 points but had just two against Ohio State.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"There is so much social media. If I get 15 points tonight the whole world is going to know on social media and I am going to get 2,500 likes and all this stuff. Because of that, kids care about it more now,\" Padgett said. \"They want to get that attention through social media. Now, all of a sudden, it's a little harder to get them to care about the name on the front, not the name on the back.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nOhio State signed three Top 50 recruits Tuesday, as Alonzo Gaffney, E.J. Liddell and D.J. Carton all inked national letters of intent. ... Ohio State is 19-1 vs. the teams that currently make up the Southern Conference. ... The Bulldogs have lost seven of their last nine road games. ...

(Photo: ESO/Callingham et al.)\n\nAstronomers have found a unique \"pinwheel\" star system in our own galaxy, one that will eventually die in a massive explosion that's never been seen before here in the Milky Way, a new study reports.\n\nScientists believe one of the stars \u2013 about 8,000 light years from Earth \u2013 is the first known candidate in the Milky Way that could produce a dangerous gamma-ray burst, among the most energetic events in the universe, when it explodes and dies.\n\n\u201cThis is the first such system to be discovered in our own galaxy,\u201d said study co-author Joseph Callingham, an astronomer with the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. \u201cWe never expected to find such a system in our own backyard,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe authors named the star system Apep after a serpent deity from ancient Egyptian mythology that's the mortal enemy of sun god Ra. Study co-author Peter Tuthill of the University of Sydney said \"the name seemed fitting as the sinuous dust plume looks like a coiled serpent doing battle with a central star.\u201d\n\nMore: 'Super Earth' discovered in orbit around a nearby star\n\nApep\u2019s stellar winds have created the dust cloud surrounding the system, which consists of a binary star with a fainter companion.\n\nThe star is spinning so fast that it's close to ripping itself apart. Scientists aren't sure when the star system will finally explode as a supernova, possibly in many thousands of years, but when it does, it will be spectacular.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are among the most powerful explosions in the universe. Lasting between a few thousandths of a second and a few hours, they can release as much energy as the sun will emit over its entire lifetime, according to the study.\n\nFortunately, the star does not appear to be aimed at Earth, because a strike by a gamma-ray burst so close by (in cosmic terms) could rip the ozone away from our atmosphere, drastically increasing our exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun.\n\nScientists believe a gamma-ray burst could have caused a huge extinction event on Earth about 450 million years ago, CBC news reported.\n\nThe study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/11/20/binary-star-system-apep-could-explode-spectacular-gamma-ray-blast/2071897002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Dorn, NC State rout Saint Peter's, 85-57", "description": "Torin Dorn scored 12 points and North Carolina State routed Saint Peter's 85-57 on Tuesday night", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/20/dorn-nc-state-rout-saint-peters-85-57/38577057/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T02:13:19Z", "content": "RALEIGH, N.C.

State to an 85-57 rout of Saint Peter's on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Wolfpack were outscored in the second half for a second straight game, with the Peacocks scoring 30 points to their 26.\n\n\"Any time you look at the scoreboard and you're up 20, 30 points, it's kind of hard to muster up the same energy,\" guard Torin Dorn said. \"But that's something we have to work on as the season progresses, keeping up the same energy and intensity in the second half.\"\n\nDorn scored 12 points, Eric Lockett added 11 points, and Braxton Beverly and freshman Jerricole Hellems had 10 apiece to help the Wolfpack (5-0) earn their fifth straight blowout of an overmatched opponent. Eight players finished with at least seven points each.\n\n\"It just gives everybody confidence that your teammate is there if you're not having a great game,\" Hellems said.\n\nN.C. State shot 52 percent and held the Peacocks without a field goal for about 12\u00bd minutes of the first half while pushing its lead into the 30s with a 41-8 run, a burst keyed by 11 points from Dorn and six 3-pointers.\n\nThe Wolfpack finished with 10 3s, making nine of them in the first half three nights after they hit eight in the first half of a rout of Maine.\n\nDavauhnte Turner had 20 points on 6-of-15 shooting to lead Saint Peter's (1-3), which missed 11 consecutive shots while falling into that inescapable deficit and losing its third straight. The Peacocks shot 33 percent and were just 4 of 21 from 3-point range.\n\n\"I told the guys, if you could weather the storm the first 10 minutes of the game, you've got a chance to be in it,\" first-year coach Shaheen Holloway said. \"I thought we did a good job (until) the first media time-out, and after that, we just started giving up 3 and 3 and 3 and 3 and 3.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSaint Peter's: Holloway has some work to do, and it doesn't get any easier with a visit to No. 8 Auburn looming next week. The Peacocks can build on the first five minutes of this one, when they made six of their first nine shots while taking an early four-point lead, or they can focus on outscoring N.C. State 30-26 in the second half.\n\nN.C. State: This was supposed to be the Wolfpack's toughest test so far \u2014 at least, according to the analytics. The Peacocks entered at No. 222 in Ken Pomeroy's efficiency ratings, while each of N.C. State's first four opponents were rated in the 300s. Instead, this one barely differed from those first four games, which were decided by an average of 41.5 points apiece.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nN.C. State had assists on 17 of its first 20 baskets. . The Wolfpack actually faced its deepest deficit of the season, trailing by four points when Quinn Taylor's layup made it 11-7 roughly four minutes in. It was the first time N.C. State trailed since it fell behind Mount St. Mary's by a bucket in the opener.\n\nHE SHOOTS 2S, TOO\n\nIt's worth noting that Beverly took his first 2-point shot of the season. The sophomore guard's first 22 shots of the year came from 3-point range. For the record, his first 2-point attempt was a missed layup about four minutes in. He finished 2 of 5 from beyond the arc and 0 for 4 inside of it.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaint Peter's: Continues its four-game road swing Saturday at North Texas.\n\nN.C.

Today millions of Americans headed to the polls to vote in the midterm elections that will decide what party will control the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. (Photo: Zach Gibson, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON - It's been a whirlwind of ups and downs for Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who is fighting with those in her own party to lead Democrats in the House they now control.\n\nPelosi is hoping to get her old job as speaker of the House back in the face of opposition from a growing group of Democrats who want new leadership for the party instead of the California Democrat, who was the first woman speaker of the House while serving in the role during the Obama Administration.\n\nHere's what we know about Pelosi's bid for speaker and why it's gotten so much attention:\n\nWhy this position matters?\n\nPelosi's fight for the gavel comes on the heels of Democrats taking control of the House during the midterm elections after years of Republican rule.\n\nIf Pelosi is elected to the position, she will be the highest ranking Democrat and second in line, after Vice President Mike Pence, to succeed the president.\n\nShe will lead the House, be the official spokeswoman when speaking to the president and Senate leadership and direct priorities for the next two years with new liberal leadership.\n\nMore: Nancy Pelosi fights for Democratic support in bid to reclaim speaker's gavel\n\nMore: Group of House Democrats pledge to oppose Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as House Speaker\n\nPelosi would help guide committee assignments and leadership roles, which over the next two years is likely to result in a headache for the Trump administration. Democrats heading committees in the House are expected to investigate the president and the work his administration has done over the last two years.\n\nAs speaker, Pelosi would also have control over whether to recognize members who wish to speak or make motions on the floor.\n\nPelosi is expected to win the first round of voting next Wednesday in the Democratic caucus\u2019 closed-door secret election because she only needs a majority to win the nomination.\n\nAfter that vote is when things might get tricky for her.\n\nThe full House will then vote on Pelosi and she will need a majority - 218 votes - to be elected House speaker. It's proven to be a slightly uphill battle with a growing number of Democrats voicing their opposition.\n\nBut, Pelosi has insisted she has the votes to win.\n\n\"I have overwhelming support in my caucus to be Speaker of the House,\" she told reporters last week at the U.S. Capitol. \"I happen to think that, at this point, I'm the best person for that.\"\n\nShe has pledged the next Congress will aim for bipartisanship and transparency.\n\n\"We are going to be opening this Congress in a very, very open and transparent way to do what we said we were going to do,\" Pelosi said last week, detailing some of the priorities, including healthcare, minimum wage and shedding light on corruption in Washington.\n\nPelosi's opposition?\n\nAlthough Pelosi has said repeatedly she\u2019s confident she will win her bid, she\u2019s been scrambling to shore up support \u2013 even among Democratic groups that have long backed her.\n\nA group of 16 House Democrats signed a letter Monday pledging to oppose Pelosi's bid. The current lawmakers and incoming members \u2013 five of the signatories were just elected \u2013 said: \"the time has come for new leadership in our Caucus.\"\n\n\"We are thankful for Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and our Caucus. She is a historic figure whose leadership has been instrumental to some of our party's most important legislative achievements,\" the letter reads. \"However, we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change.\"\n\nCLOSE House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Democrats will \"strive for bipartisanship\" when they take over the majority next year after wresting control of the House in Tuesday's midterm elections. (Nov. 7) AP\n\nThe group added: \"We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise.\"\n\nPelosi, who served as speaker from 2007 to 2011, has attempted in recent weeks to gain support by various speaking engagements and dinners.\n\nLate Tuesday, what could have been Pelosi's primary opponent, Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, voiced support for Pelosi and said she would not run for the top spot.\n\nFudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, announced her support for Pelosi within minutes of Pelosi releasing a statement that Fudge would chair a subcommittee focused on elections and voting issues.\n\nFudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, has made voting rights and election concerns one of her signature issues.\n\nIn 2016, Fudge and other members of the caucus held an event on voting rights \u2013 only blocks from the national Republican Convention. Fudge, who is from Ohio, hosted the \u201cUnited State of Voting\u2019\u2019 event at Cleveland State University, which focused on voter suppression and other issues.\n\nPolitical experts said Fudge had an uphill challenge against Pelosi but she could have siphoned off some critical support from the Congressional Black Caucus and even some of the freshmen. A record number of the upcoming freshman class are women of color.\n\n\u201cIt would be extraordinary to see two women vying for the speaker of the House position,\u2019\u2019 said Wendy Smooth, associate professor of Women\u2019s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at the Ohio State University.\n\nSmooth said Pelosi and Fudge have been outspoken members of the caucus.\n\nWho has offered support?\n\nPelosi is a longtime Democratic politician who already knows the ropes of holding the top position in the House.\n\nShe's been backed by many of the party's senior members who have worked with her for years. Several longtime members say Pelosi has paid her dues and has played a key role in helping Democrats regain control of the House.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump says there is still a very good chance of bipartisanship after Democrats won the House. USA TODAY\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi\u2019s not worried,\" said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is in line to chair the Finance Committee. \"Nancy Pelosi said we were going to win. And when people doubted her, she said we\u2019re going to win, and guess what? She was right. Nancy Pelosi said she\u2019s going to be the speaker. I believe Nancy Pelosi is right.\"\n\nEven the president offered his support, saying that if Pelosi didn't have the votes Republicans would support her. The move isn't likely as any Republican backing Pelosi would likely face some backlash.\n\nMore than 100 members have voiced support for her bid, according to the Washington Post, which also noted that about 20 members have said they would oppose her for the position.\n\nA large majority dodged the question or haven't commented on Pelosi's future, the Post notes.\n\nDrew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said she \"remains confident in her support among members and members-elect.\" He noted that 94 percent of the caucus declined to sign the letter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/20/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker-bid-what-we-know/2073648002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY Sports", "title": "Best of Zion Williamson at Duke", "description": "Highlights from Duke's Zion Williamson", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/zion-williamson-duke-basketball-highlights/2074859002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/8c12a239-ee7b-423c-bfae-329f9c2ba6b0-ax216_1de4_9.jpg?crop=1023,580,x0,y46&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T02:09:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nZion Williamson #1 of the Duke Blue Devils goes up for a dunk off the fast break during the second half of the game against the San Diego State Aztecs.

Western governments worry that Russia could use the post to undermine the rule of law.\n\nInterpol, which elects a new president Wednesday, has weathered many challenges in its 95 years. While Hollywood has portrayed it as a hive of swashbuckling agents, in reality it\u2019s an organization sometimes tangled in red tape and clashing geopolitical interests. Nazis took it over in the 1930s, and authoritarian governments have long tried to use it to hunt down fugitive dissenters.\n\nBut the latest storm of criticism comes at an exceptional time \u2013 just as Russia is trying to expand its global clout and as some powerful countries are questioning whether they need multilateral organizations like Interpol at all.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is choosing the agency\u2019s new president at a meeting in Dubai where the front-runner is Alexander Prokopchuk, a general in Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry who is currently an Interpol vice president. Interpol\u2019s interim president, South Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Yang, is also seeking the post.\n\nTwo prominent Kremlin critics warned Tuesday that electing a high-placed Russian would undermine the international law enforcement agency and politicize police cooperation across borders.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky told reporters in London that Putin has tried to use Interpol to hunt down critics such as themselves. Having a Russian lead the agency could intensify such efforts to silence dissent, they said.\n\nActivists argue that the organization needs to increase recent efforts at muscular reform, and this won\u2019t happen if Prokopchuk becomes president, because of his ties to Putin.\n\n\u201cIt was his government that organized a terrorist attack in the U.K. using chemical weapons in Salisbury. It was his government that shot down MH17, killing 298 innocent individuals. It was his government that cheated and hacked in elections in the United States and Europe,\u201d Browder said of Putin. \u201cTo put his representative in charge of the most important international crime-fighting organization is like putting the mafia in charge.\u201d\n\nTo Moscow, the complaints are all part of a Western-led campaign to weaken a resurgent Russia.\n\nRussia denies accusations of foreign interference and announced new charges against Browder this week in a long-running legal battle against him. Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Irina Volk accused critics Tuesday of running a \u201ccampaign to discredit\u201d Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\n\nBrowder has pressed for sanctions against Russian officials charged with human rights abuses after his former lawyer died in custody. Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, spent a decade in prison after exhibiting political ambitions. Both said their places in the public eye would make them poor targets for abuse, adding that they were motivated to speak out because many other campaigners who are less well-known would be silenced if governments are allowed to export repression.\n\nThe White House came out Tuesday against the election of Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying that \u201cthe Russian government abuses Interpol\u2019s processes to harass its political opponents.\u201d He said the U.S. \u201cstrongly endorses\u201d Kim.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added: \u201cWe encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world\u2019s most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that.\u201d\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is made up of its 192 member states, each of which has an equal vote.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is best known for issuing \u201cred notices\u201d that identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world\u2019s \u201cmost-wanted\u201d list.\n\nCritics argue that countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists.\n\nThe watchdog group Fair Trials International detailed in a report last month the strides Interpol has made in reducing political abuse of red notices. The group\u2019s chief, Jago Russell, said a Russian official as Interpol president could stall or reverse those reforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal moment for Interpol,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cEither countries back away from it and find other ways to cooperate, or Interpol fixes its system so that it can be trusted. \u2026 Already there are noises about pulling out of Interpol\u201d and creating a separate agency just for democratic countries, he said.\n\nThe U.S. seems committed to Interpol for now, but has pulled out of UNESCO and international accords under President Donald Trump. Britain is pulling out of the European Union and has expressed concern about management of international bodies funded by taxpayers.\n\nInterpol itself won\u2019t comment on the upcoming vote. The Interpol presidency is more of an oversight position, compared with the hands-on leadership role of the secretary-general.\n\nMore: Missing Interpol president Meng Hongwei sent 'knife' photo to wife before disappearing\n\nRelated: French judicial official says Interpol president reported missing after traveling to China\n\nInterpol\u2019s charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality, and two years ago it introduced measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out.\n\nBut the possibility of a Putin loyalist in such a prominent role has prompted concern among those critical of the Russian president\u2019s leadership. Four U.S. senators, including Marco Rubio, have urged the Trump administration to oppose the Prokopchuk candidacy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who on Monday stated that Russia was \u201crooting for the Russian candidate,\u201d said that amounted to meddling in the vote.\n\nFair Trials International warned that a Russian president of Interpol could try to limit the money spent on staff needed to vet red notices, for example, or get rid of a recent measure to protect refugees from unfair arrest.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Interpol\u2019s votes are causing controversy.\n\nHuman rights groups raised the alarm two years ago when Interpol\u2019s general assembly approved Meng Hongwei, a longtime senior Chinese security official, as president. Amnesty International criticized \u201cChina\u2019s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad.\u201d\n\nMeng is now under arrest in China as part of a possible domestic political purge \u2013 hence Wednesday\u2019s emergency vote to replace him.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly also votes on membership, like they did on Tuesday when they rejected admitting Kosovo. Interpol members voted last year to admit Palestine as a member, creating an uproar in Israel.\\\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/interpol-president-russia-europe/2074439002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andy Nesbitt", "title": "Would you eat this Thanksgiving pizza that will be available at Thursday's Lions game?", "description": "Well, would you?", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/would-you-eat-this-thanksgiving-pizza-that-will-be-available-at-thursdays-lions-game", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pizza.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:48:34Z", "content": "The Detroit Lions will have their annual Thanksgiving Day game this Thursday as they host the Bears in a pivotal NFC North game.

Dan, more the traditionalist, responds that it's \"not a crime for a baby to have two parents\" and throws Becky a curve, saying she can't work on his construction crew while pregnant because of the dangers from chemical exposure and other risks.\n\nLater, Becky reveals to Jackie that she wasn't being coy about the dad. She doesn't know who it is, since she slept with both restaurant manager Ramon and a busboy, Emilio. Realizing Ramon is in a better financial position, she tells him he's the only one she had sex with, but he trumps her by saying he's had a vasectomy.\n\n\"I assume I'm working holidays for a while,\" she concludes, having been caught in the deception.\n\nEmilio, an ambitious, Spanish-speaking immigrant who's starting to learn English, is pleased to learn he will be a father.

(Photo: Eric Seals, Detroit Free Press)\n\nDETROIT \u2013 In a major blow to the government, a U.S. district judge in Michigan has declared a federal female genital mutilation law unconstitutional, dismissing the key charges against two doctors and six others accused of subjecting girls to the cutting procedure.\n\nThe historic case involves minor girls from Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota, including some who cried, screamed and bled during the procedure and one who was given Valium ground in liquid Tylenol to keep her calm, court records show.\n\nThe federal judge's ruling also removed three mothers from the case, including two Minnesota women whom prosecutors said tricked their 7 -year-old daughters into thinking they were coming to Detroit for a girls' weekend, but instead had their genitals cut at a Livonia clinic as part of a religious procedure.\n\nCLOSE Millions of little girls and young women have been subjected to a painful rite of passage that involves cutting their genitals \u2014 often without anesthesia \u2014 for centuries in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Detroit Free Press\n\nU.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman concluded that \"as despicable as this practice may be,\" Congress did not have the authority to pass the law that criminalizes female genital mutilation, and that it's a matter for the state's to regulate. Female genital mutilation has been outlawed in more than 30 countries, though the U.S. statute had never been tested before this case.\n\n\"As laudable as the prohibition of a particular type of abuse of girls may be ... federalism concerns deprive Congress of the power to enact this statute,\" Friedman wrote in his 28-page opinion, noting: \"Congress overstepped its bounds by legislating to prohibit FGM ... FGM is a 'local criminal activity' which, in keeping with longstanding tradition and our federal system of government, is for the states to regulate, not Congress.\"\n\nDr. Fakhruddin S. Attar has an office at the Burhani Medical Clinic building in Livonia. (Photo: Elaine Cromie/Detroit Free Press)\n\nCurrently, 27 states have laws that criminalize female genital mutilation, including Michigan, whose law is stiffer than the federal statute, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, compared with five under federal law. Michigan's law was passed last year and applies to both doctors who conduct the procedure and parents who transport a child to have it done.\n\nGina Balaya, spokesperson for the U.S. attorneys office, said the government is reviewing the judge\u2019s opinion and will make a determination whether to appeal.\n\nFriedman's ruling stems from a request by Dr. Jumana Nagarwala and her co-defendants to dismiss the genital mutilation charges, claiming the law they are being prosecuted under is unconstitutional.\n\nA victory for the defendants\n\nThe defendants are members of a small Indian Muslim sect known as the Dawoodi Bohra, which has a mosque in Farmington Hills. The sect practices female circumcision and believes it is a religious rite of passage that involves only a minor \"nick.\"\n\nThe defendants have argued that \u201cCongress lacked authority to enact\" the genital mutilation statute, \"thus the female genital mutilation charges must be dismissed.\u201d They also argued that they didn't actually practice genital mutilation, but rather engaged in a benign religious ritual that involves only a scraping of the genitals.\n\n\"Oh, my God, we won,\" declared Shannon Smith, Nagarwala's lawyer, who expects the government to appeal. \"But we are confident we will win even if appealed.\"\n\nSmith has maintained all along that her client did not engage in female genital mutilation.\n\n\"Dr. Nagarwala is just a wonderful human being. She was always known as a doctor with an excellent reputation,\" Smith said. \"The whole community was shocked when this happened. She's always been known to be a stellar doctor, mother, person.\"\n\nMore: Teen girls decry painful illegal 'circumcision'\n\nMore: Feds: Moms, charged in genital cutting case, gave doctor blessing to cut daughters\n\nFor Mariya Taher, who heads a campaign out of Cambridge, Mass. to ban FGM worldwide, Friedman's ruling was a punch to the gut.\n\n\"Oh, my God, this is crazy,\" said Taher, stressing she fears the ruling will put more young women in harm's way. \"Unfortunately, this is going to embolden those who believe that this must be continued ... they\u2019ll feel that this is permission, that it\u2019s OK to do this.\"\n\nTaher, 35, who at age 7 was subjected to the same type of religious cutting procedure that's at issue in the Michigan case, said she doesn't expect laws alone to end female genital mutilation. But they are needed, she said.\n\n\"This is a violation of one person\u2019a human rights. It's a form of gender violence. \u2026 This is cultural violence,\" Taher said.\n\nYasmeen Hassan, executive global director for Equality Now, an international women's rights organization, agreed, saying the ruling sends a disturbing message to women and girls.\n\n\"It says you are not important,\" Hassan said, calling the ruling a \"federal blessing\" for female genital mutilation.\n\n\"In this day and age for FGM to still occur \u2013 and a federal government can\u2019t regulate this with a human rights violation \u2013 is very bizarre,\" she said. \"This is not what I expected. It's so not what I expected.\"\n\nHassan added: \"I don't think it's possible for the federal government not to appeal this case. My feeling is that it will go all the way to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nFriedman's ruling also drew the ire of Republican state Sen. Rick Jones.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m angry that the federal judge dismissed this horrific case that affected upwards of a hundred girls who were brutally victimized and attacked against their will,\" Jones said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is why it was so important for Michigan to act. We set a precedent that female genital mutilation will not be tolerated here, and we did so by passing a state law that comes with a 15-year felony punishment,\" Jones said. \"I hope other states will follow suit.\u201d\n\nThe federal statute at issue states: \"Whoever knowingly circumcises, excises or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person\" under the age of 18 shall be fined or imprisoned for up to five years, or both.\n\nProsecutors argued Nagarwala, the lead defendant, did exactly that when she cut the genitals of two 7-year-old Minnesota girls who were tricked into the procedure in 2017 by their mothers.\n\nThey said Nagarwala did this with the help of Dr. Fakhuruddin Attar, who is accused of letting Nagarwala use his Livonia clinic after hours to carry out the procedures; and his wife, Farida Attar, who is accused of assisting Nagarwala in the examination room during the procedures and holding the girls' hands.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Nagarwala may have subjected up to 100 girls to the procedure over a 12-year period, though they have cited nine victims in the case: the two 7-year-olds; four Michigan girls ages 8-12; and three Illinois girls.\n\nLaw deemed unconstitutional\n\nNagarwala has long maintained that she committed no crime and that she was charged under a law that slid through Congress without proper vetting.\n\n\u201cThe law was never debated on the floor of either chamber of Congress nor was there ever any legislative hearing addressing the justification or need for the federal law. Instead, all that exists is the criminal statute itself,\u201d defense lawyers have argued in court documents, claiming the driving force behind the legislation was one lawmaker's belief that the prohibited conduct was \"repulsive and cruel.\"\n\nBut the Constitution demands more than that, the defense has argued, claiming Congress could not have passed a female genital mutilation ban under the Commerce Clause because \"notably, here, the activity being regulated has absolutely no effect on interstate commerce.\"\n\nThe judge agreed.\n\n\"There is nothing commercial or economic about FGM,\" Friedman writes. \"As despicable as this practice may be, it is essentially a criminal assault ... FGM is not part of a larger market and it has no demonstrated effect on interstate commerce. The commerce Clause does not permit Congress to regulate a crime of this nature.\"\n\nThe prosecution disagrees, arguing genital mutilation is an illegal, secretive and dangerous health care service that involves interstate commerce on a number of fronts: text messages are used to arrange the procedure; parents drive their children across state lines to get the procedure; and the doctor uses medical tools in state-licensed clinics to perform the surgeries.\n\nNagarwala, meanwhile, is still facing a conspiracy charge and an obstruction count that could send her to prison for 20 years, along with the Attars. If convicted of conspiracy, Nagarwala faces up to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe case is set to go to trial in April 2019.\n\nFollow Tresa Baldas on Twitter: @Tbaldas\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/20/female-genital-mutilation-michigan/2074239002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Joel Shannon, USA TODAY", "title": "Discovery of child pornography leads to Tumblr's removal from Apple's App Store", "description": "Tumblr gone from App Store because of child porn", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/11/20/tumblr-ios-app-store-apple-child-pornography/2073740002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/62f6797f-5796-4054-944c-5e5e8d35e956/62f6797f-5796-4054-944c-5e5e8d35e956_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:25:34Z", "content": "The social networking service Tumblr announced Monday that its iOS app had been removed from Apple's App Store after child sexual abuse content had been found on the platform during a routine audit.

And we can get access to everything but the \"Doorbusters.\"\n\nThe Walmart sale kicks off Wednesday at 10 p.m. EST/7 p.m. PST online, where it will include such items as $50 off the Google Home Hub video speaker (normally $149), a $400 gift card (with lots of fine print) for last year's iPhones or $300 gift cards for the current crop.\n\nTarget's online sale begins Wednesday just after midnight PST but only for users of the REDCard, which is available for credit or debit. Target hasn't announced details of the early sale but does say many products will also be 5 percent off. The early-bird sale ends at midnight Wednesday.\n\nBest Buy already offered early access Tuesday for members of its Mybestbuy loyalty program, but many of the deals weren't in the Doorbuster category, with a few dollars off here and there.\n\nAmazon has been offering early access to find out about Black Friday deals via the Echo smart speakers, with the command \"Alexa, what are my deals?\" but the pickings are slim and not different from what's advertised online. (For instance, an Amazon Echo Dot speaker is $19.99, $20 off.)\n\nOverall, the deals this year are about on par with 2017, says David Kender, editor-in-chief of USA TODAY's Reviewed.com. \"There's a mix of great stuff and garbage, and it's sometimes hard to tell when the ads scream 40 percent off.\"\n\nThe most popular categories this year, as always, are TVs, video game consoles and games, Insta-pots and robotic vacuums, he says.\n\nHis tips for shopping on Amazon, which should be more generous about dropping prices once the holiday kicks in, is to shop now, put the items in your cart and make sure the price does indeed drop on Black Friday.\n\nHe likes the browser extensions Camelcamelcamel.com for price comparisons and Honey.com for updates on coupon codes for savings.\n\nStay on top of deals at http://gifts.usatoday.com\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/20/best-buy-target-walmart-black-friday-promo-items-only-store/2072739002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Pro Football Hall of Fame 2019 semifinalists", "description": "Meet the 25 former players and coaches who were named semifinalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's 2019 class.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/2018/11/21/pro-football-hall-fame-2019-semifinalists/2073359002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/d105cdb1-8889-46f4-8d59-85ece371726b-AP_RAIDERS_BRONCOS.jpg?crop=1881,1058,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:10:32Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press, Angela Charlton and Danica Kirka, Associated Press", "title": "Critics raise alarms of Russia-backed candidate ahead of Interpol's presidential election", "description": "Interpol is facing a pivotal \u2013 some say possibly fatal \u2013 moment in its history as members decide whether to hand its presidency to a man who represents Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/interpol-president-russia-europe/2074439002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/832c9d86-3663-4b93-8288-31f91ae48e25-AP_Interpol_Russia.jpg?crop=1563,879,x1,y299&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:10:06Z", "content": "The President of Interpol, Meng Hongwei reportedly went missing after traveling to China, where is originally from.

(Photo: Russian Interior Ministry, AP)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Interpol is facing a pivotal \u2014 some say possibly fatal \u2014 moment in its history as members decide whether to hand its presidency to a man who represents Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nKremlin critics fear they could soon face arrest wherever they go. Western governments worry that Russia could use the post to undermine the rule of law.\n\nInterpol, which elects a new president Wednesday, has weathered many challenges in its 95 years. While Hollywood has portrayed it as a hive of swashbuckling agents, in reality it\u2019s an organization sometimes tangled in red tape and clashing geopolitical interests. Nazis took it over in the 1930s, and authoritarian governments have long tried to use it to hunt down fugitive dissenters.\n\nBut the latest storm of criticism comes at an exceptional time \u2013 just as Russia is trying to expand its global clout and as some powerful countries are questioning whether they need multilateral organizations like Interpol at all.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is choosing the agency\u2019s new president at a meeting in Dubai where the front-runner is Alexander Prokopchuk, a general in Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry who is currently an Interpol vice president. Interpol\u2019s interim president, South Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Yang, is also seeking the post.\n\nTwo prominent Kremlin critics warned Tuesday that electing a high-placed Russian would undermine the international law enforcement agency and politicize police cooperation across borders.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky told reporters in London that Putin has tried to use Interpol to hunt down critics such as themselves. Having a Russian lead the agency could intensify such efforts to silence dissent, they said.\n\nActivists argue that the organization needs to increase recent efforts at muscular reform, and this won\u2019t happen if Prokopchuk becomes president, because of his ties to Putin.\n\n\u201cIt was his government that organized a terrorist attack in the U.K. using chemical weapons in Salisbury. It was his government that shot down MH17, killing 298 innocent individuals. It was his government that cheated and hacked in elections in the United States and Europe,\u201d Browder said of Putin. \u201cTo put his representative in charge of the most important international crime-fighting organization is like putting the mafia in charge.\u201d\n\nTo Moscow, the complaints are all part of a Western-led campaign to weaken a resurgent Russia.\n\nRussia denies accusations of foreign interference and announced new charges against Browder this week in a long-running legal battle against him. Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Irina Volk accused critics Tuesday of running a \u201ccampaign to discredit\u201d Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\n\nBrowder has pressed for sanctions against Russian officials charged with human rights abuses after his former lawyer died in custody. Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, spent a decade in prison after exhibiting political ambitions. Both said their places in the public eye would make them poor targets for abuse, adding that they were motivated to speak out because many other campaigners who are less well-known would be silenced if governments are allowed to export repression.\n\nThe White House came out Tuesday against the election of Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying that \u201cthe Russian government abuses Interpol\u2019s processes to harass its political opponents.\u201d He said the U.S. \u201cstrongly endorses\u201d Kim.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added: \u201cWe encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world\u2019s most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that.\u201d\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is made up of its 192 member states, each of which has an equal vote.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is best known for issuing \u201cred notices\u201d that identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world\u2019s \u201cmost-wanted\u201d list.\n\nCritics argue that countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists.\n\nThe watchdog group Fair Trials International detailed in a report last month the strides Interpol has made in reducing political abuse of red notices. The group\u2019s chief, Jago Russell, said a Russian official as Interpol president could stall or reverse those reforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal moment for Interpol,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cEither countries back away from it and find other ways to cooperate, or Interpol fixes its system so that it can be trusted. \u2026 Already there are noises about pulling out of Interpol\u201d and creating a separate agency just for democratic countries, he said.\n\nThe U.S. seems committed to Interpol for now, but has pulled out of UNESCO and international accords under President Donald Trump. Britain is pulling out of the European Union and has expressed concern about management of international bodies funded by taxpayers.\n\nInterpol itself won\u2019t comment on the upcoming vote. The Interpol presidency is more of an oversight position, compared with the hands-on leadership role of the secretary-general.\n\nMore: Missing Interpol president Meng Hongwei sent 'knife' photo to wife before disappearing\n\nRelated: French judicial official says Interpol president reported missing after traveling to China\n\nInterpol\u2019s charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality, and two years ago it introduced measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out.\n\nBut the possibility of a Putin loyalist in such a prominent role has prompted concern among those critical of the Russian president\u2019s leadership. Four U.S. senators, including Marco Rubio, have urged the Trump administration to oppose the Prokopchuk candidacy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who on Monday stated that Russia was \u201crooting for the Russian candidate,\u201d said that amounted to meddling in the vote.\n\nFair Trials International warned that a Russian president of Interpol could try to limit the money spent on staff needed to vet red notices, for example, or get rid of a recent measure to protect refugees from unfair arrest.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Interpol\u2019s votes are causing controversy.\n\nHuman rights groups raised the alarm two years ago when Interpol\u2019s general assembly approved Meng Hongwei, a longtime senior Chinese security official, as president. Amnesty International criticized \u201cChina\u2019s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad.\u201d\n\nMeng is now under arrest in China as part of a possible domestic political purge \u2013 hence Wednesday\u2019s emergency vote to replace him.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly also votes on membership, like they did on Tuesday when they rejected admitting Kosovo. Interpol members voted last year to admit Palestine as a member, creating an uproar in Israel.\\\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/interpol-president-russia-europe/2074439002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, USA TODAY", "title": "Tony Gonzalez, Ed Reed headline semifinalists for Pro Football Hall of Fame 2019 class", "description": "Tony Gonzalez, Ed Reed and Champ Bailey are the three first-year candidates who were named semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame 2019 class.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/20/pro-football-hall-fame-2019-semifinalists-tony-gonzalez/2072510002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/09063eeb-aebe-4d31-bd75-dd1cc356dbce-AP_BRONCOS_CHIEFS.jpg?crop=1555,875,x1,y154&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:09:17Z", "content": "Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez celebrates after scoring a touchdown on a 20-yard pass from Trent Green in the first quarter Sunday, Oct. 5, 2003, at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.

He may have looked the part, but it quickly became apparent that he wasn\u2019t the answer. Devin Funchess, also a bigger receiver who fit the No. 1 receiver prototype, got the next crack and, while he has been fine, it has become abundantly clear he is little more than a competent second or third option.\n\nBut Carolina may have already found its replacement for Smith. And, no, I\u2019m not talking about 2018 first-round pick D.J. Moore, who is coming off his best day as a pro in the 20-19 loss to the Lions. I\u2019m talking about a player who was on the field for just 16 offensive snaps in Detroit: Second-year receiver Curtis Samuel.\n\nThe 2017 second-round pick out of Ohio State has not seen much of the field in 2018 but has still managed to make a tremendous impact on the Panthers offense. He\u2019s played only 112 snaps all season \u2014 nearly half the number THIRD tight end Chris Manhertz (no, that\u2019s not a made-up name) has played. Smauel has touched the ball only 21 times this season. He has five touchdowns.\n\nFive. On 21 touches.\n\nNearly 25% of the plays Samuel has received the ball have ended up in the end zone. He is the most efficient touchdown-maker in the league. In 2018, 56 players have scored at least five touchdowns. All of them have touched the ball more times than Samuel has. Chargers WR Mike Williams is next on the list with 24 touches; he\u2019s played double the snaps Samuel has. Bears WR Anthony Miller is next with five scores on 29 touches but he\u2019s needed 257 snaps to get them. No other player has scored five times on fewer than 30 touches.\n\nSamuel isn\u2019t scoring easy touchdowns, either. All of his scoring plays in 2018 have been of the spectacular variety, requiring a great catch or run to get into the end zone.\n\nSamuel is more than a big play machine. He is easily the team\u2019s best route-runner, whether he\u2019s lining up in the slot or on the outside\u2026\n\nOutside of Greg Olsen, Samuel has the best hands on the team, and he showed off those hands with a clutch touchdown late in the Lions loss, contorting his body and snatching the ball out the air with his hands.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Samuel is tied with Odell Beckham Jr. for 11th in its \u201cYards per Route Run\u201d metric. And PFF has graded him as the 13th best receiver in the league this season. Here are the names ahead of him on that list:\n\nMichael Thomas\n\nTyreek Hill\n\nDeAndre Hopkins\n\nAdam Thielen\n\nJulio Jones\n\nOdell Beckham Jr.\n\nRobert Woods\n\nA.J. Green\n\nKeenan Allen\n\nDavante Adams\n\nDeSean Jackson\n\nBrandin Cooks\n\nFor whatever reason, Ron Rivera and the Panthers coaching staff have decided Samuel does not deserve more snaps than unspectacular players like Funchess, Jarius Wright and Torrey Smith. And Rivera\u2019s reasoning for Samuel not seeing the field more often has been completely unsatisfying.\n\nRivera says as far as the reasons for CJ Anderson and Curtis Samuel not getting in the game as much \u2013 \"A little to do with scheme, a little with the situation.\" \u2014 The Riot Report (@RRiotReport) October 15, 2018\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s loss, Rivera said Samuel will \u201ccontinue to get opportunities,\u201d but his snap count has actually been trending down over the last few weeks. After playing 27 snaps in Week 8, he\u2019s been on the field for a total of 52 over the last three weeks combined. The better he plays, the fewer snaps he gets, it seems.\n\nJust make Luke Kuechly the head coach already. pic.twitter.com/m8ul7RjK4i \u2014 Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) November 20, 2018\n\nMaybe the coaching staff is having a hard time envisioning a 5-foot-11, 195-pound speedster as a WR1, but look around the league: Antonio Brown, who is smaller than Samuel, is the standard. Tyreek Hill is even smaller and not far behind Brown in the league\u2019s WR hierarchy. You\u2019d think a franchise that employed Steve Smith for over a decade would realize that size doesn\u2019t really matter for receivers; then again, this is the same franchise that continues to play Funchess in the No. 1 role, so who knows.\n\nWith the Panthers\u2019 season now teetering on the edge after two straight losses, maybe Rivera will come to his senses and start playing his best receiver more than 20 snaps a game. It\u2019s become clear that the Panthers defense isn\u2019t very good, and if this team is going to hang with other playoff contenders, it will have to start scoring more points. Playing the NFL\u2019s most efficient touchdown-scorer should help."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Gonzalez, Reed, Bailey among 25 Hall of Fame semifinalists", "description": "First-year eligible Tony Gonzalez, Ed Reed and Champ Bailey are among 25 semifinalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/20/gonzalez-reed-bailey-among-25-hall-of-fame-semifinalists/38576713/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:05:00Z", "content": "First-year eligible Tony Gonzalez, Ed Reed and Champ Bailey are among 25 semifinalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Cindy Hyde-Smith return campaign donations in the aftermath of the Republican's controversial remarks about attending a \"public hanging.\"\n\nThe retailer's request for an up to $4,000 refund comes days after Union Pacific and Boston Scientific also asked for their money back.\n\nHyde-Smith's troubles track back to recently surfaced video from a Nov. 2 campaign event in Tupelo where she thanked a supporter, saying she would \"fight a circular saw for him,\" before adding: \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nWalmart began backpedaling from the contribution, shortly after reporter Judd Legum disclosed the donation.\n\nThe company tweeted to several users, including actress Debra Messing, that Hyde-Smith's comments \"clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates.\"\n\nMore: Trump: \u2018It\u2019s a shame\u2019 Mississippi senator is being criticized over \u2018hanging\u2019 comment\n\nMore: President Trump to campaign for Cindy Hyde-Smith in Mississippi runoff\n\nLast week, Google released a statement saying it was unaware of Hyde-Smith's remarks when it donated to her campaign.\n\nMississippi's U.S. Senate runoff is deep in the homestretch.\n\nWalmart's request is the latest indication that the controversy dogging Hyde-Smith's comments is unlikely to fade by the runoff Nov. 27.\n\nHigh-profile backers of Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy have dumped more than $2.6 million into the race since the Nov. 6 election.\n\nMississippians should expect to see at least some of those last-minute campaign donations reflected in a 12th-hour TV advertising blitzkrieg and voter mobilization efforts, including door knocking and direct mailers.\n\nCampaigns are required to disclose contributions at or above $1,000 within 48 hours of the election, and the Clarion Ledger is keeping close watch as the federal filings roll in.\n\nMore: U.S. Senate race is getting national attention after Hyde-Smith videos\n\nWhat's happened since the Nov. 6 special election?\n\nSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith\n\nNational GOP heavyweights, business leaders and state political leaders have rallied around Hyde-Smith as the appointed U.S. senator seeks to make her temporary assignment a full-time post. Hyde-Smith has raised nearly $362,000 since the runoff, with notable donors including former Gov. Haley Barbour and Ken Kendrick, owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team.\n\nAmid the narrow fundraising race, Hyde-Smith has returned at least one donation.\n\nHyde-Smith's official fundraising committee returned a $2,700 donation to Peter Zieve after reports surfaced saying Hyde-Smith had accepted funds from the Washington businessman whose anti-Muslim rhetoric led to a $485,000 fine in 2017 from the Washington state attorney general's office.\n\nMike Espy\n\nAlthough Espy launched his U.S. Senate bid with a $100,000 self-loan, he proved his fundraising power in short time by raising more than $1 million in three months. What's more, he narrowly out-raised Hyde-Smith during the same quarter. Fundraising numbers show contributions to Espy have topped $370,000 since the runoff. Actress Chelsea Handler and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick are among the notable out-of-state contributors.\n\nOutside spending since Nov. 6\n\nMoney spent supporting Hyde-Smith: $65,677\n\nMoney spent supporting Espy: $59,515\n\nMoney spent against Espy: $2.68 million\n\nMoney spent against Hyde-Smith: $507,900\n\nContact Bracey Harris at 601-961-7248 or bharris2@gannett.com.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Just like everybody fortunate enough to be at the Coliseum on Monday night, Sean McVay was still buzzing when he left the building after the Los Angeles Rams' epic victory over Kansas City.\n\nWhen he finally reached his suburban home, the coach wasn't ready to lose that feeling. Instead, McVay and some friends kicked off the Rams' bye week by watching highlights of Los Angeles' 54-51 win deep into the night.\n\n\"I was pretty wired, man,\" McVay said Tuesday afternoon, about 21 hours after kickoff. \"I would say right now is about the first time I'm starting to wind down and to be able to take a nap hopefully here soon.\"\n\nMcVay and the Rams have absolutely earned their sleep.\n\nLos Angeles (10-1) is this season's first team to reach double digits in victories after holding off the Chiefs in a game that featured so many eye-popping digits: a 14-touchdown, 105-point, 1,001-yard masterpiece of pure entertainment.\n\nThe third highest-scoring game in league history was the latest peak in the Rams' two-year transformation under McVay, whose staff has put this long-downtrodden franchise in position to clinch its first back-to-back division titles since the 1970s as soon as this weekend if Carolina beats Seattle.\n\nThe win over Kansas City also was the culmination of two difficult weeks for the organization and its city.\n\nPlayers, coaches and team employees were forced from their homes by wildfires two weeks ago while many were still reeling from a mass shooting near their training complex in Thousand Oaks. The Rams then spent the previous week on the road in Colorado Springs to train for the high altitudes of Mexico City \u2014 only to have the Monday night game moved back home to LA on six days' notice.\n\n\"I think the players did an outstanding job of handling what seems like two weeks that was about two years' worth of things that they had to go through,\" McVay said. \"All they did was just handle it like pros and do everything the right way that makes you appreciative of just being able to work with people like this.\"\n\nThe final snap against Kansas City felt like closure to the players who persevered through this two-week stretch. McVay and the Rams now get a holiday week to contemplate what they've accomplished and how far they've still got to go.\n\nBecause for all their success, McVay knows the Rams have ample room for improvement.\n\nMcVay and his staff will use part of their bye week to study this triumph over the Chiefs, likely turning a critical eye on ways to help a defense that relied on big plays to survive this thriller. Kansas City outgained Los Angeles 546-455 with six touchdown passes by Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe Rams are desperately looking forward to the probable post-bye return of standout cornerback Aqib Talib. They were also happy to get contributions from surprising defensive sources in an otherwise offense-dominated night.\n\nSamson Ebukam, the Rams' unsung second-year outside linebacker, might have been the most important player on the field against the Chiefs. Ebukam returned a fumble forced by Aaron Donald for a touchdown, made a preposterous one-armed interception and returned it for another TD, and finally pressured Mahomes just enough to impede his throwing motion on a pass subsequently intercepted by Rams teammate Marcus Peters with 1:18 left.\n\n\"It's crazy we had five takeaways, just to see they still put up 51 points,\" Rams receiver Robert Woods said. \"We tried to eliminate the big plays, but we know they have some talented players. At the end of the day, we sealed them off.\"\n\nThe Rams can also use their time off to get healthy, which is always a good thing at this time of year.\n\nLos Angeles dropped those 54 points on Kansas City even with mild contributions from NFL rushing leader Todd Gurley, whose 13-game touchdown streak ended while he made just 12 carries for 54 yards and caught three passes for 39 yards.\n\nConfirming what many suspected during the game, McVay said Gurley was limited by an ankle injury after \"getting rolled up on\" earlier in the game.\n\nMcVay doesn't believe it will be a long-term problem, and he said Gurley's light action in the second half was mostly due to the Chiefs' schemes \u2014 particularly a set with 11 men in the box late in the game, leading to McVay's decision to call passing plays in a last-minute attempt to get a game-clinching first down.\n\n\"There were a lot of instances where they were playing some defensive structures where they were basically daring you to throw it,\" McVay said. \"That's a result of the respect they have for Todd and our running game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 At times like this, when Michigan State is dealing with a disappointing game or season, coach Mark Dantonio sometimes becomes philosophical.\n\nThat was certainly the case Tuesday. When asked whether his team has underachieved this year, Dantonio went on for more than 3 1/2 minutes, discussing injuries, the Spartans' offensive struggles and his players' academic performance.\n\n\"I always try and keep things in perspective, because it's tough,\" Dantonio said. \"These jobs are tough, and you have to be able to keep things in perspective in order to get better. If you don't, you send people south.\"\n\nA season that began amid high expectations is winding down with a bit of a whimper. The best Michigan State can hope for now is a win over Rutgers in Saturday's regular-season finale, followed by another victory in a bowl. That would give the Spartans an eight-win season. Michigan State has lost two straight games and did not score a touchdown in eitherone .\n\nThe Spartans (6-5) are already bowl eligible, so this won't be as bad as the 2016, when they finished 3-9. But after winning 10 games in 2017, Michigan State appeared to have regained its recent status as an elite team in the Big Ten. This season, the Spartans have been good on the defensive side of the ball \u2014 and that hasn't been enough.\n\nInjuries have certainly played a role, affecting every aspect of the offense \u2014 and special teams as well.\n\n\"We're on our fourth punter. I mean, that's unheard of,\" Dantonio said. \"We've got basically two players on our entire offense who have not missed games.\"\n\nQuarterback Brian Lewerke, running back LJ Scott and wide receiver Felton Davis are among the players who have missed time for the Spartans. Dantonio said he's not sure if injuries cost Michigan State games, but it's certainly possible the team could have played better if it had been healthier.\n\nInstead, the Spartans fell out of the conference title race and are having to find other ways to motivate themselves, now that their loftiest aspirations are out of the question.\n\n\"One quote that's been tossed around a lot this year is 'getting ourselves off the mat' \u2014 nobody's going to feel bad for us,\" safety Khari Willis said. \"Stepping up to the challenge each and every week, just trying to make sure that our guys are ready to go.\"\n\nDantonio hopes his program still has a solid foundation.\n\n\"I look at it, as a whole, our program as a whole, and I ask ourselves: What kind of chemistry do we have? What are we doing in school? Highest grade-point average that we've ever had. What are we doing on the field?\" Dantonio said. \"Still won six games right now. Want to win seven. Want to win eight.\"\n\nAfter all the success Michigan State has had under Dantonio, the difference between six wins and eight may not seem like much, but he clearly believes it's important to finish 2018 on a strong note.\n\n\"This year is not done yet,\" Dantonio said. \"I do believe that this year will still be a success. I firmly believe that it will be a success. We'll make it a success \u2014 the way we handle things and the way we handle problems.\"\n\nNOTES: Dantonio said WR Brandon Sowards, a fifth-year senior, is planning to apply for an extra year of eligibility. He missed all of the 2017 season because of a knee injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 For the second time this season the Seahawks are having to find an option at weakside linebacker with K.J. Wright is sidelined due to injury.\n\nWright has missed seven of Seattle's 10 games played this season due to a knee injury that surfaced during pregame warmups of the team's preseason game in Minnesota in August. Wright had surgery shortly after and missed the first six weeks of the season as setbacks in his recovery slowed his return to the field.\n\nThe knee issue again sidelined Wright during the team's loss to the Los Angeles Rams and kept him out of the Thursday night victory over the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\"He's still working to get back,\" head coach Pete Carroll said Tuesday.\n\nBarkevious Mingo started in place of Wright against the Packers before being replaced after just one defensive series by Austin Calitro. Calitro also replaced rookie Shaquem Griffin in the team's opener against Denver.\n\nMychal Kendricks was then signed and started the next three games for Seattle before the league imposed an eight-game suspension for a guilty plea in an insider-trading case. While Kendricks returned to practice Tuesday, he's ineligible to play for another two weeks while serving the final stretch of his suspension.\n\nMeanwhile, it's uncertain whether just rest and rehab will be enough to get Wright back on the field in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We're going to find out. We don't know,\" Carroll said.\n\nThe Seahawks are going with Calitro this week for their matchup against the Carolina Panthers. The undrafted rookie has started three of 10 games played for Seattle this year in relief of Wright, with 22 tackles, a pass defended and a half sack of Aaron Rodgers last Thursday against the Packers.\n\n\"We're gaining experience as we go,\" Carroll said. \"Austin has done a nice job when he's had his chances. He's still a young player so there's stuff to learn and all but he's done a nice job, particularly in the physical side of hitting and tackling and all.\"\n\nCalitro will likely keep the gig until either Wright or Kendricks are able to return.\n\n\"We just have to understand it's kind of a next man up,\" middle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \"Everybody kind of knows I trust everybody that's been in the position. Austin is in it right now. We have a lot of confidence in him.\"\n\nKendricks is eligible to play against the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 10.\n\n\"It's great for Mychal in particular;\" Carroll said of having Kendricks back at practice. \"He needs to get going and doing some stuff that's positive and all of that. He had a really good experience with us before. We loved him playing for us.\"\n\nNotes: RB J.D. McKissic was designated to return from injured reserve and returned to practice Tuesday. McKissic injured his foot in the preseason and was placed on injured reserve following roster cuts in early September.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Bulldogs, though, still have control of their playoff fate with Georgia Tech and Alabama up next on their schedule.\n\nOklahoma continues to stay at No. 6 even though the Sooners did not look spectacular against Kansas.

The Knights, who beat Cincinnati in impressive fashion Saturday for their 23rd consecutive consecutive win, passed Ohio State even though the Buckeyes beat Maryland. They also leaped West Virginia, which fell from ninth to No. 13 following their loss to Oklahoma State.\n\nThe Mountaineers are still in the Big 12 title race, but likely won't have an opportunity rise high enough even with this Friday's showdown against Oklahoma and a likely matchup against Texas the following week in the conference championship game should they win.\n\nThe Buckeyes, which held their place in 10th following a difficult defeat of Maryland in overtime, can still win the Big Ten East by defeating rival Michigan at home Saturday. That would send Ohio State into the conference championship game against No. 19 Northwestern, providing a path to the playoff should other contenders falter.\n\nThe top four teams in final rankings on Dec. 2 will play in the semifinals.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Pac-12 winds up the regular season this week with a few loose ends.\n\nLike the Pac-12 North.\n\nSeventh-ranked Washington State hosts No. 16 Washington on Friday in the Apple Cup with the division's spot in the Pac-12 championship game on the line.\n\nFor Washington State, the stakes are higher. The Cougars still have a shot \u2014 however slim \u2014 of making the College Football Playoff. But they'll need to beat the Huskies, then beat Utah in the conference championship, and hope a couple of teams above them in the national rankings tumble.\n\nIf the Cougars win out and don't get selected, they're headed for the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut first things first. It will be the 111th Apple Cup, and the third in a row where both teams are ranked. Two seasons ago, the Cougars and the Huskies were both 7-1 in conference play going into the game in Pullman and Washington won 45-17 to earn a spot in the league championship. The Huskies went on to face Alabama in the CFP semifinals.\n\nWashington has won the last five Apple Cups, but coach Chris Petersen isn't counting on recent trends for this one. This season has been too strange for that.\n\n\"I think you just look at what's happened around our league and every program in there. I think that says it all. It's very, very different year to year in college football,\" Petersen said.\n\nWashington State coach Mike Leach played down the rivalry aspect of the game. He said \"like most weeks the challenge is with ourselves.\"\n\n\"I think they're already focused,\" Leach said about his team. \"The biggest thing is having a good week of practice. Have a good week of practice and then duplicate that.\"\n\nOther things to note heading into the final weekend of the season:\n\nBOWL BOUND: Bowl season is quickly approaching, so here's a handy primer for the Pac-12's arrangements: The league has seven bowl partners, led by the Rose Bowl. The winner of the Pac-12 championship goes to Pasadena \u2014 unless it is one of the four national playoff teams, and then it would go to either the Orange or Cotton bowls. The Rose Bowl would replace the CFP-bound team with another league team to face an opponent from the Big Ten.\n\nAfter the Granddaddy Of Them All, set for Jan. 1, the other bowls are: The Alamo Bowl against the Big 12 on Dec. 28, the Holiday Bowl against the Big Ten on Dec. 31, the Redbox Bowl against the Big Ten on Dec. 31, the Sun Bowl against the ACC on Dec. 31, the Las Vegas Bowl against the MWC on Dec. 15 and the Cheez-It Bowl against the Big 12 on Dec. 26.\n\nLet's take a moment to appreciate the bowl named after a popular snack cracker.\n\nCurrently, there are six teams in the league that are already bowl-eligible with one game left.\n\nRIVALRY WEEK: In addition to the Apple Cup, there are two other conference rivalry games this weekend. Oregon and Oregon State meet Friday in the annual Civil War, which is essentially only for pride this season, and Arizona faces Arizona State on Saturday in the Territorial Cup. The game is important for Arizona because the Wildcats need one more win to reach six and secure bowl eligibility.\n\nUSC hosts Notre Dame in the 90th meeting of their intersectional rivalry, and Utah hosts BYU in the Holy War. Colorado visits Cal and Stanford is at UCLA for the other two regular-season finales.\n\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham isn't particularly fond of having the Holy War at the end of the season \u2014 and on Saturday \u2014 because the Pac-12 championship is looming in the distance and the North's representative will be determined Friday.\n\n\"I guess ideally you'd like a bye this week so that you could prepare for what's coming up next. So we have the six-day turnaround where whoever we face has the seven-day turnaround, so that isn't ideal, but that is how it lays out,\" Whittingham said. \"Nothing we can do about it. I don't think the rivalry game is scheduled for the end of the year in the foreseeable future, I think it moves back to the beginning.\"\n\nSpeaking of Utah, they'll play for the Pac-12 championship for the first time since joining the league.\n\nHOTSEAT UPDATE: Mike MacIntyre became the first Pac-12 coach of the season to fall when Colorado dismissed him Sunday. Clay Helton still has his job at USC as of Tuesday. This seems to be shaping up to be a quieter offseason than last year when there were five coaching changes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Howard Simmons) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAlabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan were at the top of the College Football Playoff rankings Tuesday night, marking the first time in the five-year history of the postseason system that the same teams held the first four spots for three straight weeks.\n\nUnlike last week, there was a little movement in the top 10. Unbeaten Central Florida moved up two spots to No. 9. The Knights became the first team from outside the Power Five conference to be ranked in the selection committee's top 10.\n\nGeorgia remained No. 5, followed by Oklahoma at sixth. LSU remained seventh, Washington State held at 8 and Ohio State stayed at 10th, getting jumped by UCF.\n\nCommittee chairman Rob Mullens, the Oregon athletic director, said the group spend \"considerable time\" discussing Ohio State, which beat Maryland 52-51 in overtime on Saturday, and UCF, coming off a 38-13 victory against CIncinnati.\n\n\"We said while UCF might not have the depth of talent of Ohio State, the committee thought they're playing more as an all-around team,\" Mullens said.\n\nNo. 11 was Florida, which could help the Gators secure a New Year's Six bowl bid. Penn State is 12th.\n\n___\n\nUCF'S LONG SHOT\n\nThere does not seem to be a realistic path to the playoff for UCF. What about an unrealistic one? Maybe. Imbalanced conferences have set traps for playoff contenders that UCF athletic director Danny White could not have laid out any better.\n\nThere is a case to be made that there is literally no way UCF would be allowed in the playoff. The conspiracy theorist would say the selection committee has been given their Power Five marching orders and that's that. There is a glass ceiling over UCF no matter the chaos in the other conferences. The less cynical would say UCF's schedule, not as rigorous as the other top teams, would deservedly keep the Knights out even if the alternative is teams that have lost two or even three games.\n\nCFP executive director Bill Hancock has often said there is no glass ceiling on the Group of Five teams. They just need aggressive and fortuitous nonconference scheduling. The example often give is Houston of the American Athletic Conference in 2016. The Cougars, coming off a Peach Bowl victory like UCF this season, beat two highly ranked Power Five teams with star quarterback that season \u2014 Oklahoma with Baker Mayfield and Louisville with Lamar Jackson. But they lost three conference games and didn't even earn a major bowl bid.\n\nBut a Group of Five team with those types of nonconference victories, plus a strong conference record and league title, would have a chance to make the final four.\n\nUCF doesn't have those victories this season. Its game against North Carolina was cancelled by a hurricane, and the Tar Heels aren't any good, anyway. UCF did play and pound Pittsburgh in September and the Panthers have turned out to be a good enough to reach the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game against Clemson in two weeks.\n\nThe Panthers (7-4) are one of the keys that could help UCF pick the lock on the playoff.\n\nNorthwestern (7-4) of the Big Ten and Utah (8-3) of the Pac-12 have also clinched spots in their respective conference championship game, and Texas (8-3) could do the same in the Big 12 on Friday by beating Kansas.\n\nUCF needs all these teams to win their conference titles and Alabama to win the Southeastern Conference at 13-0. At that point Notre Dame would likely reach the playoff no matter what it does against Southern California this weekend. Let's just assume the Irish win and are 12-0 and in.\n\nThat leaves two spots and four of the five Power Five conference champions have at least three losses. None of those teams are getting in. The conference title game losers could still be in the mix, but what if these are the conference title games losers?\n\n\u2014 Washington (8-3) after the Huskie beat Washington State in the Apple Cup.\n\n\u2014 West Virginia (8-2) after the Mountaineers beat Oklahoma.\n\n\u2014 Ohio State (10-1) after the Buckeyes beat Michigan.\n\n\u2014 Clemson (11-0) after the Tigers beat South Carolina.\n\nThat would leave Clemson 12-1, with a loss to Pitt \u2014 the team UCF crushed.\n\nAssuming Clemson gets a mulligan and gets into the playoff, every other team would have at least two losses. At that point, wouldn't the committee have to give UCF a chance?\n\n____\n\nFollow Ralph D.

(AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Jack Nicklaus says if he were in a high-stakes match in Las Vegas in his prime, the most compelling opponent would be Arnold Palmer. Never mind that he considers his toughest rival to be Tom Watson. Or that he finished runner-up to Lee Trevino in majors four times in seven years.\n\nWith apologies to the super-hyped exhibition between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson on pay-per-view, any talk of rivalries in golf starts with Nicklaus and Palmer.\n\n\"I rarely lost to Arnold,\" Nicklaus said last week before an American Cancer Society benefit. \"We never ended up coming down the stretch every much.\"\n\nNicklaus was a runner-up to him six times, including the 1960 U.S. Open at Cherry Hills as a 20-year-old amateur.\n\nBut unlike Woods-Mickelson, who never really squared off in a major until Woods' fifth year on the tour, Nicklaus famously beat Palmer in a playoff to win the 1962 U.S. Open at Oakmont in Palmer's backyard.\n\n\"Arnold and my rivalry became more from the two us,\" Nicklaus said. \"We would play together a lot. We were paired a lot. And usually we beat each other up and we ended up giving the tournament away. That's why they talk about the rivalry. Everyone was interested in who won that day, not who won the tournament.\"\n\nNicklaus was reminded of the 1970 U.S. Open at Hazeltine, where the tournament scoreboard had the names Palmer, Nicklaus and Gary Player at the bottom the entire week. None of them finished in the top 40.\n\n\"I've never seen a tournament ever do anything like that,\" Nicklaus said.\n\nNicklaus also finished runner-up in the majors four times to Watson, all coming down to the final few holes, none more dramatic than Turnberry in 1977.\n\n\"Watson was the toughest,\" Nicklaus said. \"He was a kid with blinders on. I love the way Tom played.\"\n\nTrevino won by four shots at Oak Hill in the 1968 U.S. Open, then beat Nicklaus in a playoff at Merion in 1971 and denied Nicklaus the third leg of the Grand Slam a year later by beating him at Muirfield. And in 1974, Trevino got him by one shot at Tanglewood in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"He thrived on competitive moments,\" Nicklaus said.\n\nBut Palmer? That was different.\n\nHe said the rivalry started in 1958 when Nicklaus, an 18-year-old amateur, was invited to take part in a day honoring Dow Finsterwald.\n\n\"On the first tee we had a driving contest,\" Nicklaus said. \"Arnold drove it on the green. I drove it 30 yards over the green. I never let Arnold forget that. I'd say, 'Hey AP, we had one driving contest, I hit it 30 yards by you.' He'd say, 'Yeah, but I shot 63 that day and you shot 67.' To me, that was the start of our rivalry. Ever since we played, we always had fun with that.\n\n\"I'd say, if I hadn't shot 39 on the last nine holes at Cherry Hills, no one would have ever heard of you.' And he'd say to me, 'If I hadn't three-putted nine times in '62, nobody would have ever heard of you.' That was our banter.\"\n\nThere was no social media back then. Or pay-per-view.\n\nCHAMP'S BONUS\n\nCameron Champ had an ideal start to his rookie season by winning the Sanderson Farms Championship, making all five of his cuts and earning nearly $1.3 million. And while he lost a chance to win at Sea Island, he cashed in another way.\n\nChamp won $300,000 through the \"Birdies Fore Love\" competition by making the most birdies over the fall part of the season.\n\nThe money goes to the charity of his choice, and the 23-year-old already has the Cameron Champion Foundation geared toward STEM education and youth golf.\n\n\"Charity and giving back has always been a thing of mine and my family personally,\" he said. \"We didn't come from much, but we always gave back as much as possible.\"\n\nJ.J. Spaun was second in birdies and is directing $150,000 to the United Way for low-income families affected by the California wildfires. Joel Dahmen was third and is giving the $50,000 to the Send It Foundation to support young adults fighting cancer by providing outdoor activities. Dahmen and his brother are cancer survivors, and their mother died of cancer when he was a junior in high school.\n\nDESERT START\n\nRory McIlroy is skipping his traditional start in Abu Dhabi for the first time when healthy. In his place, the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship won't be entirely without star power. Dustin Johnson already has said he's playing for the third straight year. He will be joined by U.S. Open and PGA champion Brooks Koepka, who returns for the first time since his rookie year on the European Tour in 2014.\n\n\"Last time I played in 2014, I was ranked 93rd in the world, so a lot has happened since that time,\" Koepka said.\n\nJASON GONE\n\nJason Gore was one round away from one of the most unlikely stories on the PGA Tour.\n\nHe missed 10 out of 13 cuts on the Web.com Tour, missing time to have a procedure on his ailing back. He became licensed to sell insurance in California and was playing golf with clients. And then he got a late exemption to the RSM Classic and went into the final round one shot out of the lead.\n\nThat's where the dream ended. Gore shot a 2-over 72 and tied for 15th. A top 10 would have got him into the field at the Sony Open next year.\n\nAs a past champion, Gore can get in a half-dozen tournaments by his priority status and others by sponsor's exemption as one of the PGA Tour's more gregarious characters. He says he is asking for exemptions.\n\nBut he says he's done with the grind on the Web.com Tour, where he has spent seven of the last 10 seasons.\n\n\"This is going to sound terrible and it's a great place to play, the Web.com Tour, but I'm just kind of done,\" Gore said. \"Those kids are really good and it's not worth missing our child's life at my stage. It's an unbelievable place. But at 44, it's not worth it for me to miss watching a son and a daughter grow up. I'm not going to sit there and beat my head against the wall against kids that I could be their dad.\"\n\nA NEW MEMORY\n\nFormer British Amateur champion Scott Gregory had a rough summer, especially when he opened with a 92 in the first round of the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.\n\nThe year ended on a high note, however, as he shot 62 in the third round of European Tour qualifying and wound up tying for 11th. Gregory was among 27 players who earned their cards for next season.\n\n\"I'm just over the moon,\" he said. \"It makes up for a few of the things that I went through this year.\"\n\nDIVOTS\n\nRSM has extended its title sponsorship of the PGA Tour at Sea Island through 2025. ... Shubhankar Sharma of India won the Sir Henry Cotton Award as the European Tour's top rookie. Sharma won twice last season. He is the third Asian to win the award in the last four years, following Jeunghun Wang (2016) and Byeong Hun An (2015), both of South Korea. ... The LPGA Tour season ended with only three Americans among the top 20 in the world \u2014 Lexi Thompson (5), Jessica Korda (12) and Danielle Kang (18). ... Eleven countries have won the last 11 times in the World Cup of Golf, a streak of parity that began with Japan in 2002.\n\nSTAT OF THE WEEK\n\nTournaments on three other tours offered more world ranking points last week than the RSM Classic (24) on the PGA Tour \u2014 the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai (52), the Australian Open (32) and the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan (30).\n\nFINAL WORD\n\n\"I had to apologize on 18 to Cameron because I pretty much talked his ear off. I guess I turned into Lee Trevino with no talent.\" \u2014 The outgoing Jason Gore after playing the third round of the RSM Classic with Cameron Champ.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

After all, everyone knows what Dawson can do. Why not cut him and see what the rookie can do?\n\nWhile Dawson is still on the roster, a young kicker has joined the team, and local fans will like the move.\n\nThey signed former Arizona State standout Zane Gonzalez, who was the best kicker in college football in 2016, to the practice squad.\n\nIt was a move that some probably expected to happen with McCrane at some point in the weeks to come.\n\nDawson, 43 years old and in the final year of his two-year, $6 million contract, won\u2019t be coming back next season.

Once the season is over, the Cardinals can sign him to a future contract for 2019 in January. He gets a few weeks to learn the system and the Cardinals have a young kicker in camp.\n\nGonzalez hasn\u2019t had a great start to his NFL career. He was 15-of-20 on field goal attempts as a rookie in 2017 with the Cleveland Browns, which wasn\u2019t great. He then missed three of five kicks to start this season and was let go.\n\nHe dealt with a groin issue and the Cardinals brought him in earlier in the season.\n\nAdding Gonzalez means he should at least be in the mix for the job next year.

Short covering is adding to the boost in both commodity prices and stock prices for major producers. (Photo: Jitalia17 / Getty Images)\n\nA surprising pre-winter snowstorm hit the Northeast recently and brought mass transit in some of the nation's most populated areas to its knees.\n\nIn New York, Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main gateway for interstate buses into Manhattan, was so crowded with commuters that it completely shut down. Across the East River in New Jersey, Newark's Penn Station was wall-to-wall with exhausted straphangers who faced scattered delays.\n\nIn Philadelphia, SEPTA, the regional transportation authority, and Amtrak experienced cancellations throughout the day and night as trees took down train power lines.\n\nWith an El Ni\u00f1o-predicted winter season ahead, are mass transit systems in the Northeastern section of the U.S. prepared to handle the snow?\n\nHere's what transit experts had to say:\n\nNew York City\n\n\"The city's subways were built as a response to a snowstorm, so they're largely resilient during snow events,\" said Danny Pearlstein, policy and communications director at the Riders Alliance, an organization that fights for reliable public transportation. \"The problem with the last storm was that the forecasts were off.\"\n\nThe New York City subway system is over 100 years old and was built as a response to the Great Blizzard of 1888, a storm that paralyzed the East Coast from the Chesapeake Bay to Maine. The storm buried the unprepared city with drifts that were over 45 inches high, according to National Weather Service.\n\nThough nothing nearly that significant is predicted this cold weather season, Pearlstein said the Big Apple's public transit can use some upgrades above ground to prepare for the coming winter months.\n\nMore: Chris Christie joins everybody else in attacking New Jersey governor about snow commute\n\nMore: Early season winter blast creates hellish conditions for commuters\n\n\"Our primary concern is that we build a bus network with all the features of a 21st-century bus system,\" Pearlstein said. He said that only one out of every five bus stops has a shelter to protect commuters from wind, rain and snow. \"We aren't expecting service to be perfect, but we expect it to be safe and reliable.\"\n\nHey Bus Riders, did you have to wait in the snow without a shelter for your bus? \u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\ude89\n\n\n\nSend us your pics of your shelterless bus stop. Tell Mayor Bill #deBusio that ALL New Yorkers should have bus shelters. pic.twitter.com/XlOvUPpybH \u2014 Riders Alliance (@RidersNY) November 15, 2018\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nLike other cities, the first snow of the season led to a nightmare commute. Buses slid and got stuck, passengers had to walk in the slush, and trains were subject to delays up to 90 minutes, according to NBC 10.\n\nIn a statement, SEPTA said 32 of its bus routes were directly impacted by the storm.\n\nDespite the pre-winter blindside, an avid SEPTA bus rider and transit expert said Philadelphia is \"at least 90 percent prepared\" to tackle inclement winter weather.\n\n\"As long as you're along a subway route, there's a 90 percent chance you'll get where you need to go during a snowstorm in Philadelphia,\" said Marcus McKnight, who has over six years of transit experience, working in various capacities for Southeastern Pennsylvania transportation authority.\n\nPeople who live or work on side streets will likely have a more difficult time getting to their destinations, McKnight said.\n\nCommuters wait for the Hudson Link in Tarrytown, N.Y. which is operating on a delay during a steady snowfall for the evening commute Nov. 15, 2108. (Photo: TANIA SAVAYAN, The Journal News via USA TODAY Network)\n\nWashington\n\nThe nation's capital has made strides to improve its public transportation system after years of deepening concerns over safety and reliability.\n\nWMATA, the tri-jurisdictional government agency that operates the transit service, installed thousands of electrical insulators to reduce fires, new railroad ties to help keep tracks properly in place, and if a rush hour trip is delayed by 15 minutes or more, the ride is free of charge.\n\nDespite the improvements, transit enthusiasts say that the system can quickly become unreliable when faced with weather disturbances.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything remarkable about how D.C. performs in the snow. It's bad in the rain, it's bad when it snows, and it's bad just about any other time,\" said the founder of Unsuck D.C. Metro, an anonymous blog and Twitter account that tracks the Metro's problems. \"Despite billions in investment over the past ten years, service seems to just be getting worse.\"\n\nD.C.'s subway ridership has been on the decline for about a decade, the transportation advocate said.\n\nThe railroad system in D.C. will shut down if snowfall approaches 8 inches, WMATA said in a statement, and bus service is limited to major roads only. During light snow, most services should operate normally.\n\nBoston\n\nIn 2015, Boston broke its seasonal snowfall record with 108.6 inches, leading to what experts called \"one of the biggest transit failures in recent history.\"\n\nThere was a series of blizzards and snowstorms for several weeks in a row, completely wiping out the T, Boston's subway service. Since then, Massachusetts has invested over $100 million toward snow-proofing the transit system.\n\n\"In advance of this winter, we\u2019re doubling down on our efforts to highlight the key resources that allow us to get the most accurate information about service out to our customers so they can make informed decisions,\" Transit Authority General Manager Luis Manuel Ramirez said in a statement last year.\n\nIn preparation for snow, Boston has trimmed trees along railroad corridors, installed new rails, and expanded snow clearing and snow removal contracts.\n\n\"It's commendable that the state committed this money to invest in resiliency measures,\" said Tim Lawrence, VP of operations and communications director for Transit Matters, a public transportation advocacy group. \"But there's one ongoing problem.\"\n\nBoston's Blue subway line runs along the beach at sea level and under the Boston Harbor, Lawrence said. \"Being right on the harbor, snow can cause higher than normal tides which can lead to flooding in some of the stations. We are trying to push the Commonwealth to think about that.\"\n\n\"No matter where you are, when you get a record amount of snow, things are going to break,\" Lawrence said. \"We've learned that whatever problems exist before it snows will really be highlighted when there's a blizzard.\"\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/20/snowstorms-how-equipped-public-transportation-northeast/2055974002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Indians OF Martin cleared to work out after medical scare", "description": "Cleveland Indians outfielder Leonys Martin has been cleared by doctors following a medical scare", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/11/20/indians-of-martin-cleared-to-work-out-after-medical-scare/38576487/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc8e142ccda060d6c5baebada4fe6648ef6cdae1/c=0-120-4374-2580/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/51555e25b97c49e1a0b6de7854c83567.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:16:17Z", "content": "FILE - In this Aug. 4, 2018, file photo, Cleveland Indians' Leonys Martin runs out a ground ball during the team's baseball game against the Los Angeles Angels in Cleveland.

However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\n\n\nBlack Friday 2018 is almost here, and the deals have already begun. At Reviewed, our shopping and TV experts are tracking prices all month long to bring you the best Black Friday deals. Though there are a couple notable doorbusters on cheap TVs, the great news is the best Black Friday TV deals we've found are all live right now. Here are the ones you should check out:\n\nThe Best Black Friday 2018 TV deals available now:\n\n1. LG C8 OLED 4K TV\u2014$1,696.99 on Amazon (Save $500): This is the best TV of the year. It usually goes for $2,200, but has been dropping little by little since September, and right now it's at its lowest price we've seen at major retailers (and it's available with Prime shipping). The 65-inch is $300 off right now too, marking its lowest Amazon price of the season.\n\n2. TCL 43-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018)\u2014$279.99 on Amazon (Save $50): This TCL 4K TV is a bit cheaper than the nicer S5 model, which is on sale for $320 (down from $350). The main reason this one's $40 less? Unlike the S5, the S4 doesn't have Dolby Vision and the Roku remote doesn't have a headphone jack for wireless audio, but you can't beat the picture quality for the price.\n\n3. Samsung NU8000 55-In. 8-Series Smart 4K TV\u2014$747.99 on Amazon (Save $150): We were impressed by this TV in our tests, but our main hangup was the high starting price. This deal sorts that out, netting you a very good all-around name-brand TV for an affordable price. You can also get a 65-inch model on sale for $997.99 ($300 off), making it one of the cheaper 65-inch 2018 TVs in this class.\n\n4. TCL 55-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2017)\u2014$349.99 on Amazon (Save $30): With 4K and Roku's streaming platform built in, you really can't find a better deal on an entry-level big screen TV. At this low sale price, we love this 4K TV, especially for secondary viewing areas like bedrooms, kitchens, or playrooms. It usually costs $380, and originally retailed for $450, so it's a great buy on one of last year's best budget TVs.\n\n5. TCL 65-in. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018 6 Series)\u2014$899.99 at Best Buy (Save $70): This is the Best Buy exclusive version of one of our favorite TVs this year, offering awesome picture quality, the Roku smart platform, and pristine HDR in a 65-inch package. The non-Best Buy version goes for $999 regularly, so you're basically saving $100 off the competition here.\n\n6. Samsung 50-in. 6-Series 4K TV (2018)\u2014$327.99 (Save $272): It's not often you can get a 50-inch 4K Samsung TV for under $350, but here we are. This is one of the lower-end 4K TVs Samsung offers, but if you prefer Samsung over budget-conscious brands like Vizio and TCL, this is a great deal.\n\n\n\n7. Sony 65-in. X850F 4K LED TV (2018)\u2014$998 (Save $400): Sony still makes some of the best TVs you can buy, but they're typically priced above what we can regularly recommend. This 65-inch Sony is Amazon's Choice for a high performance TV and this $400 price cut is the cheapest it's been all year and one of the best big-screen deals we've found ahead of Black Friday. The 75-inch version has also seen a $500 price cut (to $1,798), if you want something even bigger.\n\n\n\nHere are some other TV and home theater deals worth checking out, though not nearly as good as the ones above. Most of these are also live now, but some (especially the Roku Ultra, our favorite streaming box) won't go live until Black Friday:\n\n\n\nOther deals that are live now:\n\nBlack Friday deals that are not yet live:\n\n\n\nOver the next week and on Black Friday proper there are a few other deals that may be worth checking out, but most of the Black Friday ads from stores like Wal-mart and Best Buy are out and we feel our top deals here are just better buys. As usual, most of the TVs with the biggest \"discounts\" are not the name-brand, high-quality sets that we would typically recommend. It's really easy to overpay for a TV on Black Friday\u2014even if you think you're scoring a deal\u2014so be sure to follow our coverage in case anything changes.\n\nWe'll update this post as soon as we find any more deals worth highlighting throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it's pretty clear: if you want a deal on a TV this year, we think you're better off just buying one of the above now.\n\nReviewed.com has you covered through the shopping madness, researching endlessly to find you the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.

The $904,000 came from the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, where he worked as executive director from October 2014 to September 2017.\n\nThe disclosure form covered his income of $502,000 in 2017 and $402,000 in 2016, according to the group's tax forms. He also earned $252,000 from the group in 2015, according to the tax form.\n\nWhitaker also earned $103,400 from his self-named law and consulting firm, according to the disclosure form. He listed $15,000 in consulting fees from CNN, $1,750 in consulting fees from American Trust Bank, where he served as an advisor; and $1,875 in legal fees from World Patent Marketing.\n\nTrump named Whitaker acting attorney general after firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Nov. 7 \u2013 a day after the midterm election.

Among the clients he represented from September 2016 to August 2017 was Mujo Becirovic, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute at least 50 kilograms of marijuana and conspiracy to distribute at least 500 grams of a mixture containing cocaine.

He was one of 20 defendants in the Des Moines-area case.\n\nBefore becoming chief of staff, Whitaker worked as director of the nonprofit Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, whose web site said it provides accountability, ethics and transparency \u201cby hanging a lantern over public officials who put their own interests over the interests of the public good.\u201d\n\nWhitaker was paid $502,000 in 2017 for work from Jan. 1 to Sept. 14, which is equivalent to an annual salary of $715,000, according to the group\u2019s tax form. The annual figure represented a 77 percent increase from the $402,000 he was paid in 2016, according to the group\u2019s tax form.\n\nThe group received a $1 million contribution in 2017 from a single donor whose identity is not publicly disclosed on its tax return, and who the organization declined to identify in response to questions from USA Today.\n\nThe organization\u2019s March 2014 application for tax-exempt status told the Internal Revenue Service the purpose was \u201cto conduct research and provide informational studies on free market concepts in relation to environmental regulations and policy.\u201d The original name, Free Market America Educational Foundation, changed in October 2014 to Working for Rights to Express & Communication before its current name.\n\nNotre Dame Law School Professor Lloyd Mayer, who specializes in nonprofit law, said the organization\u2019s changes to its name and purpose just months after applying for tax-exempt status in 2014 are \u201ca yellow flag, but not an obvious red flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for groups to change their name, change their leadership, change even their purposes over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is unusual is the speed at which it happened.\u201d\n\nAmerican Oversight had sent a letter to the Office of Government Ethics late last week asking why the agency had not yet made Whitaker's form public.\n\n\"The secrecy is particularly unusual and disturbing,\" said Melanie Sloan, a senior adviser for the group. \"It suggests that there might be a problem.\"\n\nEthics advocates such as Walter Shaub, former head of Office of Government Ethics, had long urged release of the financial disclosure report.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 days since we requested Whitaker\u2019s financial disclosure report.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 With the inaugural Nations League program ending Tuesday, the 2020 European Championship is up next for the continent's national teams.\n\nAll 24 places at Euro 2020 are up for grabs when qualifying starts in March, although the Nations League helped shape the draw that will be held on Dec. 2 in Dublin.\n\nGermany, for instance, won't be among the top-seeded teams because of its poor results since September.\n\nFor 16 teams, there already is a backup plan to reach Euro 2020. Those Nations League group winners are sure of a place in a playoff round held in March 2020 regardless of their finish in the traditional qualifying groups.\n\nAnother quirk of Euro 2020 is there are 12 host countries \u2014 from Ireland in the west to Azerbaijan in the east \u2014 and none gets an automatic entry.\n\nHere is the Euro 2020 outlook:\n\nEURO 2020 QUALIFYING DRAW\n\nAll 55 teams in the Dec. 2 draw are seeded according to Nations League results.\n\nThey will be drawn into five groups of five teams and five six-team groups, with games played from March to November next year.\n\nThe Nations League top-tier group winners \u2014 Switzerland, Portugal, Netherlands, England \u2014 must be in the smaller, five-team groups. They will play the Final Four tournament hosted by Portugal in June when others are playing Euro 2020 qualifiers.\n\nThe top two finishers in each group qualify automatically for Euro 2020.\n\nPot 1: Switzerland, Portugal, Netherlands, England, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Poland.\n\nPot 2: Germany, Iceland, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Wales, Czech Republic.\n\nPot 3: Slovakia, Turkey, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Finland, Bulgaria, Israel.\n\nPot 4: Hungary, Romania, Greece, Albania, Montenegro, Cyprus, Estonia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Georgia.\n\nPot 5: Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus, Luxembourg, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Gibraltar, Faeroe Islands.\n\nPot 6: Latvia, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Malta, San Marino.\n\nEURO 2020 PLAYOFFS\n\nThe last four places at the tournament will be decided through a 16-team playoff, the format of which is completely new.\n\nFour teams from each of four Nations League tiers will play in a mini-tournament featuring semifinals and a final next March 26-31. The four winners advance to complete the 24-team Euro 2020 lineup.\n\nIf one of the Nations League group winners have already secured a spot, the next-best team in that tier will make the playoffs.\n\nIt is a golden opportunity for fourth-tier League D teams which are unlikely to qualify automatically.\n\nSo, one of Georgia, Macedonia, Kosovo or Belarus will make its tournament debut at Euro 2020. For Kosovo, it's a first entry in qualifying after gaining membership of UEFA and FIFA only in 2016.\n\nOther potential playoff lineups:\n\nLeague C: Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Finland.\n\nLeague B: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden.\n\nLeague A: Switzerland, Portugal, Netherlands, England.\n\n12 HOST COUNTRIES\n\nEuro 2020 will be hosted in 12 cities in 12 different countries, kicking off in Rome on June 12.\n\nIt was supposed to be 13 cities \u2014 each hosting three group-stage games plus a knockout game from the round of 16 or a quarterfinal \u2014 but Brussels dropped out when a new stadium project failed.\n\nThe semifinals and final were awarded to Wembley Stadium in London, which also stepped in to get the four Brussels games.\n\nHost nation teams who qualify will have at least two home games in the group stage.\n\nThe host city pairings are:\n\nGroup A: Rome, Italy; Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\nGroup B: St. Petersburg, Russia; Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nGroup C: Amsterdam, Netherlands; Bucharest, Romania.\n\nGroup D: London, England; Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nGroup E: Bilbao, Spain; Dublin, Ireland.\n\nGroup F: Munich, Germany; Budapest, Hungary.\n\nRound of 16 games (June 27-30) will be in: London, Amsterdam, Bilbao, Budapest, Copenhagen, Bucharest, Glasgow, Dublin.\n\nQuarterfinals (July 3-4) will be in St. Petersburg, Munich, Baku, Rome.\n\nThe semifinals will be July 7-8 in London, and the final on July 12.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
