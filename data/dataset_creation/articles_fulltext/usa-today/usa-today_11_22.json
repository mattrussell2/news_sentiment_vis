(Photo: Mike Williams)\n\n\u201cThe Shepherd of the Hills,\u201d a well-read book with religious overtones, is set in Branson, Missouri, and helped put the lovely Ozark Mountains city on the map. So you might think Christmas would be a big deal in the popular vacation destination. But Branson was mostly a three-season getaway until 1988. That was the year theme park Silver Dollar City first extended its season with a Christmas festival.\n\n\u201cEverybody told me, \u2018It\u2019s winter, people won\u2019t come,\u2019 \u201d says Pete Herschend, co-founder of the park and its parent company, Herschend Family Entertainment. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes they will.\u2019 Either I carried the day, or they gave up arguing.\u201d\n\nVisitors did, indeed, make the offseason trek to the park. And they\u2019ve continued to come in ever-increasing numbers. Plenty of other seasonal theme parks in less-than-ideal climates now have holiday events, but Silver Dollar City was among the first to pioneer the concept.\n\nAccording to Tony Orlando, one of the many entertainers who call Branson home and regularly perform there, he helped get the city\u2019s famous celebrity theaters into the Christmas spirit. Known for \u201cTie a Yellow Ribbon,\u201d the pop song that became an anthem for returning military members, Orlando organized a Christmas show on Veterans Day in 1993 to benefit veterans\u2019 organizations.\n\n\u201cPete Herschend made a bet with me and said that he\u2019d bring in the Radio City Rockettes the following year if I could pull off the event,\u201d Orlando says. The show was a big success. \u201cPete came over to me afterwards and said, \u2018I just bought the Rockettes.\u2019 That really got Christmas in Branson going.\u201d\n\nToday, Silver Dollar City, which is themed to the late 19th century, welcomes about a quarter of its annual attendance during the holiday season. Virtually every Branson theater and attraction remains open throughout November and December. There is even a Christmas Coalition that is marketing the Ozarks spot as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Christmas Tree City\u201d and has encouraged area businesses and organizations to erect more than 1,000 decked-out trees.\n\nChristmas is, indeed, a huge deal in Branson.\n\nTravel back in time at Silver Dollar City\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of things for our guests to do, but there are two main reasons people visit us for An Old Time Christmas,\u201d says Brad Thomas, Silver Dollar City\u2019s president. \u201cLights and shows.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, Thomas estimates the park strung about 6,500 lights for its first Christmas event. Today, it boasts 6.5 million and has one of the most high-wattage, bulb-tastic displays anywhere. For the Christmas in Midtown Light Spectacular, now in its second year, the park has plastered nearly every square inch of the land with 1.5 million bulbs. It has even built faux second stories on many of Midtown\u2019s buildings to give it more surface area to bathe in light. With its flying angels, leaping reindeer and blinking bulbs, the area is a frenetic, kinetic kaleidoscope of color.\n\nAt the front of the park, a 50-foot Christmas tree, in tandem with the many lights that surround it, periodically springs to life with a show synchronized to carols. Twice each evening, the Holly Jolly Light Parade, which features characters and illuminated floats from the beloved stop-motion TV show \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\u201d proceeds around the park and past the tree. So yeah, there are gazillions of lights throughout Silver Dollar City.\n\nKnown for its high-caliber shows, the park presents a wide variety of holiday-themed presentations when it switches to Christmas mode. These include \u201cThe Living Nativity,\u201d \u201cChristmas on the Bayou\u201d and \u201cFrontier Fa-La-La Follies.\u201d Its two premier productions are the one-hour-long, Broadway-like musicals \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d and \u201cA Dickens\u2019 Christmas Carol.\u201d They include surprisingly sophisticated sets, solid performances, a dash of comedy and just enough tender moments to tug at audiences\u2019 hearts.\n\nIn its early years, none of the rides were operating for Silver Dollar City\u2019s Christmas events. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think people would want to go on them in the cold,\u201d Herschend says. While Branson\u2019s weather remains generally moderate in November and December, it can dip into the 30s. Responding to demand, however, the park slowly began cranking up its coasters and other rides. Defying conventional wisdom, it now offers nearly all of them to holiday revelers.\n\nThis year, visitors can hop on board Time Traveler, which debuted in the spring. The world's fastest, steepest and tallest full-circuit spinning roller coaster, the unique ride has generated a lot of buzz and garnered acclaim. Guests can also take wild and woolly rides on the wonderful wooden coaster Outlaw Run, which is particularly wild after the sun sets. While the rest of the park is aglow, the park shuts off most of the thrill machine\u2019s lights for disorienting descents, twists, turns and inversions in nearly total darkness.\n\nSilver Dollar City dishes out some of the best food in all of parkdom. For its Christmas event, some of the highlights include hickory-smoked prime rib and turkey with all of the fixings at its all-you-can-eat buffets. For dessert, guests can indulge in treats such as chocolate red velvet funnel cakes or hot apple dumplings with cinnamon ice cream that's churned in the park. Visitors can even learn how to make their own holiday treats, such as Christmas cookies and decadent hot chocolate, at the park\u2019s Culinary Craft School.\n\nGuests enjoy the food, rides and lights. But Thomas thinks Silver Dollar City\u2019s Christmas event, which is awash in the season\u2019s traditions and evokes the holiday\u2019s deeper meanings, has the power to reach visitors on a deeper level. Taking cues from George Bailey and Ebenezer Scrooge, \u201cThere are people who come out of our shows and think about how they should live their lives,\u201d he says. Self-reflection aside, one ride on Time Traveler is enough to cure anybody of the bah humbugs.\n\nThe Lennon Sisters bring Christmas harmony\n\nPeople come to the Ozarks city in search of the season\u2019s traditions, and its many theaters are only too happy to oblige, according to Lynn Berry, director of communications at Branson\u2019s Convention & Visitors Bureau. \u201cPeople are sentimental and nostalgic, and they find comfort here,\u201d she says. \u201cThe shows are totally dripping in Christmas.\u201d\n\nOne of Branson\u2019s most popular theaters, the Andy Williams Performing Arts Center oozes nostalgia. The crooner passed away in 2012, but Jimmy Osmond, who used to appear with Williams as part of the Osmond Brothers, now operates the theater and keeps his mentor\u2019s legacy alive. Osmond hosts and is one of the featured performers in \"The Andy Williams Ozark Mountain Christmas Show.\"\n\nThe slick production, which presents a number of musical acts, recalls an earlier era. It also stars the Lennon Sisters. People of a certain age, who would remember the singing sisters from Lawrence Welk\u2019s TV show (look it up, kids), may be surprised to find the gals looking as if they\u2019ve been preserved in amber and sounding as sweet as ever. Many holiday tunes, including a rousing rendition of Andy William\u2019s signature song, \u201cIt\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year,\u201d are on the playlist.\n\nVisitors can take a ride aboard the Showboat Branson Belle, run by the Silver Dollar City folks, for a Christmas dinner show. Although there aren\u2019t any headlining celebrities, the show does feature an engaging and talented troupe of singers and dancers who perform everything from classic rock to classic movie tunes to, of course, Christmas classics. The food served on the retro paddle wheeler, which includes choices such as pecan-encrusted trout, is tasty, particularly for a group meal.\n\nGhosts of Christmas toys past\n\nThere are plenty of other things to do in Branson. For instance, you could make like Rudolph and fly at the Aerodium, part of Fritz's Adventure. There are a number of wind-tunnel attractions, but the Aerodium is the first in the country to be located outdoors. Participants go airborne for a skydiving-like experience, but instead of free-falling down, a powerful fan propels them up. It\u2019s a giddy sensation to hover with nothing tethering you to the ground, and when the operator cranks up the fan speed, you can rise surprisingly high in the air.\n\nRegardless of the white Christmas conditions, you could go \u201csnow\u201d tubing on the Snowflex hill at Wolfe Mountain. Visitors pile into tubes and soar down a steep slope covered in a synthetic material that mimics snow. The park claims it\u2019s the largest attraction of its kind in the U.S.\n\nIf you want to explore the ghosts of Christmas toys past, you could make your way to the World\u2019s Largest Toy Museum and ogle Lincoln Logs, Cracker Jack prizes, antique dolls, a gaggle of toy guns and more than a million other playthings. Curiously, the museum also includes an exhibit about the late radio broadcaster Paul Harvey (again, look him up). It also includes a well-stocked gift shop to purchase new toys for the children on your Christmas list.\n\nWell-stocked doesn\u2019t begin to describe Dick\u2019s 5 & 10, one of the country\u2019s few remaining variety stores of its kind. Visitors could make a serious dent in their Christmas shopping and delight family and friends with quirky gifts from Dick\u2019s. The 10,000-square-foot emporium, which is crammed with things you may be surprised to find still exist, is impressive in the age of Walmart, especially considering the retail behemoth\u2019s headquarters are located nearby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a throwback,\u201d says Steve Hartley, whose father, Dick Hartley, founded the store in 1961. \u201cWe hit emotions and bring back memories.\u201d\n\nRemember Whoopee Cushions? Dick\u2019s has 'em. As well as Goo Goo Clusters, back scratchers and paper dolls. There aren\u2019t many things that actually cost a nickel or a dime any longer, but there is an aisle jammed with \u201cpenny\u201d candy (that will set you back 10 cents).\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/23/branson-christmas-silver-dollar-city-shows/2079027002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 1 Notre Dame women win Vancouver Showcase opener", "description": "Women's Top 25 Capsules", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2018/11/22/no-1-notre-dame-women-win-vancouver-showcase-opener/38588709/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8eda0a1a81f6b95c1edc79d9eed23bcf81c8a50/c=0-290-6000-3665/local/-/media/2018/11/22/USATODAY/usatsports/ea17943991e347c69f3a88ea4bb965a9.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T23:49:49Z", "content": "Notre Dame's Brianna Turner (11) scores as Gonzaga's Zykera Rice (00) defends during the first half of an NCAA women's college basketball game in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Thursday, Nov. 22, 2018.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions were the team with the healthy starting quarterback, but in the end, Matthew Stafford came up short.\n\nStafford had an interception returned for a tiebreaking touchdown in the fourth quarter, then had another pass picked off in the end zone with just over a minute remaining in Detroit's 23-16 loss to the Chicago Bears on Thursday. Chicago was without injured quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, but the Bears' stellar defense got the best of Stafford.\n\nWith the score tied at 16, Stafford's short pass to the left was intercepted by Eddie Jackson and returned 41 yards for a touchdown with 6:00 to play. The Lions (4-7) drove back down the field, but on third down from the Chicago 11, Stafford's pass was intercepted in the end zone by Kyle Fuller.\n\n\"Jackson made a really good play on the first one. I've still got to see him a little better than I did,\" Stafford said. \"Second one, I know we got four chances at it there. Put it in where I thought was going to be a good spot, and just wasn't.\"\n\nStafford went 28 of 38 for 236 yards, but Detroit didn't take many deep shots. The Lions were playing Chicago for the second time in 12 days. In the previous meeting \u2014 a 34-22 win by the Bears \u2014 Chicago had six sacks.\n\nStafford wanted to release the ball quickly Thursday, and he was sacked only twice in the rematch, but the Lions looked limited on offense. Detroit was without injured receiver Marvin Jones and injured running back Kerryon Johnson.\n\nThe Bears (8-3) didn't have Trubisky, but Chase Daniel stepped in for his third career start, going 27 of 37 for 230 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nStill, points were tough to come by, and the Lions were in decent shape in the fourth quarter, taking over at their 41 with 6:09 remaining in a tied game. Then Stafford's pass intended for Michael Roberts was picked off by Jackson and run back to the end zone.\n\n\"I saw him coming out of center field. Just thought we had outflanked him,\" Stafford said. \"Thought Mike was out wider than he was, which was the truth. Just didn't get it to him quick enough. He did a good job undercutting it and obviously made a great play.\"\n\nThere was still plenty of time, and before long, Detroit had first-and-10 from the Chicago 12. After a short run and an incompletion, Stafford threw to the right side for Roberts, but the receiver didn't go where Stafford's pass did \u2014 toward the back corner of the end zone.\n\n\"It was one human on one human to my right, so I felt pretty good about it,\" Stafford said. \"Mike's a big guy. Was going to try and give him a high ball to go up and jump and get.\"\n\nInstead, Fuller intercepted the pass . Stafford was asked if he expected an interference flag, since Roberts' route may have been impeded a bit.\n\n\"No. I think obviously it's a physical game,\" Stafford said. \"I was thinking Mike was going to be in a different spot, but that's cutting the ball loose and then hoping sometimes that you're on the same page. Obviously didn't work out in our favor.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Gonzaga defeated Duke 89-87. (AP Photo/Marco Garcia) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) \u2014 Rui Hachimura arrived at Gonzaga as an intriguing prospect who spoke very limited English. He spent his first season in Spokane acclimating to the new language and culture while watching the Zags reach the national title game.\n\nHachimura's role increased as a sophomore, though he was still primarily a backup player on a loaded roster.\n\nGiven a chance to lead the Zags this season, Hachimura has thrived.\n\nThe multidimensional 6-foot-8 forward established himself as one of the nation's best players early this year and took a star turn at the Maui Invitational, earning tournament MVP while leading Gonzaga past top-ranked Duke in the title game.\n\n\"He was wanting the ball and when we got him the ball for the most part he was delivering against some high, high level athletes and some damn good defenders around the rim,\" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. \"So that's a really, really good sign for us.\"\n\nHachimura's aggressiveness is a recent trend.\n\nWhen he arrived on campus, Hachimura was too deferential and passive on the court. Few and his assistants worked with the Japanese big man to be more assertive, and he certainly has been this season.\n\nHachimura leads No. 3 Gonzaga with 22.5 points per game while shooting 59 percent and grabbing 5.8 rebounds per game. He had 23 points in the Zags' Maui Invitational opener against Illinois and 24 in the semifinals against Arizona.\n\nHachimura was the difference-maker against Duke in the title game, calling for the ball and scoring on post-ups and mid-range jumpers. He had 20 points on 7-of-14 shooting, grabbed seven rebounds and blocked three shots, including two of Gonzaga's four in the final 46 seconds to preserve an 89-87 victory over the Blue Devils and Gonzaga's second Maui title.\n\n\"Hachimura gives them a guy that you can go to to get a bucket or get fouled,\" Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said.\n\nBorn to a Japanese mother and father from the West African nation of Benin, Hachimura grew up playing baseball around his hometown of Toyama, Japan. He later tried track before a friend persuaded him to play basketball.\n\nHachimura caught the attention of coaches at Mesei High School and developed his game at the private boarding school. He continued to improve while he grew and popped up on the radar of U.S. coaches when he scored 25 points against the United States at the 2014 FIBA U17 World Championships in Dubai.\n\nGonzaga assistant coach Tommy Lloyd, who has a knack for finding talented international players, showed video of Hachimura to Few, who saw the talent immediately and persuaded him to join the Zags.\n\nAfter a rough start in Spokane, largely because of the language barrier, Hachimura gradually adjusted to the culture and the more aggressive style of basketball in the United States.\n\nNow he could become the first Japanese-born NBA lottery pick.\n\nLong-armed and agile, Hachimura has strength and footwork to score down low, and he has a superb midrange jumper. He created problems for Duke with his midrange jumper and scored the go-ahead basket with 75 seconds left on a power move to the basket.\n\n\"He's made a big jump,\" Few said. \"He's being really aggressive. I've been on him to own it a little bit more and I think he's starting to own it.\"\n\nHachimura's rise in American college basketball has drawn plenty of attention in Japan.\n\nWhen Gonzaga held a media day for Hachimura in May, crews from Japan's largest networks followed him around for the day. Hachimura had nearly two dozen people follow and film him doing everything from eating to studying. He also gave more than two hours of interviews that were broadcast to millions back in Japan.\n\n\"I'm getting kind of used to the attention,\" he said at the time.\n\nHe better. It's only going to ratchet up from here.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nA lettuce worker washes romaine lettuce in Salinas, Calif,. Thursday, Aug. 26, 2007. (Photo: Paul Sakuma, AP)\n\nEditors' note: This story is an updated version of an article published on May 9, 2018.\n\nAmerica tries to eat its vegetables, so the current E. coli outbreak likely linked to romaine lettuce has put everyone from Caesar salad fans to those who barely tolerate a splash of greens in a taco on high alert.\n\nBut how did these seemingly innocent little leaves turn deadly?\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now investigating a multi-state E. coli outbreak, that's sickened 32 people, including 13 who were hospitalized, in 11 states..\n\nThe news comes months after an unrelated E. coli outbreak connected to romaine lettuce, which made 210 people ill in 36 states. Ninety-six had to be hospitalized and five died. That incident -- the U.S.'s largest multi-state E. coli outbreak in a dozen years -- was traced back to the Yuma, Arizona, growing region.\n\nMore: Black Friday has officially started\u2014these are the best deals\n\nMore: Museum Store Sunday: Support small local businesses off the beaten holiday path\n\nMore: Board of Japanese automaker Nissan fires Carlos Ghosn as chairman\n\nWe've sent men to the moon. Many of us carry tiny computers in our pockets. So why can't we keep romaine lettuce safe and clean? Here's some reasons why lettuce is so vulnerable and why tracking down the source of a bacterial outbreak can be difficult.\n\nAmerica hearts lettuce, especially women\n\nThanks to the national wellness trend embraced by healthy Millennials and aging Baby Boomers, the consumption of fresh vegetables, as opposed to frozen or shelf-stable varieties, is on the rise. Adding to that is the growing popularity of salad-centric restaurants, like Tender Greens and Sweetgreen, and the increasing inclusion of salads on the menus of fast-food chains.\n\nAccording to global market research firm Mintel's most recent data, 70% of vegetables sold in the U.S. in 2016 were fresh produce, up 13% from 2011, but growing at a 39% clip since then is fresh-cut salad, now 11% of what's in stores. Fresh veggies are forecast to grow 9% by 2021 and fresh-cut salads, 33%.\n\n\"Household vegetable purchase is universal and highly driven by fresh product purchases, with 97% of consumers purchasing fresh options in the past month,\" Mintel said.\n\nThe group most affected by the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak is women. According to the CDC, 65% of the people sickened as a result of this episode are female. Chalk that up to women being bigger salad eaters than men.\n\nBlame it on Mother Nature\n\nFields where produce is grown are subject to the whims of Mother Nature and her animals. Fruits and veggies grow in dirt and can be fertilized with manure. Bugs and birds fly around. Animals may run wild through even fenced fields \u2014 or defecate in rivers and lakes used to irrigate nearby farms. Growing out in the open means lots of opportunities for bacteria to enter the picture.\n\n\"Stuff is grown in nature outside. It can't be bacteria-free, virus-free, parasite-free,\" University of Florida food-safety expert Keith Schneider said. \"We do our best. The farmers jump through a lot of expensive hoops to make the food as clean as possible, but nature can intervene.\"\n\nLettuce is naturally unprotected\n\nUnlike some of its fruit and vegetable brethren, lettuce has nothing to keep it safe. The lack of rinds and peels \u2014 which you'd find on, say, a watermelon and a cucumber \u2014 gives bacteria countless entry points. A head of lettuce has tons of nooks and crannies for the nasty stuff to hide, making leafy greens far more vulnerable than other thinly-skinned, yet solid and easily washed produce, like tomatoes.\n\n\"The population is choosing to eat foods inherently more risky,\" said Matthew Stasiewicz, an assistant professor of applied food safety at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"Realistically, there\u2019s not an activity in life that carries zero risk.\"\n\nDistance can make the problem grow faster\n\nThe days of getting produce year-round only from nearby farms are long gone. As the national food supply becomes more sophisticated, we're able to grow food at a central location and then pack it, preserve it and ship it around the U.S.\n\nDespite the ease social media and 24-hour news cycles bring to spreading warnings about outbreaks, following the food from point A to point E remains complicated.\n\nConvenience can lead to illness\n\nThe extra phase of processing the romaine lettuce \u2014 whether chopping it or simply packaging it \u2014 provides more chances for bacteria to sneak in.\n\n\"If all lettuce from the field is clean, you bring it to the packing house, and equipment is contaminated,\" Schneider said. \"All things that go over the belt, we can contaminate.\"\n\nA raw deal\n\nFoods you eat raw, like lettuce, miss out on a cooking phase that can kill bacteria. What the industry has dubbed \"the kill step\" withholds a key opportunity to get rid of food poisoning-causing particles. For example, applesauce, which is subjected to heat as part of the preparation, is far less likely to pose a problem than a raw Red Delicious apple. That's why health officials preach the importance of thoroughly cooking meat and poultry and to avoid unpasteurized dairy products. For produce, washing is key.\n\nIt can take a while before illness gets reported\n\nPeople sickened by romaine lettuce may not have reported it yet. The average lag is two to three weeks.\n\n\"One of the major challenges of identifying sources of foodborne disease is people eat a lot of food,\" Stasiewicz said. \"There\u2019s also a major problem remembering what they eat. When eating a complex food, like a sandwich or burrito, you might not even know what you're eating.\"\n\nThe evidence is often tossed\n\nFresh produce has a short shelf life, especially quickly-spoiling bagged salads, so by the time the inspector made it to your house, the culprit would be long since, ahem, tossed.\n\nWhile you know what your favorite breakfast cereal is, chances are you don't recall the name of the company that makes your bagged lettuce. Forget about remembering the brand of lettuce heads or hearts you buy. That complicates tracking.\n\n\"Without a bag, a lot number to a farm, you don't know where it was packed and what farm it came from,\" Schneider said.\n\nAnd even if you miraculously still had the tainted lettuce, complete with the packer's or farm's name printed on it, the crop in the field by the time inspectors arrived would already be harvested.\n\nSolving the problem isn\u2019t simply a matter of \u201clettuce CSI,\" according to Schneider. \"When you want to find the pathogen smoking gun, it\u2019s gone.\"\n\nCLOSE Trust us when we say you should read this.

Police said Chau apparently was shot with arrows and buried on the beach.\n\nThey are consulting with experts before deciding how to go about recovering his body.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult proposition,\u201d said Dependra Pathak, police chief for India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar islands, where North Sentinel is located. \u201cWe have to see what is possible, taking utmost care of the sensitivity of the group and the legal requirements.\u201d\n\nAlthough Indian government regulations forbid interaction with the Sentinelese, Chau was determined to visit the island and paid fishermen $325 to take him close to it, officials said. He then paddled to shore on a kayak, bringing a Bible and gifts that included fish, a soccer ball and fishing line.\n\nPathak called the trip a \u201cmisplaced adventure,\u2019\u2019 adding, \u201cHe certainly knew it was off limits.\u2019\u2019\n\nP.C.

He then swam back to the fishermen\u2019s boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, Chau wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day. It\u2019s not clear what ensued, but on the morning of the third day, the fishermen saw tribesmen drag Chau\u2019s body along the beach and bury his remains.\n\nPathak said the fishermen then returned to Port Blair, capital of the island chain, and shared the news with a friend of Chau\u2019s, who informed the family. Pathak said seven people have been arrested for helping Chau arrange his illegal trip, including five fishermen, the friend and a local tourist guide.\n\n\u201c\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure.

In 2006, two Indian fishermen were killed by islanders after their boat broke loose and drifted ashore. Indian media reports say authorities did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Christianity with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith.\n\nChau, who hailed from Washington State and attended Oral Roberts University, went through that program in 2015.

Wilderness EMT. PADI Advanced Open Water Diver. Outbound Collective Explorer. Perky Jerky Ambassador. Snakebite Survivor.\n\nOn the page there\u2019s also a letter from the Chau family that says in part: \u201cHe was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us. To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer. He loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people. We forgive those reportedly responsible for his death.\u2019\u2019\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/22/american-adventurer-john-chau-killed-hostile-tribe-remote-island/2087955002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Cydney Henderson, USA TODAY", "title": "'Jersey Shore' star Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi expecting her third child: 'I\u2019m thankful'", "description": "\"Jersey Shore\" star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi announced on Instagram that she is expecting her third child with husband Jionni LaValle.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/22/jersey-shore-nicole-snooki-polizzi-pregnant-third-child/2088162002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/22/USAT/82b56377-3ef9-48a4-afef-366dcbd198ab-LL_GDBD_SNOOKI_120114.JPG?crop=2999,1670,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T21:37:02Z", "content": "New Jersey now has an official law inspired by Snooki.

USA TODAY\n\nIn this photo taken Tuesday, June 7, 2016, cars drive by a Havana Club billboard on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami. (Photo: Alan Diaz, AP)\n\nWhen health officials wanted to reduce deaths from tobacco, they spread messages about the proven cancer risks, pushed to ban smoking in public places and worked to raise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nAlcohol, which causes 88,000 deaths a year in the USA, is a similarly grave public health concern. Studies show deaths linked to alcohol are up 35 to 50 percent since 2000. But the way forward is less clear.\n\nWhat worked with smoking may not work with drinking, which enjoys broad social acceptance. Nearly all the potential solutions hit considerable roadblocks.\n\nThe Trump administration's tax cut last year included an 18 percent break in the federal tax on beer, wine and liquor.\n\nStates with more stringent alcohol control policies had lower rates of binge drinking, according to an analysis of state laws and taxes in 2014.\n\nBinge drinking accounts for about half of all deaths attributable to alcohol, two-thirds of years of life lost and three-quarters of economic costs.\n\nLegislative approaches to alcohol face many of the same challenges that tobacco bills do: Legislatures support their home state alcohol industries the way they resist policy threats to tobacco interests.\n\nLess than 60 percent of U.S. adults drink alcohol. If influencing legislators is the goal, David Jernigan says, that population includes the right people.\n\nMore: Alcohol kills more people, and younger. The biggest increases are among women\n\nMore: My 'bottom' was being drunk on TV. I'm grateful I hit it before I killed myself or others\n\nJernigan, a professor at Boston University's school of public health who has specialized in alcohol research for 30 years, says he doesn't drink because \"I like to keep my wits about me.\"\n\nNonetheless, he says, \"it's just so socially acceptable, especially among the people who write the laws. It's the drug of choice and incredibly normalized for upper-income people in the USA.\"\n\nAmong approaches that have shown results:\n\nRaising taxes: Alcohol is subjected to excise taxes, which are based on the volume sold, and sales taxes, which are based on the retail price. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a 10 percent increase in taxes leads to a 5 to 8 percent decline in drinking.\n\nFor states, that's good news and bad news. Though reductions in drinking might save states money on Medicaid for low-income and disabled residents, fewer sales reduce state revenue.\n\nDavid Jernigan is a professor at Boston University's school of public health who has studied alcohol for about 30 years. (Photo: Courtesy of David Jernigan)\n\nRichard Berman is CEO of the public affairs firm Berman & Co., which has represented the alcohol, tobacco and restaurant industries.\n\nHe says higher taxes can prompt people to trade down to less expensive brands, or if they live near a state line to go to a neighboring state with lower taxes.\n\nJernigan disagrees.\n\n\"Alcohol taxes are a win, win, win,\" he says. \"States get more money, and people drink somewhat less.\"\n\nRestricting sales. State and local governments often cap the number of liquor stores allowed in an area and the days and hours they can sell.\n\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, recommends that states resist privatizing alcohol sales, which is linked to a median 44 percent increase in sales, which leads to more drinking.\n\nStates that don't cap or control liquor sales have 50 percent more liquor stores per capita than those that do, Marathon Strategies reported in 2014.\n\nIn states that had caps based on population, there was one store for every 10,204 people. In states that didn't have caps, there was one store for every 5,737 residents.\n\nImproving access to treatment. Only about one in 10 people who need treatment for substance abuse receive the care they need, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration report in 2017.\n\nPsychologist Ben Miller, chief strategy officer at the nonprofit Well Being Trust, says people with addictions need to be identified earlier and linked to treatment \"at that first stop,\" including emergency rooms and jails.\n\nIntegrating mental health workers in primary care doctors' offices, he says, could \"help countless lives, save millions of dollars and begin to change the culture of care to be more comprehensive.\"\n\nPsychologist Benjamin Miller is the chief strategy officer at the nonprofit advocacy group the Well Being Trust. (Photo: The Well Being Trust)\n\nBolstering coping skills. About 15 percent of deaths attributed to alcohol are suicides. Addressing addiction would help address feelings of hopelessness.\n\nThe Well Being Trust called for a \"National Resilience Strategy.\"\n\nThe nonprofit group says investing in early childhood policies and programs would have the greatest impact.\n\nIn its Pain in the Nation report this year, the Well Being Trust called for better early identification of trauma and mental health problems in school-age children to help them deal with stress and trauma before they turn to alcohol and drugs as crutches.\n\n\"The most important substance we should be looking at is alcohol, because it leads to so many things, including physical abuse and rape, that shouldn't happen,\" Jernigan says. \"We need to stop accepting that there isn't anything we can do about it.\"\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are struggling with health problems mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY\u2019s \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/19/alcohol-taxes-restrictions-public-health-policy-problem-drinking-blue-laws/1729501002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Chris Korman", "title": "The Bears defense pulled off an astoundingly great celebration", "description": "Some are calling it the greatest NFL celebration ever.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/the-bears-defense-pulled-off-an-astoundingly-great-celebration", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/bears-defense.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T21:09:36Z", "content": "By: Chris Korman | November 22, 2018 4:09 pm Follow @ChrisKorman Look, we\u2019re not overselling this.

(Photo: Sarah Prince, AP)\n\nAmerican adventurer and Christian missionary John Allen Chau followed his convictions to one of the most dangerous places on earth.\n\nThe remote island\u2019s natives are so hostile and isolated, authorities now hesitate to go in and retrieve his body.\n\nPolice in India said Chau, believed to be 26 or 27, was killed last week on an unauthorized visit to North Sentinel, where people live as their ancestors did thousands of years ago and where outsiders are seen with suspicion and attacked. Police said Chau apparently was shot with arrows and buried on the beach.\n\nThey are consulting with experts before deciding how to go about recovering his body.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult proposition,\u201d said Dependra Pathak, police chief for India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar islands, where North Sentinel is located. \u201cWe have to see what is possible, taking utmost care of the sensitivity of the group and the legal requirements.\u201d\n\nAlthough Indian government regulations forbid interaction with the Sentinelese, Chau was determined to visit the island and paid fishermen $325 to take him close to it, officials said. He then paddled to shore on a kayak, bringing a Bible and gifts that included fish, a soccer ball and fishing line.\n\nPathak called the trip a \u201cmisplaced adventure,\u2019\u2019 adding, \u201cHe certainly knew it was off limits.\u2019\u2019\n\nP.C. Joshi, an anthropology professor at Delhi University who has studied the islands \u2013 located hundreds of miles off the Indian coast \u2013 pointed out the local people have little resistance to many diseases from outside and \u201ca simple thing like flu can kill them.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe fishermen said that on his first day, last Thursday, Chau interacted with some tribesmen \u2013 who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants \u2013 until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. He then swam back to the fishermen\u2019s boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, Chau wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day. It\u2019s not clear what ensued, but on the morning of the third day, the fishermen saw tribesmen drag Chau\u2019s body along the beach and bury his remains.\n\nPathak said the fishermen then returned to Port Blair, capital of the island chain, and shared the news with a friend of Chau\u2019s, who informed the family. Pathak said seven people have been arrested for helping Chau arrange his illegal trip, including five fishermen, the friend and a local tourist guide.\n\n\u201c\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them.\u201d\u201d Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey\n\nThis is not the first time tragedy has befallen those who have landed on North Sentinel. In 2006, two Indian fishermen were killed by islanders after their boat broke loose and drifted ashore. Indian media reports say authorities did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Christianity with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith.\n\nChau, who hailed from Washington State and attended Oral Roberts University, went through that program in 2015. Authorities said he had visited the Andaman Islands that year and in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure,\u2019\u2019 Staver said. \u201cI have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them.\u201d\n\nStaver said Chau\u2019s last notes to his family on Friday told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nAn Instagram page under the name johnachau features several photos of outdoor sites and provides a list that reads: Following the Way. Wilderness EMT. PADI Advanced Open Water Diver. Outbound Collective Explorer. Perky Jerky Ambassador. Snakebite Survivor.\n\nOn the page there\u2019s also a letter from the Chau family that says in part: \u201cHe was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us. To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer. He loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people. We forgive those reportedly responsible for his death.\u2019\u2019\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/22/american-adventurer-john-chau-killed-hostile-tribe-remote-island/2087955002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Zlati Meyer, USA TODAY", "title": "Romaine lettuce: Why it's hard to keep it safe from E. coli and other bacteria", "description": "Lettuce is more vulnerable than many other foods to bacteria outbreaks.

Ninety-six had to be hospitalized and five died. That incident -- the U.S.'s largest multi-state E. coli outbreak in a dozen years -- was traced back to the Yuma, Arizona, growing region.\n\nMore: Black Friday has officially started\u2014these are the best deals\n\nMore: Museum Store Sunday: Support small local businesses off the beaten holiday path\n\nMore: Board of Japanese automaker Nissan fires Carlos Ghosn as chairman\n\nWe've sent men to the moon. Many of us carry tiny computers in our pockets. So why can't we keep romaine lettuce safe and clean? Here's some reasons why lettuce is so vulnerable and why tracking down the source of a bacterial outbreak can be difficult.\n\nAmerica hearts lettuce, especially women\n\nThanks to the national wellness trend embraced by healthy Millennials and aging Baby Boomers, the consumption of fresh vegetables, as opposed to frozen or shelf-stable varieties, is on the rise. Adding to that is the growing popularity of salad-centric restaurants, like Tender Greens and Sweetgreen, and the increasing inclusion of salads on the menus of fast-food chains.\n\nAccording to global market research firm Mintel's most recent data, 70% of vegetables sold in the U.S. in 2016 were fresh produce, up 13% from 2011, but growing at a 39% clip since then is fresh-cut salad, now 11% of what's in stores. Fresh veggies are forecast to grow 9% by 2021 and fresh-cut salads, 33%.\n\n\"Household vegetable purchase is universal and highly driven by fresh product purchases, with 97% of consumers purchasing fresh options in the past month,\" Mintel said.\n\nThe group most affected by the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak is women. According to the CDC, 65% of the people sickened as a result of this episode are female. Chalk that up to women being bigger salad eaters than men.\n\nBlame it on Mother Nature\n\nFields where produce is grown are subject to the whims of Mother Nature and her animals. Fruits and veggies grow in dirt and can be fertilized with manure. Bugs and birds fly around. Animals may run wild through even fenced fields \u2014 or defecate in rivers and lakes used to irrigate nearby farms. Growing out in the open means lots of opportunities for bacteria to enter the picture.\n\n\"Stuff is grown in nature outside. It can't be bacteria-free, virus-free, parasite-free,\" University of Florida food-safety expert Keith Schneider said. \"We do our best. The farmers jump through a lot of expensive hoops to make the food as clean as possible, but nature can intervene.\"\n\nLettuce is naturally unprotected\n\nUnlike some of its fruit and vegetable brethren, lettuce has nothing to keep it safe. The lack of rinds and peels \u2014 which you'd find on, say, a watermelon and a cucumber \u2014 gives bacteria countless entry points. A head of lettuce has tons of nooks and crannies for the nasty stuff to hide, making leafy greens far more vulnerable than other thinly-skinned, yet solid and easily washed produce, like tomatoes.\n\n\"The population is choosing to eat foods inherently more risky,\" said Matthew Stasiewicz, an assistant professor of applied food safety at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"Realistically, there\u2019s not an activity in life that carries zero risk.\"\n\nDistance can make the problem grow faster\n\nThe days of getting produce year-round only from nearby farms are long gone. As the national food supply becomes more sophisticated, we're able to grow food at a central location and then pack it, preserve it and ship it around the U.S.\n\nDespite the ease social media and 24-hour news cycles bring to spreading warnings about outbreaks, following the food from point A to point E remains complicated.\n\nConvenience can lead to illness\n\nThe extra phase of processing the romaine lettuce \u2014 whether chopping it or simply packaging it \u2014 provides more chances for bacteria to sneak in.\n\n\"If all lettuce from the field is clean, you bring it to the packing house, and equipment is contaminated,\" Schneider said. \"All things that go over the belt, we can contaminate.\"\n\nA raw deal\n\nFoods you eat raw, like lettuce, miss out on a cooking phase that can kill bacteria. What the industry has dubbed \"the kill step\" withholds a key opportunity to get rid of food poisoning-causing particles. For example, applesauce, which is subjected to heat as part of the preparation, is far less likely to pose a problem than a raw Red Delicious apple. That's why health officials preach the importance of thoroughly cooking meat and poultry and to avoid unpasteurized dairy products. For produce, washing is key.\n\nIt can take a while before illness gets reported\n\nPeople sickened by romaine lettuce may not have reported it yet. The average lag is two to three weeks.\n\n\"One of the major challenges of identifying sources of foodborne disease is people eat a lot of food,\" Stasiewicz said. \"There\u2019s also a major problem remembering what they eat. When eating a complex food, like a sandwich or burrito, you might not even know what you're eating.\"\n\nThe evidence is often tossed\n\nFresh produce has a short shelf life, especially quickly-spoiling bagged salads, so by the time the inspector made it to your house, the culprit would be long since, ahem, tossed.\n\nWhile you know what your favorite breakfast cereal is, chances are you don't recall the name of the company that makes your bagged lettuce. Forget about remembering the brand of lettuce heads or hearts you buy. That complicates tracking.\n\n\"Without a bag, a lot number to a farm, you don't know where it was packed and what farm it came from,\" Schneider said.\n\nAnd even if you miraculously still had the tainted lettuce, complete with the packer's or farm's name printed on it, the crop in the field by the time inspectors arrived would already be harvested.\n\nSolving the problem isn\u2019t simply a matter of \u201clettuce CSI,\" according to Schneider. \"When you want to find the pathogen smoking gun, it\u2019s gone.\"\n\nCLOSE Trust us when we say you should read this.

(AP Photo/Darko Bandic) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGLASGOW, Scotland (AP) \u2014 World soccer's rule-making panel wants to give goalkeepers more freedom to move when facing a penalty.\n\nCurrently, the Laws of the Game state goalkeepers \"must remain on the goal line ... until the ball has been kicked.\"\n\nThe panel, known as IFAB, proposed Thursday that goalkeepers should need \"only one foot on the goal line when a penalty is taken.\"\n\nThis would allow 'keepers to begin moving forward earlier without risking referees ordering the kick to be retaken if they make a save.\n\nPenalty kicks were the main focus of the International Football Association Board's business meeting to prepare for a March 1 session when law changes can be approved. New laws will take effect June 1 \u2014 the date of the Champions League final.\n\nOther proposals included aiming to write a more precise wording for accidental handball offenses.\n\n\"The most significant clarifications relate to 'non-deliberate' handball situations, where there is an unfair 'outcome/benefit' due to the ball making contact with a player's hand/arm,\" IFAB said.\n\nAt the World Cup in June, Portugal almost lost its place in the round of 16 when Iran was awarded a stoppage-time penalty for a handball harshly judged against defender Cedric Soares. Iran scored the spot kick, then missed a clear chance to win the game.\n\nIFAB also ended trials with the so-called ABBA order of teams taking penalties in a shootout. To relieve the pressure of one team potentially always taking spot kicks while trailing, the order could be reversed in each successive round.\n\n\"The board noted the absence of strong support, mainly because the procedure is complex, and agreed that it will no longer be a future option for competitions,\" the panel said.\n\nIn other proposals, IFAB wants to cut timewasting by forcing substituted players to leave the field at the nearest touchline, make team officials in the dugouts eligible to receive yellow and red cards, and allow goal kicks to be touched again without leaving the penalty area.\n\nIFAB said it is also looking at ways to curb attacking players disrupting defensive walls, and ordering a dropped ball if an attacking team gains too much advantage from the ball hitting a referee.\n\nThe panel includes delegates from soccer's ruling body FIFA, which has four votes, plus the four British soccer federations. Proposals need six of eight votes to pass.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHere are some things to watch this week in the Pac-12 Conference:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK: No. 16 Washington at No. 7 Washington State. The Apple Cup is always the biggest game on the schedule for both teams. The 111th version has huge Pac-12 implications and possibly beyond. The Cougars (10-1) are 7-1 in the conference and the Huskies are 6-2, with no one else really close. That makes Friday's game essentially the play-in game to represent the Pac-12 North in the conference title game. On top of that, Washington State still has slim hopes of making the College Football Playoff, which would disappear with a loss to Washington. It's the third straight year both teams are ranked heading into the Apple Cup and the Huskies have won the past five meetings. This should be good.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Arizona State at Arizona. The first meeting for the Territorial Cup for Arizona under coach Kevin Sumlin and Arizona State under Herm Edwards. The Sun Devils (6-5) have clinched bowl eligibility, but the Wildcats (5-6) still need a win to get into the postseason, so there's added incentive on both sides of this rivalry. Arizona leads the all-time series 49-41-1, but the Sun Devils won the 90th Duel in the Desert last season 42-30 in Tempe. Arizona State RB Eno Benjamin needs 121 yards rushing to set the school single-season mark.\n\nNUMBERS GAME: Washington has won 14 straight games, tying Clemson for second longest in the FBC behind top-ranked Alabama's 24 straight wins. ... Oregon QB Justin Herbert has thrown a TD pass in 26 straight games, the longest active streak in FBS. ... Cal is bowl eligible for the first time since 2015. ... Stanford is bowl eligible for the 10th straight season.\n\nUPSET WATCH: BYU at Utah. A rivalry game, so the Utes will likely be up for this game, but they're coming off the high of clinching the Pac-12 South title and have the Pac-12 Championship game coming up. The Cougars are just 6-5 but have wins over Arizona and then-No. 6 Wisconsin with a close loss to California on their resume.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER: UCLA RB Joshua Kelly. The Bruins running back ran for 289 yards and two TDs on 40 carries in the Bruins' 34-27 victory last week. The yards were most in the history of the rivalry and third most in UCLA history.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gary McCullough, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) \u2014 When they take the field Sunday, Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr . will have waited 1,072 days for his rematch with Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown .\n\n\"It's the best versus the best,\" Harris proclaimed.\n\nBrown got the best of Harris last time.\n\nThe star cornerback hadn't surrendered a touchdown in 35 games before Brown scored twice on him in man coverage in the Steelers' 34-27 comeback in Pittsburgh on Dec. 20, 2015.\n\n\"I hope we see them again,\" Harris said afterward, and the feeling was certainly mutual \u2014 Brown caught 16 passes for 189 yards that night.\n\nIt appeared Harris would get his wish a month later when the Steelers visited Denver for an AFC divisional playoff game.\n\nBrown didn't get to play, however, after taking a vicious hit to the head from Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict the week before, a foul that set up Pittsburgh's game-winning field goal in a wild-card game at Cincinnati.\n\nHarris was dealing with a bruised left rotator cuff that basically turned him into a one-armed tackler, but he helped the Broncos beat the Brown-less Steelers 23-16, propelling them on their Super Bowl title run.\n\nAlthough Denver (4-6) hasn't been back to the playoffs since, Harris remains one of the game's great shutdown cornerbacks. His interception of Philip Rivers last week made him the only player in the NFL with multiple interceptions each of the past seven seasons.\n\nBrown is just as good as ever, too, helping the Steelers (7-2-1) stay atop the AFC North year after year. His 11 TD catches this season are tied with Kansas City's Tyreek Hill for the league lead.\n\nOf his 130 games, including the playoffs, Harris has never had a worse game than he did the previous time he faced Brown.\n\n\"I didn't have a good game that night,\" Harris said. \"It was tough that game. It was pretty much on me that game. We didn't have anybody in our secondary that game. I think all my safeties were gone. I think I was out there with (Josh) Bush and (Shiloh) Keo, so that was a hard game. It won't be anything like that again.\"\n\nHarris faces No. 1 receivers week in and week out, but Brown is special. He's one of just four active players with 40 100-yard receiving games (Julio Jones, Brandon Marshall and Larry Fitzgerald are the others).\n\n\"He has great route-running and they let him play,\" Harris said, suggesting officials let him get away with separation tactics. \"They let him play a little bit at the top of the routes. Also what he does, Big Ben (Roethlisberger) extends a lot of time for him and then he can kind of free-lance and get deep.\n\n\"I can't say what I do at the top of the routes, but I've got little tricks too. You've just got to play your game. Don't be scared, compete, and that's what I do every week.\"\n\nHarris often voices frustration about not getting a lot of action on his side of the field, but he eagerly anticipated last week's game against the Chargers because he knew Rivers would challenge him.\n\nHarris also knows that Roethlisberger won't ignore him Sunday .\n\n\"Definitely. I know I've got like 12 to 15 chances to get picks,\" Harris said, \"and my goal is to come out with one or two.\"\n\nThere are signs Harris won't have another patchwork secondary surrounding him like the previous time. Cornerback Bradley Roby, who left the previous game with a concussion, is progressing and the Broncos are hopeful he'll be back in the starting lineup this weekend.\n\nHarris said he felt Roby was having his best game of the year when he got hurt, and coach Vance Joseph concurred, saying, \"He played with great focus, he wasn't chasing plays, he was playing with great technique and he covered his guy. I think most young corners they're playing the game to make plays instead of allowing the plays to come to them. When he's done that, he's played well for us.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chris Pietsch) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJonathan Smith played in four Civil War games between Oregon and Oregon State, but one moment stands out from 2000 when the No. 5 Ducks played the No. 8 Beavers.\n\nSmith was quarterback for the Beavers while Joey Harrington was behind center for the Ducks. The game had big postseason implications for both teams.\n\nSmith set the scene: \"Sun was out. It was cold. Keith Jackson \u2014 the whole thing.\"\n\nHe threw a pair of touchdown passes to Robert Prescott and Jake Cookus (currently an assistant for the Beavers) pulled down three of Oregon State's five interceptions. The Beavers went on to win 23-13, reaching 10 wins for the first time in school history, then played in the Fiesta Bowl against Notre Dame. The Ducks finished 9-2 and played in the Holiday Bowl.\n\n\"When you go 10-1 at a school that has never been 10-1, and was at rock bottom a few years ago, it doesn't get any better than that,\" Beavers coach Dennis Erickson said afterward.\n\nSmith said this week: \"Probably one of my favorite memories of playing was taking a knee to win that game.\"\n\nThe other Civil War that sticks out for Smith is the 1998 double-overtime Oregon State victory. He finished his career 2-2 in the rivalry game.\n\nThe stakes are nowhere near as high in the 122nd Civil War. The Beavers (2-9, 1-7 Pac-12) are essentially playing for bragging rights in Smith's first season as head coach in Corvallis.\n\nThe Ducks (7-4, 4-4) are looking to improve their bowl prospects. First-year Ducks coach Mario Cristobal said emphasizing the postseason implications is just part of the team's preparation.\n\n\"I think you always assess yourself, the opponent, you talk about both. We're rebuilding a program, too,\" he said. \"To me that's the biggest focus of anything else. We've got to understand where we are, where we're going and the progress that we've made, and we want to continue it, so I'd say the bulk of the focus is on that.\"\n\nOregon leads the all-time series 64-47-10.\n\nHere are some other things to know when Oregon and Oregon State meet:\n\nHERBERT'S LAST? Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert may or may not be playing in his final Civil War. Herbert is widely considered one of the top prospects at his position should he decide to skip his final year of eligibility and declare for the NFL draft. If he stays in Eugene, he'll get a chance to play with brother Patrick, a four-star tight end who has committed to the Ducks.\n\nHerbert has passed for 2,883 yards with 27 touchdowns this season. His streak of 26 games with a TD pass is the longest current streak in the nation.\n\nLUTON'S LAST? The Civil War could cap quarterback Jake Luton's tenure at Oregon State, which has been marked by injuries. Last season he suffered a thoracic spine fracture against Washington State. This year he had a concussion and a high ankle sprain that kept him out of four games.\n\nSmith said there's a possibility that Luton could petition for a medical hardship waiver for a sixth year of eligibility. Luton told The Oregonian this week that he'd be open to returning for another season.\n\nMITCHELL HISTORY: Oregon wide receiver Dillon Mitchell has 68 catches for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns this season. He ranks atop the Pac-12 for receiving yards and is ninth in the nation with an average of 100.2 per game. He needs just 36 yards to break Josh Huff's single-season school record for receiving yards.\n\nFRESHMAN SENSATION: Oregon State true freshman running back Jermar Jefferson has rushed for 1,316 yards and 12 touchdowns this season. His total yards lead the nation among freshmen and his average of 119.6 yards puts him at seventh among all rushers nationally.\n\n\"Obviously the back has garnered a lot of attention, and rightfully so, as a freshman he's widely considered one of the best freshmen in the country. The offensive line has done a tremendous job for him,\" Cristobal said in assessing the Beavers' offense.\n\nTHE LAST TIME: Oregon State capped a turbulent year with a 69-10 loss to the Ducks at Autzen Stadium. Beavers coach Gary Andersen had abruptly left the team in the middle of a one-win season. Royce Freeman ran for 122 yards and two touchdowns and Herbert passed for 251 yards and three scores. It was the final game of a one-year stint as head coach for Willie Taggart, who left for Florida State in early December.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Here's what it's like.\n\nMore: Watch: NASA releases the first 8K video from space\n\nThe meal is prepared not by spending hours in the oven or on the stove like on Earth, however. The process begins in Houston, where scientists prepare the meal and then dehydrate, radiate or thermostabilize (similar to canning) it to prevent it from spoiling, according to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.\n\nScientists put it in individual vacuum-sealed bags, which are carried into orbit and kept safe in a locker until Thanksgiving. The food is prepared on the ISS by adding hot water or putting it in a small warming oven.\n\nAre you thawing out your turkey? The space station crew is preparing for Thanksgiving, too!

The Saturday launch brought food, hygiene products and science experiments on board.\n\nIt was the second delivery in a short period of time. Wallops officials delayed the launch from Nov. 15 to Nov. 17, meaning the Cygnus spacecraft carrying materials arrived shortly after a Russian spacecraft also carrying supplies that launched the day before.\n\nFollow Hayley Harding on Twitter: @Hayley__Harding\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/22/thanksgiving-iss-international-space-station/2087567002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY", "title": "Land Rover reveals redesigned 2020 Range Rover Evoque luxury SUV", "description": "Land Rover revealed a redesigned version of the Range Rover Evoque SUV.

The fashion house also labeled chopsticks \"stick shaped cutlery,\" while the narrator mispronounced Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nTo add insult to injury, a screenshot of private Instagram messages allegedly sent from co-founder Stefano Gabbana went viral.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Before joining the Justice Department, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker earned more than $1.2 million from a right-leaning nonprofit that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors, according to the nonprofit\u2019s tax filings. Whitaker\u2019s earnings represented a sizable chunk of the charity\u2019s revenue.\n\nFinancial disclosure forms released Tuesday show Whitaker received $904,000 in income from the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust from 2016 through nearly the end of 2017. He also received $15,000 from CNN as a legal commentator, according to the documents released by the Justice Department.\n\nThe nonprofit group, known as FACT, styles itself as a nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group is supposed to serve the public interest without supporting or opposing specific candidates for office. However, its challenges and its website have focused largely, though not exclusively, on Democrats and their party.\n\nWhitaker used his role as president and executive director of FACT in 2016 as a platform to question the ethics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nFrom 2014 through 2016, FACT paid out nearly 30 percent of its total revenue to Whitaker. In 2015 alone, Whitaker\u2019s $252,000 salary made up half of what the group brought in. Whitaker\u2019s salary also grew each year from $63,000 in 2014 to as much as $502,000 in 2017, according to the tax filings and public financial disclosures released by the Justice Department.\n\nSeparately, Whitaker is also facing criticism about whether he violated federal law because a campaign committee set up for his failed 2014 U.S. Senate bid accepted $8,800 in donations this year, while Whitaker was serving as a top Justice Department lawyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., called for an investigation into whether Whitaker violated the Hatch Act, a statute that generally prohibits executive branch employees from accepting or soliciting campaign donations.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s campaign committee, which still carries about $49,000 in debt, hadn\u2019t received any contributions between 2015 through 2017, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nThe campaign committee, Whitaker for U.S. Senate Inc., also reported paying $500 to Whitaker\u2019s old law firm, Whitaker, Hagenow & Gustoff, for space rental on Feb. 2. The campaign paid a $228 reimbursement to Christopher Hagenow \u2013 an Iowa legislator and founding partner of the law firm \u2013 for data services that same day.\n\nAmerican Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, also filed a complaint alleging that the campaign donations would be a Hatch Act violation. The group said in a statement Wednesday that the Office of Special Counsel \u2013 an independent federal agency that investigates such complaints \u2013 had opened a case file on the matter. A spokesman for the agency, which has no connection to the Justice Department or special counsel Robert Mueller, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday.\n\nSeveral news outlets, including The Associated Press, and outside groups had requested Whitaker\u2019s financial disclosure forms from the Justice Department after President Donald Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and elevated Whitaker to the agency\u2019s top post on Nov. 7.\n\nThose documents show Whitaker began revising his public disclosures the day he was appointed acting attorney general. He revised the forms four more times, including on Tuesday.\n\nIn a disclosure form Whitaker completed when he joined the Justice Department in September 2017, he reported receiving $1,875 in legal fees from a company called World Patent Marketing. Whitaker has come under scrutiny for his involvement with the company, which was accused of misleading consumers and is under investigation by the FBI.\n\nWhitaker also disclosed his partial interest in a family farm in Ely, Iowa, that he valued at between $100,000 and $250,000. The forms also included disclosures of $20,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt in 2017.\n\nFACT drew its funds from 2014-2016 mainly from Donor\u2019s Trust, another nonprofit designed to provide anonymity to conservative and libertarian donors. Though such tax-exempt groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment has been criticized by Democrats who have challenged its constitutionality and are concerned that he will interfere with Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Charles Schumer, asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to investigate communications between Whitaker and the White House and to look into whether Whitaker had access to confidential grand jury information in Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, had been overseeing the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation until Whitaker\u2019s appointment. Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have said they are concerned about Whitaker\u2019s past criticism of the Mueller probe, which is looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s past public statements have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump\u2019s family finances. In a talk radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/22/matthew-whitaker-right-leaning-nonprofit-paid-attorney-general/2086353002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andrew Joseph", "title": "Ranking the 10 best dunkers in college basketball", "description": "From Ky Bowman to Zion Williamson.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/best-dunkers-zion-williamson-mac-mcclung-college-basketball-highlights-videos-rankings", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ap-eastern-michigan-duke-basketball1.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T19:42:12Z", "content": "There are few plays in college basketball that impact a game quite like a dunk.

We can expect a lot more going forward, especially from these 10 players.\n\nHere are the best dunkers in college basketball for the 2018-19 season.\n\n10. Ky Bowman \u2013 Boston College\n\nYou have to respect the hair, but even more so, you have to love Bowman\u2019s leaping ability. The 6-foot-1 guard returned to Boston College for his junior season, and he leads the Eagles in scoring through three games. But we\u2019re here for the dunks, and you shall get the dunks.\n\nHe\u2019s dunk-contest ready.\n\n9. Lagerald Vick \u2013 Kansas\n\nFew expected Vick to return to Kansas for his senior season. When the 6-foot-5 guard entered his name into the draft, Bill Self was ready to move on from Vick. The draft process, though, was a wake-up call for Vick, and he convinced Self to take him back for 2018. Now wearing a new number, Vick put up career-best showings in consecutive games against Vermont and Louisiana. While there have been questions about Vick\u2019s game, nobody has ever doubted his athleticism. The dude can fly.\n\n8. Jamall Gregory \u2013 Jacksonville State\n\nSure, Gregory is a rotation player for a struggling Jacksonville State side, but he\u2019s on this list for one reason: His dunking ability matches up with the best of college basketball. He\u2019s not afraid to take off from just shy of the free-throw line and posterize someone.\n\nEven back in high school:\n\n7. Nassir Little \u2013 North Carolina\n\nZion Williamson and Mac McClung get much of the dunk hype from this freshman class. Little is no slouch either. He\u2019s already shown off what he\u2019s capable of doing in North Carolina\u2019s win over Elon.\n\n6. Nahziah Carter \u2013 Washington\n\nCarter is Jay-Z\u2019s nephew, which is cool. But for #Pac12AfterDark enthusiasts, they know that whenever Carter finds himself with a clear path to the rim, he\u2019s ready to put on a show.\n\nHe\u2019ll even put his own teammate on a poster.\n\n5. Daniel Gafford \u2013 Arkansas\n\nGafford gave Arkansas a huge boost when he elected to return to Fayetteville for his sophomore season. The 6-foot-11 forward is long, athletic and isn\u2019t afraid to break out in-game windmill dunks.\n\nHe put up 27 points in Arkansas\u2019 win over Indiana, and, yes, there were dunks.\n\n4. Jordan Davis \u2013 Northern Colorado\n\nYou better believe that a mid-major star is breaking into the top 5. Davis is not only off to a scorching start this season at Northern Colorado, but the 6-foot-2 guard can also straight-up soar. He probably had the dunk of the year last season.\n\nIt was one of many:\n\n3. Kerwin Roach \u2013 Texas\n\nBefore this high-flying freshman class arrived, Roach was arguably the best dunker in college basketball. He\u2019s been known to max-out vertical machines and posterize opponents. While his shot can be inconsistent, his dunks are not.\n\nThey never disappoint.\n\nGoodness gracious \u2014\n\nLet Kerwin Roach's FILTHY dunk wake you up from your early morning slumber\u2026 pic.twitter.com/N3yMfXXbYH \u2014 CBS Sports (@CBSSports) December 2, 2015\n\nSo many dunks.\n\n2. Mac McClung \u2013 Georgetown\n\nMac McClung broke Allen Iverson\u2019s Virginia high school scoring record and became a viral dunk sensation in the process. The three-star prospect earned a starting role with Georgetown to start the season, and he\u2019s already offered a glimpse of his ridiculous athleticism.\n\nMac McClung is going to be so, so fun. pic.twitter.com/qbaF50UN1D \u2014 Kyle Boone (@Kyle__Boone) November 14, 2018\n\n1. Zion Williamson \u2013 Duke\n\nShocking, I know.\n\nWilliamson tops our list of college dunkers on the basis of him being, well, possibly the best dunker the college game has ever seen. Duke isn\u2019t even five games into the season, and the freshman has already stacked up enough highlight dunks to last a typical career."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Black Friday: The myth, the money and the common sense", "description": "What people are saying about this post-Thanksgiving tradition.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/22/black-friday-behind-myth-money-and-common-sense-editorials-debates/2082091002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/22/USAT/f34f83a9-f7b9-4c85-8c04-4b1c3d9a3300-blackfriday.ourview_2.JPG?crop=3249,1820,x0,y280&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T19:38:13Z", "content": "Black Friday in 2017 in Grand Chute, Wisconsin.

In the 1950s, it was commonly used by human resource managers because so many workers would call in on the Friday after Thanksgiving in order to get the day off and acquire that four-day weekend so many of us know and love today. It was also used in Philadelphia in the 1950s, when people would descend on the city the day after Thanksgiving in preparation for the Army-Navy football game. ... Now the \u2018black\u2019 in Black Friday refers to retailers being \u2018in the black\u2019 or making a profit. ... According to the Outdoor Industry Association\u2019s 2018 report, only 49 percent of Americans 6 years and older participated in at least one outdoor activity in 2017. ... That means we actually have slightly more people who will participate in Thanksgiving weekend sales than who will participate in just one outdoor activity all year long. That, to me, is a tragedy, especially when it costs so much less to enjoy the outdoors than it does to hunt for bargain deals at a store.\u201d\n\nOUR VIEW: Why Black Friday shoppers still crowd stores\n\nBill Tinsley, Times Telegram, (Herkimer, New York): \u201cOur forefathers knew nothing of this. They hunted and harvested and cleaned and cooked, but they never stood in lines in front of glass doors waiting for the opening bell. They never rushed through aisles searching for treasures that were sure to disappear. They never stood in checkout lines that stretched to the back of the store. Black Friday seems to symbolize our rush through life, our efforts to get the best deal, to be first in line.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/22/black-friday-behind-myth-money-and-common-sense-editorials-debates/2082091002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa is straightening out", "description": "Leaning Tower of Pisa isn't really leaning anymore", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/22/leaning-tower-pisa-isnt-leaning-so-much-anymore/2087400002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/65553967-e0f5-41b6-a115-e28080976868/65553967-e0f5-41b6-a115-e28080976868_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T19:36:53Z", "content": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa isn't leaning so much anymore.

By using hundreds of tons of lead counterweights at the base and extracting soil from under the foundations, engineers initially shaved 17 inches off the lean.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2018/11/22/leaning-tower-pisa-isnt-leaning-so-much-anymore/2087400002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Sergio Bustos, USA TODAY", "title": "Trump again warns he may shut down southern border", "description": "Trump again threatens to close southern border", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/22/donald-trump-southern-border-shut-down-mexico-migrant-caravan-immigration/2086291002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/d18ee784-4fe6-49bb-9277-419886192985/d18ee784-4fe6-49bb-9277-419886192985_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T19:35:01Z", "content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday again threatened to close the southern border if the Mexican government fails to do more to secure its side of it. \"If we find that it's uncontrollable, if we find it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or whe\u2026 [+2925 chars]", "fulltext": "CLOSE Several hundred migrants have arrived in Tijuana after a month-long journey from Honduras.

Can he do it?\n\nTrump has been railing for more than a month about the thousands of Central American migrants who left Honduras last month and trekked through Mexico en route to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum. The migrants said they were escaping extreme poverty and gang violence. Trump has called it \u201can invasion\u201d and has deployed thousands of military troops to support U.S. Border Patrol agents to secure the southern border.\n\nThe latest wave of migrants traveling through northern Mexico is part of a large caravan that began arriving this week to Tijuana, near the border with San Diego, where hundreds, and possibly thousands, more migrants are expected to follow in coming days.\n\nSeveral charter buses arrived just after midnight Tuesday at the Unidad Deportiva Benito Juarez, the sports complex the city opened as a makeshift shelter. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many migrants were in the latest group. But inside, there were 3,000 other migrants who had arrived in Tijuana since last week.\n\nThe municipal government opened up the Benito Juarez sports complex last Wednesday. Originally planned to hold 3,000 migrants, the latest arrivals have put the shelter over capacity.\n\nSo far, the city has not said whether they intend to open a second shelter as hundreds more migrants make their way to Tijuana. Another 3,000 migrants have been in the nearby city of Mexicali, about 90 miles away.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/22/donald-trump-southern-border-shut-down-mexico-migrant-caravan-immigration/2086291002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Jets' Darnold sits out again, appears unlikely vs. Patriots", "description": "Jets QB Sam Darnold sits out practice again, appears unlikely to play vs. Patriots", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/22/jets-darnold-sits-out-again-appears-unlikely-vs-patriots/38587299/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f71264c29f1a44ff0e104a0b93e27c6331014a7/c=0-358-4566-2926/local/-/media/2018/11/22/USATODAY/usatsports/bd42542571304760aa347f4e8724cff6.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T19:31:20Z", "content": "FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, file photo, New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold (14) walks off the field after an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins, in Miami Gardens, Fla.

USA TODAY\n\nOne reason this Thanksgiving ritual endures could be that it involves a tiny act of rebellion against the internet age. How sane: Our view\n\nBlack Friday in 2017 in Grand Chute, Wisconsin. (Photo: Dan Powers/USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nTo many of us, the idea of rushing out to a mall or superstore the day after Thanksgiving is about as appealing as standing in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nWhy, we ask, would anyone race to crowded stores when they could stay in with family, watch college football, or rediscover the miracle that is mayonnaise as an agent for repurposing leftover turkey?\n\nWe can\u2019t say we know the answer for sure. But we do marvel at those who pour into stores looking for Black Friday bargains. Seemingly, nothing can stop them. Not the weather. Not the crowds. Not the mayhem. Not the gloom that has overtaken retail as investors fret over an economy overdue for a slowdown. And not the fact that hurrying to a store in the age of instant e-commerce seems so \u2026 last century.\n\nOTHER VIEWS: The myth, the money and the common sense\n\nTo be sure, holiday shopping habits do appear to be shifting. The National Retail Federation has stopped breaking out its holiday sales numbers by whether they come from e-tail purchases or from physical stores. (It predicts an overall seasonal increase of 4.1 percent over 2017.) That's a pretty good sign retailers don't want to bring further attention to the declining fortunes of brick-and-mortar sites.\n\nBut there is no denying that people still love going to stores. Actual shopping in actual places remains an important part of the holiday ritual for millions of Americans. To many, it's the difference between playing a sport and playing a video game.\n\nAs crassly commercial as stores may be, they are still places where actual human beings interact. They convey more authenticity than being \u201cfriended\u201d by strangers, or \u201cfollowing\u201d pseudo celebrities with millions of others.\n\nIn a store, the intrepid shopper commits the affirmative act of finding a present. That item might be heavily promoted by the store, but it doesn\u2019t drop into one\u2019s cart. It is picked up and examined before a decision is made. Maybe it gets put back on the shelf when the shopper changes his or her mind. Maybe there is a conversation with a sales clerk. The process is not that different than it would have been decades ago.\n\nOnline, the shopper has barely logged in before being confronted with creepy algorithmic suggestions based on prior purchases. Said shopper clicks. And, like that, it is over. This hardly qualifies as shopping. This hardly qualifies as thinking.\n\nPerhaps we are reading too much into the Black Friday phenomenon. Maybe people simply feel housebound after Thanksgiving. Maybe they have had enough of family togetherness. Maybe they can't resist a bargain, or the perception of a bargain. But we suspect one reason Black Friday endures is that it involves a tiny act of rebellion against the internet age.\n\nSuch rebellion would hardly be unreasonable. There aren\u2019t many studies showing that time spent in stores is bad for one\u2019s health. There are quite a few drawing a link between time spent online \u2014 particularly time spent on social media platforms \u2014 and depression or anxiety.\n\nPerhaps the people crowding into stores aren't the crazy ones after all.\n\nBy Dan Carney for the Editorial Board.

(AP Photo/James Kenney, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Wesley Woodyard laughs when asked if the 32-year-old linebacker has found a fountain of youth.\n\nComing off a career-high 172 tackles, Woodyard once again is leading the Tennessee Titans in tackles despite missing two starts and nearly three full games with an injured shoulder.\n\nHe sets the tone for the NFL's second-best scoring defense, a unit that has taken a big leap in several statistical categories this season under first-year head coach Mike Vrabel and coordinator Dean Pees.\n\nWoodyard, now in his 11th NFL season, says the secret to his success as a former undrafted free agent out of Kentucky is much simpler.\n\n\"I'm surrounded by a bunch of great guys that I love to go to work with every week,\" Woodyard said. \"They make my job easier, showing up to work man I enjoy being here. And most importantly, I've had the chances to learn and take the bits and pieces from a lot of people that I came across in this game of football and now just going out there doing what I do. I love the game, so go and play and have fun and be free.\"\n\nAn undrafted free agent in 2008, Woodyard signed with Denver and wound up voted a team captain in each of his six seasons with the Broncos. He signed with Tennessee after the Broncos lost the 2014 Super Bowl to Seattle and has been a captain each season with the Titans.\n\nThe 6-foot, 233-pound linebacker credits his longevity and success to a combination of keeping the driven mentality of being undrafted mixed with an ever-changing cast of head coaches and defensive systems.\n\n\"I had three new head coaches and a new D coordinator every year the first five years,\" Woodyard said. \"I use it as a blessing man. I got a chance to learn five new systems, got a chance to put football out there for new coaches, and this league man, the turnover ratio is so huge. Every year it's a different system, different schemes and I've been blessed to be in a lot of different schemes: 4-3s, 3-4s, new coaches, old coaches. So I've seen a lot.\"\n\nWith the Titans, Woodyard has had three different head coaches and the chance to play for a pair of defensive coordinator legends in Dick LeBeau and now Dean Pees. His current coordinator coached Ray Lewis and Ed Reed in Baltimore and said what Woodyard has in common with those players is being a pro knowing how to take care of their bodies. They also study hard.\n\n\"And if they have a shortcoming in any area, they know how to overcome that shortcoming,\" Pees said. \"We all get older and we all get slower, ... but the guys that know how to handle that, they all play smarter as they get older, and don't rely as much on their talent as their instincts. And Wesley is definitely in that same caliber.\"\n\nWoodyard, also switched to a vegan diet last year , is surrounded by youth at inside linebacker with Jayon Brown in his second season, 2018 first-round draft pick Rashaan Evans and six-year veteran Daren Bates. Woodyard is leading the way with 72 tackles, and he's tied for second on the Titans with 3\u00bd sacks. He also has five tackles for loss as the Titans (5-5) prepare to visit Houston (7-3) on Monday night.\n\nThe linebacker jokes he heard being in your 30s is the new prime.\n\n\"The biggest thing for me man is getting better every year, to challenge myself to get better at something every year and continue to get better. Me coming in the league undrafted, you have that chip on your shoulder where you got to prove yourself every year no matter if you're a first-round pick or a late-round pick, you got to go every year, and that's just been my mentality.\"\n\nNotes: The Titans went through a walk-through practice Thursday, taking advantage of an extra day before their game in Houston. QB Marcus Mariota was limited with an injured neck, and Vrabel says they will test Mariota's arm Friday because they didn't throw much Thursday. WR Taywan Taylor (left foot) and C Ben Jones (shoulder) also were limited. RB David Fluellen (knee) did not practice.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

USA TODAY\n\nOhio State coach Urban Meyer looked in pain during last week's game at Maryland. (Photo: Nick Wass, AP)\n\nIf you missed it live \u2013 and somehow did not see the montage, or the extended cut, or the greatest hits \u2013 it might be only because you have not been trying.\n\nOhio State escaped Maryland last week, 52-51 when the Terrapins failed to convert a two-point try in overtime. The win felt like a loss, another oddly difficult struggle in a season filled with them. But the enduring visual was of Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer on the sidelines, in apparent agony.\n\nBent over between plays, hands clasped to his head. It was painful just watching. And it\u2019s why, as the Buckeyes\u2019 annual date with Michigan looms, the nagging questions are not so much about what\u2019s wrong with this team, which has not played to its seeming capabilities this season (yet still has College Football Playoff possibilities), but instead what ails its coach.\n\nFirst, and most important: Is Meyer OK? But next, and inevitably: Could he actually be nearing the end of his tenure at Ohio State?\n\nAs The Game approaches, there are no definitive answers.\n\nWhen Ohio State hosts Michigan on Saturday in Columbus, the stakes are very high: the Big Ten East division title, a shot at the Big Ten championship and beyond that, perhaps the College Football Playoff. Those add intensity to a rivalry that never needs more, ever.\n\nAnd they heap even more pressure on a coach who is very clearly struggling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working so damn hard for this,\u201d Meyer said this week.\n\nHe was referring to how badly the Buckeyes want to beat their rivals. But it\u2019s an astounding turn for a coach who, just a couple of years ago, was being hailed as a challenger to Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban in college football\u2019s coaching hierarchy. Now the questions are not about passing Saban or building a legendary legacy, but whether, at 54, he will continue to coach much longer.\n\nEverything suddenly seems so difficult. So painful. So debilitating.\n\nSome of the myriad issues Meyer has endured this season are self-inflicted. His initial comments about former assistant coach Zach Smith at Big Ten media days last July led to a firestorm of scandal that resulted in Meyer\u2019s suspension during August and the first season\u2019s first three games. During the investigation that led to the suspension, many wondered if Meyer would return to the job \u2013 but he clearly didn\u2019t believe he should even have been suspended. Since his return, there has not been consistent calm for long, either on the field or off.\n\nLast month, questioned about his future, he said he planned to coach at Ohio State next season and \u201cfor as long as I can.\u201d A day later, he revealed that he\u2019s been dealing with an enlarged congenital arachnoid cyst on his brain. Though Meyer had surgery in spring 2014, he continues to take medicine. The cyst causes occasionally severe headaches \u2013 as in one highly visible example, the Buckeyes\u2019 49-26 win against Indiana, when Meyer dropped to his knees in the fourth quarter.\n\nLast Saturday, as Ohio State struggled to find a way to beat Maryland, the cameras kept returning to Meyer\u2019s tortured sideline demeanor. It was riveting and horrible, and it seemed a reflection of his overall discomfort this season.\n\nMeyer does not look well. And in his seventh year at Ohio State, there are seeming parallels to the end of his tenure at Florida. He retired from that gig after six seasons, citing stress-related health issues.\n\nWhen he returned to coaching a year later at Ohio State, after a year doing TV work, he promised to do things differently \u2013 famously signing a contract with his family (and hanging it in his new office) that promised he would have work-life balance.\n\nBut that leads to another revealing nugget. Last week someone asked Shelley Meyer, via Twitter, what her husband\u2019s \u201cmost difficult personality trait\u201d is, and she responded:\n\n\u201c(I) think he would be ok if I said his \u2018control/perfection\u2019 issues are the most difficult to deal with \u2013 as we know LOGICALLY, a person can\u2019t control everything and being perfect is REALLY hard when u can\u2019t control all \u2026\u201d\n\nMake of that what you want. Meyer is not unique in those traits \u2013 it\u2019s a character quality/flaw of most college football coaches \u2013 but his reputation is that of a control freak to the nth degree. This season has brought myriad issues the coach could not even hope to control.\n\nIt has been a long season for Ohio State Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer. (Photo: Tommy Gilligan, Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nConsidering what happened at Florida, it could be Meyer is simply so tightly wound, something eventually springs loose and a crash is inevitable.\n\nIt might also be the Buckeyes\u2019 defense. Ohio State is allowing 5.91 yards a play and 398.6 yards a game \u2013 85th and 70th nationally, respectively. Through 11 games, it\u2019s statistically the worst defense in the history of the program, and it\u2019s been an anchor on an offense that, with first-year starting quarterback Dwayne Haskins, has been among the nation\u2019s best.\n\nMeyer told reporters this week he\u2019s had \u201cuncomfortable and direct\u201d conversations with the Buckeyes\u2019 defensive assistants. And yet the most important numbers are more than fine.\n\nDespite everything, Ohio State is 10-1. Meyer\u2019s career record at Ohio State is an astounding 80-9 and a national championship. With a win Saturday \u2013 which would be the Buckeyes\u2019 14th in the last 15 games against Michigan, and Meyer\u2019s seventh in as many tries \u2013 Ohio State would head to the Big Ten championship with at least a shot at making the Playoff.\n\nAlthough Ohio State is a home underdog, it\u2019s never safe to assume anything in a rivalry. Maybe, finally, a talented roster plays to its perceived potential, stops Michigan\u2019s Playoff bid and promotes its own hopes. But given everything we\u2019ve seen in a tumultuous season, it seems more likely the Buckeyes are in for a painful finish.\n\nTheir coach might be, too."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Chris Chase", "title": "Survivor Episode 9 recap: Fallen idol", "description": "An immunity idol couldn\u2019t save the latest castaway to be voted out on Survivor.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/survivor-david-vs-goliath-episode-9-recap", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/dan1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:46:40Z", "content": "Every Thursday, FTW recaps the latest episode of Survivor: David vs. Goliath, with our Survivor Superlatives.

The scientist searches for the idol and makes it seem like it\u2019s a problem on par with standing at that chalkboard from Good Will Hunting. Somehow, Christian makes looking under rocks, into tree nots and on branches seem like some sort of science. But Christian, Dan found TWO IDOLS. If he can find multiple immunity necklaces that sort of erases the whole theory about how superior intellect is needed for such a task. It\u2019s like if Stephen Hawking had been proud of himself for doing the People magazine crossword.\n\nMost unfamiliar with the concept of a hammock: Dan\n\nAs if to prove the point about IQ\u2019s relation to idol hunting, Dan was next shown sitting in a hammock. Well, captured by a hammock. He wasn\u2019t relaxed with his feet kicked up as you\u2019d expect from most hammock enjoyers, he had his knees up and he hammock engulfed him, like he\u2019d just stepped on a trap laid by The Others from Lost.\n\nMost obvious foreshadowing: Dan, being Dan\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad Alec won,\u201d the soon-to-be-voted-out Dan said after Alec won the immunity challenge, thus ensuring that he was soon to be voted out. It the most obvious use of lovebird foreshadowing since Romeo and Juliet.\n\nWorst fashion statement or maybe the best fashion statement, I\u2019m not sure: Elizabeth and her hat\n\nLast week, during her first Tribal on the journey, Elizabeth wore a lovely dress that, nonetheless, felt completely out of place in the jungle, Elizabeth made another bold statement this week, walking into Tribal wearing a fedora, with John walking behind her wearing an \u201cI tried\u201d face. The Talented Mrs. Ripley is going to be a solid jury member, providing great reaction faces and off-the-runway looks.\n\nTribal grade: A-\n\nThe thing about Survivor advantages is that they almost never work. Not immunity, but the steal-a-vote or skip-a-vote or double-vote, etc. \u2013 they almost never work to the advantage of the players. On Wednesday, the David tribe took advantage of not one, but two, advantages, played in tandem that saved their numbers. (Other Goliaths flipped but we didn\u2019t see whether it was because of the advantage threat.) Long story short: Nick stole Alison\u2019s vote, Dan played an immunity idol for himself and Carl played the idol nullifier to erase Dan\u2019s immunity. (We didn\u2019t see how or when Carl played the advantage \u2013 it was in the urn after the vote \u2013 which only jacked up the surprise.) Did both Davids have to play their advantages to get their way tonight?

The State Department estimates that $1.7 billion in goods and services, and hundreds of thousands of people, legally cross the border each day.\n\nLast month, Trump fired off a series of tweets warning he would close the border if the governments of Mexico and Central America did not control a caravan heading toward the United States.\n\nMore: Trump threatens to seal U.S.-Mexico border over migrant caravan. Can he do it?\n\nTrump has been railing for more than a month about the thousands of Central American migrants who left Honduras last month and trekked through Mexico en route to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum. The migrants said they were escaping extreme poverty and gang violence. Trump has called it \u201can invasion\u201d and has deployed thousands of military troops to support U.S. Border Patrol agents to secure the southern border.\n\nThe latest wave of migrants traveling through northern Mexico is part of a large caravan that began arriving this week to Tijuana, near the border with San Diego, where hundreds, and possibly thousands, more migrants are expected to follow in coming days.\n\nSeveral charter buses arrived just after midnight Tuesday at the Unidad Deportiva Benito Juarez, the sports complex the city opened as a makeshift shelter. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many migrants were in the latest group. But inside, there were 3,000 other migrants who had arrived in Tijuana since last week.\n\nThe municipal government opened up the Benito Juarez sports complex last Wednesday. Originally planned to hold 3,000 migrants, the latest arrivals have put the shelter over capacity.\n\nSo far, the city has not said whether they intend to open a second shelter as hundreds more migrants make their way to Tijuana. Another 3,000 migrants have been in the nearby city of Mexicali, about 90 miles away.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/22/donald-trump-southern-border-shut-down-mexico-migrant-caravan-immigration/2086291002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Trump makes Thanksgiving threat to close border", "description": "President Donald Trump is threatening to close the U.S. border with Mexico for an undisclosed period of time if his administration determines that its southern ally has lost \"control\" on its side.

(AP Photo/Paul White, FILE) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWhat to watch in the leading soccer leagues in Europe this weekend:\n\nENGLAND\n\nThree teams are unbeaten after the opening 12 games of an English top-flight campaign for the first time in 130 years. One of them could struggle to maintain that record this weekend.\n\nOf the trio of pacesetters, Chelsea faces the toughest test when the Premier League resumes Saturday following the international break as Maurizio Sarri's side is away to fourth-place Tottenham.\n\nWithout hitting top form, Tottenham is putting together an impressive run of results, with nine wins from 12 games. That's one more victory than Chelsea has.\n\nThe other unbeaten sides are Manchester City and Liverpool, who both play away on Saturday against West Ham and Watford respectively.\n\nManchester United, seven points off the top four in the race for Champions League qualification, is at home to Crystal Palace.\n\n\u2014 By Steve Douglas\n\nSPAIN\n\nAtletico Madrid has a chance to take the Spanish league lead for the first time this weekend but will need to do something it hasn't done in the competition in eight years: Defeat Barcelona.\n\nThree points on Saturday at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium will move Atletico past Barcelona in the standings. The team's last league win over the Catalan club was in 2010 and that was at the old Vicente Calderon Stadium, before Diego Simeone was in charge.\n\nAtletico has only two wins against Barcelona in 26 matches since then, both in the Champions League, with the last one in 2016. Atletico lost 16 of those games, drawing eight.\n\nLike Atletico, Sevilla and Alaves also trail Barcelona by one point after 12 games. Sevilla hosts Valladolid on Sunday, while Alaves visits relegation-threatened Leganes on Friday.\n\nFifth-place Espanyol hosts fellow Catalan club Girona on Sunday. Sixth-place Real Madrid visits Eibar on Saturday to try to keep up its strong momentum under new coach Santiago Solari.\n\n\u2014 By Tales Azzoni\n\nITALY\n\nIn what promises to be an emotional occasion on Sunday, Genoa and Sampdoria meet in their first derby since 43 people were killed in the Morandi highway bridge collapse in the city in August.\n\nSince Ivan Juric began his third stint as Genoa coach last month, replacing Davide Ballardini, the team has not won in four matches. Two draws and two losses included a 5-0 thrashing by Inter Milan.\n\nSampdoria has done even worse after a draw and three losses, with 11 goals conceded in its last three games.\n\nOn Saturday, Serie A leader Juventus hosts promoted Spal and third-place Inter plays Frosinone. On Sunday, second-place Napoli meets Chievo Verona while Lazio and AC Milan, in a battle for fourth spot, meet in Rome.\n\nRoma visits Udinese on Saturday ahead of its Champions League match against Real Madrid.\n\n\u2014 By Andrew Dampf\n\nFRANCE\n\nWith a crucial Champions League game coming up against Liverpool next week, Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel is unlikely to risk Neymar or Kylian Mbappe for Saturday's home match against Toulouse.\n\nNeymar injured his groin in Brazil's friendly against Cameroon on Tuesday, while strike partner Mbappe hurt his shoulder playing for France against Uruguay on the same night.\n\nPSG has a 13-point lead at the top of the league \u2014 after 13 games \u2014 and has already netted 45 goals. With Toulouse in 15th place, a 14th win appears straightforward enough for the hosts.\n\nTuchel could rest other key players ahead of Wednesday's game at Parc des Princes. PSG is third behind Napoli and second-place Liverpool in Group C with five points from four games.\n\nOn Sunday, second-place Lille is at Nice and third-place Montpellier faces Rennes.\n\n\u2014 By Jerome Pugmire\n\nGERMANY\n\nAfter losing to Borussia Dortmund before the international break, Bayern Munich is in the unusual position of being outside the Champions League qualification positions heading into Saturday's home match against Fortuna Duesseldorf in the Bundesliga.\n\nBayern is in fifth place, seven points behind unbeaten leader Dortmund, which travels to mid-table Mainz on Saturday.\n\nSecond-place Borussia Moenchengladbach is at home to struggling Hannover on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

According to reports he said \u201c[expletive] Thanksgiving\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t celebrate that [expletive].\u201d\n\nToday came the inevitable apology:\n\nMeant no disrespect to the Holiday and those who celebrate it respectfully.

Irving\u2019s late mother, Elizabeth Ann Larson, was adopted out of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and the Celtics point guard was honored by the tribe in North Dakota in August. Irving also has a tattoo of the tribe\u2019s logo on his neck. While Thanksgiving has become a popular holiday throughout the United States, some in the Native American community believe it is not worthy of celebration, citing instances of racism and oppression following the arrival of European settlers. Some in the Native American community instead choose to observe Thursday as a National Day of Mourning.\n\nIrving was clearly frustrated after the loss, but he probably could have found a way to get his message across in a way that would allow for his message to be the focus. Unlike with the flat earth thing, he\u2019s actually saying something worth thinking about here. The \u201cPilgrims and Indians celebrating peacefully thing\u201d is mostly a fairytale, of course, that ignores far too much of what we actually know about what happened next.\n\nBesides, Thanksgiving has roots as a religious holiday, and is also at least partially related to the fledgling U.S. government declaring a day of thanksgiving in 1777 after a significant victory against the British."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Best of NFL Week 12: Thanksgiving Day games", "description": "Take a look at the best images from the 12th week of play during the 2018 NFL season.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/2018/11/22/best-nfl-week-12/2086017002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/22/USAT/3e980c58-58d6-4d50-b327-2e11c6e0bf49-GTY_1064331708.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x1,y288&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:24:03Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nChase Daniel (4) started for the Bears at quarterback in place of Mitchell Trubisky, who was inactive with an injury.

(AP) \u2014 Four years ago, Syracuse place-kicker Andre Szmyt was playing soccer at his high school in the northern Chicago suburbs, not even on the radar of the school's football coach. Now, he's a star for the 19th-ranked Orange.\n\nThe 6-1, 195-pound redshirt freshman from Vernon Hills High School is one of three finalists for the Lou Groza Award, given to the nation's top place-kicker. With one game left in the regular season, at Boston College on Saturday, and a bowl game to follow, Szmyt is poised to eclipse the NCAA record for field goals in a season and become just the second kicker to lead the nation in scoring.\n\nNot bad for a walk-on who played only one year of high school football and landed at Syracuse by chance.\n\n\"I've been confident all year,\" Szmyt said. \"I knew coming into this season once I was listed as the No. 1 on the depth chart that I could continue. Gaining confidence was a big part.\"\n\nSzmyt has an Atlantic Coast Conference-record 28 field goals in 31 attempts, including all three he's tried from beyond 50 yards, and has not missed an extra point in 51 tries. He leads the nation with 2.2 field goals and 12.3 points per game for 135 points, also tops in the Bowl Subdivision. The national record for field goals is 31, set in 2003 by Georgia's Billy Bennett. Boise State's Tyler Jones averaged 11.8 points per game in 2004 to lead the nation in scoring.\n\nThose who know Szmyt best are taking it all in stride.\n\n\"I'm really not surprised,\" said Bill Bellecomo, Szmyt's high school football coach. \"I'm excited.\"\n\nSzmyt landed on his high school football team by chance, too.\n\n\"After my junior season of soccer, all my buddies played football,\" Szmyt said. \"They knew I had a strong leg in soccer and they just kind of told me: 'You should be a kicker. We need a kicker on our football team.'\"\n\nThe coach was an easy sell.\n\n\"Our guys sent me a video of him kicking a 55-yarder,\" Bellecomo recalled. \"They said, 'We've got to get this kid out for football.'\"\n\nAnd why not? Nothing like being able to sit back and watch.\n\n\"We tried to just leave him alone and let him do his thing,\" Bellecomo said. \"I'm going to be honest. I have no idea about anything about kicking. All of us coaches, we'd looked at each other and every once in a while somebody would ask, 'Where did you get this kicker?' We coached him up. No, not really.\n\n\"I thought with some good coaching that he would be fantastic. We just couldn't give it to him.\"\n\nThere wasn't much need.\n\n\"He's got the right mentality for a kicker because nothing bothers him. That's just the kind of kid he is,\" Bellecomo said.\n\nSzmyt's first kick for Vernon Hills was a 43-yarder to win the game.\n\n\"There was no time left,\" Bellecomo said. \"It was a 7-7 game and all the kids were yelling at him, 'You're going to make this!' I pulled him aside and I said: 'I'm going to put my headset away because I know this game's over. Now, you go do your thing. I'm not even going to watch.'\n\n\"He had a big smile on his face and he nailed it right down the middle. Had about another 10 yards to it. That was my claim to fame as far as coaching him.\"\n\nBecause Szmyt got such a late start in football, there was a scramble to get him noticed, even after a season in which he hit 9 of 12 field goals, including a school-record 48-yarder, to help the Cougars to an 11-4 record.\n\n\"It's difficult to sell a kid who only has one year of film and I was trying to sell him to anyone who would listen,\" Bellecomo said.\n\nOne who did listen was Dave Boller, former director of high school relations at Louisville. But the Cardinals wanted him there the day after his classes ended his senior year. \"He wasn't big on taking off right away,\" Bellecomo said.\n\nWhen Boller abruptly left Louisville to become the Orange's director of player personnel, Szmyt visited Syracuse and decided it was the place for him. He joined the Orange at the start of 2017 fall camp and won the starting job in preseason camp last summer.\n\n\"We keep numbers on all our kickers, it's a mathematical thing, and his numbers were extremely high,\" Syracuse coach Dino Babers said.\n\nPressure was added in practice to see if Szmyt could still kick with the same high percentage, which he did, and not much seems to have fazed Szmyt since. He hit a pair of field goals in the opener at Western Michigan, a month later converted three in front of a screaming crowd at Death Valley in a near-upset of No. 2 Clemson, then drilled three more in an overtime loss in the rain at Pittsburgh, including a season-long 54-yarder.\n\nHis reward after that was a scholarship.\n\n\"I was in awe. I wasn't expecting it,\" Szmyt said. \"It came out of nowhere. I was sitting in a team meeting after a loss.\"\n\nSyracuse is coming off a 36-3 loss to No. 3 Notre Dame at Yankee Stadium. The Orange averted a shutout when Szmyt kicked a 28-yarder with 10 seconds left after clanging a 23-yard attempt off the left upright earlier in the quarter.\n\n\"I just pulled the ball,\" said Szmyt, whose kicks have traveled right down the middle with uncanny regularity.\n\nSyracuse will play in its first bowl game in five years and the Orange are averaging 40.6 points, so Szmyt has a good shot to snare the national record.\n\n\"Hopefully, that's the plan if I'm out there,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Before joining the Justice Department, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker earned more than $1.2 million from a right-leaning nonprofit that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors, according to the nonprofit\u2019s tax filings. Whitaker\u2019s earnings represented a sizable chunk of the charity\u2019s revenue.\n\nFinancial disclosure forms released Tuesday show Whitaker received $904,000 in income from the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust from 2016 through nearly the end of 2017. He also received $15,000 from CNN as a legal commentator, according to the documents released by the Justice Department.\n\nThe nonprofit group, known as FACT, styles itself as a nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group is supposed to serve the public interest without supporting or opposing specific candidates for office. However, its challenges and its website have focused largely, though not exclusively, on Democrats and their party.\n\nWhitaker used his role as president and executive director of FACT in 2016 as a platform to question the ethics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nFrom 2014 through 2016, FACT paid out nearly 30 percent of its total revenue to Whitaker. In 2015 alone, Whitaker\u2019s $252,000 salary made up half of what the group brought in. Whitaker\u2019s salary also grew each year from $63,000 in 2014 to as much as $502,000 in 2017, according to the tax filings and public financial disclosures released by the Justice Department.\n\nSeparately, Whitaker is also facing criticism about whether he violated federal law because a campaign committee set up for his failed 2014 U.S. Senate bid accepted $8,800 in donations this year, while Whitaker was serving as a top Justice Department lawyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., called for an investigation into whether Whitaker violated the Hatch Act, a statute that generally prohibits executive branch employees from accepting or soliciting campaign donations.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s campaign committee, which still carries about $49,000 in debt, hadn\u2019t received any contributions between 2015 through 2017, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nThe campaign committee, Whitaker for U.S. Senate Inc., also reported paying $500 to Whitaker\u2019s old law firm, Whitaker, Hagenow & Gustoff, for space rental on Feb. 2. The campaign paid a $228 reimbursement to Christopher Hagenow \u2013 an Iowa legislator and founding partner of the law firm \u2013 for data services that same day.\n\nAmerican Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, also filed a complaint alleging that the campaign donations would be a Hatch Act violation. The group said in a statement Wednesday that the Office of Special Counsel \u2013 an independent federal agency that investigates such complaints \u2013 had opened a case file on the matter. A spokesman for the agency, which has no connection to the Justice Department or special counsel Robert Mueller, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday.\n\nSeveral news outlets, including The Associated Press, and outside groups had requested Whitaker\u2019s financial disclosure forms from the Justice Department after President Donald Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and elevated Whitaker to the agency\u2019s top post on Nov. 7.\n\nThose documents show Whitaker began revising his public disclosures the day he was appointed acting attorney general. He revised the forms four more times, including on Tuesday.\n\nIn a disclosure form Whitaker completed when he joined the Justice Department in September 2017, he reported receiving $1,875 in legal fees from a company called World Patent Marketing. Whitaker has come under scrutiny for his involvement with the company, which was accused of misleading consumers and is under investigation by the FBI.\n\nWhitaker also disclosed his partial interest in a family farm in Ely, Iowa, that he valued at between $100,000 and $250,000. The forms also included disclosures of $20,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt in 2017.\n\nFACT drew its funds from 2014-2016 mainly from Donor\u2019s Trust, another nonprofit designed to provide anonymity to conservative and libertarian donors. Though such tax-exempt groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment has been criticized by Democrats who have challenged its constitutionality and are concerned that he will interfere with Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Charles Schumer, asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to investigate communications between Whitaker and the White House and to look into whether Whitaker had access to confidential grand jury information in Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, had been overseeing the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation until Whitaker\u2019s appointment. Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have said they are concerned about Whitaker\u2019s past criticism of the Mueller probe, which is looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s past public statements have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump\u2019s family finances. In a talk radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/22/matthew-whitaker-right-leaning-nonprofit-paid-attorney-general/2086353002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Nick Schwartz", "title": "#FanIndex poll: Which NFL team had the greatest player ever?", "description": "Did the NFL\u2019s GOAT play for your favorite team?

(AP) \u2014 Located inside the Washington State football complex is a glass enclosure where, when it's in the possession of the crimson and gray, the Apple Cup trophy resides.\n\nIt's been five years since the trophy has called Pullman home, and reclaiming ownership on Friday when No. 7 Washington State hosts No. 16 Washington would add a chapter to a season already unlike no other in the Cougars' history.\n\n\"None of the past five years has a great deal to do with right now,\" Washington State coach Mike Leach said. \"I'm not terribly focused on that.\"\n\nA year that began with tragedy could end with unexpected triumph if the Cougars (10-1, 7-1 Pac-12, No. 8 CFP) can end their five-game skid. The winner will play in the Pac-12 championship game against Utah as the North Division champ, and for the Cougars, there still remains the outside possibility of landing in the College Football Playoff with two more wins and a lot of chaos.\n\nWashington State even being mentioned in the CFP conversation is astonishing. The season has provided joy and excitement to a program shrouded in sadness less than a year after the death of Tyler Hilinski.\n\n\"I'd like to make jokes, but I think Mike Leach is awesome for college football and what he's all about. But at the end of the day I don't think there's too many people that have not been impressed with what he's done over there because they have been through a lot. It's impressive,\" Washington coach Chris Petersen said.\n\nGardner Minshew is a big reason why the Cougars \u2014 who were picked to finish fifth in the Pac-12 North \u2014 have a chance to land in the conference title game. The grad transfer from East Carolina with the well-groomed mustache has mastered most of Leach's offense in just a few months on campus and become the national leader in passing.\n\nMore so, he brought a joy and swagger the Cougars desperately needed. But the Cougars will have to be more than Minshew to get the Apple Cup back in their possession.\n\n\"Coming up here you learn fast how much it means to everybody,\" Minshew said.\n\nSomewhat lost in the buildup has been what is still at stake for Washington. It's fair to say the season has been a disappointment after the Huskies (8-3, 6-2, No. 16 CFP) began the year with playoff aspirations only to stumble three times. But beating the Cougars would continue their in-state dominance and give Washington a chance at reaching the Rose Bowl. It's not the playoff, but Pasadena isn't a bad place to spend New Year's Day.\n\nA decade, ago the Apple Cup was the laughingstock of college football when the 1-10 Cougars faced the 0-10 Huskies in a game remembered affectionately as the Crapple Cup. Now for the second time in three years, the Pac-12 North title is on the line.\n\nHere's what else to watch for in the 111th meeting:\n\nPROTECT THE STACHE: Washington's ability to get pressure on Washington State's quarterbacks in previous Apple Cups has caused major problems for the Air Raid. Last year Washington defensive tackle Vita Vea took over the game and Washington State's offense struggled. Vea is gone, Washington's pass rush has been a concern all season and the Cougars have been exceptional protecting Minshew, who has been sacked just nine times in 11 games.\n\nGROUND GASKIN: One of the best games of Myles Gaskin's career at Washington came in last year's matchup when he rushed for 192 yards and four touchdowns. The senior needs 94 yards rushing to become the first player in Pac-12 history with four 1,000-yard rushing seasons in his career and appears fully healthy after missing time earlier in the season with a shoulder injury. But Washington State's defense has been stingy against the run, allowing 3.79 yards per rush.\n\nCATCH AND RUN: The combo of running backs James Williams and Max Borghi is a huge part of the Washington State offense. Combined, the pair have 109 receptions. Williams' 69 catches are tied for 18th nationally regardless of position. The use of Borghi and Williams is an extension of the Cougars' run game, which itself has been very good this season. The use of the running backs in the pass game will mean a busy day for Washington linebacker Ben Burr-Kirven, second in the country with 145 tackles.\n\nMEMORIES OF '97: There are many parallels between this Washington State team and the 1997 one. Both were led by a charismatic quarterback and had a dynamic pass offense. Both had a solid defense. And both rose up in a season when it was Washington entering the year as part of the national championship conversation. That 1997 Washington State team beat the Huskies in the Apple Cup to go to the Rose Bowl. Can these Cougars match the accomplishment?\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

On that day, McCoy passed for 299 yards on 25 completions, and even had a rushing touchdown. He was able to lead Washington to a 20-17 victory in overtime, resulting in the seventh win of his career. The Cowboys hope history will not repeat itself, as they face off against Washington on Thanksgiving.\n\nThroughout McCoy\u2019s career he has been a perennial backup quarterback. After eight seasons in the NFL he has done little to prove otherwise with a starting record of 7-18. Now he is thrust into the starting role for the next six games due to a season-ending leg injury for Alex Smith.\n\nSmith has often caught a lot of flak for his style of play. He has been tagged as a game manager with an emphasis on playing mistake-free football. Even so, Washington hopes it will be a seamless transition from Smith to McCoy on such short notice. But the loss of Smith does not tank Washington\u2019s playoff chances just yet.\n\nTaking AY/A (Adjusted Yards per Attempt) into account, which is a metric that assigns a value to interceptions and touchdowns and equates them to yards. Smith has been consistently above average as a quarterback from 2010 to 2017. But there may be a point to why Washington is so confident in McCoy to lead their offense. Smith had been playing at an unremarkable level in 2018 prior to his unfortunate injury. Washington is confident that things will more-or-less be the exact same from a scheme and game plan perspective.\n\nThe Cowboys are no strangers to struggling quarterback play, it is one of the reasons why they rely so much on their ground game and Washington is no different in this regard. Against the Cowboys they will look to Adrian Peterson to carry the load on offense. In their last meeting Peterson was able to rush for 99 yards on 24 carries. The Cowboys can expect Peterson to get a similar amount of carries in their upcoming matchup, perhaps more so now that McCoy is at the helm.\n\nA Familiar Face\n\nOn Monday, Washington signed former Cowboys backup quarterback, Mark Sanchez. He is an interesting pickup, during his tenure with the Cowboys, he was a mentor for Prescott during his formative 2016 rookie campaign.\n\nIn such a short week Sanchez won\u2019t be expected to be much of Washington\u2019s plans on Thursday. But Washington\u2019s offense is based on the running game to take pressure off the quarterback. So it is a safe environment for Sanchez, who has faced his own share of struggles in his seven year career.\n\nAre Washington\u2019s playoff hopes finished?\n\nThe outcome of Thursday\u2019s contest could be paramount as it will ultimately be a battle for first place in the NFC East. Right now Dallas has some momentum after riding a two-game win streak. On the other hand, Washington currently leads the division with a record of 6-4, but somehow, they are 7.5 point underdogs against the Cowboys, this speaks volumes about their current predicament.\n\nThe Cowboys defense has also had some recent success getting to the quarterback. They are ranked No.10 in the league with 28 sacks, a number they would like to see go up. But they will be pitted against an offensive line that is pretty good at protecting the QB. They have only allowed 24 sacks as a unit, which is tied for No.11. The Cowboys will come out aggressive to try and make McCoy uncomfortable in the pocket."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Cydney Henderson, USA TODAY", "title": "Man arrested for anti-Semitic rant on plane, reportedly saying 'all Jews raise their hands'", "description": "A passenger traveling to Atlanta Wednesday reportedly yelled \"all Jews raise their hands\" to \"identify them\" mid-flight during an alarming tirade, according to fellow traveler Jordan Dale.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/22/man-arrested-after-anti-semitic-rant-plane/2085638002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/999355f1-b469-46fb-abd9-9f7c1b85a5bf-AP_Man_On_Tarmac.jpg?crop=3720,2093,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T17:15:21Z", "content": "A man on a Delta flight sat in feces, and now the airline is apologizing.

You're going to have to prepare the right way.\"\n\nTennessee's inconsistency is perhaps most evident in its rushing attack.\n\nThe Vols rushed for just 20 yards on 26 carries in a 14-3 victory over Charlotte but recovered the next week to run for 215 yards against Kentucky. One week later, Missouri held Tennessee to 82 yards rushing on 28 carries.\n\n\"If the offensive line's not performing well, then the team's not going to perform well,\" Tennessee offensive tackle Marcus Tatum said. \"I put it all on us.\"\n\nWhile Tennessee has been up and down all season, Vanderbilt has been maddeningly consistent in its inability to finish.\n\nVanderbilt had a 21-3 lead over No. 13 Florida (No. 11 CFP) in the second quarter, owned a 28-19 advantage at Missouri in the third quarter and was tied with No. 17 Kentucky (No. 15 CFP) in the second half. Vanderbilt also was trailing 22-17 at No. 3 Notre Dame (No. 3 CFP) in the closing minutes when it drove inside the Fighting Irish's 35-yard line and attempted to score a go-ahead touchdown.\n\nThe Commodores won none of those games.\n\nVanderbilt is hoping that it turned a corner last week with its 36-29 overtime victory over Mississippi. After losing so many close games all season long, the Commodores finally managed to produce some winning plays when it mattered most.\n\n\"The other night we finally rose to the occasion, so hopefully it changes,\" Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \"You got to meet the challenge for it to change you. I thought we met the challenge, and now we've got to find a way to come back and do it again.\n\n\"From what I've seen from our football team, our margin for error is slim.\"\n\nMason noted that Vanderbilt's history of close games this season suggests that Saturday's matchups will likely come down to the final possession. The Commodores believe the Ole Miss result could give them a confidence boost if Saturday's game is up for grabs down the stretch.\n\n\"I think now we know how to do that and get to the other side,\" Mason said. \"So do I have confidence we can do it? Yeah, I have confidence we can do it. But it's like anything else, you got to play the game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Teresa Walker in Nashville, Tennessee contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Andre Penner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Four years ago, then-Gremio coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was humiliated by his once-loving Palmeiras fans during a Brazilian league match.\n\nThey chanted \"7-1! 7-1! 7-1!\" during their 2-1 victory at Pacaembu Stadium, a reference to the hammering Big Phil took as Brazil coach in the 2014 World Cup semifinals against Germany five months earlier.\n\nIt didn't matter that Scolari had given the Sao Paulo club its only Copa Libertadores title in 1999. Or that he was the mastermind when Palmeiras won the 2012 Brazilian Cup unbeaten with one of their worst teams in recent history. The home humiliation with Brazil was too big of a stain to be erased so quickly.\n\nFast forward four years and once again the coach of Palmeiras, Scolari could win his first major title at home since the historic embarrassment against the Germans at the Mineirao Stadium. With a victory on Sunday at Vasco da Gama, one of the worst teams in the Brazilian league, Scolari will win his second trophy in the competition \u2014 22 years after the first.\n\nFew expected that when Scolari took over in July. Palmeiras was lagging in sixth place in the standings despite being the biggest spender in the country. Midfielder Lucas Lima, once courted by Barcelona, was not delivering. Former Alaves striker Deyverson was too undisciplined. The team's defense was unreliable.\n\nBut after a record 21-match unbeaten streak in the league, no one in Brazil doubts the former Chelsea manager anymore. Scolari's team now has 74 points, five ahead of Flamengo, with two matches to play.\n\n\"There is no use in breaking records if we are not crowned champions,\" Scolari said Wednesday after a 4-0 win over America.\n\nAfter spending three years at Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande, the 70-year-old Scolari is once again revered as one of the best Brazilian coaches in the business. His attacking Palmeiras team is much more stylish than the stiff Brazil of four years ago and, most importantly, the 7-1 chants from opposing fans have disappeared.\n\nEven if the title doesn't come on Sunday, Palmeiras will still have another chance at home on Dec. 2 against Vitoria, which could be relegated by then.\n\nCHILEAN PROTEST\n\nChile midfielder Jean Beausejour used his national team jersey to make a point.\n\nThe 34-year-old player and his Chilean teammates wanted to honor a mapuche Indian named Camilo Catrillanca before their friendly match against Honduras. Catrillanca was killed by Chilean police in an incident that has shocked the South American country.\n\nThe president of the Chilean soccer association, however, denied the request of a minute's silence because Catrillanca did not have any sports links. So Beausejour wore his mapuche name of Coliqueo on his national team shirt.\n\nChile won the match 4-1.\n\nURUGUAYAN PROMISE\n\nTwo weeks after Penarol defended its Uruguayan title, there are still players fulfilling their promises and taking pictures to prove it.\n\nMidfielder Cristian Rodriguez climbed the Pan de Azucar, one of the highest points in the country at 389 meters. Midfielder Fabian Estoyanoff dyed his hair silver.\n\nRodriguez scored Penarol's winning goal in the victory over archrival Nacional on Nov. 11.\n\nPenarol has 52 Uruguayan titles while Nacional has 46.\n\nECUADORIAN ONIONS\n\nAmerica de Quito, the runner-up in the Ecuadorian league in 1969 and 1971, is back in the country's top division for the first time in 30 years.\n\nKnown as \"Cebollitas,\" or the Little Onions, they were relegated in 1988 and had not returned until Wednesday's 4-0 win over Portoviejo.\n\nIn the last round of Ecuador's Serie B, America has a shot at winning the title.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Emirates Formula One Grand Prix will take place on Sunday. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Not only is Max Verstappen unrepentant over his altercation with Esteban Ocon at the Brazilian Grand Prix, he suggests the French driver got away lightly with a few shoves to the chest.\n\nAlthough he had already been lapped and had little to fight for, Ocon refused to let race leader Verstappen past him two weeks ago. The pair tangled, sending the Dutch driver spinning back to second place and pushing Lewis Hamilton up to first at Interlagos.\n\nIt cost Verstappen his third victory of the season, and sixth of his Red Bull career. He stopped a post-race interview when he saw Ocon, squaring up to his rival and shoving him three times before angrily pointing a finger at him as he walked away.\n\nAsked at the Abu Dhabi GP on Thursday if he had regrets, Verstappen replied: \"No, not really. I was after an apology and I got a different response.\"\n\n\"I lost a victory, so I think from my side I was really calm. It could have been much worse,\" added the 21-year-old Dutchman, who is known as much for his fiery temper as his daredevil driving. \"I thought it was quite a calm response. What do you expect me to do? Shake his hand and say, 'Thanks very much'.\n\nAlthough Ocon breached race etiquette as a back-marker by not moving aside for the leader, Verstappen seemed equally upset by the Force India driver's comments.\n\n\"You guys don't hear what's being said ... You just see me pushing,\" he said. \"But if you understood the whole conversation, I think it would be different.\"\n\nOcon's words were \"something I didn't expect to hear,\" Verstappen added, before using an expletive.\n\nThe Red Bull driver must now perform two days of public service within six months, a punishment he calls harsh.\n\n\"We're not robots,\" Verstappen said. \"We are all here to win. You are in that position and it gets taken away from you.\"\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, the two men sat with Ferrari pair Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen between them.\n\nOcon was stone-faced throughout but had his say.\n\n\"It's not a great thing to be involved in a crash with the leader,\" he said. \"I'm sorry for Max. It was his race to win.\n\n\"The team came on the radio saying, 'You can un-lap yourself if you want, if you are faster.' I just went for it,\" the 22-year-old Frenchman said. \"Even if Max said the opposite, he would like to come back on what he did after the race.\"\n\nThe pair have competed since their karting days. Verstappen was evasive when they were asked how they felt about each other, Ocon more forthcoming.\n\n\"I will respond, if he cannot, I will,\" Ocon said. \"We've been racing a long time. The important thing is it stays good racing and good fun for the fans, but doesn't go over the top.\"\n\nFour-time world champion Vettel has had altercations in the past with Verstappen and former teammate Mark Webber.\n\n\"We are here to fight for something that means the world to us. For people watching, it's a show. For people reporting about the show, it's a job. For us it's a job, but it's our lives,\" Vettel said. \"Emotions are part of sports.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That's just who they are.\"\n\nThe Tigers (7-4, 3-4 Southeastern Conference) have a different primary defensive mission than most recent Iron Bowls. There's no stop-the-run-and-you-stop-Bama mentality.\n\nIt's more about trying to find some way to contain Tagovailoa and his dangerous targets led by wide receivers Jerry Jeudy and Henry Ruggs III and tight end Irv Smith Jr. And then figure out a way to deal with the runners, too.\n\nAuburn beat Jalen Hurts & Co. last season by holding the Tide to 103 passing yards. Jarrett Stidham outplayed Hurts, who did run for 82 yards.\n\nAlabama hasn't lost since, with Tagovailoa coming off the bench to lead a national title game comeback against Georgia.\n\nTagovailoa is a Heisman Trophy contender with a school-record 31 touchdown passes against just two interceptions. He has thrown for 2,865 yards and is the nation's top-rated passer.\n\n\"You can tell they feel like they can call anything and Tagovailoa can make it right and most of the time he does it,\" Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said.\n\nIt will be the first Iron Bowl start for Tagovailoa, a left-hander from Hawaii. He has gained some notion of the game's significance during his time in Tuscaloosa.\n\n\"When you grow up in Alabama, I've heard, you're either an Auburn fan or an Alabama fan,\" he said. \"It's going to be packed this game, I know that. but it's not like we haven't had an opportunity to go into this game and try to perform.\"\n\nTagovailoa has come back to Earth some after a torrid start to the season that had him widely regarded as the Heisman front-runner .\n\nHe passed for just 164 yards against Mississippi State and threw an interception on his second straight Saturday after going his first nine games without one.\n\nNow, he has the Iron Bowl and the SEC championship game against No. 5 Georgia to try to improve his Heisman candidacy.\n\nAll that film study by Davis showed him a guy who's accurate, knows the game and is \"a fierce competitor.\" Tagovailoa forces defenses to disguise coverages and try to keep him guessing as much as possible.\n\n\"You can tell he reads defenses pretty well,\" the Auburn linebacker said. \"If you show him what you're going to do, it's going to be a long night, I can tell you that.\n\n\"You can tell sometimes that he has the freedom at the line of scrimmage to check plays and get the offense in a good look, according to what the defense is showing.\"\n\nAnd Auburn defenders know that the key to helping pull off an upset is to slow down Tagovailoa and his collection of receivers.\n\nAlabama still has a formidable running game led by Damien Harris, Najee Harris and Josh Jacobs. But they've been more complimentary players to Tagovailoa's passing than the central offensive figures.\n\n\"They have a really good passing offense,\" Auburn defensive tackle Dontavius Russell said. \"In the past, there were times where you knew if you stopped the run, you would be successful. But I think they're a little more balanced, and it just presents that much more of a challenge.\"\n\nEven Tagovailoa's Auburn counterpart, Stidham, has been impressed on and off the field. The two met at the Elite 11 camp in California over the summer.\n\n\"I got to be around him a little bit,\" Stidham said. \"I got to know him. Great dude. Obviously a great football player. He's being doing really well. It doesn't surprise me.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Defense may be in short supply when No. 5 Georgia, coming off its second-most total yards in school history, plays Georgia Tech, which has its triple-option offense on a roll.\n\nNeither coach seems to think it'll be possible to slow down the other team in Saturday's state rivalry game.\n\nGeorgia Tech coach Paul Johnson shook his head when reviewing the Bulldogs' 701 total yards in their 66-27 win over UMass last week.\n\n\"Watching that tape from a week ago, I'm not sure we could do that to our scout team,\" Johnson said. \"They looked unstoppable. Maybe they'll let us play with 12 on defense.\"\n\nGeorgia (10-1) is averaging almost 40 points per game , and a larger role for dual-threat backup quarterback Justin Fields provides new worries for Georgia Tech's defense.\n\nGeorgia Tech (7-4) has won four straight and boasts the nation's top rushing offense. As always, the Yellow Jackets' biggest advantage is their spread-option offense is unique among Power Five teams.\n\nEvery week, opposing coaches moan about the difficulty of attempting to prepare for Georgia Tech's option attack in only one week. No opponent can find scout team players who can imitate the speed and efficiency with which the Yellow Jackets, led by senior quarterback TaQuon Marshall , run the option.\n\n\"No, you can't practice it every week,\" said Georgia coach Kirby Smart. \"We've got too much stuff to do. We try to work on it in the off week, we work on it in the offseason, we work on it during the season on some Mondays when we feel like we've got a simpler game plan for whoever we're playing. But it's hard to do every week.\"\n\nSmart said the challenge of defending Marshall's runs and lightning-quick option pitches seems almost unfair.\n\n\"You've got to remember they're doctorate experts in it and we're one week a year,\" Smart said. \"So you've got to be smart about what you do and you've got to sell your team on being able to play the right way against it.\"\n\nUnfair? Georgia has won seven of 10 games in the series since Johnson and his spread-option scheme arrived in Atlanta in 2008. The Bulldogs took a lopsided 38-7 win at Georgia Tech last year.\n\nGeorgia's 2017 defense, led by speedy linebacker Roquan Smith, had a wealth of players who had experience against the option.\n\nMarshall knows the Bulldogs are leaning on more newcomers on defense this year.\n\n\"I don't think they're as good as they were last year defensively,\" Marshall said. \"I think they had a lot of guys that went to the next level that contributed a lot last year. I mean, I still think they have a pretty good defense but I don't think they're as stacked on defense as they were last year.\"\n\nGeorgia still ranks 13th in the nation in total defense.\n\nGeorgia Tech ranks only 42nd in total defense but has made good use of its 24 takeaways, more than twice its total of 10 last season.\n\nJohnson says his defense just has to give the Georgia Tech offense a chance. Last year the Yellow Jackets' offense spent too much time on the sideline.\n\n\"The thing that sticks out about last year's game to me is we ran 53 plays,\" Johnson said. \"That's been the thing for us the last two weeks, we can't get off the field (on defense). That's what we usually do to other people.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) explore the World Wide Web in \"Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2.\" USA TODAY\n\nYou didn\u2019t think Disney would get all its princesses together without them saving the day, did you?\n\nSnow White, Cinderella, Moana and the rest have a major movie moment welcoming young Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) into their sorority in the animated sequel \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d (in theaters now). But the princesses also come back in the action-packed climax, which leads to a couple of fun midcredits scenes to keep the film's online-culture jokes coming.\n\nSpoiler alert! We're discussing plot points integral to the end of 'Ralph Breaks the Internet,' so beware if you haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\n...\n\n\u2026\n\n...\n\nTHIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING. (And also a fine time for a GIF of Ralph and Vanellope careening through wi-fi cable.)\n\nWe chatted with directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston to break down that fun finale:\n\nVanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman, center bottom) shares a selfie with her fellow Disney princesses in the sequel \"Ralph Breaks the Internet.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nGirls just want to have fun \u2013 and also rescue the 'big, strong man.\u2019\n\nWhen Vanellope meets the princesses during the \u201cWreck-It Ralph\u201d sequel, Rapunzel asks her, \u201cDo people assume all your problems got solved because a big, strong man showed up?\u201d They welcome her to the posse when she answers to the affirmative, a situation that gets flipped at the end when the girl squad teams up to save Ralph (John C. Reilly) from a Godzilla-sized Ralph virus made up of thousands of little Ralphs. The good guys win \u2013 Moana (Auli\u2019i Cravalho) gets the knowing line, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d \u2013 and the heroic shenanigans wind up with Ralph in a gown in bed a la \"Sleeping Beauty.\" \u201cThis dress isn\u2019t for a big boy,\u201d he says.\n\nHaving the princesses do Ralph a solid was \u201can early idea,\u201d Johnston says, though it wasn\u2019t until late in the game \u201cwhen we actually figured out that Rube Goldberg thing of how each of them is going to use their own power and actually do it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s always room for milkshakes and pancakes.\n\nThe first end-credit scene is a small variation on one of the most popular bits from the first trailer: Ralph and Vanellope find their way into a \u201cPancake Milkshake\u201d mobile game where Ralph loves feeding pancakes to a bunny. Too much, in fact, and the results are rather, well, explosive.\n\nMovie trailers often feature sequences that don\u2019t make it into the final cut, yet \u201cit was one of those things where if we had to bet money on it, we would have said, \u2018This 100 percent is staying in the movie,\u2019 \u201d Moore says. However, after the trailer came out, the filmmakers realized it didn\u2019t fit in the story any longer, \"no matter where we tried to kind of crowbar it in.\u201d Making things more complicated: Disney had started making plush dolls of the bunny and his kitty counterpart from the game.\n\n\u201cThat's when Phil came up with the idea of making it a post-credit scene,\u201d Moore says. \u201cAnd then playing it pretty much in its entirety so no one could say it wasn't in the film. Like, 'Don't be mad!\u2019 \u201d\n\nRalph (voiced by John C. Reilly, left) gets to do his own cover of Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nFace it, you\u2019ve just been Wreck Rolled.\n\nAt the very end of the credits, the words \u201cFrozen 2 Sneak Peek\u201d are emblazoned on the screen, teasing footage of the hugely anticipated \u201cFrozen\u201d sequel that's out this time next year. It\u2019s not a stretch to think that Disney would put the first trailer on a major holiday release such as \u201cRalph,\u201d but, sorry, young 'uns: Instead of Anna, Elsa, Olaf or even Kristoff, Ralph comes in dancing and warbling Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d for a variation on Rickrolling called the \u201cWreck Roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck getting that song out of your head,\u201d Ralph says. \u201cIt\u2019s a real earwig.\u201d\n\nAlthough Rickrolling hasn\u2019t been a thing for a while, it was one of the first ideas they had for the movie, Moore says, \u201cand it just never fit organically into the story.\u201d\n\nWe were sure that @RickAstley would love our very own #WreckRoll. We were wrong...at first. #RalphBreaksTheInternetpic.twitter.com/3JFxZ7pajm \u2014 Ralph Breaks the Internet (@wreckitralph) November 20, 2018\n\nParents will get the joke, and filmmakers figured Ralph's inherent goofiness would overtake any hard feelings about new \u201cFrozen\u201d footage that doesn't materialize. (It kind of goes against the whole \u201cNever gonna let you down\u201d lyric, if we\u2019re being honest.)\n\n\u201cMy kids don't know it,\u201d Johnson says of the Rickrolling meme. \u201cThey're 6 and 8 and just think it's hilarious that Ralph is dancing and singing.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/22/ralph-breaks-internet-disney-princesses-spoilers/2076425002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Charles Curtis, Steven Ruiz", "title": "NFL picks against the spread, Week 12: Can the Vikings bounce back against the Packers?", "description": "Our experts break down the NFL\u2019s Week 12 slate.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/nfl-picks-against-the-spread-week-12-betting-odds-spreads-predictions", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/usatsi_11261414.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:51:06Z", "content": "Week 11 is in the books and Week 12 is here, so For The Win s Charles Curtis and Steven Ruiz return to make their NFL picks.

It might be time to reshape our perceptions of teams as we head down the home stretch. Vegas clearly has.\n\nCharles: A stalemate with Steven. Still 13 games back of him and two under .500, though.\n\nNOTE: The Titans-Texans spread wasn\u2019t posted as of Thursday morning.\n\nBears at Lions (+2)\n\nSteven: Lions\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely short week for the Bears, who just played on Sunday night and are now playing the early Thursday game. This is a schedule loss.\n\nCharles: Lions\n\nI assume Chase Daniel will be the starter, and while my faith in the Bears defense has proven to work in recent weeks, I\u2019ll take the home team for some short week Thanksgiving magic.\n\nRedskins at Cowboys (-7)\n\nSteven: Redskins\n\nSeven points?!?! The Cowboys are favored by a whole touchdown? Nope. They don\u2019t score enough to justify that margin and I don\u2019t think Colt McCoy is much of a downgrade from Alex Smith.\n\nCharles: Cowboys\n\nAnother backup QB situation: Do I back Colt McCoy or a surging Cowboys squad? I\u2019ll go with Ezekiel Elliott to have another big game against a tough Redskins defense.\n\nFalcons at Saints (-8)\n\nSteven: Saints\n\nI said it last week: I\u2019m not picking against the Saints until they stop covering. That hasn\u2019t happened in a while and I don\u2019t expect it to happen on Thursday. The Falcons offense is good, sure, but the Saints might drop 50 on that defense.\n\nCharles: Saints\n\nThis seems small to me with the way the Saints are playing lately. I know Matt Ryan threw for five touchdowns the last time these two teams met, but New Orleans is a different team now.\n\n49ers at Buccaneers (-3)\n\nSteven: Buccaneers\n\nJameis Winston is better than he gets credit for \u2026 even from Vegas. I\u2019m not trusting Nick Mullens on the road against a decent Bucs team, whose record isn\u2019t really reflective of its talent level.\n\nCharles: Buccaneers\n\nJameis Winston uses his second starting opportunity to prove he can beat bad teams. I think the Niners run the ball all day with success but come up short.\n\nGiants at Eagles (-7)\n\nSteven: Giants\n\nThe Eagles are going to win this game. I have no doubt in my mind about that. BUT \u2026 they haven\u2019t scored enough points this season to convince me to eat seven points.\n\nCharles: Giants\n\nDid you see what the Eagles defense did last week? Nothing. And while the Giants are absolutely not the Saints, Eli Manning will be able to take advantage of Philly\u2019s terrible secondary and cover.\n\nPatriots at Jets (+10.5)\n\nSteven: Patriots\n\nI\u2019m done betting against the Patriots this season \u2014 even if they let me down against the Titans. The same won\u2019t happen against a Jets team that really has no incentive to win. And Bill Belichick has had two weeks to prepare for a rookie quarterback.\n\nCharles: Patriots\n\nComing off a bye, Bill Belichick wants to make a statement to the league that the Pats are just fine. So he puts up 40-plus on the road in a blowout.\n\nSeahawks at Panthers (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Seahawks\n\nThe Panthers are trending down on both sides of the ball and the Seahawks are headed in the opposite direction. They\u2019ll do whatever they want against this Carolina defense and I\u2019m not sure the Panthers offense, which isn\u2019t even playing its best guys, will score enough to cover this one.\n\nCharles: Panthers\n\nTwo teams I can\u2019t trust either way, so I take the home team using the two sweetest words in the English language: Default.\n\nJaguars at Bills (+2.5)\n\nSteven: Jaguars\n\nI was fully ready to pick the Bills, but that line is just too small for me to do it. This is going to be a 10-9 kind of game, so I\u2019ll take the points.\n\nCharles: Jaguars\n\nCan\u2019t we just choose not to even bet on this? Fine. I\u2019ll hope that the Jags\u2019 defense completely shuts down Josh Allen.\n\nRaiders at Ravens (-12)\n\nSteven: Ravens\n\nLamar Jackson was a little better in the pocket in his first start than I expected, and this week he\u2019ll have even more time to dissect the defense against a struggling Raiders pass rush.\n\nCharles: Ravens\n\nIT\u2019S LAMAR JACKSON TIME LET\u2019S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\nBrowns at Bengals (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Browns\n\nYeah, I have officially given up on this Bengals team that looks lost without A.J. Green. I know the Browns can\u2019t win on the road, but that\u2019s going to change eventually, right?\n\nCharles: Bengals\n\nDid you know the Browns have lost 25 straight road games? Absurd. I think they keep this close, but Cincy wins by a field goal.\n\nCardinals at Chargers (-13.5)\n\nSteven: Cardinals\n\nThe Chargers are the better team, but 13.5 points is a lot to cover against any NFL team. Even the Cardinals. Their defense will keep them within two touchdowns.\n\nCharles: Chargers\n\nLos Angeles should win this one with ease, but I hesitated with this one: They don\u2019t really have a home-field advantage these days to justify such a humongous spread, even against the Cards.\n\nDolphins at Colts (-9.5)\n\nSteven: Dolphins\n\nYikes. As much as I like this young Colts team and Andrew Luck, they have no business being favored by that many points. And Ryan Tannehill\u2019s return should give the battered Dolphins offense a boost.\n\nCharles: Colts\n\nI\u2019ll keep riding Andrew Luck and a defense that\u2019s good enough to keep the Fins in check.\n\nSteelers at Broncos (+3)\n\nSteven: Steelers\n\nPittsburgh wasn\u2019t nearly as sharp as I expected last week. But that tends to happen to the Steelers. In fact, those are the type of games they\u2019ve lost in the past. And, typically, they bounce back from them and that\u2019s what I expect to happen in Denver. The Broncos need to get pressure on the quarterback to have defensive success and that\u2019s just not going to happen against one of the league\u2019s best lines.\n\nCharles: Steelers\n\nI don\u2019t get this spread at all. Is it just because Pittsburgh will play in thin air? I know I said last week the Broncos win a lot of close games, but the Steelers are flying high right now.\n\nPackers at Vikings (-2.5)\n\nSteven: Packers\n\nNeither of these teams is as good as we thought they\u2019d be. I\u2019m really just going with the better quarterback here.\n\nCharles: Vikings\n\nI feel like this is a bet on the coaches given how both teams are all over the place right now. And that means there\u2019s no way I can put money on Mike McCarthy over Mike Zimmer."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Doug Stanglin, USA TODAY", "title": "Trump tweets on a 'mean & nasty world,' unsafe judges, and, yes, Thanksgiving", "description": "Trumps tweets about 'nasty world,' bad judges, and, yes, Thanksgiving", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/22/trumps-tweets-nasty-world-bad-judges-and-yes-thanksgiving/2085366002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/8f128576-c6a0-4eb2-a845-bee0b21e33ff/8f128576-c6a0-4eb2-a845-bee0b21e33ff_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:36:56Z", "content": "President Donald Trump got his holiday tweet-a-thon rolling early on Thursday with a Thanksgiving Day reminder that it\u2019s a \u201cmean &amp; nasty world out there\u201d before charging that some judges are making the country unsafe.

To celebrate Thanksgiving, here are the 32 Thanksgiving traditions that best represent each NFL team.\n\nDallas Cowboys \u2013 Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade\n\nAn annual tradition of overinflation (floats in New York, egos in Dallas), fans who give up their Thanksgivings to watch an event that\u2019s not especially interesting and a cranky old owner who sees the light when the real Kris Kringle begins working in his toy department. Wait, that last part might only apply to Miracle of 34th Street.\n\nNew York Giants \u2013 When it\u2019s a potluck and the one dynamite cook in the group brings a tremendous dish and you have to act like the other food is okay so as not to hurt feelings\n\nThat\u2019s Saquon Barkley and the rest of the Giants\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles \u2013 Brined turkey\n\nThe \u201cit\u201d thing of 2017 is now pass\u00e9 in 2018.\n\nWashington Redskins \u2013 Not fighting over the wishbone\n\nI think the Redskins have had enough of broken bones this week.\n\nChicago Bears \u2013 Turducken\n\nIf John Madden were still with us (calling games on Thanksgiving, that is) to which team would he most want to hand out the various legs and strange cuts of meat inside his famed turducken? It has to the Bears, right? And chances are he\u2019d just have given the whole thing to Khalil Mack.\n\nDetroit Lions \u2013 Watching Lions games on Thanksgiving\n\nLike some people attending Thanksgiving dinners, watching the Lions on the fourth Thursday of November is done more out of obligation than desire, sort of like watching the Lions on every day that isn\u2019t Thanksgiving.\n\nGreen Bay Packers \u2013 Watching A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\n\nBecause Charlie Brown kicking with Lucy pulling away the football is still probably more accurate than Mason Crosby was in that Lions game.\n\nMinnesota Vikings \u2013 An $84 turkey\n\nAfter success last year with a two-dollar turkey, Minnesota decided that paying 47 times as much was sure to give the team a bump from the NFC championship to, I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s 47 times better than that?\n\nAtlanta Falcons \u2013 A burned turkey\n\nThe past 21 months in the lives of the Atlanta Falcons. 1) leading Super Bowl LI by a score of 28-3 and losing; 2) rebounding well to make the 2017 playoffs and having a chance to knock off the eventual champs in the divisional round but failing on four tries at the goal line; 3) having the same exact thing happen in this year\u2019s season opener rematch; 4) starting 1-4; 5) rebound to 4-4; 5) then suffering two ugly loses to the Browns and Cowboys. Atlanta\u2019s turkey didn\u2019t just burn, the son of a gun went up in flames.\n\nCarolina Panthers \u2013 Grits\n\nAlways solid, always underrated. Since 2012, who\u2019s finished higher in the standings \u2013 the almighty Saints with Drew Brees and genius Sean Payton, or the little ol\u2019 Panthers with their amazing quarterback who never gets enough love? Carolina has finished better in 3 of the 4 seasons in which the teams didn\u2019t tie.\n\nNew Orleans Saints \u2013 I don\u2019t know, something with Emeril\n\nSay \u201cBam!\u201d for every time Sean Payton leaves Drew Brees in the game to throw stat-padding yards and touchdowns that\u2019ll boost his MVP candidacy.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers \u2013 Crab legs\n\nCrab legs, it should be noted, are a perfectly acceptable turkey substitute.\n\nArizona Cardinals \u2013 Passing the rolls\n\nYou know when you\u2019re passing the plates around the table and you invariably get stuck holding the worst dish while a traffic jam build up behind your dad as he tries out new jokes on unsuspecting family members? The Cardinals see that as an opportunity. Their only two wins this year are against the worst team in the rotation \u2013 the 49ers, aka the canned cranberry sauce of the NFL.\n\nLos Angeles Rams \u2013 Eating a second Thanksgiving dinner around 8 p.m.\n\nEven when the day/game is over, there\u2019s no need to take your foot off the gas.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers \u2013 Subpar tiramisu\n\nThe 49ers know how to deal with overrated, expensive, Italian disappointments.\n\nSeattle Seahawks \u2013 People who serve lamb instead of turkey\n\nThere is no definition of seahawk in the Oxford English Dictionary, not even \u201cSuper Bowl champion football team that blows its back-to-back chances by keeping the ball out of the hands of the best short-yardage running back of his time and thus splintering the locker room in what would be the death knell for the dynasty that wasn\u2019t.\u201d Similarly, there\u2019s no Thanksgiving without turkey. It\u2019s part of the essence of the day. If seahawk doesn\u2019t mean anything, then a day without turkey doesn\u2019t either. And I don\u2019t even like turkey! I\u2019d prefer lamb! But we\u2019re not animals; I respect the traditions, eat a bunch of carbs at dinner and then top it off with a late-night run to Taco Bell.\n\nBuffalo Bills \u2013 Going radio silent\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way to keep away an unwanted guest? Radio silence. Off the grid. No communicado. If the Bills can avoid calls, not return texts, stay off social media and, above all, not post IG pics of their Thanksgiving feast, then there\u2019s no way Nathan Peterman can come crash the party.\n\nMiami Dolphins \u2013 Leftovers\n\nBrock Osweiler. Danny Amendola. Frank Gore. Kenny Stills. Kiko Alonso. Even Ryan Tannehill and Cameron Wake. The Dolphins are basically a team of leftovers.\n\nNew England Patriots \u2013 Watching old home movies\n\nGiven Bill Belichick\u2019s extensive back catalog of videos of walk-throughs and opposing sideline gyrations, it only stands to reason that he calls everybody into a dark room to watch old family films after dessert, like my father-in-law does when he wants to show me my wife\u2019s fourth-grade basketball prowess. Prowess means getting rejected by the rim on a layup, right?\n\nNew York Jets \u2013 Asking \u201cis the food done yet?\u201d\n\nAn appropriate question for both the yams in the oven and Todd Bowles\u2019 time on the sideline.\n\nBaltimore Ravens \u2013 Avoiding family members\n\nThough the Ravens aren\u2019t exactly in disarray, the Lamar Jackson/Joe Flacco quarterback situation, John Harbaugh\u2019s (theoretically) impending exit and a No. 1 defense trying to stay calm as a mediocre offense has only been good enough to nab a 5-5 record makes the Ravens locker room seems to be in a sort of disarray. It\u2019s like when you successfully avoid talking to you aunt\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d during the early football game but then are seated right next to him at dinner. And the worst part is that neither of you have any Super Bowl rings to ease the awkwardness.\n\nCincinnati Bengals \u2013 The dish nobody likes, but nobody hates\n\nYour aunt \u2013 well, she\u2019s not technically your aunt but you call her \u201caunt\u201d anyway \u2013 brings a cranberry chutney to dinner every year and nobody eats it. You feel bad, so every now and then you indulge and tell her it\u2019s good but, at the end of the day, it\u2019s still been 16 years of mediocrity.\n\nCleveland Browns \u2013 Unspoken relief at a usual presence not being at the table\n\nYou can\u2019t sit around the table and talk about how happy you are that your sister\u2019s ex-boyfriend is no longer at Thanksgiving to douche it up by talking about his blackout nights in Vegas or how he saw E from Entourage at the Clevelander, but everybody knows how great his absence is for the family \u2013 kinda like the Brows with Hue Jackson.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers \u2013 Tradition for the sake of tradition\n\nIn a tradition-rich franchise that\u2019s been owned by the same family for its entire 85-year existence and has only had three coaches since 1969, it stands to reason that every Thanksgiving is the same in Pittsburgh, meaning that Mike Tomlin just walks the streets indiscriminately tripping people.\n\nHouston Texans \u2013 Your Uncle Terry\n\nJust as the Texans have won seven-straight games, Terry has won seven-straight Thanksgivings, if the criteria for winning Thanksgiving is \u201chaving too much wine and making a slightly inappropriate comment about Carrie Underwood and whoever is singing the national anthem at the Cowboys game.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis Colts \u2013 Rustic meals\n\nWhen Abraham Lincoln announced a \u201cnational day of Thanksgiving\u201d during the Civil War, Union troops were served 400,000 pounds of ham, canned peaches, apples, cake and, weirdly, an unspoken amount of turkey. If you\u2019re going to boast the 200 tons of ham, the least you could do is provide a turkey tally, no? Capt. Andrew Luck was surely very welcoming of the feast and almost certainly included it in one of his \u201cDearest Mother\u201d letters.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars \u2013 Tofurkey\n\nThe Jags have been so toothless this season I\u2019d just assumed they\u2019d tuned vegetarian.\n\nTennessee Titans \u2013 Carrots\n\nIf served, carrots (however they\u2019re prepared) are a fine dish. But, if your dinner is like my dinner and your mom forgets about one of her 35 dishes every year, the carrots are often the culprit, ultimately forgettable. Ask yourself: If the Titans were put on a bye from Week 6 through Week 10, how long would it take you to notice they hadn\u2019t played? Unless you\u2019re a Titans fan, the answer is never. Never.\n\nDenver Broncos \u2013 Going somewhere new for dinner\n\nGrandma has had Thanksgiving dinner for 30 years and it\u2019s your favorite meal of the year. Succulent turkey, creamy mashed potatoes, stuffing of a perfect consistency, sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top, a Jello dish that you\u2019re convinced came from heaven and the pies \u2013 oh, the pies. Apple, cherry, pumpkin, lemon meringue and the one that you can\u2019t identify but is the best of all. Then, one day, your sister says she wants to have Thanksgiving at her house. It\u2019s not her serving Stovetop stuffing that\u2019s the problem (though it doesn\u2019t help); it\u2019s that she messes up Stovetop stuffing. Badly. Anyway, that\u2019s the Broncos quarterback situation after John Elway.\n\nKansas City Chiefs \u2013 Santa Claus appearing at the end of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade\n\nAt the end of the parade, Santa comes out on his sleigh and ushers in the Christmas season. My four-year-old stands in front of the TV watching this, eyes agape, staring with a childlike wonder at the man in the red coat and with the long, white beard. It\u2019s a sense of awe I wish I could feel for even a minute. But this is how I assume Chiefs fans feel watching Patrick Mahomes every week.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers \u2013 Eating Thanksgiving dinner alone\n\nIt happens when you move to a new city and no one knows, or cares, that you\u2019re there.\n\nOakland Raiders \u2013 A catered dinner from the fanciest restaurant in town\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the meal, per se, but you could have had an equally tasty experience hiring a young chef than by overpaying a snooty old-guard cook."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "2018 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade", "description": "The annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade mounted its annual trek through the heart of Manhattan Thursday, despite record low temperatures and winds.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/nation/2018/11/22/2018-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/2085521002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/22/USAT/eea8abe6-a07d-4248-adaa-a7c4a070d9e9-AP_Thanksgiving_Parade.1.jpg?crop=4095,2303,x0,y175&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:25:47Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nThe Ronald McDonald balloon makes its way down 6th Ave. in New York during the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Nov. 22, 2018.

USA TODAY\n\nNavy running back Malcolm Perry carries the ball as Army defensive back Rhyan England (8) defends during the first quarter of the 118th Army Navy game at Lincoln Financial Field. (Photo: James Lang, James Lang-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nEach week during the season, members of the USA TODAY Sports college staff (Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Erick Smith and Eddie Timanus) will provide their answers to on an intriguing question from college football.\n\nThe penultimate weekend in college football's regular season is for rivalries. But not all rivalries are played in November. What is the best rivalry in college football?\n\nJace Evans\n\n\"The Game\" between Michigan and Ohio State is certainly a classic, and it\u2019s historically also one of the most tightly-contested rivalries. Even with Ohio State dominating the series in the 21st century (15-3 advantage), there have been a number of classic games - was the spot good? - that keep things compelling.\n\nBut it is not my favorite rivalry. That honor belongs to the Iron Bowl.\n\nNo, it's not the most consistent rivalry game, but the Iron Bowl provides the most incredible highs college football can offer - often at Alabama's expense. Punt 'Bama Punt, Cam Newton's comeback and the Kick-Six come to mind as games that punctuate what rivalries are all about. Alabama has had the edge practically forever, but Auburn fans can always hold these games over rival Tide fans' heads and Alabama fans, despite all the team's success, will never get over the losses. For those of us without a direct rooting interest, what makes these games great is the moments. Especially in the Nick Saban era, Alabama losses have become big events and its losses to Auburn particularly have stood out (\"Auburn's going to win the football game!\"). Of all rivalries the Iron Bowl seems to deliver the most memorable moments that will stand the test of time, and isn't that what we love about this sport?\n\nPaul Myerberg\n\nThe best rivalry in college football is the one between Alabama and Clemson. Most rivalries are based on real estate. Alabama and Clemson do compete in the same general area, the Southeast, and often do cross paths on the recruiting trail. But this rivalry is born wholly out of the games themselves: Alabama and Clemson is a series that is played for national championships, not bragging rights, as the two programs have put a huge spread of space between themselves and the rest of college football. There\u2019s currently nothing like it in the sport.\n\nGeorge Schroeder\n\nWhenever someone asks this, it becomes a window into the soul. What\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d becomes what you like best about college football. Is it national relevance? Is it longevity? Is it \u2013 and this is where most of us default \u2013 the magnitude of sheer hatred? And then you hear about the Iron Bowl, or The Game, or any of a number of others.\n\nBut let\u2019s take a break from the darkness. The best rivalry in college football is played in December, a week after everyone else is finished, by teams uninvolved in the Playoff chase, by players who are all-Americans in the most important ways. Here lately, it\u2019s possible the teams might not throw a pass.\n\nThe best rivalry in college football is Army-Navy.\n\nErick Smith\n\nWith some many amazing options, there's really not a wrong choice here. But part of the rivalry experience is where the games are actually played. And there is no greater environment in college football than Oklahoma and Texas in the middle of the Texas State Fair.\n\nThe stands are split evenly between crimson and burnt orange. The emotions always run high. And the results of the games have had a big impact on the history of the sport. Plus, the winner gets to trot around the Cotton Bowl with a Golden Hat.\n\nThe other aspect of a rivalry is the animosity between the two sides. The Sooners created the Horns Down gesture that has become a way to troll the Longhorns across the Big 12. West Virginia was actually penalized for twice this season for using it in celebrations.\n\nTexas has its own way to unique way to mock Oklahoma, too. Someone will mention the time of day and follow it with \"Oklahoma still sucks.\" Longhorns defensive lineman Breckyn Hager received a reprimand from the Big 12 doing exactly that during an interview after a win against Iowa State last week.\n\nJust more proof the impact of the rivalry extends to way beyond when the teams meet on the field.\n\nEddie Timanus\n\nI get this question frequently around this time of year, and my answer will never change. It will always be Army-Navy.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of justified cynicism associated with college football nowadays, but this rivalry remains what spirited competition is supposed to be about. These guys will pound on each other and fight like heck for 60 minutes. And when it\u2019s over, they\u2019ll sing each others alma maters, shake hands and know that they\u2019re all on the same side when it comes to defending the country."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "My First Performance: Zedd", "description": "While Zedd struggles to think back and remember his stage debut \u2013 his parents filmed everything for posterity.

If they can manage that, they will play Marshall at Lane Stadium on Dec. 1 trying to qualify for their 26th consecutive bowl game.\n\nThe first part doesn't figure to be as easy as history might suggest.\n\n\"They're both extremely important, without a doubt,\" Hokies defensive coordinator Bud Foster said of the two long streaks, \"and obviously, you've got to take care of the first one to get to the next one.\"\n\nVirginia Tech brings a four-game losing streak into the game, and has lost the games by an average of 21 points. They've also had difficulty stopping the run, which could make Virginia an especially challenging opponent.\n\nThe Cavaliers are led by dual-threat quarterback Bryce Perkins, who leads the ACC and ranks 17th nationally by being responsible for 170 points (19 passing touchdowns, nine rushing TDs and one 2-point conversion pass).\n\nHe's certainly caught the attention of the Hokies coaching staff.\n\n\"The thing that jumps off the film to me about Bryce is he does not ever look like he's trying very hard,\" coach Justin Fuente said this week. \"He's such a smooth athlete, he never looks like he's straining.\"\n\nThe Hokies quarterback is Ryan Willis, and he's put up good numbers, too. Since replacing the injured Josh Jackson in the third game, he's thrown for almost 2,000 yards with 17 touchdown passes and just five interceptions.\n\nWillis, a Kansas native, has been well informed of the importance of the rivalry.\n\n\"Beating UVA is something we have to do year in and year out.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 No. 6 Oklahoma against No. 12 West Virginia gives Heisman Trophy hopefuls Kyler Murray and Will Grier the chance to make perhaps one final impression.\n\nThe Big 12's top two scoring offenses will battle Friday night for the right to go to next week's Big 12 championship game. There could be a rematch next week depending on how other games play out.\n\nThe Sooners (10-1, 7-1 Big 12, No. 6 CFP) are chasing their third-straight title along with a berth in the College Football Playoff but might need at least one team ahead of them to lose.\n\nOklahoma is the only team that West Virginia (8-2, 6-2, No. 13 CFP) hasn't defeated since joining the league in 2012. The Mountaineers also haven't gone a full season unbeaten at home since 2009.\n\nTop the Sooners on Friday night and they'll accomplish both along with another first \u2014 playing for a Big 12 title.\n\n\"It'd mean a lot. This is a big game,\" West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen said. \"Our guys feel like we're ready for it. They've whipped us before. But I feel like this is the best team that we've had.\"\n\nWest Virginia's Tony Gibson compares being a defensive coordinator in the Big 12 to \"drinking water out of a fire hose.\" And there will be plenty of worries with Oklahoma's explosive offense.\n\nThe Sooners have surpassed 290 rushing yards in five straight games. Murray is dangerous both as a passer (3,310 yards, 34 TDs) and a runner (739 yards, 10 TDs). Murray played the first series against the Mountaineers last year in place of Baker Mayfield. On the first play from scrimmage, Murray took off on a 66-yard run.\n\nOklahoma's weakness is its defense. The Sooners have allowed at least 40 points over the past three weeks. That includes 524 yards allowed last week to Kansas , which has one of the league's worst offenses.\n\nYet Oklahoma has won five straight since a 48-45 loss to Texas .\n\nTwo of West Virginia's last three games have been decided in the final seconds.\n\n\"Listen, we know the challenge,\" Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said. \"It's kind of a perfect script for us, going and playing on the road, tough environment, good football team, lot of things on the line. That's just the way we like it.\"\n\nHere are some other things to know when the Sooners and Mountaineers meet:\n\nPILING IT ON\n\nBased on past performances in Morgantown, it might take 1,000 yards of offense to decide this game.\n\nThe teams combined for 1,440 yards in 2012 when Landry Jones and Oklahoma won 50-49, 1,013 yards in 2014 in a 45-33 Sooners win, and 1,064 two years ago in Oklahoma's 56-28 victory.\n\nWIN AND YOU'RE IN\n\nThe winner will clinch a berth in the Dec. 1 league championship game in Arlington, Texas. If the Sooners lose, they'll get the second spot if No. 11 Texas loses at Kansas. West Virginia gets the second spot with a loss only if Texas loses and No. 25 Iowa State loses at home to Kansas State. Texas is in with a win over the Jayhawks.\n\nMURRAY'S TIES\n\nMurray was recruited to Texas A&M by Jake Spavital, who was the Aggies' offensive coordinator and now has the same job at West Virginia. Murray left Texas A&M after the 2015 season, which coincided with Spavital's final year.\n\nSpavital compared the similar experiences of Murray and Grier \u2014 two transfer quarterbacks who had to wait for their chance. Grier transferred from Florida to West Virginia after his freshman season in 2015.\n\n\"Now they're out there doing what they've always done,\" Spavital said. \"It's pretty impressive watching both those kids play at a high level.\"\n\nFINAL HOME GAME\n\nSeventeen West Virginia seniors will be honored before their final home game, including Grier and wide receivers David Sills and Gary Jennings. Grier has combined for 43 touchdown passes to the pair over two seasons.\n\nIMPROVING MCKOY\n\nWest Virginia running back Kennedy McKoy has scored four touchdowns in his last two games and is coming off a season-high 148 rushing yards in a 45-41 loss at Oklahoma State. Oklahoma has allowed a league-high 25 rushing touchdowns this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In his 11th season, McGee has basically gotten a basketball rebirth. \"I played against him in the last two NBA Finals and I wanted him on this team because I know what he brings,\" said James, who lobbied the Lakers to get McGee. \"It's his energy, his energy level, his ability at the rim and his ability to protect the rim. If you don't have that on your team, you're not going to have much, man. You need to have people with a high IQ, which he's got. That's why I wanted JaVale to be part of this.\" (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThere was a two-season stretch during which JaVale McGee scored a total of 141 points. He was a target of jokes, wildly misunderstood by many in the NBA, almost an afterthought of sorts whose career seemed to be closer to flaming out than taking off.\n\nAnd in those darkest days, McGee kept asking himself the same question.\n\n\"Is it over?\"\n\nThe answer now is obvious: No, it wasn't over. Fast forward, and it may just be getting started.\n\nHe's living the life that few in the NBA get to experience. He's teamed up with the best players of this generation \u2014 Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, LeBron James. He's won two championships, part of Golden State's back-to-back titles over the last two seasons. And now he's the starting center for the Los Angeles Lakers, getting a chance to play big minutes and put up numbers for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nIn his 11th season, McGee has basically gotten a basketball rebirth.\n\n\"I played against him in the last two NBA Finals and I wanted him on this team because I know what he brings,\" said James, who lobbied the Lakers to get McGee. \"It's his energy, his energy level, his ability at the rim and his ability to protect the rim. If you don't have that on your team, you're not going to have much, man. You need to have people with a high IQ, which he's got. That's why I wanted JaVale to be part of this.\"\n\nMcGee's numbers are so much better this season than what they've been. But he cringes at the notion that he's gotten better.\n\nWhat the Lakers have given him is a better chance. That's the difference. And he's certainly one of the reasons why they're off to a 10-7 start, winners in six of their last seven games.\n\nMcGee's per-36-minutes averages over his career have been remarkably similar: Never lower than 13.1 points in a full season, the majority of the time between 15 and 18 points per 36 minutes of play. But the numbers are spiking this year because he's actually getting minutes \u2014 the Lakers are starting him and playing him about 25 minutes per night, and he's responding with averages of 13.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game.\n\nHe's showing everyone else what James saw in the NBA Finals the past two years.\n\n\"He could have said get anybody,\" McGee said. \"It's just a reassuring feeling, a confidence-builder I guess, knowing that you're going into a situation wanted as an option, like you're really wanted. That's pretty dope.\"\n\nAway from the court, McGee is a very diverse person \u2014 and very private. He doesn't think much of social media, preferring to keep his inner circle very small and very close.\n\nHe makes music on his computer and is serious about that as a vocation. He's devoted to philanthropy, having built some wells to bring clean water to parts of Uganda. And the irony there is that McGee is a native of Flint, Michigan, a place that has been dealing with a clean-water crisis since 2014 \u2014 but his efforts in Uganda are coincidental, since he started that quest before the Flint situation became known.\n\n\"It's all such a humbling experience,\" McGee said.\n\nThe game has sufficiently humbled McGee at times as well.\n\nIn those 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons, when McGee was barely playing because of ongoing issues related to a stress fracture in his left leg, he wondered if his career was coming to a premature end. His physical game was failing, his mental game was in trouble as well, and basketball stopped seeming fun.\n\n\"Of course, I had all those feelings, all those thoughts,\" McGee said. \"But what overshadowed all that was me just not being willing to prepare for the worst. I'm just going to keep preparing for the best. So I just kept working like I wasn't hurting, and it ended up being dealing with pain and the pain going away and then realizing the pain isn't even there anymore.\"\n\nHis game has taken off since.\n\nThe funny thing about McGee is that he came into the NBA with the skills that big men now are supposed to have \u2014 stretch defenses, make shots from the perimeter, have some guard-esque skills. That's the player he was at Nevada before getting picked by Washington at the No. 18 spot of the 2008 NBA Draft.\n\nBut when he entered the NBA, the mandate basically was for a 7-footer like himself to rebound and set screens. In today's NBA, his versatility is almost required for a big. The Lakers rave about all the things fans notice and a lot of more about what might not be so noticable \u2014 like his footwork, his speed down the floor, his hands and his cutting.\n\n\"He's been great,\" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \"He's been professional. He's taking care of himself. He's vocal in the locker rooms and the huddles, he's been producing for us, obviously his shot-blocking has been a big part of us having some success on defense. We're very pleased with JaVale.\"\n\nDue respect to Walton, he'll never be McGee's favorite coach.\n\nHis mom has that title on lock.\n\nPamela McGee won two NCAA titles as a player at USC and an Olympic gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, was the No. 2 pick in the 1997 WNBA Draft and is in the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\"I used to be Pamela McGee,\" she said. \"Now I'm JaVale McGee's mama.\"\n\nWhile many lost faith in her oldest child, she never did. The two titles with the Warriors probably meant as much to Pamela McGee as they did to her son. And now she's back in familiar surroundings \u2014 Los Angeles, where she played, sitting near the floor to watch Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. She has flashbacks when James and her kid team up to do something spectacular, like those \"Showtime\" Lakers did.\n\n\"There's an African proverb that says the teacher will become the student and the student will become the teacher,\" she said. \"I think we're there. I was a very strict mother, but now, it doesn't come from my mouth, it comes from my heart. I'm just extremely proud. Not too many mothers get this opportunity.\"\n\nThere are goals that McGee still has to accomplish in his career.\n\nHe wants to be an All-Star. He wants to average a double-double. He wants to win a blocked-shot title. He's turning 31 in January, is in great condition and knows he could play several more seasons. And as this season goes along, McGee knows part of his job will be sharing wisdom he's collected in his two championship runs with those younger Lakers who don't know what the postseason is about yet.\n\n\"We're having a blast,\" McGee said. \"And when we start figuring it out, you're going to see a team that's having so much fun.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This story discusses Ivan Drago's full character arc in 'Creed II.' Stop reading now if you haven't seen the movie yet and don't want to know.\n\nThree decades after falling to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) in \"Rocky IV,\" disgraced Russian killing machine Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is back for revenge in \"Creed II.\"\n\nIt's a meal best served after many cold Ukrainian winters.\n\nWith his brutal son Viktor (Florian Munteanu) doing the fighting, ice-hearted Drago challenges Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the son of boxing legend Apollo Creed, who was literally killed by Drago in the \"Rocky IV\" ring.\n\nLundgren, 61, says \"Creed II\" (in theaters now) pays homage to his classic villain, before it changes the course of Drago's history.\n\n\"'Rocky IV' was like, 'We're in a nuclear stand-off with Russia, we need this bad guy without layers,'\" says Lundgren. \"I was pleased to play a character with a little more emotion and more rounded than the first.\"\n\n** Seriously, this is your last chance to stop reading.

Again,' \" says Caple. \"We had to find a way that really sung.\"\n\nAfter trying many variations, it landed with Drago telling Rocky: \"My son will break your boy.\" Drago also shoves Viktor's mouthguard into his jaws to push him during the Adonis fight, saying, \"You must break him.\"\n\nIt's been a while: Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago stares down Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa in \"Creed II.\" (Photo: BARRY WETCHER/MGM/WARNER BROS.)\n\nThe Rocky-Drago rematch actually happened, then got cut.\n\nAfter Viktor pummeled Adonis in the film's first charity bout, Caple filmed a hospital showdown between Rocky and Drago.

Things have not quite reached that level of urgency at Michigan for Jim Harbaugh against Ohio State. But it\u2019s getting there. (AP Photo/Annie Rice, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTom Osborne began one of the great coaching careers in college football history with five straight losses in the most important game on Nebraska's schedule.\n\nFrom 1973-77, Osborne's Cornhuskers went 46-13 overall but 0-5 against Oklahoma.\n\n\"It was probably getting to the point where it was almost a one-game season,\" Osborne recalled this week. \"We could win a lot of games, nine, 10 whatever, but if you didn't beat Oklahoma it was not a good year. Fortunately, I was able to survive that.\"\n\nSome of the game's most successful coaches have been labeled \"can't win the big one\" because of repeated failures against rivals. Coming up short in the game that matters most to your fans can tempt a coach to question everything \u2014 from his Xs and Os to his Jimmys and Joes.\n\nThings have not quite reached that level of urgency at Michigan for Jim Harbaugh. But it's getting there. Harbaugh is 0-3 against rival Ohio State as coach of the Wolverines heading into Saturday's latest installment of the Big Ten's biggest rivalry. No. 4 Michigan has lost six straight overall to No. 10 Ohio State.\n\nAs usual, The Game will help decide the Big Ten championship. And as has often been the case, there are national championship implications for both teams.\n\n\"To us, this is as big as it gets. Doesn't get any bigger,\" Harbaugh said. \"Most important thing in our football lives. For the whole 365 days.\"\n\nFrom the early 1970s through the 1980s, Nebraska-Oklahoma was about as big as it got in college football. Sooners-Huskers was a top-10 matchup 15 times from 1971-88. Two other times, one of the teams was ranked 11th and the other was top 10. The game was usually for Big Eight supremacy and often a shot at the national championship was on the line.\n\nBarry Switzer's Sooners owned Osborne's Huskers for the first five seasons of their careers, winning each meeting, including three blowouts.\n\nOsborne said he realized defending Oklahoma's wishbone offense required more than just a week's worth of preparation. Nebraska started dedicating a period of each Monday practice to OU's offense throughout the season. Osborne said it became impossible to emphasize the game any more to the players. If anything, he would have to temper their enthusiasm and not let past failures affect the confidence of both coaches and players. Nebraska's issues with Oklahoma, Osborne said, were more physical than mental.\n\n\"I think it can get in your head, but I think probably the biggest difficulty we had was just pure athleticism,\" Osborne said. \"Sometimes losing can be very instructional.\"\n\nOsborne started looking for more mobile quarterbacks like Oklahoma's and introduced the triple-option into his I-formation offense.\n\n\"Oklahoma wasn't necessarily our enemy. They were our friend because we weren't going to be able to pull them down to our level. We had to get up to their level. And eventually we got there,\" said Osborne, who finished his career 13-13 against Oklahoma, dominating the Sooners in the '90s after Switzer left for the NFL, and winning three national titles.\n\nMack Brown had his own Oklahoma problem when he was coach at Texas. By then the Big Eight had morphed into the Big 12 and the Longhorns and Sooners were playing for pole position in the Big 12 South every October.\n\nTexas lost five straight to Bob Stoops' Sooners from 2000-04 while going 52-6 against everybody else. Brown said pressure mounts exponentially in rivalry games for the team on a losing streak.\n\n\"The guys get tight,\" said Brown, who finished 7-9 against Oklahoma at Texas. \"They worry so much about being miserable. Fans being all mad at them until the next year.\"\n\nLike Osborne, Brown started working on Oklahoma all year. Texas would game plan for the Sooners without the players knowing, practicing plays the staff intended to save for Oklahoma.\n\n\"But we didn't want them to think that we were putting in plays for that game and running them a few times because we didn't think we could win with our regular stuff,\" Brown said.\n\nIn 13 seasons (1988-2000) at Ohio State, Hall of Fame coach John Cooper went 2-10-1 against Michigan. Four times, the Buckeyes were ranked in the top five when they lost to Michigan.\n\n\"Do I wish we won more? Absolutely. Yeah, you kidding me? But after the game's over there's nothing you can do about it except go out and try to recruit better players and coach better,\" said Cooper, who went 111-43-4 (.715) at Ohio State.\n\nSince Cooper was replaced by Jim Tressel in 2001, Ohio State has lost just twice to Michigan, including six straight wins since Urban Meyer took over in 2012. Meyer has been a master in rivalry games. With Florida, his teams went 16-2 against Florida State, Tennessee and Georgia. He also went 4-0 at Utah against BYU and Utah State.\n\nHarbaugh, the former Michigan quarterback who guaranteed and then delivered a victory against Ohio State in 1986, was lured back to his alma mater four years ago to close the gap between the Wolverines and Buckeyes. He has done that, going 38-12 and coming within a disputed fourth-down spot of winning at Ohio State two years ago.\n\nBut Michigan is not paying $7.5 million a year to Harbaugh for close.\n\n\"(A win) would mean so much. For our team and everybody that's for us,\" Harbaugh said. \"We know how important it is for everybody that is us.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

They are looking for their seventh straight win but will have their hands full with a 4-6 Broncos team that\u2019s much better than their record indicates. Here are five predictions though that will lead to a Steelers win over the Broncos.\n\nBeating the Broncos won\u2019t be easy for the Steelers. They\u2019ve beaten the Chargers in Los Angeles and gave both the Chiefs and the Rams a very good fight. The Broncos have plenty of weapons on both sides of the ball that are capable of game-changing plays.\n\nQuarterback Case Keenum leads the Broncos offense and has a gunslingers mentality. His top two targets, Emmanuel Sanders and Courtland Sutton, have combined for 83 receptions for over 1,200 yards and five touchdowns. Sanders is quick and shifty, while Sutton is cut from the mold of Demaryius Thomas.\n\nPhilip Lindsay and Royce Freeman lead the Broncos ground game. They have a combined 199 carries for 1,002 yards and 10 touchdowns, five each. Lindsay is a homegrown explosive back who is dangerous in the open field and averages over five yards per carry. He may be a bit smallish at 5\u20198\u2033 and 190 pounds, but he runs with surprising power. Freeman is their power back and averages just over four yards per carry.\n\nThe Broncos have the 21st ranked defense in the NFL, 25th against the run and 18th against the pass. Their front seven is led by outside linebackers Von Miller and Bradley Chubb, who have combined for 19 sacks. Chris Harris Jr. is still their top corner. Although he may be a step slower now he makes up for it with intelligent play.\n\nThe Steelers are more than capable of beating the Broncos, but if history is any indication, doing it in the mile high environment will prove to be a difficult proposition. Having said that, however, here are five predictions that will lead to a Steelers win over the Broncos."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Doug Stanglin, USA TODAY", "title": "Trumps tweets on a 'mean & nasty world,\" unsafe judges, and, yes, Thanksgiving", "description": "The president, from Mar-a-Lago, bolsters his pro-Saudi position and lashes out at judges who try to legislate about asylum for migrants.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/22/trumps-tweets-nasty-world-bad-judges-and-yes-thanksgiving/2085366002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/22/USAT/0d7c5306-a699-444b-9219-955f58c9853d-AP_Trump.JPG?crop=4271,2388,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:16:59Z", "content": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media before leaving the White House in Washington, to travel to Florida.

A lot more.\n\nThe defending American Athletic Conference champions can complete a second consecutive undefeated regular season by beating intrastate rival South Florida on Friday.\n\nNext on their list of goals is winning the AAC championship game \u2014 which they'll host on Dec. 1 \u2014 to remain in the conversation about which teams are deserving of berths in the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"From where this program's come, it's just getting started,\" quarterback McKenzie Milton said. \"I think we're just scratching the surface and UCF is going to be good for a very, very long time.\"\n\nFirst-year coach Josh Heupel, who inherited a team that went 13-0 but was left out of the CFP last season, agrees.\n\n\"This is the most unique story in college football in my opinion because it's continuing to build what it's going to be,\" Heupel said. \"Blue-blood programs were built in the 30s, 40s and 50s. We're right in the midst of what's going on here.\"\n\nAnd the rest of the country is taking notice, especially after last week's 38-13 rout of Cincinnati in a prime-time matchup capping a day in which ESPN's \"College GameDay\" broadcast from Orlando for the first time.\n\n\"Waking up in the morning ... turning the TV on and seeing it's in Orlando on UCF's campus on Memory Mall, that was unreal ... a childhood dream to me,\" senior defensive lineman Joey Connors said.\n\nThe Knights (10-0, 7-0) climbed three spots in the AP Poll this week and will face the winner of Friday's game between Houston and Memphis in the AAC title game. South Florida (7-4, 3-4) has lost four straight following a 7-0 start that propelled the Bulls into the Top 25.\n\n\"Central Florida's playing with a lot of confidence, something we don't have right now,\" South Florida coach Charlie Strong said.\n\n\"When you start winning, when you start playing with confidence, you feel like no one's going to beat you,\" Strong added. \"That's what they have going on right now.\"\n\nSome other things to know about the Knights and Bulls:\n\nI-4 RIVALRY\n\nThe schools are situated about 90 minutes apart, with Interstate 4 connecting Orlando and Tampa.\n\nThe series, which USF leads 6-3, has been dubbed the \"War on I-4.\" Since 2016, the winner has been presented with a traveling trophy that's 4-foot, 3 inches tall and weighs 160 pounds.\n\nMEMORABLE GAME\n\nUCF won a 49-42 thriller a year ago in Orlando. USF's Quinton Flowers had 605 yards total offense and the Bulls rallied to tie the score 42-all on the quarterback's 83-yard scoring pass to Darnell Solomon and a two-point conversion with 1:41 remaining.\n\nThe Knights went ahead for good when Mike Hughes returned the ensuing kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown.\n\n\"You had two teams evenly matched, and it came down to a kickoff return,\" Strong said. \"If we would have covered it better, who knows what might have happened.\"\n\nPOTENT OFFENSE\n\nMilton, eighth in Heisman Trophy balloting a year ago, has thrown for 2,577 yards and 24 touchdowns. UCF is sixth in the nation in total offense (528.9 yards per game) and scoring (43.6) and has scored at least 30 points in 23 consecutive games. That's the second-longest streak since 1936. South Florida did it 24 straight times from 2015-17.\n\nUSF has allowed 57, 41,35 and 27 in losses to Houston, Tulane, Cincinnati and Temple during its longest skid since 2013.\n\n\"It's a lot of home run balls for them,\" Strong said. \"We can't allow them to take the ball and pitch it over our heads for 60, 70-yard plays. If anything, you've got to make them drive the ball and you've got to be great in the red zone.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, file) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 With a pair of gold medals at stake, a Russian court has issued a ruling that directly challenges the authority of the International Olympic Committee and the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nThe Moscow City Court ruled Wednesday that bobsledder Alexander Zubkov, who carried the Russian flag at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Sochi Games, should still be considered an Olympic champion despite having been stripped of his medals because of doping. A CAS ruling upholding his disqualification is not enforceable in Russia, the court said.\n\nCAS, however, is the only valid arbiter for sports disputes at the games, according to the Olympic Charter. In rare instances, Switzerland's supreme court can weigh in on matters of procedure.\n\n\"The CAS decision in this case is enforceable since there was no appeal filed with the Swiss Federal Tribunal within the period stipulated,\" the IOC told The Associated Press in an email on Thursday. \"The IOC will soon request the medals to be returned.\"\n\nThe law firm representing Zubkov said the Moscow court found the CAS ruling violated Zubkov's \"constitutional rights\" by placing too much of a burden on him to disprove the allegations against him.\n\nZubkov won the two-man and four-man bobsled events at the Sochi Olympics but he was disqualified by the IOC last year. The verdict was later upheld by CAS.\n\nZubkov and his teams remain disqualified in official Olympic results, but the Moscow ruling could make it harder for the IOC to get his medals back.\n\n\"The decision issued by the Moscow court does not affect in any way the CAS award rendered ... an award which has never been challenged before the proper authority,\" CAS secretary general Matthieu Reeb told the AP.\n\n\"The fact that the CAS award is considered as 'not applicable in Russia' by the Moscow court may have local consequences but does not constitute a threat for the CAS jurisdiction globally.\"\n\nThe IOC's case against Zubkov was based on testimony from Moscow and Sochi anti-doping laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov, who said he swapped clean samples for ones from doped athletes, and forensic evidence that the allegedly fake sample stored in Zubkov's name contained more salt than could be possible in urine from a healthy human.\n\nZubkov, who says he never doped, retired after the Sochi Olympics and has since become president of the Russian Bobsled Federation. The International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation didn't respond to a request to comment.\n\nIn the two-man event, Beat Hefti and Alex Baumann of Switzerland are due to inherit the gold medal from Zubkov's team, while a Latvian squad is in line for the four-man gold medals.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A general sense of mourning lingers.\n\nIn the more than three months since 43 people were killed in the Morandi highway bridge collapse, Genoa's residents have had little to smile about.\n\nThe city derby on Sunday \u2014 the first meeting between Genoa and Sampdoria since the bridge tragedy \u2014 could provide an opportunity for some relief.\n\n\"I hope the derby can produce a smile on the faces of all of Genoa's citizens,\" Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero said.\n\nThe \"Derby della Lanterna\" \u2014 named for the port city's light house \u2014 is one of the most heated intracity matchups in Italy outside of Rome and Milan.\n\nMaking matters more critical is that both Genoa and Sampdoria are in crisis.\n\nSince Ivan Juric began his third stint as Genoa coach last month, replacing the fired Davide Ballardini, the squad has not won in four matches. The two draws and two losses over that span include a 5-0 thrashing by Inter Milan.\n\nSampdoria has done even worse with a draw and then three straight losses entering the derby \u2014 with 11 goals conceded in its last three games.\n\nStill, there have been moments of greatness.\n\nGenoa striker Krzysztof Piatek leads Serie A with nine goals, having scored all of them in the first seven rounds.\n\nAn airborne back-heel volley against Napoli in early September from veteran Sampdoria forward Fabio Quagliarella is in the running for Serie A goal of the season.\n\nBoth Genoa and Sampdoria had their opening matches in August postponed because of the bridge collapse. What caused a stretch of the bridge to give way, sending trucks and cars plunging into a dry riverbed during a heavy thunderstorm, is under investigation by prosecutors.\n\nHypotheses include possible inadequate maintenance or design flaws. The bridge was a major traffic artery for the northwestern port city and its closure has caused long detours and prompted traffic jams along old coastal roads.\n\nA cartoon image of Genoa and Sampdoria fans embracing to replace the bridge was widely shared online in August.\n\nGenoa Mayor Marco Bucci said recently that demolition of a supporting pillar on one end of the bridge should begin next month. To be demolished later is the pillar near apartment buildings, whose evacuated occupants hope to retrieve belongings.\n\nBucci said a replacement bridge should be completed by mid-2020.\n\nGenoa midfielder Romulo, who previously played for Hellas Verona and Juventus, noted that the Genoa derby has a bigger significance than others he has played in.\n\n\"In Turin, if you play for Juventus, the derby is like any other match \u2014 there's too wide of a gap between the squads,\" Romulo said. \"In Verona, the difference is felt with the fans: Chievo has very few supporters so you don't feel the tension of the derby in the week-long buildup.\n\n\"Here nobody is talking about anything else. On the streets and at the restaurant everyone keeps on stopping me asking me to beat 'la Samp.'\"\n\nFor this week, at least, people in Genoa have something else to discuss besides the bridge collapse.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 With his imposing frame, aggressive attitude and talent for scoring difficult goals, Diego Costa has rightfully earned his reputation as a terror for defenders.\n\nBut that status is in serious danger after a scoring drought in the Spanish league that dates back to February.\n\nThe 30-year-old Costa hasn't scored in nine appearances for Atletico Madrid in the league this season, partly because he has been hampered by two muscle injuries which have also cost him a place on Spain's national team.\n\nSaturday offers an ideal scenario for Costa to break out of his slump when Atletico hosts Barcelona on Saturday with the league lead on the line. Barcelona leads the competition by one point ahead of three teams, including Atletico in third place.\n\nCosta is expected to be cleared to play against Barcelona after returning to practice this week following an international break.\n\nTrue to coach Diego Simeone's emphasis on keeping a clean sheet, Atletico is in the title hunt thanks to a stingy defense that has given it six wins, five draws and one loss. The team leads the league with only eight goals allowed, while scoring 16. That contrasts with Barcelona, which has scored a league-leading 34 times and conceded 18 goals.\n\nAfter an erratic start to his career when he was loaned out to several smaller clubs, Costa found a backer when Simeone took over the team in 2011. The match was perfect. Costa gave Simeone the enforcer on the field that he needed to inspire his code of maximum effort from his players.\n\nThe result was the club's most successful era. Costa helped win the 2013 Copa del Rey title and was the driving force in attack for Atletico's 2014 league win.\n\n\"He gives us strength and energy,\" Simeone said about Costa last month. \"It is important to have his personality and force. ... He gives a boost to our fans, his teammates and our coaching staff.\"\n\nCosta returned to Atletico midway through last season after spending three years at Chelsea, where he won two Premier League titles. Despite only scoring three goals in the league, he helped Atletico win the Europa League title and finish second to Barcelona in the league.\n\nAfter scoring three goals for Spain at the World Cup, the Costa of old appeared to have resurfaced at the start of this season when he netted two goals in a 4-2 win over Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup in August. But his only other goal in any competition since then came on Sept. 18 when he scored in a 2-1 win at Monaco in the Champions League.\n\nSimeone still values Costa's contributions even when he is not scoring goals. That said, Costa's problem is not a question of lacking his scoring touch or running across inspired goalkeepers.\n\nHe is not producing the scoring chances of a top-notch striker.\n\nCosta has only managed to generate seven shots in the league this season. Teammate Antoine Griezmann has three goals from 24 shots, while Barcelona counterpart Luis Suarez has scored nine goals from 36 shots.\n\nAnd it seems that Simeone may be losing faith in the player.\n\nSimeone substituted Costa at halftime of the 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao after seeing he was incapable of threatening to score or set up a teammate.\n\nSimeone, however, doesn't have a great second option if he wants to sit Costa against Barcelona. His only other true striker is the untested Nikola Kalinic. Otherwise, he could align another playmaker like Angel Correa or forwards Victor \"Vitolo\" Machin or Gelson Martins, or just bulk up his defense to slow down Lionel Messi.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

For his final match as captain of France Davis Cup team, Yannick Noah has been as meticulous as ever. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLILLE, France (AP) \u2014 With no player standing out as a clear leader, France captain Yannick Noah chose Jeremy Chardy ahead of Lucas Pouille for the opening match of the Davis Cup final against Croatia.\n\nThe 40th-ranked Chardy, in the team only after Richard Gasquet withdrew injured, will lead defending champion France against Borna Coric on indoor clay at Pierre Mauroy Stadium on Friday.\n\nJo-Wilfried Tsonga, who's missed most of the year through injury and dropped to 259th in the rankings, will play Marin Cilic, Croatia's top player, in the second singles.\n\nPouille sealed France's victory over Belgium in last year's final and was widely expected to be playing again.\n\nNoah explained after the draw on Thursday, \"I have the feeling that in Davis Cup the one who attacks generally wins. And Jeremy is a terrific attacking player.\"\n\nAlthough he's in his first Davis Cup final, Chardy has won all three of his previous rubbers on indoor clay, and has a 2-1 record against Coric.\n\n\"I did not feel I'm the favorite,\" the 12th-ranked Coric said. \"It's 50-50. I've lost twice against Chardy. The last time on clay.\"\n\nIt's the second consecutive year Noah has taken a gamble in the final. Last year, he fielded an inexperienced pair in doubles and was rewarded by a victory that put France one point away from the title.\n\n\"It's never easy to make choices,\" Noah said. \"This one was very difficult, and subtle. The strength in this team is that we have three players capable of playing in singles.\"\n\nNoah took advantage of a new rule this year increasing the size of teams from four to five players, giving captains more leeway in selection. He said Pouille, who was born close to Lille, will be ready to play on Sunday if needed.\n\n\"Honestly, I was not surprised,\" Croatia captain Zeljko Krajan said of Noah's nominations. \"I know Yannick can sometimes pull a joker out of his pocket and I thought Chardy could be his joker this weekend.\"\n\nTsonga appears to be set up for a thrashing from Cilic.\n\nCilic qualified for the eight-man ATP Finals this month, while Tsonga returned to competitive tennis only in September after a seven-month absence due to a knee injury. But Noah said he has been impressed by Tsonga's form during France's training camp.\n\nTsonga said the prospect of playing in the final gave him an extra motivation to come back.\n\n\"When I was struggling, the only way to hang on was to think about the fabulous moments which deserve our sacrifices,\" Tsonga said. \"When I decided to return it was, among other things, because of the Davis Cup.\"\n\nCilic praised the quality of the clay court under the roof of Lille's soccer stadium but complained about the lightning and the uneven temperature across the arena.\n\n\"The light is not good at all,\" he said. \"It's difficult to see in the corners.\"\n\nNicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert, who reached the final at the ATP Finals, are scheduled to face Croatian pair Mate Pavic and Ivan Dodig in Saturday's doubles.\n\nIn Sunday's reverse singles, Chardy is set to face Cilic, and Tsonga to take on Coric.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Here are 5 the For The Win staff thinks are totally overrated.\n\nMashed Potatoes\n\nI realize it\u2019s blasphemous to criticize one of the staples of Thanksgiving, but I\u2019m going to do it anyway: Mashed potatoes are kind of trash. Well, on their own at least. Pour some gravy on a mound of mashed potatoes, and then you\u2019ve got something. But dry mashed potatoes? Borderline inedible. It\u2019s time we admit that mashed potatoes are nothing more than a vessel for the real star of the classic combination. Its gravy, which has a similarly one-sided relationship with the most overrated Thanksgiving dish of them all: Turkey. Gravy needs more love. It\u2019s the glue that holds the entire Thanksgiving meal together. -Steven Ruiz (Editor\u2019s note: It\u2019s likely Steven probably just hates Thanksgiving all together.)\n\nIf something is so bland that you absolutely have to cover it in gravy then it is not worth eating. -Chris Korman (Editor\u2019s note: Per a trusted source, sour cream is the secret ingredient to truly good mashed potatoes.)\n\nCranberry Sauce\n\nThe Thanksgiving meal offers the perfect balance: Meaty (turkey), bready (stuffing), salty (everything, but green bean casserole fits) and sugary (sweet potatoes AND DON\u2019T FORGET TO PUT ROASTED MARSHMALLOWS ON THEM). There\u2019s no place for another sweet dish, especially if dessert is coming out. This is especially the case when you see that sliced cranberry sauce in the shape of the can it comes out of. No thanks, and pass me an extra helping of sweet potatoes. -Charles Curtis (Editor\u2019s note: Charles is wrong, sweet potatoes with marshmallows is an abomination.)\n\nStuffing\n\nDoes anyone really like this side dish when there are surely better ones from which to choose? Although if mushy bread with vegetables scattered in it is your thing, go for it. -Michelle Martinelli\n\nCreamed Spinach\n\nWhy does anyone have anything on the table that looks like something a baby chewed and then spit back out. -Hemal Jhaveri (Editor\u2019s note: This is the only right answer.)\n\nDinner rolls\n\nThere are both better ways to load up on carbs and better vessels to carry melted butter than dinner rolls, which are completely unnecessary on the Thanksgiving table. Every dinner roll you eat is a just another serving of stuffing that you won\u2019t have room for. They also lose their temperature much quicker than any other dish, and no one likes a cold roll. -Nick Schwartz"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Lions Wire", "title": "Looking back on Thanksgiving with the Lions", "description": "It's a Detroit tradition that we love to hang our hats on.

Let\u2019s take a look back at some of the more recent Thanksgiving games in Detroit.\n\n1998 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nCoin Flip Gate.\n\nThey were going to overtime. The captains were in the middle of the field, and Steelers running back Jerome Bettis called out \u201ctails.\u201d However, the umpire, Phil Luckett, swore Bettis said \u201cheads.\u201d The Lions were awarded the toss and kicked a field goal on the opening possession of overtime to win 19-16.\n\n2012 vs. Houston Texans\n\nThis game featured head coach Jim Schwartz throwing the challenge flag when he thought running back Justin Forsett was down. Forsett hopped back up and scored a touchdown. Since the touchdown was to automatically be reviewed, the Lions were given a 15-yard penalty and the ruling wasn\u2019t allowed to be reviewed. It proved costly as the Lions lost that game 34-31 in overtime. Also, in that game, it looked as though Ndamukong Suh kicked Matt Schaub right in the \u2026 well, you remember where.\n\n2015 vs. Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThis was an offensive onslaught. The was the game with one of my favorite Golden Tate moments \u2014 when he literally walked into the end zone. Calvin Johnson went for 93 yards and scored three touchdowns.

USA TODAY\n\nChristmas presents rest under a Christmas tree. (Photo: Stockbyte/Getty Images)\n\nTinsel and trees are great, but much of Christmas is about the surprise. As the advent calendar winds down to Dec. 25, suspense builds. What unexpected gift will emerge from those brightly wrapped boxes and stockings?\n\nKeeping your gifts a secret is harder than ever, because so much shopping is done online, and the digital paper-trail is extensive. Household computers are replete with receipts and notifications, and it\u2019s easy to forget how many ways a shared account can blow your cover. Worse, you may not even realize how many clues you leave.\n\nSince Amazon has become the global nucleus of online shopping, you\u2019ll be relieved to know that the company provides several settings and safeguards \u2013 mostly designed with the holidays in mind. (Although it\u2019s also handy for birthdays and anniversaries).\n\nJust follow these three straightforward steps to keep your Christmas gifts under wraps.\n\nHide Christmas presents from your kids\n\nFirst step: make sure you hide your Amazon purchases. The easiest tactic is an Amazon Household account. You can share your Amazon account and Amazon perks like free movies on Prime with your family \u2013 and there's no additional cost.\n\nAmazon Household includes one adult. This person has access to your stored payment methods and Prime perks, like free shipping. You can also share it with up to four teenagers and four kids ages 12 and under. This way, teenagers and kids won't have access to everything you're doing on Amazon.\n\nMore: 9 Amazon Prime perks you didn\u2019t know about \u2013 until now\n\nHow does this prevent others from ruining Christmas? Teenagers have their own login, and you will either receive a text to approve their purchases or you can put a spending limit on their accounts. Kids will have access to free, kid-appropriate digital content, like Amazon FreeTime.\n\nNote: You still can't hide your purchase history from another adult with an Amazon Household account. But hopefully, that second adult isn't trying to find their Christmas presents. You might try to warn them with a \"spoiler alert,\" so they don't go poking around the \"purchases\" list.\n\nHide presents in your archive\n\nIf you're a parent or guardian, you know that no Christmas gift is entirely safe from early detection. Somehow, there's always one or two gifts that don't elicit squeals of surprise.\n\nDigitally, though, there are ways to make it tough for anyone to see what you've purchased, including your Amazon online purchases. One way to do that is to archive your order history.\n\nMore: Amazon drops $25 minimum for free shipping through holiday shopping season\n\nThat's relatively easy to do, and it's tricky for anyone to find those archived orders (although not impossible). Here's what you do.\n\nGo to your Amazon homepage. Click on Orders in the menu to the right of Account & Lists. You'll see your orders. Click on Archive Order on the right side of each item.\n\nHere's the point: It's a little challenging to find those archived purchases. To find yours, go to Orders, then click on the drop-down menu where it says Past 6 Months and select Archived Orders \u2013 you'll be given the option to unarchive an order.\n\nCLOSE There\u2019s only one company that does Christmas better than Santa Claus, that\u2019s Amazon. Buzz60's Maria Mercedes Galuppo has more. Buzz60\n\nRemove your browsing history\n\nYour kids are smart or tricky, or both. They know where to find your Amazon purchases, and the items you've been searching for on the site. They also know that a browser's history is a dead giveaway \u2013 especially when cookies and targeted ads announce everything you've been reviewing for the past few days.\n\nYou still have some control, and you can make it tough for others to find anything there.\n\nIt's easy to clear your browsing history on Amazon, although it could take several minutes if you've ordered a lot of items. Start by opening your Amazon homepage.\n\nYou'll see Browsing History on the upper-left side of the homepage. Hover over the drop-down menu. You will see your most recent purchases along with the date you purchased them. Hover over that date, and you'll see an X and the word, \"Remove.\"\n\nYou can also click on the Browsing History link the menu. You can remove one item at a time or click on Manage History in the upper-right side to remove all items or to turn off your browsing history.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

(Photo: Sarah Prince, AP)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2013 Indian authorities were struggling Thursday to figure out how to recover the body of an American killed last week after wading ashore on an isolated island cut off from the modern world.\n\nJohn Allen Chau was killed by North Sentinel islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach, police say.\n\nBut even officials don\u2019t travel to North Sentinel, where people live as their ancestors did thousands of years ago, and where outsiders are seen with suspicion and attacked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult proposition,\u201d said Dependera Pathak, director-general of police on India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where North Sentinel is located. \u201cWe have to see what is possible, taking utmost care of the sensitivity of the group and the legal requirements.\u201d\n\nPolice are consulting anthropologists, tribal welfare experts, forest experts and scholars to figure out a way to recover the body, he said.\n\nWhile visits to the island are forbidden, Chau paid fishermen last week to take him to the island. He used a kayak to paddle to shore, bringing gifts including a football and fish.\n\nHe interacted with some of the tribesmen \u2013 who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants and are known for attacking anyone who comes near with bows and arrows and spears \u2013 until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. The 26-year-old adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to the fishermen\u2019s boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nMore: American missionary, adventurer killed by tribe members on restricted and remote island\n\nThat night, he wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day, Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn\u2019t known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau\u2019s body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nPathak said the seven people have been arrested for helping Chau, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau\u2019s and a local tourist guide.\n\n\u201cIt was a case of misdirected adventure,\u201d Pathak said.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can\u2019t be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \u201cbeloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\u201d The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\u201cHe ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\u201d the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed on another island while he prepared to travel to North Sentinel. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016. North Sentinel is part of the Andaman Islands and sits at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the island chain, where they broke the news to Chau\u2019s friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air on Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday and another trip was planned Thursday.\n\nIndia has a very hands-off approach to the island\u2019s people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\u201d Staver said.\n\nChau was carrying a Bible that was hit by an arrow when he was first shot at by the tribesmen on Nov. 15, according to notes Chau left with the fishermen that Staver said he has seen.\n\nStaver said Chau\u2019s last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nOne of Chau\u2019s friends said the American spent a month at his home in Cape Town, South Africa, before going to India.\n\n\u201cIf he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\u201d said Casey Prince, 39.\n\nThe two first met about six years ago, when Chau was a manager on the soccer team at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma. Chau and others on the team traveled to South Africa to volunteer at a soccer program Prince founded\n\nPrince described him as easy to like and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nAssociated Press writers Tim Sullivan in New Delhi, Gene Johnson and Phuong Le in Seattle, and Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/22/indian-police-struggle-get-body-american-killed-north-sentinel/2085267002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Dalvin Brown, USA TODAY", "title": "Cars with the deepest Black Friday discounts", "description": "Cars with the deepest Black Friday discounts", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/money/cars/2018/11/22/cars-deepest-black-friday-discounts/2074376002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/21/USAT/76f5a02c-5032-43d4-90d5-9e597209f142-18_FUSI_Titan_34FrntDrvrMotn_mj.jpg?crop=3658,2057,x842,y943&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:01:06Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Ford\n\nBlack Friday means deep discounts at some of the most popular retailers in the country.

It could be something you inherited or that the other person admired: a piece of artwork or jewelry, a beloved toy, a musical instrument, a grandparent's toolbox or baking supplies.\n\nMore: Budgets, family drama and stuff: How do you manage holiday gift-giving?\n\nTake a hatchet to other expenses\n\nOur holiday spending surge requires cutting other expenses to keep our budget in balance. Ahead of the holidays, we:\n\n\u2022 Eat out less and plan meals that mostly use items from our pantry.\n\n\u2022 Scour our recurring bills for possible savings, such as pausing subscriptions or canceling an unused gym membership.\n\n\u2022 Look for cheap entertainment, such as free community concerts or baking cookies with friends.\n\nWe're also changing how we make charitable donations, since the 2017 tax overhaul likely means we'll no longer get a tax deduction. Instead of rushing to make big year-end contributions, we've set up monthly payments to our favorite charities. That provides them with a steady source of income and avoids another big December dent in our budget.\n\nMore: Holiday budgeting tips: 3 ways to give thoughtful gifts without overspending\n\nKeep the budget updated\n\nA budget should be a living document, regularly updated and adjusted. I log our spending every week or so and use apps such as Santa's Bag or Christmas List that I can update on my phone.\n\nThis approach does more than keep us honest about our spending. At the end of the season, I have a realistic idea of how much to save for next year. I divide that total by 12, and set up a monthly transfer to an online savings account labeled \"Christmas.\"\n\nHaving the money to pay for the holidays in cash every year may be the best gift of all.\n\nThis column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

USA TODAY\n\nChristmas presents rest under a Christmas tree. (Photo: Stockbyte/Getty Images)\n\nTinsel and trees are great, but much of Christmas is about the surprise. As the advent calendar winds down to Dec. 25, suspense builds. What unexpected gift will emerge from those brightly wrapped boxes and stockings?\n\nKeeping your gifts a secret is harder than ever, because so much shopping is done online, and the digital paper-trail is extensive. Household computers are replete with receipts and notifications, and it\u2019s easy to forget how many ways a shared account can blow your cover. Worse, you may not even realize how many clues you leave.\n\nSince Amazon has become the global nucleus of online shopping, you\u2019ll be relieved to know that the company provides several settings and safeguards \u2013 mostly designed with the holidays in mind. (Although it\u2019s also handy for birthdays and anniversaries).\n\nJust follow these three straightforward steps to keep your Christmas gifts under wraps.\n\nHide Christmas presents from your kids\n\nFirst step: make sure you hide your Amazon purchases. The easiest tactic is an Amazon Household account. You can share your Amazon account and Amazon perks like free movies on Prime with your family \u2013 and there's no additional cost.\n\nAmazon Household includes one adult. This person has access to your stored payment methods and Prime perks, like free shipping. You can also share it with up to four teenagers and four kids ages 12 and under. This way, teenagers and kids won't have access to everything you're doing on Amazon.\n\nMore: 9 Amazon Prime perks you didn\u2019t know about \u2013 until now\n\nHow does this prevent others from ruining Christmas? Teenagers have their own login, and you will either receive a text to approve their purchases or you can put a spending limit on their accounts. Kids will have access to free, kid-appropriate digital content, like Amazon FreeTime.\n\nNote: You still can't hide your purchase history from another adult with an Amazon Household account. But hopefully, that second adult isn't trying to find their Christmas presents. You might try to warn them with a \"spoiler alert,\" so they don't go poking around the \"purchases\" list.\n\nHide presents in your archive\n\nIf you're a parent or guardian, you know that no Christmas gift is entirely safe from early detection. Somehow, there's always one or two gifts that don't elicit squeals of surprise.\n\nDigitally, though, there are ways to make it tough for anyone to see what you've purchased, including your Amazon online purchases. One way to do that is to archive your order history.\n\nMore: Amazon drops $25 minimum for free shipping through holiday shopping season\n\nThat's relatively easy to do, and it's tricky for anyone to find those archived orders (although not impossible). Here's what you do.\n\nGo to your Amazon homepage. Click on Orders in the menu to the right of Account & Lists. You'll see your orders. Click on Archive Order on the right side of each item.\n\nHere's the point: It's a little challenging to find those archived purchases. To find yours, go to Orders, then click on the drop-down menu where it says Past 6 Months and select Archived Orders \u2013 you'll be given the option to unarchive an order.\n\nCLOSE There\u2019s only one company that does Christmas better than Santa Claus, that\u2019s Amazon. Buzz60's Maria Mercedes Galuppo has more. Buzz60\n\nRemove your browsing history\n\nYour kids are smart or tricky, or both. They know where to find your Amazon purchases, and the items you've been searching for on the site. They also know that a browser's history is a dead giveaway \u2013 especially when cookies and targeted ads announce everything you've been reviewing for the past few days.\n\nYou still have some control, and you can make it tough for others to find anything there.\n\nIt's easy to clear your browsing history on Amazon, although it could take several minutes if you've ordered a lot of items. Start by opening your Amazon homepage.\n\nYou'll see Browsing History on the upper-left side of the homepage. Hover over the drop-down menu. You will see your most recent purchases along with the date you purchased them. Hover over that date, and you'll see an X and the word, \"Remove.\"\n\nYou can also click on the Browsing History link the menu. You can remove one item at a time or click on Manage History in the upper-right side to remove all items or to turn off your browsing history.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

I am thankful for the chance to pay back that debt and see a nation more united than divided.\n\nShoulders of camo uniforms with U.S. flags on them. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nI lead a double life. Most of the month, I\u2019m a national security expert in Washington, D.C., offering my views on how the United States can compete with China to shape the course of the 21st century. But one weekend each month, I wake up before sunrise, put on a uniform, and fulfill my duty as an officer in the Navy Reserve.\n\nI joined almost four years ago, motivated by a combination of family history and idealism.\n\nMy maternal grandparents, German Jews, fled to the United States just before World War II. Without a refuge in America, they would have been annihilated in the Holocaust. None of their descendants had served in the U.S. military. Our debt to America remained unpaid.\n\nI also wanted to have skin in the game. As a civilian working in foreign policy, I could make recommendations for military action without fear of having my own life disrupted or, at worst, cut short. This felt fundamentally unjust.\n\nSo I contacted a recruiter, filed an application, endured the poking and prodding of a Navy physician, and signed up for eight years of service.\n\nI\u2019m now halfway through. And despite occasional frustrations, thankful to serve.\n\nWhat have I learned?\n\nServing and sacrificing together\n\nI\u2019ve gained a deeper appreciation for the enormous sacrifices of active duty military personnel. The typical reserve commitment \u2014 one weekend each month and a two-week block each year \u2014 is modest, but for a young family, still taxing. And the potential for a year-long future mobilization to somewhere hot and sandy is unsettling. Hearing my wife and I discuss the prospect, my 2-year-old daughter, even with limited understanding, has broken down in tears.\n\nMore: I spent two years serving my country with AmeriCorps. In return, Uncle Sam sent me a bill.\n\nDespite the risks, I can't imagine being anything but a California firefighter\n\nIt took a village to kill my brother: How families, hospitals and government fail alcoholics\n\nI\u2019ve come to understand that we rise together. More than any other organization in which I\u2019ve participated, the U.S. military places a premium on mentorship. As the first in my family to serve, I\u2019ve needed help, from learning basic skills such as marching, to navigating clunky and complex Navy personnel systems, to mastering new areas of military knowledge far removed from my civilian expertise. All along the way, officers and enlisted have extended a hand, even when they had no formal requirement to do so.\n\nI\u2019ve discovered the other Washington. Much of America regards the nation\u2019s capital as hopelessly dysfunctional, a theater for political combat, where the needs of the people are subordinated to the interests of the few. On drill weekends, another Washington emerges. Americans of all religious, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds serve side by side. Democrats, Republicans and independents come together, not only to get the mission done but also to joke and complain, forging bonds that transcend a single weekend.\n\nWhy I'm thankful to serve\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, some friends asked whether I regretted signing up for eight years of military service. To the contrary, that fiercely contested election \u2014 and the nation\u2019s growing internal divisions since then \u2014 have underscored the rightness of my choice.\n\nIt is all too easy to despise other Americans if you don\u2019t know them. The Navy Reserve, like the active duty military, is America, from stay-at-home moms to small business owners, from law enforcement officers to university professors, from civilian intelligence professionals to political operatives. Through it, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to encounter a far broader segment of Americans than is possible in my civilian role as a national security expert.\n\nFour years in, I\u2019m thankful to be an officer in the Navy Reserve. I wish that more Americans had the opportunity to serve and realize that far more unites us than divides us.\n\nDaniel Kliman is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

People will be calling about frozen pipes, or they'll be turning on their boiler for the first time this season. That's when you usually discover a problem,\" Malota said.\n\nHe said service calls start at $175. \"They can up to a thousand dollars if we have to change circulating pumps. Those are expensive,\" he said.\n\nHe said that all the extra business is exciting, but \"I do feel bad for the people who will have to call us, though.\"\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/22/black-friday-means-big-business-these-plumbers/2028857002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Ranieri's task at struggling Fulham: Getting back to basics", "description": "The arrival of Claudio Ranieri as Fulham coach should ensure an end to the chaotic selections, loose defending and naive approach that marked the promoted team's turbulent first three months back in the Premier League", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/22/ranieris-task-at-struggling-fulham-getting-back-to-basics/38584789/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3991650c5c4635aa77b5073f200a09f32fbf9eb6/c=0-80-1446-893/local/-/media/2018/11/22/USATODAY/usatsports/5a4f0e63ea3c4e45ab576c18e91d6916.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:01:21Z", "content": "FILE - In this Thursday, March 30, 2017 file photo, soccer coach Claudio Ranieri waves from a balcony of Rome's Capitol Hill, after receiving an honorary award for his work at Leicester City.

Jokanovic sent out Fulham to play in an expansive and open style that allowed them to be picked off with ease. He never fielded the same back four.\n\nNo wonder Ranieri said his priority was to sort out the defense and finally keep clean sheets, with the reward for the players a trip to fast-food chain McDonald's for burgers. Famously, pizzas were his gift to Leicester's squad for shutouts.\n\n\"Today I said this: Restart every time,\" Ranieri said Thursday. \"We can win, lose, clean and restart tomorrow. Forget the past.\"\n\nCompared with masterminding a title success for Leicester over the superpowers of the league, keeping Fulham up should be child's play for the 67-year-old Ranieri.\n\nFulham, after all, is only three points from safety. It has 26 games left to play. It has a squad containing more than 100 million pounds ($113m) worth of new talent bought in the offseason. In theory, there are at least three rival teams less equipped to stay up.\n\n\"This Fulham squad has exceptional talent that is contrary to its position in the table,\" Ranieri said.\n\nHe could hardly have a kinder first match either, a home game against a Southampton side that has failed to score in half of its league games and has only one victory.\n\nRanieri needs to settle on a goalkeeper \u2014 Jokanovic played three in 12 games \u2014 and a fixed back four. He also requires a central midfield combination that provides better protection for his defense and must get more out of 18-year-old Ryan Sessegnon, who was Fulham's standout in the second-tier Championship when playing on the left wing but has sometimes featured at left back this season.\n\nIn attack, can Aleksandar Mitrovic and Andre Schuerrle be Fulham's version of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, Leicester's attacking pair that excelled under Ranieri? The combinations have different profiles \u2014 where Vardy had sheer pace, Mitrovic has presence and strength; where Mahrez was all about touch and technique, Schuerrle has a lethal shot and an eye for goal \u2014 but their importance is similar.\n\nCan the coach once nicknamed \"The Tinkerman\" when in charge of Chelsea provide some stability at Fulham?\n\n\"I am Tinkerman,\" he said, \"but I tinker clever. It's important to maintain the same lineup for some matches but you never know. I want everybody available and then I can choose.\"\n\nRanieri must also instill a new mindset.\n\n\"I think now it is important to not think about miracles, but think about a lot of battles and be ready together,\" he said. \"I repeat, together. The club, the players, the fans.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Sarah Prince, AP)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2013 Indian authorities were struggling Thursday to figure out how to recover the body of an American killed last week after wading ashore on an isolated island cut off from the modern world.\n\nJohn Allen Chau was killed by North Sentinel islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach, police say.\n\nBut even officials don\u2019t travel to North Sentinel, where people live as their ancestors did thousands of years ago, and where outsiders are seen with suspicion and attacked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult proposition,\u201d said Dependera Pathak, director-general of police on India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where North Sentinel is located. \u201cWe have to see what is possible, taking utmost care of the sensitivity of the group and the legal requirements.\u201d\n\nPolice are consulting anthropologists, tribal welfare experts, forest experts and scholars to figure out a way to recover the body, he said.\n\nWhile visits to the island are forbidden, Chau paid fishermen last week to take him to the island. He used a kayak to paddle to shore, bringing gifts including a football and fish.\n\nHe interacted with some of the tribesmen \u2013 who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants and are known for attacking anyone who comes near with bows and arrows and spears \u2013 until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. The 26-year-old adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to the fishermen\u2019s boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nMore: American missionary, adventurer killed by tribe members on restricted and remote island\n\nThat night, he wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day, Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn\u2019t known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau\u2019s body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nPathak said the seven people have been arrested for helping Chau, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau\u2019s and a local tourist guide.\n\n\u201cIt was a case of misdirected adventure,\u201d Pathak said.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can\u2019t be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \u201cbeloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\u201d The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\u201cHe ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\u201d the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed on another island while he prepared to travel to North Sentinel. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016. North Sentinel is part of the Andaman Islands and sits at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the island chain, where they broke the news to Chau\u2019s friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air on Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday and another trip was planned Thursday.\n\nIndia has a very hands-off approach to the island\u2019s people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\u201d Staver said.\n\nChau was carrying a Bible that was hit by an arrow when he was first shot at by the tribesmen on Nov. 15, according to notes Chau left with the fishermen that Staver said he has seen.\n\nStaver said Chau\u2019s last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nOne of Chau\u2019s friends said the American spent a month at his home in Cape Town, South Africa, before going to India.\n\n\u201cIf he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\u201d said Casey Prince, 39.\n\nThe two first met about six years ago, when Chau was a manager on the soccer team at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma. Chau and others on the team traveled to South Africa to volunteer at a soccer program Prince founded\n\nPrince described him as easy to like and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nAssociated Press writers Tim Sullivan in New Delhi, Gene Johnson and Phuong Le in Seattle, and Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/22/indian-police-struggle-get-body-american-killed-north-sentinel/2085267002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Russia's Mutko returns to football body after stepping aside", "description": "Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was banned from the Olympics for life over his country's doping scandals, has resumed running Russian football", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/22/russias-mutko-returns-to-football-body-after-stepping-aside/38584777/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:26:09Z", "content": "MOSCOW (AP) Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was banned from the Olympics for life over his country's doping scandals, has returned to a senior role in Russian football.

Going from the top 10 to unranked leaves the Tigers only one way to appease restless fans: Play the spoiler and upset their biggest rival, No. 1 Alabama. (AP Photo/Todd Kirkland, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHere are some things to watch during the final week of the Southeastern Conference football regular season:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nAuburn at No. 1 Alabama (No. 1 College Football Playoff): The Iron Bowl looks lopsided on paper this season, with the Tide picked as a 24\u00bd-point favorite at home. But it's hard to completely discount Auburn considering the Tigers have won three of the past eight in the series, including 26-14 last season . Alabama has looked a little off its top form recently, especially in last week's game against The Citadel, which was tied at halftime before the Tide bounced back for the 50-17 victory .\n\nTOP MATCHUP\n\nVanderbilt quarterback Kyle Shurmur against Tennessee pass defense. Shurmur has delivered a couple of the best games of his career against Tennessee. He threw for 416 yards in a 45-34 victory over Tennessee two years ago and threw four touchdown passes in a 42-24 triumph at Tennessee last season . Now he will try to engineer Vanderbilt to a third straight win over Tennessee. It's worth noting that Shurmur was just 4 of 15 for 18 yards with an interception in a 59-0 loss to Alabama last year. Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt was Alabama's defensive coordinator last season.\n\nNUMBERS GAME\n\nNo. 13 Florida (No. 11 CFP) has lost to Florida State each of the last five years heading into Saturday's game. That represents the Gators' longest losing streak in the history of this rivalry. ... Georgia's Rodrigo Blankenship has 69 touchbacks out of 81 kickoffs and ranks second nationally in that category. He has broken his own school single-season record of 67, which he had set last year. ... Vanderbilt is seeking to beat Tennessee for a third straight year, something that hasn't happened since the Commodores beat the Volunteers six straight times from 1920-26. Tennessee is 2-4 against Vanderbilt the last six years after going 28-1 in the series from 1983-2011. ... No. 17 Kentucky (No. 15 CFP) is seeking its ninth win Saturday against Louisville, which would represent the Wildcats' largest regular-season total since a 10-1 finish in 1977. ... No. 8 LSU (No. 7 CFP) hasn't allowed its last 21 opponents to reach the 30-point mark. The only FBS team with a longer such streak is Fresno State, which hasn't allowed its last 22 foes to reach 30 points. ... Texas A&M (No. 22 CFP) has lost its last seven meetings with LSU and hasn't beaten the Tigers since 1995.\n\nUPSET WATCH\n\nVanderbilt and Tennessee have identical 5-6 overall records and 2-5 SEC marks. The difference is that Tennessee beat Auburn and Kentucky when both were ranked, while Vanderbilt has no wins over Top 25 teams. That makes it hard to understand how Vanderbilt is favored by 3 \u00bd points. Vanderbilt will be playing on its home field, but Tennessee likely will have the majority of fans on its side.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER\n\nFlorida quarterback Feleipe Franks has gone through an up-and-down season, but he's heating up late in the year. Franks rallied Florida from a 31-14 second-half deficit in a 35-31 victory over South Carolina and followed that up by going 19 of 27 for 274 yards in a 63-10 blowout of Idaho . He has four touchdown passes, three touchdown runs and no interceptions in his last two games. Franks now gets a chance for redemption against Florida State after throwing three interceptions in a 38-22 loss to the Seminoles last season.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Steve Megargee in Knoxville, Tennessee, and David Brandt in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Woody Marshall) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThings to watch in the Atlantic Coast Conference in Week 13:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nNo. 19 Syracuse at Boston College. With the ACC championship game matchup settled, the focus across the conference shifts to positioning for the bowl selection process. The Orange (8-3, 5-2, No. 20 CFP) enter the final weekend of league play having vaulted the Eagles (7-4, 4-3) in the Atlantic Division standings and own sole possession of second place, a game ahead of BC and North Carolina State. The big question for Syracuse is the healthy of QB Eric Dungey, who suffered what coach Dino Babers termed an upper-body injury during last week's loss to No. 3 Notre Dame .\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nPittsburgh's rushing offense vs. Miami's run defense. The 24th-ranked Panthers (7-4, 6-1, No. 24 CFP) claimed their first ACC title game appearance \u2014 and reeled off a four-game winning streak \u2014 on the strength of their ground game, which ranks third in the league at 247.6 yards per game. The Hurricanes (6-5, 3-4) have the third-best run defense in the conference (132.8 ypg) and have held five of their last six opponents to fewer than 175 yards rushing.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nNine ACC teams are bowl eligible and three more could join them over the coming two weeks \u2014 Florida State (5-6) and Wake Forest (5-6) need to upset instate rivals Florida and Duke, while Virginia Tech (4-6) must knock off Virginia and then beat Marshall next week in a last-minute replacement game. Only two schools \u2014 Louisville and North Carolina \u2014 are assured of missing the postseason. The ACC has placed 21 teams in bowls during the past two seasons, 10 last year and 11 in 2016.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nKeep an eye on Wake Forest as a 12\u00bd-point road underdog against Duke. The Demon Deacons (5-6, 2-5) need a victory to qualify for their third straight bowl. But they've had a tough time lately against their instate rivals, with the Blue Devils (7-4, 3-4) winning five of the last six meetings.\n\nIMPACT PLAYER\n\nIt's mildly surprising that N.C. State QB Ryan Finley had never thrown four touchdown passes in a game until he did it last week at last-place Louisville . Now, he and the Wolfpack close their conference schedule against the league's other cellar-dweller \u2014 rival North Carolina, which has allowed each of its last two opponents to throw for at least 300 yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The way Max Verstappen has driven recently offers encouragement of a more open Formula One title race next year.\n\nVerstappen has been in typically daredevil form, with some overtaking moves of the highest class, and the Red Bull driver is aiming to sign off the season in style at this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\nF1 needs him to carry over his form into 2019, too.\n\nBecause each year since 2014, the championship contest has been between Lewis Hamilton and one other driver: his former Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg and more recently Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. Although two of those championships went down to the last race \u2014 Hamilton won in '14 and Rosberg in '16 \u2014 it was always a two-way contest. This year and last, Hamilton beat Vettel into second place, with everyone else lagging behind.\n\nGiven that Vettel's title wins with Red Bull from 2011-13 were overwhelming victories, there has not been a wider contest with multiple drivers since 2010, when several fought for the title heading into the season-ending desert race under floodlights at Abu Dhabi. Vettel won that dramatic race for his first F1 title.\n\nBut Verstappen has finished this season so strongly he has surpassed Vettel and even matched Hamilton, which bodes well for 2019.\n\nOver the past four races, Verstappen has had four podium finishes including \u2014 a win in Mexico \u2014 for 76 points compared with 77 for Hamilton in the same span. But the tally would have been 83-70 in Verstappen's favor if not for a reckless attacking move by French driver Esteban Ocon in the latter stages of the Brazilian GP two weeks ago.\n\nAlthough he was already lapped and had no points to fight for, Ocon stubbornly refused to let race leader Verstappen past him and they tangled on the track , sending Verstappen spinning back to second and pushing Hamilton to first. It led to a heated incident after the race, where an irate Verstappen squared up to a grinning Ocon and shoved him three times in the chest before pointing an angry finger at him as he eventually walked away.\n\nVerstappen's actions drew criticism from some observers, but they also highlighted the 21-year-old Dutchman's fiery will to win. Despite his young age he already has five GP wins to his name, including two this season.\n\nHamilton's Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, has not won a race this season despite having a quicker and considerably more consistent car.\n\nIt fuels the view that Verstappen, in a Ferrari or a Mercedes, would already be a serious title contender now.\n\nHe is fifth in the standings, but could overtake Bottas and move up a spot at this weekend's Abu Dhabi GP. Verstappen is also more than 60 points clear of his Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo, the senior driver, although the margin is blurred by the fact both have been undone at times this season by engine problems.\n\nVerstappen has failed to finish four races while Ricciardo's wretched luck has seen him retire from eight races. Yet both have managed to win two races each despite the car's inconsistent nature.\n\nBy contrast, Hamilton has finished every race except for Austria in July, and Bottas has finished all but two, underlining the more reliable Mercedes.\n\nThe complex engine problems ultimately forced Red Bull to split with Renault as its partner and choose Honda from 2019. Yet there is no little irony in that switch now, considering how strong Verstappen has been in recent races when his engine has held up.\n\nIt is a risky move for Red Bull to partner with Honda, considering the complications of the McLaren-Honda partnership in recent years.\n\nBut Red Bull is optimistic Honda has sorted its problems out and will provide a more powerful engine than Renault.\n\nIf so, Verstappen could well be pushing Hamilton and Vettel hard for the 2019 title.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In between servings of turkey and stuffing, Gordon Hayward hopes the struggling Boston Celtics use the holiday to think about where they stand as a team.\n\n\"Tomorrow might be a good day for us to reflect a little bit,\" Hayward said Wednesday night after the Celtics fell behind by as many as 26 and were booed by the Boston crowd during a 117-109 loss to the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Celtics have lost a season-high three in a row and seven of their last 10 games. So what's wrong with the team many pegged as the Eastern Conference favorite? Everything, according to coach Brad Stevens.\n\n\"This is a lot of things,\" Stevens said. \"We have a myriad of issues we have to fix.\"\n\nBoston's defense is a stout as ever \u2014 second in rating, third in points allowed, third in opponent field goal percentage, according to NBA.com.\n\nHowever, the Celtics have been struggling mightily to find the offensive consistency they enjoyed last season. Hayward and Kyrie Irving are healthy, giving Boston its full complement of weapons, but the Celtics are 25th in scoring, 27th in offensive rating and 29th in team field goal percentage.\n\n\"We're not playing with the same personality that we did last year and that's the easy way to describe it and the 50,000 issues are below that,\" said Stevens. \"I just don't know that we're that good. Maybe it's not a wake-up call if you keep getting beat.\"\n\nNew York took an eight-point lead after the first quarter. After pushing the lead to double digits early in the second, the Knicks took control with a 17-5 run to go ahead 57-31 with about 3\u00bd minutes left until halftime. That's when the boos started.\n\n\"It was just ugly. It\u2019s a scary sight when it just comes down to us just playing hard,\" Irving said.\n\n\"I think it's just tiring at this point, when we show flashes of brilliance, and we put ourselves in a deep hole and we're consistently coming back, and we can't play like that.\"\n\nFollow Matt Eppers on Twitter @meppers_."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 4 Cavs, No. 25 Badgers eye trips to Atlantis final", "description": "Fourth-ranked Virginia and No. 25 Wisconsin each have semifinal games to headline the Battle 4 Atlantis schedule Thursday", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/22/no-4-cavs-no-25-badgers-eye-trips-to-atlantis-final/38584723/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T07:15:04Z", "content": "PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) The Battle 4 Atlantis resumes with a Thanksgiving Day slate of four games that include semifinal contests for fourth-ranked Virginia and No. 25 Wisconsin in the Bahamas.

It was his second big outing in two days in the Bahamas, a sign that last season's Atlantic Coast Conference sixth man of the year is poised to thrive in a leading role.\n\n\"Every game you sort of start over,\" Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. \"But as long as he's ready to go and has that mindset of being defensive-minded and then aggressive with soundness offensively, that's all I can ask for from him.\"\n\nVirginia (5-0) advanced to Friday's championship game to face No. 25 Wisconsin, which beat Oklahoma in a semifinal to start the four-game slate on Thanksgiving Day. Florida beat Stanford and Butler beat Middle Tennessee in the consolation bracket.\n\nHunter had 15 points, eight rebounds and a career-high nine assists in the first-round win over Middle Tennessee, a sneaky-good performance that even had Bennett surprised by his assist total afterward.\n\nOn Thursday, he roamed everywhere and essentially played as the 5-man in a small-ball lineup down the stretch as Virginia sought to counter Dayton's athleticism. He's athletic enough to harass smaller players on the wing but strong enough to wrestle with big men with his 225-pound frame.\n\n\"I think it helps a lot offensively and defensively,\" he said. \"I can switch 1 through 4, maybe sometimes guard a 5. And offensively, I can bring the big man out and let our guards drive and attack.\"\n\nHe hit the game's biggest shot, too.\n\nLeading 60-56 with the shot clock dwindling, Hunter took a pass on the right side and pump-faked to get Dayton's Obi Toppin airborne. He calmly took a dribble as Toppin flew by and buried a 3 with 53.1 seconds left, helping the Cavaliers hold on after the Flyers (4-1) shot 55 percent after halftime.\n\n\"You get a miss there and who knows \u2014 you get a transition opportunity, it's a different ballgame,\" Dayton coach Anthony Grant said. \"That was huge.

He finally missed with 5:57 left to finish at 7 for 8.\n\nThat was the first missed 3 after halftime for the Badgers (5-0), who made 8 of 9 in the second half and 14 of 22 for the game.

The Huskers canned his replacement, Mike Riley in part because they weren't good enough to beat the Hawkeyes.\n\nNew coach Scott Frost will get his first crack at Iowa on Friday in a border rivalry that's blossomed into something of annual referendum on both programs.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (7-4, 4-4 Big Ten) snapped a three-game losing streak last weekend with a cathartic 63-0 whitewash of Illinois on the road. Nebraska (4-7, 3-5) has won four of its last five after a 0-6 start and would like nothing more than to enter the offseason with a win at Iowa.\n\nThe Hawkeyes have won three straight over the Huskers, including a 56-14 blowout in Lincoln a year ago that helped seal Riley's fate.\n\n\"This game is extremely important to us,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"It's got a lot of weight, a lot of value, and we're giving it our utmost intention ... You look at Nebraska, they're a team that's really riding high right now, playing with really good momentum.\"\n\nIowa's seniors will try to make it a clean sweep of Nebraska, which has lost the last two in the series by 30 and 42 points.\n\nIOWA'S ATTACK\n\nAfter losing to Penn State, Purdue and Northwestern by just 12 combined points, the Hawkeyes exploded for nine touchdowns against the Illini. Iowa scored in nearly way imaginable, racking up touchdowns on runs, passes, a fumble return and a punt return.\n\n\"I've certainly watched them enough to know that they're really good on offense, I've been impressed. I think they're more multiple than they used to be,\" Frost said.\n\nQB MARTINEZ\n\nThe Hawkeyes know that they will have to be wary of Nebraska quarterback Adrian Martinez. He needs just 90 yards of total offense to become the first freshman in school history with 3,000.\n\n\"He's not (Penn State quarterback Trace) McSorley, but there are probably some parallels in there,\" Ferentz said. \"He's really a very threatening guy, running the football, throwing the football. They've got designed runs, designed options, those types of things, and then also he'll pull it down and go.\"\n\nIOWA'S D\n\nIowa has pitched a pair of shutouts, and the Hawkeyes held four other opponents to 14 points or less. The Hawkeyes rank ninth nationally in scoring defense at 16.5 points per game and will likely be the toughest unit Nebraska has seen outside of Michigan, which beat the Huskers 56-10.\n\n\"They are another tough, solid team,\" Martinez said. \"They are going to be very sound and play hard. We are going to have to come to play there. They are not going to make a lot of mistakes.\"\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nLast week's win was the 150th for Ferentz at Iowa. Ferentz also won 12 times at Maine. ... Nebraska leads the series 10-7 in games played in Iowa City. ... Iowa leads the Big Ten with 17 interceptions. ... Nebraska's Stanley Morgan Jr. needs just 24 receiving yards to set the school's career record. ... The Hawkeyes are 12-3 in their last 15 trophy games. All three losses in that span came against Wisconsin.\n\nHE SAID IT (JOKINGLY)\n\n\"His sustained success is impressive, but you still don't get to 150 unless you're a little bit old. I'll make sure I remind him of that when I see him.\" \u2014 Frost about Ferentz.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Tom Herman wasn't on the Texas sideline two years ago, even if a bunch of his players were, when the Longhorns walked out of Memorial Stadium with a head-shaking loss to Kansas.\n\nThe defeat ended a string of 13 consecutive wins over the Jayhawks, likely sealed the fate of embattled coach Charlie Strong and ultimately led to Herman's hiring away from Houston.\n\nBut when asked whether there is a sense of revenge among the veteran players on the Texas roster as they prepare to return to Lawrence for the first time Friday, the plainspoken Herman responded with what could only be considered an audible shrug.\n\n\"I feel like that program that went there, I feel like that was 50 years ago, not two years ago,\" he said. \"We're so far passed that point in our program, no, there's no hidden significance to it.\"\n\nEspecially considering some far more important things are at stake: The No. 11 Longhorns (8-3, 6-2 Big 12, No. 15 CFP) will clinch a spot in the Big 12 title game with a win.\n\nThe fact that the Longhorns are in the mix heading into their regular-season finale may be the best evidence of the progress Herman has made. The year they lost to the Jayhawks, they finished 5-7 for the second straight season, and played their finale knowing a bowl game was out of reach.\n\n\"We've come a long way but we're far from a finished product,\" Herman said. \"I would argue we're overachievers at this point, when you look throughout the landscape of our conference. How many first-team all-conference guys do we have on our starting 22? I don't know. I think we have some pretty good players, but we have a lot of guys that know how to play team football.\n\n\"That's the sign of progress,\" Herman said, \"when your culture can take over and win some games.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks (3-8, 1-7) are in the midst of another culture change of their own.\n\nDavid Beaty will be coaching his final game for Kansas on Friday, having been relieved of duties with two games left in the season but allowed to finish out his fourth season in charge. He only has six wins over that time period, including that monumental high of beating the Longhorns.\n\nThe school has already hired national championship-winning coach Les Miles, and he is busy assembling a coaching staff and hitting the ground recruiting.\n\n\"I haven't spoken to him and we probably won't speak,\" Beaty said, \"but that's OK. I'm going to be the coach here through the rest of this week and then it's going to be time for a change. Our job is to win this game, to help those (players) that are going to still be here.\"\n\nTexas is no doubt in a better place than it was two years ago, when the Longhorns lost to the Jayhawks. But the reality is Kansas is in a better place, too, with a competitive roster \u2014 even if the positive results have been painfully hard to produce.\n\n\"Only the ones who have been inside know where we started and where we're at today,\" Beaty said. \"At the end of the day it's about production, and production is spelled out with W-I-N. You've got to win. We weren't able to do that at a high enough level fast enough. And I get that.\"\n\nHe has one more chance on Friday.\n\nHAGER APOLOGY\n\nTexas defensive end Breckyn Hager issued a public apology earlier this week after he called out Oklahoma following the Longhorns' win over Iowa State last week. Hager had said that \"OU still sucks,\" and Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby publicly reprimanded him.\n\nPOOKA POWER\n\nKansas freshman Pooka Williams torched the Sooners for 252 yards and two touchdowns on just 15 carries last week.\n\n\"He's the real deal,\" Texas defensive lineman Chris Nelson said. \"The biggest thing for this game is just gang-tackling. Everybody has to put a hat on him.\"\n\nSAM THE MAN\n\nTexas quarterback Sam Ehlinger is expected to play after reinjuring his right shoulder against Iowa State. Shane Buechele finished up the win over the Cyclones and Ehlinger did not throw early in the week, but Herman expressed confidence he would be ready by Friday.\n\nJOHNSON HEALING\n\nLonghorns wide receiver Collin Johnson said he's \"close to 100 percent\" after hurting his knee in practice early this month. He caught three passes for 55 yards against Iowa State, and said, \"It was good to be back out there. At this point, everybody is battling.\"\n\nBIG 12 TITLE\n\nTexas won three Big 12 title games, the last in 2009, before it went away following the 2010 season. Oklahoma played TCU for the championship last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Solis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe senior class that arrived at Missouri four seasons ago was joining a program that had reached back-to-back SEC title games, one that had surpassed just about every expectation after it bolted from the Big 12 for the powerhouse conference.\n\nThey've experienced the collapse of the program, the hiring of a new coach in Barry Odom, and now the return of the Tigers to prominence heading into their regular-season finale on Friday.\n\nWhat better way to go out than with a win over rival Arkansas?\n\n\"We've gone through a lot,\" said Odom, who won just four games his first season and seven last season, but has a chance to finish 8-4 and perhaps make a New Year's Day Six bowl game with a win over the Razorbacks. \"There's been some lows and some highs and they've been able to hold tight together and hold true to them, and that's going to help them down the road.\"\n\nThe Tigers (7-4, 3-4 SEC) are certainly finishing strong. They've followed a 0-4 start to league play by beating Florida, Vanderbilt and Tennessee \u2014 two of those games on the road.\n\nTheir winning streak has coincided with standout performances by senior quarterback Drew Lock, who began the year as a Heisman Trophy candidate before a rough stretch. He's thrown for at least 250 yards and seven total touchdowns the past three weeks, sending his draft stock soaring.\n\nSome believe he could be the first quarterback selected when April rolls around.\n\n\"To Drew's credit, he started believing in who he is and what he's capable of becoming,\" Missouri offensive coordinator Derek Dooley said, \"and he's stayed the course.\"\n\nThe Razorbacks (2-9, 0-7) hope to the spoil party and provide first-year coach Chad Morris with a victory upon which he can build. Arkansas took Ole Miss, Texas A&M and LSU down to the wire, but wins have been painfully hard to come by outside of games against Tulsa and Eastern Illinois.\n\n\"Losing will never be acceptable in this program,\" Morris said. \"I'm not going to compromise. I've been here before, I know what it looks like and I know what it looks like moving forward. We've got a lot of people pouring their hearts and souls into this program but we need more.\"\n\nLike a win over the Tigers in their annual rivalry game.\n\nCROCKETT'S REVENGE\n\nMissouri running back Damarea Crockett grew up in Little Rock and wasn't offered a scholarship by his home-state team, so to say that he's craving an opportunity to play the Razorbacks would be an understatement. And not even an ankle injury sustained in last week's win over Tennessee is expected to keep him out.\n\n\"I'm just trying to swallow that pride,\" he said.\n\nOTHER INJURIES\n\nTigers tight end Albert Okwuegbunam, a finalist for the John Mackey Award, has missed more than two games with a shoulder injury. He practiced a bit this week and could play, though Odom has promised not to jeopardize his future by rushing him back.\n\nFLIRTING WITH THE ENEMY\n\nArkansas defensive backs Kamren Curl and Ryan Pulley are suspended for this week's game after they were flirting with Mississippi State cheerleaders rather than warming up with the team last week. Both of them are starters.\n\n\"That's not something I would do, but some people have different focus,\" Razorbacks linebacker Dre Greenlaw said. \"I just hope everybody considers the seniors for this last game and plays their all, gives their all.\"\n\nSTATS DON'T LIE\n\nThe Tigers are 21-point favorites to beat Arkansas, and a closer look at where the Razorbacks rank statistically explains why. They are No. 113 nationally in total offense and No. 82 in total defense.\n\n\"I'm not worried about what their record is or isn't,\" Odom said. \"We need to prepare really, really well. They have good players, a really good staff. We know we'll get their best shot. We need to prepare and go play our game.\"\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS\n\nOdom wanted the stands packed on Senior Day, so he vowed to buy a ticket with his own money for anybody wanting to attend a game on the day after Thanksgiving. More than 1,000 tickets have been ordered and paid for by him.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The last week of the regular season in the Big Ten means a slate of rivalry games. (AP Photo/John Peterson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Barry Alvarez was pacing the sideline as coach the last time that Wisconsin lost Paul Bunyan's Axe to Minnesota.\n\nIt was 2003, but the empty feeling that comes with losing the rivalry game remains fresh. Losing stings.\n\nIt's all the education that younger fans and players need to understand why rivalry games remain important in the Big Ten.\n\nSchools from neighboring states. Rivalries that date to the 19th century. Families where some members attended one school and others \"the enemy.\"\n\nThe Midwest grudge match between Minnesota and Wisconsin may not resonate nationally, especially in years when the Gophers or Badgers aren't in the Big Ten title chase. But it's a border scrum that always draws regional interest, no matter the records.\n\n\"History is important, and naturally somebody that's been around and grew up in Wisconsin or Minnesota, they've known about the history, they take pride in the games. They want bragging rights,\" said Alvarez, now Wisconsin's athletic director. \"I think it's our job to educate our young people about it.\"\n\nThe teams meet for the 128th time on Saturday, the most-played rivalry in major college football going all the way back to 1890. Axe Week preparation for the Badgers includes playing a video in the locker room on an endless loop of the Badgers' victory celebrations. Wisconsin has won 14 straight in the series.\n\nMaybe it helps that the Badgers and Gophers have been geographic rivals for so long. A unique trophy axe and a ceremonial victory celebration in which the winner \"chops\" down the goal posts add to the allure.\n\nAt Nebraska, athletic director Bill Moos said he thinks that rivalry games don't resonate as much with younger fans because the postseason stakes aren't as high as decades ago.\n\n\"Because back in the day, for example when I was a player ... there were policies in place that if you didn't go to the Rose Bowl, you didn't go to a bowl game,\" Moos said. \"So when you played a rivalry game and you didn't have a bowl game to be playing for, then that was it.\"\n\nMoos, who became AD in October 2017, is trying to build a rivalry with Iowa, the Cornhuskers' opponent in their \"Black Friday\" game. Oklahoma and Colorado were Nebraska's opponents for the day-after-Thanksgiving game while in the Big 12.\n\nNow Nebraska will play Iowa on Black Friday for the eighth straight year.\n\n\"I'm big into rivalries, and season-ending rivalries, and I've been involved in them all my life as a kid, a player in college, an administrator and have always made sure that I protected those and in some instances tweaked them a little bit,\" Moos said. \"Those, I think, are a big part of college football.\"\n\nSome rivalries have fallen by the wayside, Moos noted, like Texas-Texas A&M and Nebraska-Oklahoma. Other longstanding matchups remain as strong as ever.\n\nThe Big Ten's biggest rivalry \u2014 The Game between Michigan and Ohio State \u2014 always draws attention because at least one team is almost always in the conversation for a league title or more.\n\nThe Purdue-Indiana rivalry for the Old Oaken Bucket this year has unique stakes in the Hoosier State showdown. The five-win teams need one more victory to become bowl eligible.\n\n\"Well, I think it's a great rivalry, especially for the fan base, especially for the people in the state of Indiana,\" Purdue coach Jeff Brohm said. \"I think both teams are trying hard to work their way up the ladder.\"\n\nIf the Gophers (5-6) pull an upset at Camp Randall Stadium, they get the bonus of becoming bowl eligible, too. But starting in 2020, Iowa will replace Minnesota as the final game on Wisconsin's schedule for a two-year stint, with the Axe game being moved to early October.\n\nAlvarez doesn't mind the move because he views Minnesota as a strong rival. He thinks fans will come no matter when or where the game is played.\n\n\"You like to think they are,\" Alvarez said when asked about the importance of rivalry games from a marketing perspective for an athletic department.\n\n\"You like to have their fans come down here and support their team and vice versa, have our people come up,\" Alvarez said. \"Even though it's a tough weekend, our students won't be here, it's Thanksgiving weekend \u2014 but you like the fact that it's a rivalry game that our fans will support. Both sets of fans.\"\n\n___\n\nAP College Football Writer Eric Olson in Lincoln, Nebraska, contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Michigan has lost six straight and 13 of the past 14 meetings but is four-point road favorite Saturday. Win here, and again next week over Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game, and the Wolverines should be playoff-bound. That's easier said than done. This is, after all, \"The Game.\" Ohio State (10-1, 7-1, No. 10 CFP) has not looked good the second half of the season but, though it would need some help, still has viable playoff hopes if it can beat Michigan and win the Big Ten.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nNebraska offense vs. Iowa defense\n\nThe Huskers' offense had over 450 total yards in seven straight games before being slowed down in the snow and cold in a win over Michigan State last week. Rain and temperatures in the 40s are forecast Friday in Iowa City. Adrian Martinez is one of the best freshmen in the country, and senior Devine Ozigbo is a 1,000-yard rusher. But the Huskers need injured WR JD Spielman back to complement Stanley Morgan Jr. Iowa is second in the Big Ten and sixth in the nation in total defense, and only two opponents have put up more than 400 yards. Iowa's defensive ends, particularly A.J. Epenesa, present a huge challenge.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nWith a win over Illinois, Northwestern would post its 15th victory in 16 Big Ten games to match the best 16-game stretch in program history. ... RB D.J. Knox, WR Rondale Moore and QB David Blough could pull off a first in the 130 years of Purdue football \u2014 a 1,000-yard rusher, a 1,000-yard receiver and a 3,000-yard passer. Knox needs 174 yards to make it happen. The other two have achieved their milestones. ... Indiana freshman RB Steve Scott has become the 19th Hoosier to reach 1,000 yards in a season. ... Lovie Smith made his mark as a defensive coach in the NFL, but his Illinois defenses have gotten worse each of his three seasons. The Illini national rankings have gone from 61st to 86th to 128th. This year's unit is allowing 520 yards per game. ... Michigan State has had four starting punters this season and is the only school in the nation to have five players punt. ... If Rutgers loses to MSU, it will mark the fourth time since 1997 the Scarlet Knights have finished with a win total of one or zero.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nMaryland is a 13 \u00bd point underdog at Penn State\n\nThe Terrapins (5-6, 3-5) need one win to get bowl eligible, which would be quite an accomplishment in a tumultuous season. The question is whether the Terps have much left in the tank after coming up just short last week in the 52-51 overtime loss to Ohio State. Penn State (8-3, 5-3) has beaten Maryland sounded two straight years. If Terps RB Anthony McFarland keeps playing like he has lately \u2014 508 yards the last two games \u2014 this could get interesting.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nWisconsin RB Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe national rushing leader needs 131 yards against Minnesota to hit 2,000 for the season after falling 23 yards short last season. Taylor has 714 yards over his last three games, including a national season-high 321 last week against Purdue. Minnesota has allowed more than 300 yards rushing to three opponents.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Penn State (8-3, 5-3) has beaten Maryland sounded two straight years. If Terps RB Anthony McFarland keeps playing like he has lately \u2014 508 yards the last two games \u2014 this could get interesting.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nWisconsin RB Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe national rushing leader needs 131 yards against Minnesota to hit 2,000 for the season after falling 23 yards short last season. Taylor has 714 yards over his last three games, including a national season-high 321 last week against Purdue. Minnesota has allowed more than 300 yards rushing to three opponents.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nA look at some key fantasy football questions for Week 12:\n\nWHICH UNDER THE RADAR PLAYERS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR A BIG GAME THIS WEEK?\n\nThe Buccaneers have given up multiple passing TDs to QBs in eight of their 10 games this season, giving 49ers QB Nick Mullens an opportunity this week. Browns QB Baker Mayfield has thrown for nine TDs and just two INTs in his last four games and takes on the Bengals, who have given up the second most total TDs and the second-most fantasy points per game (FPPG) to the QB position.\n\nThe Eagles may have been using a running back by committee approach this season, but Josh Adams' snaps have been on the rise and he is averaging 7 yards per carry over his past three games. He takes on the Giants in Week 12, and they've given up the eighth most FPPG to RBs.\n\nGiants WR Sterling Shepard has averaged just over six catches and 84 receiving yards and has scored four TDs in five games against the Eagles in his young career. The Eagles pass defense has been decimated by injuries and has given up the second-most FPPG to WRs.\n\nWith Buccaneers TE O.J. Howard being placed on injured reserve with an ankle injury, Cameron Brate should see an uptick in targets. QB Jameis Winston, who is starting for the Bucs again, likes to throw to his TEs.\n\nIS RAVENS RB GUS EDWARDS A VIABLE STARTER GOING FORWARD?\n\nWe recommended Ravens RB Alex Collins as a sneaky play last week due to his favorable matchup against the Bengals. Well, we were partially right: The Bengals are bad at defending against the run, but it was Edwards (who?!) \u2014 not Collins \u2014 who took advantage of Cincinnati's run defense. Collins hasn't done much to convince the Ravens that he deserves to be their top RB this season. Edwards is an undrafted free agent who had an unremarkable college career at Miami and Rutgers, but he deserves more playing time than Collins for at least another week.\n\nEdwards faces the Raiders this week, and they've given up 11 total TDs to RBs this season. From there, his next three opponents are top 6 in FPPG to RBs. In addition, if the Ravens continue to start Lamar Jackson at QB, expect them to run the ball often, providing Edwards plenty of opportunities. Opportunity doesn't always translate into fantasy production and we can't guarantee that Edwards will rush for another 115 yards and score a TD in Week 12, but you can put him in your lineup this week based on his favorable matchup. Take it one game at a time for now.\n\nWHICH QB HAS MORE FANTASY VALUE ON A WEEK TO WEEK BASIS, BALTIMORE'S LAMAR JACKSON OR WASHINGTON'S COLT MCCOY?\n\nIf the Ravens continue to start Jackson over Joe Flacco, he has more fantasy upside than McCoy. Jackson has a very favorable schedule going forward, with three of his next four opponents top five in FPPG allowed to QBs, and the other giving up the 12th-most FPPG to the position. Based on his first start, the Ravens may limit the amount of throws he makes until he grows into the job, but his ability to run (he has rushed for 117 yards) will likely provide a steady stream of fantasy points.\n\nMcCoy may not be the worst backup QB, but a large chunk of his supporting cast (Jamison Crowder, Chris Thompson and Josh Doctson) have been dealing with injuries all season long.\n\nCAN TOM BRADY TURN HIS SEASON AROUND?\n\nTom Brady is QB14 in terms of total fantasy points. That's not what you expected when you drafted him this preseason, considering he was the overall QB2 last season. Although he's 41 years old, you never should count Brady out. His peripheral stats are right about where they've always been and at 7-3, the Patriots are poised to win the AFC East again. The Pats don't care about your fantasy team and never will. Brady has produced year after year and even weathered the storm when Julian Edelman, his favorite receiver, missed the 2017 season due to injury.\n\nIt's been a different kind of year for Brady. When Sony Michel was healthy, New England was running the ball a lot more. That hurt Brady's fantasy stats. Perhaps the drop in Brady's fantasy production is directly tied to TE Rob Gronkowski's injury woes. The Pats are still winning and if Gronkowski can come back healthy after the bye, there's a good chance we'll see the Brady refocus, as he always seems to do when the stretch toward playoffs comes around.\n\nD.J. MOORE, TRE'QUAN SMITH AND CHRISTIAN KIRK HAVE ALL BEEN COMING ON AS OF LATE. WHICH ROOKIE WR CAN YOU TRUST AT THIS CRUCIAL PART OF THE FANTASY FOOTBALL SEASON?\n\nAll three rookie wideouts have a great deal of upside and are getting better as the season progresses. Although it's tough to like much about the Cardinals after they lost to the Raiders in Week 11, Christian Kirk has been the most consistent WR of the rookie trio. He's averaged six targets and just over 52 receiving yards over his past five games. Smith's season has been all over the place. He's had monster games and games where he wasn't even targeted. Moore has also been inconsistent.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 12 lineup tips and advice, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Thanks to the NFL's rules changes on kickoffs that were designed to reduce the risk of concussions, successful onside kicks have almost disappeared entirely from the game. (AP Photo/Michael Perez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Onside kicks have always been a bad bet, just not like this.\n\nThanks to the NFL's rules changes on kickoffs that were designed to reduce the risk of concussions, successful onside kicks have almost disappeared entirely from the game.\n\nKicking teams have recovered three of 34 onside attempts this season, an 8 percent success rate that pales in comparison to last year's 23 percent conversion rate when 13 of 55 onside kicks were recovered by the kicking team.\n\nOver the last decade, that success rate has hovered around 15 percent.\n\n\"It really has changed the game,\" Broncos special teams coach Tom McMahon said. \"It's really hard to get that ball now.\"\n\nThat's because teams can no longer overload to the left or right of the kicker, what special teams coaches used to call a \"see-saw\" formation.\n\nThey must have five players on each side now \u2014 two inside the hashmarks, two outside and one rover \u2014 and they can't be bunched up or get a running start anymore, either.\n\n\"You used to have six guys on one side, four on the other, and all kinds of formations and movement,\" McMahon said. \"Can't have any movement anymore. So, you know you're going to get a stagnant, five by five. Everything's balanced. And, not only is it balanced, (coverage players) have to be 1 yard away and can't even move, even if they time it perfectly, they can't move until the ball's kicked.\"\n\nWith six weeks left in the season, the NFL is on pace for the fewest onside recoveries (five) since 2009, when six of 41 onside kicks were recovered by the kicking team.\n\nYet, it's hard to imagine the league going back and tweaking the new rules to give the kicking team more of a shot.\n\n\"Those are some big collisions that happen if they have a running start,\" Denver kicker Brandon McManus said. \"So, it's going to be interesting how the competition committee does it because the numbers are going to be so low that obviously teams are going to be questioning whether there's any chance of a successful way to do it.\"\n\nOnly the Giants (1 for 4), Lions (1 for 3) and Jaguars (1 for 1) have been successful at onside kicks this season.\n\n\"Yeah, it's killed it, it's tough,\" McMahon said. \"Still, we've got to find a way. We can whine and cry, but we've got to find a way to get that ball somehow.\"\n\nHere's a look inside some more intriguing numbers with a terrific trio of Thanksgiving games kicking off Week 12:\n\nPOWER POINTS\n\nThe NFL has had the most points scored (7,791), most touchdowns (895) and most touchdown passes (570) through 11 weeks in its history. So far, half of the NFL's 32 teams have topped 40 points, including the Saints six times and the Chiefs four times.\n\nRemember that thriller in New England when the Chiefs lost 43-40 back in Week 6?\n\nKansas City is now the first team since the Giants in 1966 to lose twice when scoring 40 points. The Chiefs are averaging 34.8 points in their nine wins and 45.5 points in their two losses.\n\nDAZZLING DISPLAY\n\nSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger doesn't know what to make of that Chiefs-Rams slugfest Monday night.\n\n\"Crazy. It didn't even look real,\" he said. \"It looked like a college game out there.\"\n\nBut it wasn't all about the zippy offenses. Like those Big 12 shootouts where points pile up, a key stop can make all the difference.\n\nThree defensive touchdowns, eight sacks and seven takeaways all had as much to do with Rams 54, Chiefs 51 as did Jared Goff and Patrick Mahomes.\n\nOddities from the third-highest scoring game in league history:\n\n\u2014The 14 touchdowns were more than the Bills (13) have scored all season.\n\n\u2014The Rams put up 54 points on 455 yards of offense a day after the Buccaneers managed three points on 510 yards of offense in their 38-35 loss to the Giants.\n\n\u2014The Chiefs are the only one of 218 teams who were left lamenting a loss after putting up 50 points.\n\n\u2014And the combined 1,001 yards were 150 yards shy of the NFL record. The Patriots and Eagles combined for 1,151 yards in last season's Super Bowl , a number the Chiefs and Rams might have reached were it not for 21 flags that siphoned away 195 penalty yards.\n\nFAB FIVE\n\nLamar Jackson became the last of the five QB first-rounders to start when he subbed for an injured Joe Flacco and led the Ravens past the Bengals 24-21.\n\nJackson threw only 19 passes and ran 27 times, more rushing attempts than any QB since 1970 \u2014 and more rushes than Kareem Hunt (14) and Todd Gurley (12) combined for Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

These are two teams headed in different directions, as is the case when James leaves one team for another.\n\nCleveland, now 2-14, is bound for the lottery, which is exactly what should be happening: rebuild through the draft and with the young players on the roster.\n\nThe Lakers are rising. Maybe not yet good enough to compete for the Western Conference championship this season. Then again, who knows. The NBA is in Bizarro World right now. Memphis is atop the West standings, and Golden State has lost four consecutive games for the first time in the Steve Kerr era.\n\nAfter the Lakers\u2019 2-5 start, they have won eight of their past 10 games and are right alongside the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Denver Nuggets, Houston Rockets, New Orleans Pelicans and Sacramento Kings in the standings.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 LeBron finished with 32 points, 14 rebounds and 7 dimes in his return to Cleveland #LakersWinpic.twitter.com/Jn552AVs1d \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) November 22, 2018\n\nThey are far from a polished team, but they are getting better, and James is finding his offense. In the last four games, he has scored 44, 22, 51 and 32 points. In the past 10 games, he is averaging 29.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and six assists and shooting 53.7% from the field and 49.2% on 3-pointers.\n\nAs gracious as Cavs fans were, there had to be a forlorn feeling, watching James perform the way he did, the way he used to perform when he was with Cleveland the previous four seasons. They know what they\u2019re missing, and they know it\u2019s gone forever.\n\nThe Lakers trailed 96-87 with 7:33 remaining in the fourth quarter, and it seemed for a moment that the Cavs might just pull off and upset.\n\nBut James scored 10 of Los Angeles\u2019 next 17 points, assisted on a Kyle Kuzma 3-pointer and registered a hockey assist on a JaVale McGee layup that put the Lakers ahead for good.\n\nMore important than the outcome was the way he was received by fans and the organization \u2014 a much different experience than eight years ago when he returned to Cleveland for the first time with the Miami Heat. That was a vile, sinister night filled with profane behavior from fans who remained angry he left Cleveland.\n\n\"I'm a different person. We're all different,\" James said. \"It\u2019s all about growth, and we\u2019ve all grown from that moment eight years ago. I leave the past in the past, focus on the present and see what happens in the future.\"\n\nBut James admitted when he landed in Cleveland on Tuesday, the feeling was much different than it was when he arrived in Cleveland from Miami eight years ago.\n\nHate has been replaced by love.\n\nFans gave James a lengthy standing ovation when he was introduced as a starter. The public address announcer called his name with the kind of excitement reserved for the home team\u2019s starters.\n\nThe touching video tribute thanked James for bringing Cleveland the 2016 NBA championship and for what he does in the community. (He said visiting his I Promise School earlier in the day already left him feeling \"blessed and thankful.\")\n\nThe recognition from fans and the team was a moment he deserved.\n\n\"I appreciate these fans just as much as they appreciate me. Every single night we stepped out on the floor, they showed their appreciation to not only myself but my teammates for those 11 years, especially those last four years, those championship runs we were making. That was my salute to them for them appreciating what I was able to accomplish with my coaches and teammates.\"\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Vegas pleasantly surprised when weather forecast was wrong", "description": "Jhonattan Vegas woke up expecting the worst of Melbourne's weather after officials moved up the tee times by an hour to try to beat an expected rain in the afternoon.

It was a bonus. In this format, you make hay when the sun shines and we did that.\"\n\nGREAT UNDER PRESSURE\n\nAs New Zealand's top-ranked golfer at the World Cup, Ryan Fox had the choice to pick his partner, and he took 43-year-old veterarn Mark Brown when several other players were not available.\n\nBrown responded with a strong round Thursday to lead New Zealand to a 7-under 65 and tied for ninth.\n\n\"I was feeling a bit of pressure coming into this to try and justify Ryan picking me,\" Brown said. \"It was good to get off to a good start.\"\n\nFox was impressed.\n\n\"I think I made one birdie today, so it's pretty much all on Brownie,\" Fox said. \"Bernie played some great golf and it was good to see. He kind of needed to because my golf was terrible for the most part.\"\n\nDanny Lee withdrew from the event for New Zealand to spend time with his family. Michael Hendry was unable to commit with his Japan tour card in jeopardy.\n\nSTRONG FINISH FOR BELGIUM\n\nThomas Pieters and Thomas Detry birdied six of their last seven holes for a 9-under 63, a stroke behind the leaders, but it didn't always look like it was going to end that way.\n\nThey made five pars to open, then on the par-3 sixth, their tee shots were about 100 feet apart.\n\n\"We weren't that far away from thinking, 'OK, maybe it's now time to go back and close the season off right now,'\" Detry said.\n\nBut the Belgian pair saved par on that hole, then made three birdies to finish off the front nine, followed by their six of nine on the back.\n\n\"I disappeared for a couple of holes and we made a couple of good putts,\" Pieters said. \"Worked out perfect. We just want to go out there and have fun. It sounds like a cliche, but that's how you're going to play your best golf.\"\n\nINDIA STRONG IN MIDDLE\n\nAnirban Lahiri and Gaganjeet Bhullar were tied for seventh with Ireland after making five birdies in six holes on the front nine and another birdie on 18, giving them what Lahiri called an \"aggressive\" 64.\n\n\"I think both of us felt we should have made three or four more birdies coming in,\" Lahiri said. \"We missed a few, but you have to feed off each other's energy.\"\n\nOn Friday, it will be alternate shot, or foursomes.\n\n\"I think the mindset changes overnight,\" Lahiri said. \"We've played this quite a bunch, Eurasia Cups...

Vladislav Kamenev and Colin Wilson also scored on the power play, and Patrik Nemeth, Tyson Barrie, Nikita Zadorov and Matt Calvert scored at even strength.\n\nAlexander Kerfoot had three assists, and Mikko Rantanen remained the league's scoring leader with two assists to increase his total to 34 points. Tyler Jost and Carl Soderbeg both had two assists while MacKinnon and Kamenev had multipoint games.\n\n\"It brings a lot of confidence when you score that many goals. We just dominated pretty much the whole game,\" said Colorado goaltender Semyon Varlamov, who made 33 saves.\n\nKyle Clifford scored for Los Angeles while Matt Luff and Austin Wagner each had a goal and an assist. Cal Petersen allowed six goals on 31 shots before leaving early in the third and Peter Budaj allowed one goal on three shots.\n\n\"I don't know what to say what happened,\" Kings captain Anze Kopitar said. \"I mean there's no emotion, no energy, you know nothing and it's unacceptable.\"\n\nKamenev and Clifford exchanged first-period goals, and the Avalanche retook the lead 50 seconds after Clifford's equalizer. Landeskog fed MacKinnon with a pinpoint pass from behind the net seconds into a power play, the first of six straight goals for Colorado.\n\nNemeth extended the lead with a 57-foot wrist shot, Wilson netted his power-play goal, and Barrie and Zadorov chased Peterson with goals less than two minutes apart in the third. Calvert redirected Barrie's pass past Budaj before Luff scored on a one-timer and Wagner got his first NHL goal.\n\nNOTES: Barrie has six-game point streak. ...

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCALGARY, Alberta (AP) \u2014 Sam Bennett is taking advantage of increased playing time.\n\nBennett had the go-ahead goal and an assist, and the Calgary Flames scored five times in the first period again to beat the Winnipeg Jets 6-3 on Wednesday night.\n\nCalgary took the lead for good at 8:20 of the first when Bennett ripped a 25-foot wrist shot into the top corner for his second goal in two games. Next shift out, he combined with TJ Brodie to set up a goal by Matthew Tkachuk.\n\n\"I've wanted this opportunity for a while and I said I'd make the most of it. I'm not going to let my foot off the pedal now,\" Bennett said. \"The confidence is definitely pretty good right now. I feel confident in my plays and I'm able to make plays and not be scared to make mistakes. It's a great feeling.\"\n\nDillon Dube, Mark Jankowski, Johnny Gaudreau and Derek Ryan, with an empty netter, also scored as Calgary (13-8-1) moved back into first place in the Pacific Division.\n\nThe Flames became the fourth team in NHL history and first in nearly 30 years to score five or more goals in consecutive first periods. Calgary also scored five times in the first Monday against Vegas in a 7-2 win.\n\nThe St. Louis Blues were the last team to accomplish the feat back in November 1989.\n\n\"It was just embarrassing,\" Winnipeg forward Patrik Laine said. \"That's not the Winnipeg Jets. That's not the way we want to play this game. It was bad. It was real bad.\"\n\nElevated to the second line alongside Tkachuk and Mikael Backlund to start the homestand, Bennett remains in that spot. The fourth pick in the 2014 draft has earned accolades from his coach and teammates in helping the Flames win three of their past four games.\n\n\"He's playing awesome right now,\" Tkachuk said. \"I love how heavy and physical he's been. He's creating more space for myself and (Backlund), but he's creating more space for himself as well. You saw his speed on that breakaway in the third.\"\n\nIt was the first multipoint game of the season for Bennett. Half of his eight points have come in the past four games.\n\n\"Benny is one of those guys, he's a young guy still, he's getting comfortable with what he brings to the table,\" Flames coach Bill Peters said. \"He's got a real bright future. We've said all along, we've liked him, we've liked him a lot. His competitiveness has led to the opportunity of playing more and he's capitalized on that.\"\n\nMaking his third consecutive start with struggling Mike Smith on the bench, David Rittich finished with 37 saves to improve to 8-1-0. He's won five straight.\n\nLaine scored two goals and Brandon Tanev had the other one for Winnipeg (12-6-2).\n\n\"There was quite a bit that didn't go our way tonight,\" captain Blake Wheeler said. \"Some of that was self-inflicted and some of it, the puck just wasn't bouncing our way.\"\n\nTanev took advantage of poor defensive coverage and scored on his own rebound just 15 seconds into the game.\n\nDube's first NHL goal tied it less than two minutes later. He ended his drought in his 17th game, firing Jankowski's centering pass behind goalie Connor Hellebuyck.\n\nTkachuk's shot leaked through Hellebuyck's glove, making it 3-1 and ending the evening for the Jets goaltender. He exited after giving up three goals on nine shots.\n\n\"We've got three in a row right now and I think everyone in our locker room feels great,\" Rittich said.\n\nDown 5-1, Winnipeg started to chip away at the lead, beginning with Laine's one-timer with 14 seconds remaining in the second period.\n\nOn a nearly identical-looking goal, only this time on the power play and off a setup by Dustin Byfuglien, Laine's 13th of the season 6:17 into the third drew the Jets within two.\n\nLaurent Brossoit stopped 14 shots in relief of Hellebuyck. He took the loss to fall to 3-1-1.\n\nNOTES: Flames forward Michael Frolik (lower body) was scratched and replaced by Austin Czarnik. ... Calgary entered the night as the only NHL team to have five players with at least 20 points. ... For the Jets, it was just the second regulation loss in their last 20 games against Pacific Division opponents (15-2-3).\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJets: Have split the first two games of a four-game trip that continues Friday in Minnesota.\n\nFlames: Play at Vegas on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Here\u2019s what they had to say about the pick.\n\nArtie Burns is looking like a bust, and Joe Haden isn\u2019t getting any younger. Linebacker is also a big need, but the Steelers\u2019 lack of playmaking ability at corner has been exposed in 2018. Murphy is just a redshirt sophomore, but he\u2019s talented enough to make the early jump and still merit a first-round pick.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about Murphy before and our opinion of him is largely unchanged. There\u2019s no doubt he has flashed some excellent coverage skills and being so young has a ton of upside. But he will definitely benefit from an NFL weight program. But without a doubt cornerback is a top need.\n\nIn the second round, the Steelers are taking Buffalo linebacker Khalil Hodge.

The Apple Stores have a similar, more widespread system that eliminates cash registers in the store. Instead, associates greet customers anywhere in the store and accept payment via a specially-equipped iPhone-like device.\n\nHowever, there are just over 500 Apple Stores compared with over 5,000 Walmart stores, which are way, way larger than the average Apple Store.\n\nAdditionally, Target is also touting mobile in-store payments with a \u201cSkip the Line\u201d checkout experience that the company says is in all Target stores. \"Team members simply scan any item in a guest\u2019s basket or shopping cart and accept payment by credit card on the spot from anywhere in the store,\" says Target.\n\nAt Walmart, customers can pay with traditional credit card or download the Walmart app, put in their credit card information and just scan the product with the app instead, shaving time off the checkout process.\n\nAll in all, Walmart customers at busy stores will be able to deduct 10 to 15 minutes from the line process by using the mobile checkout, says Tony Amirikhass, the Southgate Walmart store manager.\n\n\"We have every register open\" during the holidays, he says. \"Our baskets are very large. We're a high-volume store, and it takes three to five minutes per transaction. So yeah, there's a big time-saving.\"\n\nShopper alert: The mobile checkout is aimed at those with small purchases of a handful of items, like big electronics or a toy or two, not a person with 50 to 100 items. \"We check you out there, and you're gone,\" Amirikhass says.\n\nIn 2017, e-tail giant Amazon unveiled what's considered the future of shopping with the Go stores in Seattle. These 7-Eleven size convenience stores have no cash registers, but instead use cameras, sensors and an app to track purchases.

Their lineup has been decimated by injuries, and they've fallen short in close games with a dismaying regularity.\n\nWhen they held off the Vancouver Canucks on Wednesday night by showing all the late-game poise they've lacked, the Ducks found themselves in third place in the Pacific Division in spite of it all.\n\nRyan Getzlaf had a goal and an assist, John Gibson made 25 saves for his 100th career victory and the Ducks snapped a three-game losing streak with a 4-3 win over the skidding Canucks.\n\nOndrej Kase, Adam Henrique and Kalle Kossila also scored for the Ducks, who had lost 12 of 15 since the last time they scored four goals in a game back on Oct. 17.\n\nEven while Anaheim has struggled through these injury-plagued five weeks, the Ducks have still collected enough overtime points to stay in the Pacific race. This win pushed them past Vancouver and into third place, a mere four points off the lead.\n\nIt's only November, but the standings matter to the Ducks, who are thrilled to be keeping pace.\n\n\"When you get in tough times, it's nice to look and understand that it's a long season and there is time to turn it around,\" said Getzlaf, who is Anaheim's leading scorer despite missing six games with injuries. \"Luckily enough, our division hasn't pulled away from us at the start of the year here. So we're getting points. We're scrapping and clawing, and we just keep going.\"\n\nKase scored on a pass by defenseman Josh Mahura, who earned his first NHL point in his second game.\n\nThe Ducks are playing without injured defensemen Hampus Lindholm and Cam Fowler, forcing them to use four rookie blueliners \u2014 including Mahura \u2014 who have all played in fewer than 50 career games. Anaheim hadn't used four rookie defensemen in the same game since the 1994-95 season, but coach Randy Carlyle must improvise in the absence of his two team leaders in minutes played.\n\n\"We've got to stick together in here,\" said Henrique, who scored early in the third period. \"Some teams fall apart in the dressing room, and we're sticking together.

Eventually we're going to break through.\"\n\nPouliot scored early in the second period on a slick cross-ice pass from Sam Gagner, who got his first point since returning to the Canucks. After scoring 31 points for Vancouver last season, Gagner was waived Oct. 1 and eventually sent to the AHL, only to be recalled last weekend when injuries drastically thinned the Canucks' forward lines.\n\nJacob Markstrom stopped 32 shots as Vancouver failed to rally from a late two-goal deficit and remained winless since Nov. 8 despite pushing aggressively for a tying goal in the final minutes.\n\n\"It didn't feel like the last game, that's for sure,\" Canucks coach Travis Green said of a 6-3 home loss to Winnipeg on Monday. \"I liked our push at the end. It was a close game. We've got to find a way. We're making a couple of little mistakes that are costing us, and we've got to clean that up.\"\n\nKossila put the Ducks up 4-2 midway through the third period when he converted a pass in the slot from Brian Gibbons for his first goal of the season and second of his NHL career. Gibbons' assist was his first point in 17 games with Anaheim.\n\nHorvat scored his 11th goal on a deflection with 4:44 left to keep Vancouver in it.\n\nNOTES: Anaheim has won three straight home games against Vancouver, matching its franchise record in the rivalry. ... The Canucks are without five injured regulars, including star Brock Boeser, who missed his ninth straight game with a groin injury. ... Lindholm missed his second consecutive game with a lower-body injury. Fowler is out indefinitely with broken bones in his face after getting hit by a puck. ... Gibson became the fourth goalie to win 100 games with the Ducks, joining Jean-Sebastien Giguere (206), Guy Hebert (173) and Jonas Hiller (162).\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDucks: Host Edmonton on Friday.\n\nCanucks: At San Jose on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA loaded holiday slate of NFL games features one team with the second-best record in the NFL, three teams in first place in their respective divisions and one battle that will determine which squad sits atop its division by the end of the day.\n\nHere are three keys for each Thanksgiving game:\n\nBears (7-3) at Lions (4-6) (12:30 p.m. ET, CBS)\n\n1. Daniel's turn to take over\n\nJust two weeks ago, these two teams played in Chicago, with the Bears dominating, 34-22. But quarterback Mitchell Trubisky is doubtful for the Bears with a shoulder injury, leaving Chase Daniel likely to take over the starting role. A 10th-year veteran, Daniel has only two starts and 78 pass attempts in his career. If he can find his rhythm within the offense (he's familiar with Matt Nagy's attack after serving as a backup in Kansas City), Daniel could have a favorable setup against Detroit. Receiver Allen Robinson II (six catches 133 yards, two TDs) had his best outing of the season in the earlier meeting with the Lions.\n\n2. Detroit's ground game\n\nRookie running back Kerryon Johnson (641 yards and three touchdowns on 118 carries) has been a bright spot for the Lions. But he suffered a knee injury and coach Matt Patricia said has been ruled out for Thursday's game. Detroit\u2019s options for replacing him aren\u2019t great, with LeGarrette Blount \u2013 the next leading rusher \u2013 having just 183 yards this year.\n\n3. Slow the Chicago pass rush\n\nThe Bears are tied for fifth in the NFL with 32 sacks this season (with linebacker Khalil Mack accounting for a quarter of them). The pass rush sets the tone for the entire defense and allows the secondary to clamp down on targets. The Lions' offense has given up 30 sacks so far this season. Limiting pressure and disruption will be essential for Detroit.\n\nRedskins (6-4) at Cowboys (5-5) (4:30 p.m. ET, FOX)\n\n1. McCoy needs to manage the game\n\nWith Alex Smith out for the season, Washington\u2019s playoff hopes rest on the right arm of Colt McCoy, who hasn\u2019t started a game since Week 15 of 2014. The coaching staff has expressed confidence in the ninth-year veteran. He\u2019s mobile, knows coach Jay Gruden\u2019s system, and is fairly accurate, but above all else he needs to protect the ball.\n\n2. Quicker Prescott passes\n\nIn large part due to injuries, Dallas' offensive line hasn\u2019t played to the level that it had in previous seasons. The Cowboys are tied for 29th in the NFL with 34 sacks allowed, though they gave up just two last week against the Falcons. Still, quarterback Dak Prescott has the NFL\u2019s third-highest time to throw, taking an average of 2.97 seconds for him to release the ball. To mitigate the O-line\u2019s struggles, quicker passes would help.\n\n3. Strength on strength\n\nDallas owns the NFL\u2019s fourth-best rushing offense (133.3 yards a game). Washington ranks sixth (95.7) in stopping the run. And because the Cowboys offense flows through the legs of running back Ezekiel Elliott, if Washington can stifle what Dallas does on the ground (after holding the former to a season-low 33 yards on 15 carries in the first meeting this season), it could prompt Prescott to force throws down the field. Receiver Amari Cooper has opened up the offense, but it\u2019s the Cowboys rushing attack that likely determines the outcome in the battle for first in the NFC East.\n\nFalcons (4-6) at Saints (9-1) (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC)\n\n1. Hands up\n\nSaints quarterback Drew Brees has the quickest release (an average of 2.57 seconds) in the NFL. He has thrown 25 touchdowns and just one interception. The Saints have allowed a league-low nine sacks. Atlanta\u2019s best shot to disrupt the passing game is to knock passes down at the line of scrimmage.\n\n2. Slow it down\n\nThe Falcons have a solid offense, but they'll struggle to keep up with New Orleans (NFL-best 37.8 points a game) in a track meet. The problem is that the Saints also lead the league in time of possession (33:34) and rank sixth in rushing (131.4 yards a game). Atlanta's ground game hasn't fared well (29th with 88.8 yards per game) and the Saints rank second in stopping the run (77.9), so a quick passing game could help move the chains and keep the ball out of Brees\u2019 hands.\n\n3. Special teams and turnovers\n\nThe Falcons have to protect the football. But if they can force New Orleans into committing some turnovers, it will be imperative to turn those opportunities into points. Atlanta also will need try to create scoring opportunities in the kicking and punt return game \u2013 that is \u2013 if the Saints punt at all. Thomas Morstead has a league-low 21 punts and had two games this season in which New Orleans never punted.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Bouyea with 14 points, San Francisco edges Harvard 61-57", "description": "Jamaree Bouyea scored 14 points and grabbed seven rebounds and San Francisco held on late to edge Harvard 61-57", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/22/bouyea-with-14-points-san-francisco-edges-harvard-61-57/38584383/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T05:27:04Z", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Jamaree Bouyea scored 14 points and grabbed seven rebounds and San Francisco held on late to edge Harvard 61-57 on Wednesday night.

Taiwan will vote on a referendum this month asking if the self-ruled island should compete as \u201cTaiwan\u201d instead of the present \u201cChinese Taipei.\u201d This would include the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The controversial referendum has angered China, which sees Taiwan as a breakaway province. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAthletes from Taiwan compete at the Olympics under the name of a make-believe country: Chinese Taipei. They march behind an imaginary national flag and, if they win a gold medal, hear an \"alternate national anthem\" being played.\n\nImagine if France or Australia had to use an assumed name at the Olympics, or the United States and Japan were banned from flying their flags.\n\nA referendum to challenge this will be held in Taiwan on Saturday. It asks if the self-governing island should compete in international sports events \u2014 including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics \u2014 as \"Taiwan\" instead of \"Chinese Taipei.\"\n\n\"We are the sole IOC member banned from using our own country's name,\" said Chi Cheng, a bronze medalist in the 1968 Olympics. \"We are the only member who cannot sing our national anthem and fly our national flag. We are the only one. This shows how seriously China is suppressing us.\"\n\nNo matter what voters want, nothing is likely to change.\n\nChina's authoritarian government has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since the two separated in the 1949 civil war. The International Olympic Committee backs China, which will host the 2022 Winter Olympics after spending $40 billion on the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, the IOC said it will not alter a 1981 agreement that Taiwan must compete as Chinese Taipei. Its executive board repeated that stance in meetings on May 2-3.\n\n\"The agreement remains unchanged and fully applicable,\" the IOC said.\n\nThat puts the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee in a bind.\n\nIf the referendum passes, it could be required by Taiwanese law to go ahead with the name change pending approval from the legislature.\n\nBut in a statement to AP, it said \"we are bound by the Olympic Charter, the agreement we signed with the IOC in 1981, and also by the IOC executive board decision.\"\n\nTaiwan's athletes are caught in the middle. Dozens protested Wednesday, fearing they could lose their chance to participate in the Olympics.\n\nEven if Taiwan was booted out, the IOC has frequently let athletes compete under an independent Olympic flag.\n\nJacqueline Yi-ting Shen, the secretary general of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, declined to comment for this article. But she spoke about Taiwan's predicament in an interview with the AP at the Asian Games in August.\n\n\"This gives us a chance to compete and make our strength known internationally, so we accept the pity that we have to compete under the name of Chinese Taipei,\" Shen said.\n\nShe added: \"I'm sure that many people (in Taiwan) feel dismayed. But quite a lot understand that it is the reality in the international sporting realm. If we use our own name, we will lose the chance for our athletes. They will lose the playground, or the showcase they have. The right of our athletes to compete is our utmost concern. And I think most Taiwanese understand that.\"\n\nMa Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, told a news conference this month that Taiwan was using the name issue to \"politicize\" sports. He said the referendum would damage Taiwan's interests but gave no details of measures Beijing might take.\n\nEarlier, China warned that Taiwan would \"swallow its own bitter fruit\" over the referendum issue.\n\nTaiwan's ruling party, the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party led by President Tsai Ing-wen, has remained largely silent on the name change.\n\n\"There are international constraints on her (Tsai),\" Dachi Liao, who teaches political science at National Sun Yat-sen University, told the AP. \"She cannot speak out loudly on this; maybe doing something subtly, but never speaking out.\"\n\nLiao said the referendum is a proxy vote on independence, and China fears it could echo in the ethnic-minority regions of Tibet and Xinjiang.\n\n\"People who support changing the name, many of these supporters are pro-independence,\" Liao said. \"The pro-independence people are feeling upset, so they try to find an opportunity to promote this kind of issue even though they know it may not pass.\"\n\nChina has thwarted Taiwan's every move to assert its independence, even in the sporting sphere. Earlier this year, Taiwan lost the right to hold the East Asian Youth Games, under reported pressure from China.\n\nTaiwan held the Summer University Games last year with about 7,500 athletes. China skipped the opening ceremony, but competed in the events. Athletes from Argentina unfurled Taiwan's real flag at the closing ceremony, waving an independence symbol that Taiwan athletes are forbidden from displaying.\n\nThe Argentines were reprimanded for breaking Olympic rules, but warmly applauded inside the stadium.\n\nChina has warned international airlines and hotels not to use the word \"Taiwan\" on maps or other material.\n\nThe referendum needs one-quarter of Taiwan's 19 million voters to be approved. Liao, the political scientist, doubts it will reach that threshold. If it does, the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee is likely to ask its membership what to do.\n\nIt risks IOC censure if it moves ahead. The IOC is reported to have warned it at least three times not to proceed. If it backs down, it's thwarting the democratic will of Taiwan voters.\n\n\"It's insulting to us because everyone knows we are Taiwan,\" George Chang, the former mayor of Tainan and a referendum organizer, told AP. \"Chinese Taipei is not an area or a country. What is Chinese Taipei? Nobody knows. So let Taiwan be Taiwan.\"\n\nTaiwan participated in the 1972 games as the Republic of China. It boycotted the next several after its United Nations seat was handed to China, returning in 1984 after submitting to the name change and China's rising clout.\n\nDespite the roadblocks, the island of 24 million remains a regional power and placed seventh in the recent Asian Games, fielding a delegation of 550 and boasting stars like badminton's No. 1-ranked woman Tai Tzu-ying.\n\nAlexander C. Huang, who teaches political science at Tamkang University in Taiwan, said the island only faces more isolation if it challenges China.\n\n\"Taiwan does not have much leverage or support our noble cause, to get our name right or to get our flag flying,\" he said. \"Maybe in the future ... the atmosphere would lead us to that eventual goal.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The Vegas Golden Knights couldn't put away the Arizona Coyotes in regulation time, but they dominated overtime and picked up an important divisional win.\n\nMax Pacioretty stuffed in a rebound at 3:36 of overtime, and the Golden Knights beat the Coyotes 3-2 Wednesday night.\n\nThe goal was the second of the night for Pacioretty, who also scored in the second period. Tomas Nosek also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury had 19 saves for Vegas.\n\nVegas had five shots in the extra period; Arizona had none.\n\n\"We know how many divisional games we have here coming up,\" Pacioretty said. \"They're all important.

Both teams have picked up points in three of their last five games.\n\nStepan scored at 19:08 of the first period and with 6:49 left in the third period. His second goal tied the game at 2-all. On the power play, Alex Galchenyuk fed Stepan, who had plenty of open net.\n\nThe Coyotes got another power play with 1:55 to play, but couldn't convert before the end of regulation.\n\n\"There's some positives to take out of the power play scoring a big goal for us,\" Stepan said. \"We scored a big goal to give our team a chance to win the hockey game. ... We go forward with that.\"\n\nVegas lost a chance for a two-goal lead early in the third period. Cody Eakin's apparent goal was reviewed and overturned when teammate Alex Tuch was ruled offside.\n\nThe first period saw some hard hitting by both teams and a brief tussle between Coyotes center Brad Richardson and Golden Knights center William Karlsson. Arizona's Christian Fischer had a shot bounce off the post late in the period.\n\nStepan scored his fifth goal of the season with 52 seconds left in the first, when he redirected Jakob Chychrun's shot past Fleury for a 1-0 Coyotes lead.\n\nChychrun, playing in just his second game of the season, recorded his first point.\n\nNosek took a pass from Reilly Smith and beat Kuemper with a shot over his glove at 5:50 of the second period, tying the game.\n\nThe Coyotes just missed regaining the lead at the 11:32 mark of the second when Clayton Keller broke away with a long pass from Oliver Ekman-Larsson and hit the post with his shot.\n\nPacioretty started the play that led to his goal late in the second period.

(AP Photo/Chris Nicoll) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 After all but the last couple of Sacramento Kings had exited the locker room, coach Dave Joerger stood in the doorway and couldn't stop smiling as his center walked toward him.\n\n\"That was one hell of game, Willie Cauley-Stein,\" Joerger said. \"Yes, one hell of a game.\"\n\nCauley-Stein had faced the NBA's reigning defensive player of year, Rudy Gobert, and didn't flinch. He just nodded at his coach as if it were no big deal.\n\n\"I'm faster than him and more elusive. So I just play my game. I'm the same size as him, so I'm not real worried about his length,\" said Cauley-Stein, who scored 23 points to help Sacramento beat the Utah Jazz 119-110 on Wednesday night.\n\n\"I give him a lot of misdirection and then I get into his body so he can't jump,\" he added. \"I'm not afraid.\"\n\nAt a time in the game when previous Kings teams would wilt, this Sacramento squad outhustled, outmuscled and outshot the Jazz in the middle of the fourth quarter.\n\nNemanja Bjelica made a 3-pointer with 4:56 remaining to finish a 16-1 run that turned a two-point game into a 105-88 lead.\n\n\"You lose games when you stop playing hard and start trying to hold the ball. If you try and stall out the game, you're going to lose,\" said Cauley-Stein, who shot 11 for 15. \"We want to keep being aggressive.\"\n\nJust when Sacramento looked to be in total control, the Jazz mustered a last-gasp rally. Donovan Mitchell scored 14 points in less than 3\u00bd minutes to bring Utah to 114-110.\n\n\"We have the fight in us,\" Mitchell said. \"We've got to do that, not when we're down 15 or 17. ... We've got to do it from the beginning of the game.\"\n\nBjelica, who had 18 points, converted a three-point play and Iman Sumpert made two free throws to finish off the Jazz, who have lost four of five. Bogdan Bogdanovich also scored 18.\n\nDe'Aaron Fox added 17 points and 13 assists for the Kings, who snapped a six-game losing streak to Utah.\n\n\"We kept playing at our pace. In close games, guys don't want to run anymore,\" Fox said. \"It's hard to beat us if we're playing at that pace while we're still executing.\"\n\nMitchell scored 35 points and awakened the Jazz, who seemed to be slogging through the game until their late surge. Jae Crowder added 16 for Utah.\n\nThe Kings, quicker to loose balls and crisp on their offensive sets, led by as many as 15 in the first half.\n\nRicky Rubio missed his first seven shots and then suddenly made three in a row in the third quarter. His last shot \u2014 a floating 19-foot jumper \u2014 gave the Jazz their first lead since the opening moments at 72-71.\n\nThe Kings quickly regained the lead but couldn't extend their advantage to double digits until Fox got into the lane on back-to-back possessions for tough floaters that started the Kings' surge in the final period.\n\nGOING THE DISTANCE\n\n\"Just keep running is the biggest thing for us. Don't stop,\" Joerger said before the game. \"By the end of the game we're able to run teams down. It's opening up transition shots.\" The Kings outscored the Jazz 14-9 in fast-break points.\n\nAfter the game, Fox added: \"With the way that we're playing, we're getting down the court faster than their five. If we have numbers, my job is just to find who's open. The game has definitely slowed down for me and I'm able to make that pass and guys are making shots.\"\n\nWHERE'S THE DEFENSE?\n\nAfter leading the NBA in defensive efficiency last season, the Jazz are having trouble stopping anyone.\n\n\"We have to be able to defend better to win,\" coach Quin Snyder said. \"If I could point to one thing, it's our communication. That's the thing that links you together and makes you be able to defend as a group.\"\n\nGobert is pointing at himself.\n\n\"I think it starts with me. The guys need me. I have to show up and bring the intensity,\" he said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKings: Sacramento's offense seemed one step ahead of the scrambling Utah defense all night, shooting 53 percent from the field and 44 percent on 3-pointers. ... Bogdanovich has scored in double figures in five straight games. He missed the first 10 games of the season.\n\nJazz: After Crowder made a 3-pointer while getting fouled, he rested on his back for a bit and got high-fives from several delighted fans in the front row. ... Utah never led by more than two after Gobert started the game with a dunk. Gobert finished with 13 points and 15 rebounds. ... The Jazz shot 12 for 39 from 3-point range.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKings: At the Golden State Warriors on Saturday evening.\n\nJazz: Visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Apple Stores have a similar, more widespread system that eliminates cash registers in the store. Instead, associates greet customers anywhere in the store and accept payment via a specially-equipped iPhone-like device.\n\nHowever, there are just over 500 Apple Stores compared with over 5,000 Walmart stores, which are way, way larger than the average Apple Store.\n\nAdditionally, Target is also touting mobile in-store payments with a \u201cSkip the Line\u201d checkout experience that the company says is in all Target stores. \"Team members simply scan any item in a guest\u2019s basket or shopping cart and accept payment by credit card on the spot from anywhere in the store,\" says Target.\n\nAt Walmart, customers can pay with traditional credit card or download the Walmart app, put in their credit card information and just scan the product with the app instead, shaving time off the checkout process.\n\nAll in all, Walmart customers at busy stores will be able to deduct 10 to 15 minutes from the line process by using the mobile checkout, says Tony Amirikhass, the Southgate Walmart store manager.\n\n\"We have every register open\" during the holidays, he says. \"Our baskets are very large. We're a high-volume store, and it takes three to five minutes per transaction.

I didn't think we would come out, in any way, shape or form, and not be ready to play this game,\" McCaffery said of his team's fast start. \"We took care of it.\"\n\nIowa, which vaulted into the Top 25 on Monday after beating then-No. 13 Oregon and blowing out UConn in New York last week, scored the game's first 12 points on its way to the rout.\n\nWieskamp, the reigning prep player of the year in Iowa, broke his previous career high of 15 points midway through the first half in helping the Hawkeyes stake out a 30-11 lead \u2014 after combining for just five points against the Ducks and Huskies.\n\n\"He was really aggressive, and that's what we want him to be,\" McCaffery said of Wieskamp, perhaps his highest-ranked recruit. \"He puts it on the deck, he shoots the 3, he's aggressive on the glass. Incredibly versatile.\"\n\nThe Hawkeyes pulled Wieskamp and the rest of the starters with 14 minutes to go, content to cruise to their fifth straight win.\n\n\"Right after we got back I was in the gym working. It bothered me a bit to struggle, but I thought I did good things defensively to help our team win,\" Wieskamp said. \"I know what I'm capable offensively.\"\n\nReginald Gee had 16 points to lead Alabama State (2-3).\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE:\n\nIowa: It's been five games and Iowa continues to look like a brand-new team despite returning nearly everyone from last year's 14-19 debacle of a season. The Hawks' flow is better on both ends of the floor, and Garza continues his quiet push toward becoming one of the nation's best big men.\n\nAlabama State: The Hornets won't play another home game until January 5. It looks like it'll be a long five weeks.\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nGarza and Wieskamp combined to make 14 of 15 shots, with Garza shooting 8 for 8. ...Iowa didn't need much from Jordan Bohannon. The junior, who entered play averaging 12 points a game, didn't score. ...Walk-on Austin Ash got the crowd going by draining a late 3 for his first career bucket. ... Connor McCaffery had nine points and seven assists in just 13 minutes.\n\nTHE RANKINGS\n\nThis is the earliest Iowa has been ranked in a season since Nov. 14, 2005. That team, coached by Steve Alford, won the Big Ten tournament before being stunned by 14th-seeded Northwestern State in the opening round of the NCAAs. ...The last time the Hawkeyes were ranked was in the final poll of 2016. They were 25th.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa hosts Pittsburgh in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge on Nov. 27.\n\nAlabama State plays at Akron on Nov. 28.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Eric Staal ensured two solid periods didn't go to waste for the Minnesota Wild.\n\nStaal scored his second goal of the game with 5:58 left and Minnesota overcame a sloppy third period to beat the Ottawa Senators 6-4 on Wednesday night.\n\nMatt Dumba also scored twice as the Wild ended a two-game slide and won for the 12th time in 17 games. Mikael Granlund had three assists.\n\n\"We gutted it out and got the job done,\" Staal said. \"It doesn't matter how you do it.\"\n\nDown by three to start the final period, Ottawa's Thomas Chabot made it 4-2 with a short-handed goal 24 seconds in. Christian Jaros scored his first career goal midway through the period, and Colin White scored 83 seconds later to tie it and send Wild goaltender Devan Dubnyk to the bench.\n\n\"I've never made that change in my life. I don't want to make that change,\" Minnesota coach Bruce Boudreau said. \"But I thought we needed a break, and we needed something without calling a timeout. Sometimes you call a timeout and that energizes the other team because they think you're afraid.\"\n\nOn the winner, Jason Zucker controlled the puck behind the Ottawa net before blindly sending a backhand pass in front. Charging down the slot, Staal put the puck behind Craig Anderson.\n\nEric Fehr added an empty-net goal, and Alex Stalock made one save down the stretch to get the win.\n\n\"It just kind of feels like a waste,\" said Chris Tierney, who also scored for Ottawa. \"You work that hard to get back and to give it up a couple minutes later is a sour feeling.\"\n\nThis was the start of a four-game trip for the Senators.\n\nThe Wild were 2 for 4 on the power play against the league's worst short-handed team. Ottawa is at 67.1 percent on the penalty kill.\n\nStaal scored Minnesota's second power-play goal on a one-timer from the slot six minutes into the second period with a follow-through that dropped him to one knee for a 3-0 lead.\n\nDumba scored on the man advantage with 9.9 seconds left in the first period.\n\nMinnesota has scored at least one power-play goal in five straight games (seven goals) and 10 of its past 13, going 14 for 47 in that span.\n\n\"We showed that we can score goals, but we also showed that we're far away from having a defensive awareness and everything that we need to do defensively to be able to win games on a regular basis,\" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said.\n\nScoring 3.59 goals per game, Ottawa trails only Tampa Bay, but the Senators allow a league-worst 4.27.\n\nTierney scored on a tap-in midway through the second period to get the Senators within 3-1, but Dumba countered with a long shot late in the second.\n\nDumba has five goals and two assists during a career high-tying five-game point streak. His 10 goals are a league high for defenseman, and his four power-play goals are also best by a blue liner. He's the sixth defenseman since 1989-90 with 10 or more goals through 22 team games, joining Shea Weber, Al MacInnis, Ray Bourque, Gary Suter and Jeff Brown.\n\nDumba, who had a career-high 14 last season, is on pace for 39.\n\n\"Yeah, that'd be something else,\" Dumba said with a laugh. \"That's not happening.\"\n\nThe Wild and Senators each have a league-high 20 goals from their defensemen.\n\nNOTES: Jordan Greenway also scored for Minnesota. .

Houston struggled to contain Griffin late after defensive stopper P.J. Tucker was ejected in the third quarter after he received two technical fouls for arguing with officials.\n\n\"With P.J. getting kicked out of the game early it put more minutes on our guys,\" Harden said. \"But we found a way to win. There's going to be games like that where you've got to figure it out.\"\n\nGriffin had a turnover and a charge after his fifth 3 and Harden, who made all 19 of his free throw attempts, made two free throws to make it 122-116 with 19.1 seconds left. Ish Smith added a 3-pointer to cut the lead to three points with 9.6 seconds left, but Harden made two more free throws.\n\nGriffin was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 3.6 seconds remaining and made the first two free throws before missing the third. It was Harden at the line again after that, and he made both shots before Smith made a 3 at the buzzer.\n\n\"It was big,\" Chris Paul said. \"It was good for us. Blake got hot down the stretch ... but for us as we keep saying it's just about piling up wins.\"\n\nGriffin led the Pistons with 37 points and 11 rebounds Andre Drummond added 20 points with 11 rebounds for the Pistons.\n\n\"At the end of the game, two turnovers down the stretch killed us,\" Griffin said. \"It doesn't matter how many points you score ... in the big moments, that's where I have to be better.\"\n\nDetroit used a run to cut Houston's lead to six points with about six minutes left before the Rockets scored the next eight points, with six from Harden to make it 113-99 about a minute later.\n\nBut Griffin made three 3-pointers, with the first two on consecutive possessions, to fuel a 9-2 run that got Detroit to 115-108 with 3 1/2 minutes left.\n\nJames Ennis made a 3-pointer for Houston after that, but Griffin scored the next five points, with another 3-pointer to cut the lead to 118-113 with about two minutes left.\n\nHarden added a basket on a goaltending call, but Griffin made yet another 3 to make it 120-116 before his late errors.\n\nThe Rockets scored the first seven points of the third quarter to make it make it 65-57. But Detroit scored the next eight points, with 3s by Reggie Jackson and Langston Galloway to tie it a couple of minutes later.\n\nHouston went on another run after that, outscoring Detroit 9-2, to take a 76-67 lead midway through the quarter. Harden got the Rockets going in that span with a 3-pointer and Capela capped it with four straight points.\n\nThe Rockets were up 81-73 later in the third when Tucker got hit by Griffin on a screen and began complaining to an official. He received a technical foul, but that didn't stop him from continuing to get in the officials' face and yell at him, drawing a second technical and an ejection.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPistons: Detroit made 16 3-pointers to give the team at least 10 in seven straight games, a franchise record. ... Luke Kennard missed his 11th game with a sprained right shoulder and coach Dwane Casey said that he hasn't been cleared for contact drills and will still be out for a while.\n\nRockets: Capela received a technical foul in the third quarter for hanging on the rim after a dunk. ... Chris Paul added 20 points with seven assists.\n\nTUCKER'S EJECTION\n\nCrew chief Courtney Kirkland on what led to Tucker's ejection: \"The first technical foul was assessed to Tucker for his use of profanity toward Ben Taylor. He walked to him aggressively; Taylor assessed the first technical foul. He stayed there patiently and then Tucker continued to use progressive profanity toward him in a very aggressive manner. That's what the two technical fouls were for.\"\n\nHARDEN'S MILESTONE\n\nHarden's performance on Wednesday night gave him 13,391 career points with the Rockets to move him past Rudy Tomjanovich and into third place on the team's all-time scoring list. Harden was pleased to move up the list but knows taking first place from Hakeem Olajuwon, who is Houston's all-time leading scorer with 26,511 points, will be a huge task.\n\n\"We all know how great he was in the league and for this team as well,\" Harden said of Tomjanovich. \"So, it's an honor, but I've got a long way to go to catch Dream.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPistons: Host Houston on Friday night.\n\nRockets: Visit Detroit on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Both passed and will face off in the championship game Friday night.\n\nDedric Lawson had a double-double with 26 points and 12 rebounds to lead No. 2 Kansas to a 77-68 win over Marquette in the second semifinal of the NIT Season Tip-Off on Wednesday night. Earlier in the evening, No. 5 Tennessee topped Louisville 92-81.\n\nMarquette (3-1) led by as many as 12 in the first half before taking a 47-38 lead into the break. Then came the Jayhawks run.\n\n\"Coach got on us,\" said Dedric Lawson of Bill Self's halftime message. \"I won't tell you the word he used, but coach got on us about being tough and going out there and defending our man. We had a couple adjustments in the second half and that helped us out in the 22-0 run.\"\n\nMarquette went 0-of-10 from the field to start second half as Kansas (4-0) retook the lead in commanding fashion. The Golden Eagles finally scored a basket nine minutes into the second half on Joey Hauser's 3-pointer to make it 60-50. His brother, Sam Hauser, led the Golden Eagles with 20 points while Markus Howard had 18 points\n\n\"It definitely brought some awareness for us to see what we can do defensively, because that was a great offensive team that had great shooters, a great point guard and a great wing that could make shots,\" Lawson said. \"I think that was a pretty good offensive team, so to hold them to all those stops was pretty good for us going forward.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks got 16 points from Lagerald Vick while Devon Dotson chipped in with 10 points, four assists and three steals.\n\nIn the first semifinal, Grant Williams scored 24 points and the Vols had five players in double figures to beat the Cardinals.\n\nAdmiral Schofield added 20 points for the Vols (4-0), who shot 54 percent from the field. The win was the 664th of Tennessee coach Rick Barnes' career. It moved him past John Wooden on the all-time Division I wins list.\n\n\"It means I've been around a while,\" Barnes said.\n\nTrailing 77-70 with 6:51 left, Louisville coach Chris Mack got called for a technical foul when he didn't like an over-the-back call on Dwayne Sutton. The Cardinals could never recover, trailing by as many as 15.\n\n\"I complained during the game, so I'm not going to again complain now,\" Mack said. \"I thought when Dwayne got the ball it was completely clean. It's basketball. I shouldn't have received the technical. That's my fault. It'll be the last one of this year.\"\n\nJordan Nwora had 23 points and 10 assists to lead Louisville (3-1).\n\nWhile Kansas could vault itself into the No. 1 ranking with a win after No. 1 Duke's loss to No. 3 Gonzaga, Self sees it as litmus test for a team ripe with underclassmen.\n\n\"We need this game more than Tennessee needs this game, because we're young and we're not as tough as we need to be and we'll have to tough on Friday with the way they play or they could certainly make us look really bad, so I think it's a great game for our guys to see where we're at without question.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Going in, we talked about how we all need to do more, and at halftime I told them, 'We're not doing enough,'\" Malone said. \"I don't see the urgency that we need to get a win on the road against a division opponent, and the way we responded in that third quarter I thought was phenomenal.\"\n\nDenver clamped down defensively, holding Minnesota to 5-for-19 shooting and forcing seven turnovers in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Millsap and Murray combined for 23 points, four steals and two blocks as the Nuggets outscored the Wolves 35-18 in the quarter.\n\n\"We just played free. Everybody played in attack mode,\" guard Monte Morris said. \"Our players who need to make plays down the stretch went out and did that.\"\n\nMillsap started the pivotal third quarter with five points in a quick 7-0 run that put Denver on top 57-56. He then scored on a fast break, connected on a jumper and hit a 3-pointer to push his shooting totals to 10-for-11 on the night.\n\nBut Millsap's scoring binge was interrupted when he hit the floor hard in a collision with Towns midway through the third quarter. He went to the locker room holding a towel to his head and received stitches for a facial laceration.\n\nMurray picked up where Millsap left off, hitting his second and third 3-pointers of the quarter and dropping in a floater to push Denver's lead to 80-67.\n\nMillsap returned with 7:02 to play in the fourth quarter and played the rest of the way, helping Denver hang on after a 12-0 Minnesota run all but erased its lead. His floater from the baseline gave the Nuggets a 101-95 lead with less than two minutes to play.\n\n\"He's a tough cat. I'm sure he's going to have a nice headache in the morning,\" Malone said. \"But he's a pro \u2014 he came back in and wanted to get right back in the game and helped us pull out this victory.\"\n\nMinnesota trailed 89-76 early in the fourth quarter when its bench triggered a 12-0 run to make it a game again. Rose hit four free throws and a 3-pointer and Dario Saric added five points in the run.\n\n\"We were searching,\" Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"I thought they gave us a lift, got us back. The third quarter was a big problem. The bench put us in position to have a chance to win.\"\n\nGary Harris ended Minnesota's run with a 3-pointer and added two more driving baskets to help Denver maintain its lead.\n\nDOING IT ALL\n\nNikola Jokic and LeBron James are the only two NBA players to lead their teams in points, rebounds, assists and steals. On Wednesday, Jokic showed that he can help his team even on a night when his shots weren't dropping. He made just 3 of 13 shots from the field and scored seven points, but he also had 12 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNuggets: Denver capped a 1-2 road trip with the win. Two of their next three are at home, but then the Nuggets start a five-game road swing on Nov. 30 with games in Portland, Toronto, Orlando, Charlotte and Atlanta. . Millsap made 11 of 13 shots from the field. The rest of the Nuggets were 31-for-76 (40.8 percent).\n\nTimberwolves: Towns entered the game as one of nine players to have made at least one 3-pointer in every game he's played in this year. He extended the streak with a 3-pointer in the third quarter and finished the game 1-for-5 from behind the arc. . The Wolves assigned F Keita Bates-Diop to their G-League team in Iowa. . Minnesota wrapped up a five-game homestand with a 3-2 record. The Wolves are 7-3 at home but are winless in eight road games\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNuggets: Host Orlando on Friday night.\n\nTimberwolves: At Brooklyn on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The two-day sweep marked the second straight year the Sun Devils came to Las Vegas on Thanksgiving week, knocked off a Top 25 team and captured a tournament.\n\nThe Sun Devils, who defeated No. 15 Mississippi State on Monday, beat Kansas State and then-No. 15 Xavier to win the 2017 Continental Tire Invitational at the Orleans Arena.\n\nThe Sun Devils (5-0) used a balance of perimeter shooting and points in the paint to overcome a seven-point deficit early in the first half, while Dort led the charge in the second half, scoring 19 in the final 20 minutes.\n\n\"He was so composed throughout the game, just big shot after big shot,\" Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley said about Dort. \"I think he knows how gifted he is, how talented he is. He's a worker, got a great attitude ... he's really beyond his years.\"\n\nUtah State (5-1) was led by Sam Merrill and Dwayne Brown Jr., who scored 27 and 14, respectively.\n\nThe Aggies regained the lead early in the second half, using a 6-0 run to pull ahead 47-44 with 15:53 left in the game. But the Sun Devils responded with a 10-3 run of their own, capped by a 3-pointer from Dort to give them a 54-50 lead.\n\nUtah State coach Craig Smith likened Dort's style of play to Indiana Pacers point guard Victor Oladipo, because of his size, explosiveness and ability to score from anywhere on the court.\n\n\"When he's consistently making shots like that, he's just an unbelievable player because he does it all,\" Smith said. \"He plays his rear end off on the defensive end, he's really a disrupter on that end of the floor and nobody even talks about that. The best scorers in the world can shoot the three, have a pull-up game and get to the rim and get freebies at the free throw line and he does all four.\"\n\nDort, named the tournament MVP, finished with 10 of 15 shooting from the floor, including two 3-pointers, and 11 of 14 from the free throw line. As a team, the Sun Devils hit 50 percent (26 of 52) from the floor and outscored the Aggies on the break, 10-0.\n\nUtah State, meanwhile, hit 44.6 percent (25 of 56) from the field, and went 7-for-23 (30.4 percent) from 3-point range.\n\n\"We survived not playing our best defense, we've been way better defensively,\" Hurley said. \"I give a lot of credit to coach Smith, he's on the right track with his program. For a first-year coach, to have his team playing that hard and that together he's gonna do a great job there.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They stayed focused when the Phoenix Suns made a big play.\n\nA couple of solid practices really paid off.\n\nParker had 20 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists, and the Bulls beat the Suns 124-116 on Wednesday night to stop a four-game slide.\n\nChicago shot a season-high 56.8 percent from the field and placed six players in double figures in just its third win in its last 12 games. Following an ugly 122-83 home loss to Toronto on Saturday night, Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg worked on pushing the pace in practice, and his team responded with one of its best offensive performances.\n\n\"I thought our outlet passes were crisp,\" Hoiberg said. \"I thought they were up the floor, and I thought our guys did a good job of getting down quickly. We didn't hang our heads. We had a couple answer-back plays after they scored where we scored on the other end, and those are important. Those are big plays. We need all those points.\"\n\nGetting Zach LaVine back helped. LaVine scored 29 points after missing the Raptors loss with an illness, and Ryan Arcidiacono, Wendell Carter Jr. and Antonio Blakeney each had 14 points for Chicago.\n\nPhoenix lost for the seventh time in its last eight games. Devin Booker scored 23 points, T.J. Warren had 21 and Deandre Ayton added 18 points and 12 rebounds.\n\n\"We had no force, no energy, no effort,\" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. \"They wanted this win more, and they got it.\"\n\nParker was 6 for 10 from the field in perhaps his best game since signing with his hometown team in the offseason. He also had two steals.\n\n\"Winning always solves everything,\" Parker said. \"I just want to do what I can to win and hopefully that kind of snowballs.\"\n\nJamal Crawford's pullup jumper for the Suns tied it at 97 with 10:54 left, but the Bulls responded with a 10-0 run. Parker had a driving dunk before Blakeney capped the decisive sequence with a jumper with 7:27 remaining.\n\nPhoenix pulled within three on Warren's 3-pointer with 1:27 to go, but Arcidiacono found Carter for a layup and LaVine made two foul shots to help close it out.\n\n\"They really got their confidence, got in their rhythm, got their flow and got easy baskets,\" Crawford said. \"Whenever you give a team, especially at home, easy baskets, it settles them in and gives them their confidence.\"\n\nOOPS\n\nThe Suns led by as many as nine in the third quarter, and Kokoskov felt his team relaxed at that point.\n\n\"We thought the game was over, and that's what happens with an inexperienced team,\" he said. \"They knew there was the rest of the game, and they never quit. That early lead gave us a lackadaisical mindset thinking we can go through this game scoring every time we want. We forgot to play defense.\"\n\nLOOK OUT\n\nArcidiacono gave Chicago a spark when he jumped over Phoenix's bench while trying to save a ball from going out of bounds in the first quarter. He landed on a couple of fans in the front row, causing a man to lose some of his beer, but everyone was OK.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSuns: Crawford had a season-high 16 points against his first NBA team. ...

(AP) \u2014 Tired of coming from behind during their NHL-best winning streak, the Buffalo Sabres went out and did something about it.\n\nJeff Skinner and the Sabres got off to a fast start Wednesday night as Buffalo scored four first-period goals on its way to a 5-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nIt was a dynamic outburst from the league's hottest team, which has won seven in a row.\n\n\"That was written on our white board \u2014 making sure we're ready to start,\" said right wing Tage Thompson, who scored Buffalo's second goal. \"We want to be on the winning side starting from the drop of the puck.\"\n\nEvan Rodrigues and Sam Reinhart each had a goal and an assist for Buffalo (14-6-2), which came from behind in its previous three victories. Skinner and Johan Larsson also scored, and Carter Hutton made 23 saves.\n\n\"It's good for one that we're learning,\" Sabres captain Jack Eichel said. \"It's progress from the last few games of not starting the way we wanted. A full 60 minutes is what we're looking for. I thought we played a majority of the game the way we wanted to.\"\n\nThis is Buffalo's longest run since taking 10 games in a row to open the 2006-07 season. It's quite a change from last season, when the Sabres didn't get their 14th win until late January and finished in last place.\n\n\"It's a testament to the guys and putting in the work every day,\" Eichel said. \"But with that being said, it's November. It's Thanksgiving tomorrow. There's so much of our season left. We want to keep doing it. Your objective is to win every game. We'll enjoy this one, obviously enjoy our holiday and then obviously we have a really good team coming in on Friday.\"\n\nClaude Giroux and Wayne Simmonds scored for Philadelphia (9-10-2). Alex Lyon made eight saves before being pulled for Calvin Pickard.\n\n\"It's unacceptable,\" Giroux said. \"I'm pretty (ticked) off.\"\n\nBuffalo was all over the Flyers right from the start.\n\nSkinner opened the floodgates 3:38 into the game on a rebound opportunity. Jason Pominville's shot from the right circle was stopped and pushed to Skinner in the slot, where he had an easy finish to make it 1-0.\n\nLess than two minutes later, Thompson doubled Buffalo's lead on a tremendous one-man effort. Thompson used his size and power to skate around Flyers defenseman Radko Gudas, tucking a shot inside the far post. It was his second goal of the season, with his first coming in Monday's win over Pittsburgh.\n\nRodrigues made it 3-0 at 8:55 on the power play, his first goal of the season. He pounced on a rebound to end his scoring drought.\n\nLarsson made it 4-0 just before the end of the first, scoring with eight seconds remaining. Larsson sped past Flyers defenseman Christian Folin and buried a hard shot to the short side for his first goal of the season.\n\nSeconds later, Larsson bested Scott Laughton in a scrap.\n\n\"We didn't do enough in the first 10 minutes in any way,\" Philadelphia coach Dave Hakstol said.\n\nThe Flyers showed more fight in the second period, cutting Buffalo's lead to 4-2.\n\nGiroux got them on the board 5:26 into the second on a one-timer from close range. Simmonds made it 4-2 with 6:09 remaining in the period.\n\nPhiladelphia had its share of chances in the third period as well, but Buffalo was able to hold on. The Flyers' best opportunity of the period came on a 2-on-1 rush with 6:48 remaining, when Hutton foiled Travis Konecny's attempt. They had another good chance with 4:07 left after a Sabres defenseman fell, but failed to score.\n\nReinhart scored into an empty net with 1:38 to go.\n\nNOTES: The Sabres recalled defenseman Lawrence Pilut from the AHL's Rochester Americans before the game. Pilut was scratched, along with D Marco Scandella and LW Remi Elie. The Sabres signed Pilut last offseason out of the Swedish Hockey League, where he was named the league's top defenseman last year. ... Buffalo also placed C Patrik Berglund (upper body) on injured reserve. ...

(AP) \u2014 Jalen Harris put in a lot of time on his own last season to keep his game sharp, waiting on his opportunity to take the court for Arkansas.\n\nAfter transferring from New Mexico, Harris redshirted last season under NCAA rules, but he did not sit idly by. Instead he recruited a pair of former teammates to work out with him after hours to make sure he was in the best shape possible when this season rolled around.\n\nThat effort is starting to pay off, and it was never more evident than on Wednesday night. Harris recorded a double-double with 11 points and 11 assists as Arkansas routed Montana State 90-68.\n\n\"I just tried to stay in the gym and work hard,\" said Harris, who matched his season-high in points. \"I used to always hit up Daryl (Macon) and Jalen (Barford) and ask them what I needed to do, what gamelike things I need to work on and they always told me. So by having those guys around, it really helped out.\"\n\nIt also helps that Harris has sophomore post Daniel Gafford playing at a high level. Gafford, who was named the SEC player of the week after his career-high 27 points against Indiana on Sunday, was a perfect 8 of 8 from the floor Wednesday night, most of those off feeds from Harris, and scored 16 points.\n\n\"It's just ridiculous,\" Harris said of Gafford's almost 80-percent shooting through four games. \"Just get it to him down there and you know he has a good possibility of making it, so you keep feeding him.\"\n\nThe Razorbacks (3-1) were never threatened in Wednesday's one-sided win. Mason Jones, whose key rebound and free throw with 2.5 seconds left lifted the Razorbacks to a 73-72 win against Indiana, scored the first seven points of the game for Arkansas (3-1) and finished with a team-high 18 points, one of five Arkansas players to score in double figures.\n\nMontana State (1-5) fell behind quickly under the Arkansas scoring barrage, but senior guard Tyler Hall did his part to keep the score respectable at 54-38 at halftime by scoring 23 points, including seven 3-pointers. Hall finished with 29 points.\n\nThe Razorbacks forced 24 Montana State turnovers and recorded 13 steals to go along with 29 assists.\n\nArkansas coach Mike Anderson said he was pleased with his team's energy, especially to start the game.\n\n\"Early on we made a lot of shots, but our defense was really on-point,\" Anderson said. \"Montana State eventually found a nice little groove, a lot of it attributed to the Hall kid. He started really knocking down some shots that were in Al Dillard's range. I mean guys were on him. But I thought in the second half we did a better job of adjusting and making him work for his shot.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nArkansas' schedule sets up favorably over the next eight games \u2014 six of them at home in Fayetteville and one in North Little Rock \u2014 for the Razorbacks to head into SEC play at 10-1.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\nWednesday's game is the second of a three-game stretch over six days for Arkansas, but Gafford said the Razorbacks would rather play games than practice.\n\n\"We're just having fun because we're actually getting to play somebody besides ourselves,\" Gafford said. \"It's a good feeling. It's way better than practice.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nArkansas got 25 points off the bench, including eight from Reggie Chaney to go along with five rebounds. . The Razorbacks scored 29 points off the 24 turnovers and were 10 of 10 on dunks. . Montana State had 18 offensive rebounds, a statistic Anderson said the Razorbacks needed to improve on.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArkansas: The Razorbacks play host to Texas-Arlington on Friday, its third game in six days.

NBC News reports that number is the largest margin that Democrats have defeated Republicans in a midterm House election since 1974.\n\nThat midterm race, shortly after Nixon resigned, allowed Democrats to win the popular vote by 8.7 million votes, NBC reported.\n\nSome have made comparisons between the administrations of Trump and Nixon as special counsel Robert Mueller continues to examine the role of Russia in the 2016 election and whether the president attempted to obstruct justice and end the probe.\n\nNixon also resisted investigations after his administration attempted to distance itself with five men who broke into the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate hotel.\n\nThe coverup led to Nixon's resignation from the presidency in 1974.\n\nMore: The election that won't end: 2 House seats in New York, 1 in California remain in question\n\nMore: Meet the Democrats who could lead the investigations into President Donald Trump\n\nMore: These are the historic firsts for women, minority and LGBTQ candidates in 2018\n\nThis year's midterms flipped nearly 40 seats, allowing Democrats to take control of the House and setting the stage for two years of confrontations with President Donald Trump when they take power in January.\n\nDemocrats are expected to leverage their new majority to wield Congress' oversight powers. They could demand Trump\u2019s tax returns, subpoena his Cabinet members and investigate suspected ties to Russia. And they can block the president\u2019s legislative priorities, whether it\u2019s funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border or curbing entitlement programs.\n\nThe election was also a historic one for women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. Female candidates spearheaded Democratic gains. At least 80 women had been elected to the House. Sixty-nine of the House women are Democrats, including 27 of 28 newcomers, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\n\nJared Polis was the first gay man to win a governor's race.

In the baseball, \"I was aware right away of a higher level of power, technique and speed.\"\n\nOhtani won American League Rookie of the Year earlier this month despite an elbow injury that disrupted his switch from Japan to the major leagues and likely will prevent him from pitching next year.\n\nHe didn't play between June 4 and July 3 because of a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, an injury the Angels were aware of when they signed him last winter.\n\nThe 24-year-old right-hander had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1 and hopes to be able to help the Angels at the plate next season. He probably won't take the mound again until 2020.\n\nIn an indication that he plans to continue both pitching and batting, Ohtani said having surgery made the most sense.\n\n\"I'm glad I had the surgery,\" Ohtani said. \"Of course, there was some reluctance over whether to have it but considering the long term I decided it was necessary.\"\n\nAs a pitcher, Ohtani was 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA and 63 strikeouts over 51 2/3 innings in 10 starts. As a designated hitter, he batted .285 with 22 homers and 61 RBIs and a .925 OPS in 367 plate appearances.\n\nOhtani was also asked about the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where his sport is making a return after being dropped after the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\nPlayers from MLB are unlikely to take part as the league has said it will not shut down its season for the Olympics.\n\n\"As (the Olympics) are being held in Japan I have a lot of interest,\" Ohtani said. \"As baseball is back in the program, I'd love to take part, I think that's just natural.\"\n\nThe questions weren't all game-related. On a lighter note, Ohtani said he has no immediate plans to get married and that he won't be able to give an acceptance speech in English for his Rookie of the Year Award.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He became the 22nd NBA player to reach the milestone and then tossed some love toward the Raptors.\n\n\"I'm very thankful for every team that I've played for,\" Carter said. \"... But there's nothing like your first.\"\n\nCarter, who played his first seven seasons with Toronto, began the night 13 points shy of the mark. The Hawks were pulling for Carter, in his 21st season, to reach the milestone against his former team. After the game, Carter's teammates were like fans looking for souvenirs.\n\n\"All the guys tried to take everything I own,\" Carter said. \"All my backup shoes are gone now.\"\n\nCarter, 41, didn't seem to mind.\n\n\"I still love it,\" he said. \"I still love playing. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do it.\"\n\nCarter sank a 3-pointer with less than two minutes remaining and, clearly aiming for the milestone, missed two more 3s before being fouled with 33.9 seconds remaining.\n\nCarter pulled with one point of 25,000 when he sank two free throws after a video review overruled the original call he was fouled on a 3-pointer. On Atlanta's final possession, he missed a jumper before rookie Kevin Huerter grabbed the rebound and passed back to Carter, setting up the buzzer-beating jam.\n\nCarter's 14 points gave him 25,001 for his career.\n\nPlayers from both teams hugged Carter at midcourt.\n\n\"He earned it,\" Lowry said. \"It's awesome to do it against the team he started with.\"\n\nAdded Toronto's Fred VanVleet: \"Vince has changed the game for every kid growing up.\"\n\nLowry had 17 assists and 12 rebounds for his 13th career triple-double.\n\nJonas Valanciunas had season-high totals of 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Raptors (15-4).\n\n\"That was kind of fun,\" Valanciunas said before giving credit to Lowry. \"It's easy to play with this kind of point guard.\"\n\nPascal Siakam had 22 points.\n\nJeremy Lin scored 26 points off the bench for the Hawks (3-15), who have lost nine straight since their last win against Miami on Nov. 3.\n\nAtlanta's only starter to score in double figures was Taurean Prince with 12 points.\n\nThe teams combined to miss 14 straight shots from the field to open the game before Lowry finally sank a jumper. He followed up with a 3-pointer, and the Raptors never lost the lead.\n\nThe Raptors led 55-44 at halftime.\n\nToronto stretched the lead to 20 points for the first time at 100-80 on Danny Green's 3-pointer midway through the final period.\n\nCarter's milestone was popular with players for both teams.\n\n\"I would love for him to do it tonight but Vince is going to play the game the right way and do what he's supposed to do and he's going to worry about that as it happens,\" said Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce before the game. \"... I know this is his former team. I know it would have another added boost to it, being against Toronto, adding a milestone that is a great accomplishment and a testament to his 21 years.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nRaptors: OG Anunoby (sprained right wrist) and C.J. Miles (right adductor strain) did not play. ... The Raptors improved to 8-2 on the road.\n\nHawks: Alex Len (sore back) and Omari Spellman (right hip adductor) did not play. ... Atlanta's bench outscored the starters 16-8 in the first period and 72-36 for the game. \"We just struggled,\" said Pierce of the starters. \"We just needed to get some new life, new energy.\"\n\nREST FOR LEONARD\n\nThe Raptors rested top scorer Kawhi Leonard on the second day of back-to-back games. That has been the standard practice with Leonard, but coach Nick Nurse said \"we're getting closer\" to Leonard playing in consecutive days.\n\nNO FOUL\n\nLowry left the game with a bloody nose with 4:09 remaining. No foul was called, despite his protests to officials as he held a towel to his face. He returned to the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRaptors: Host Washington on Friday night.\n\nHawks: Host Boston on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Winston played well enough in that game to earn the start the following week. He\u2019s been up-and-down overall in his three starts and five appearances this season.\n\nWinston is completing a career-high 65.9 percent of his throws, but he\u2019s tossed eight touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Still, Shanahan knows what the Bucs\u2019 signal caller is capable of.\n\n\u201cHe always lets it rip. He always tries to make plays,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cBut, he\u2019s been a little off in some games, which have led to some picks. But, he\u2019s come back in and given them a chance to win some games. Jameis is a guy that also, when nothing is there, he\u2019s made some plays that I didn\u2019t think people could make. He can be as good as anyone in this league and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to play very well.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers didn\u2019t play well last time they encountered Winston and the Bucs. He threw for 269 yards and three touchdowns with a 117.2 passer rating in a 34-17 Tampa Bay romp at Levi\u2019s Stadium in 2016.\n\nSan Francisco will need to find a way to force Winston to go off script and try to force throws into tight windows. He\u2019s shown in his career that he\u2019s susceptible to interceptions, and his inconsistent playing time this year under new offensive coordinator Todd Monken could make him more liable to turn the ball over.\n\nThe 49ers will have a shot at an upset and their first road win of the year if they can make him toss a couple interceptions Sunday."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Collins with 21, Yetna 15; USF breaks away from FAMU, 69-59", "description": "David Collins scored 21 points with four assists and Alexis Yetna added 15 points and 10 rebounds as South Florida defeated Florida A&M 69-59 for its best start since the 2014-15 season.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/collins-with-21-yetna-15-usf-breaks-away-from-famu-69-59/38583861/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T03:15:26Z", "content": "TAMPA, Fla.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Boston coach Brad Stevens knows what is wrong with the Celtics. Plenty.\n\nTrey Burke scored 29 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. had 21 and the New York Knicks snapped a six-game losing streak with a 117-109 victory over the surprisingly inconsistent Celtics on Wednesday night.\n\nNoah Vonleh had 16 points and Enes Kanter finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds for New York, which won for the fifth time in 19 games.\n\n\"This is a lot of things,\" Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \"We have a myriad of issues we have to fix.\"\n\nKyrie Irving led the Celtics with 22 points and 13 assists, Marcus Morris had 21 points, and Al Horford and Gordon Hayward each added 19 points. It was a season-high third straight loss for Boston, which slipped to 9-9.\n\nPegged as one of the Eastern Conference's favorites after they lost in the conference finals last season, the Celtics currently look like a team that has lost its cohesiveness. The Celtics have a healthy Irving and Hayward, who were injured and missed the playoffs, but they look nothing like last season's team.\n\n\"We're not playing with the same personality that we did last year and that's the easy way to describe it and the 50,000 issues are below that,\" Stevens said. \"I just don't know that we're that good. Maybe it's not a wake-up call if you keep getting beat.\"\n\nBoston cut its deficit to 110-106 on a 3-pointer by Hayward, but Burke hit a jumper with 50 seconds to play. Burke added a 3-pointer to make it 115-109 with 12 seconds left.\n\nMitchell Robinson's basket with just under five minutes to play pushed New York ahead 103-87 and sent a good number of fans to the exits, and some voiced their displeasure before leaving by booing.\n\n\"In order to be considered a special team, you have to earn it,\" Irving said\"\n\nHardaway felt the Knicks have something to build on.\n\n\"We're 5-14. We've still got a lot of learning to do,\" he said. \"We'll go and look at film on Friday. But everybody should go home with a smile on their face and eat good tomorrow, you know, because we got a win.\"\n\nLeading by 16 at the half, the Knicks had their lead cut to 10 four times in the third quarter, but Boston was unable to reduce it to single digits.\n\n\"Effort. They stuck with it. Young fellas on a back-to-back, in a hostile environment,\" Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \"Just played extremely hard and played through a lot of adversity. Thank goodness that clock ran out.\"\n\nThe Celtics started hearing boos from the home crowd midway through the second quarter and the boos became louder when they fell behind by 20 points, 46-26.\n\n\"Tomorrow might be a good day for us to reflect a little bit,\" Hayward said.\n\nNew York built its lead to 57-31 on Kanter's reverse layup before heading to the locker room with a 65-49 edge at halftime.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKnicks: Fizdale started Emmanuel Mudlay and Hardaway in the backcourt, saying: \"They're starting to play with some good chemistry. I'm happy with the pace.\" ... They shot 65 percent (15 of 23) in the second quarter.\n\nCeltics: Horford started after he was listed as probable because of a sore left knee. He went to the locker room briefly in the second quarter. ... Boston missed its initial 10 3-point attempts and 14 of its first 15.\n\nSTAYING THE SAME\n\nFizdale decided to use the same starting lineup as Tuesday night, because his team \"got off to a good start\" despite a loss to Portland at Madison Square Garden.\n\nNew York got off to a quick start again Wednesday, opening a 25-14 lead late in the opening quarter.\n\nGOTTA GO\n\nStevens was asked about the play of two of his players before the game and turned it into how his team needs to improve and play more consistently.\n\n\"It's not about what you do on one day right now,\" said. \"It's about how can you piece things together and go and go and go and go. As a team, that's what we're all searching for.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKnicks: Host the Pelicans on Friday.

(AP) \u2014 Coming into the night, the Toronto Maple Leafs were tied for the NHL lead in scoring and ranked second in goal differential on the strength of a top-notch power play.\n\nStill, the Carolina Hurricanes found a way to neutralize the Leafs behind a former Toronto goaltender and solid special-teams play.\n\nTrevor van Riemsdyk and Justin Williams scored 22 seconds apart in the first period, sending the Hurricanes to a 5-2 victory Wednesday.\n\nCurtis McElhinney, claimed off waivers from Toronto in early October, made 30 saves as Carolina snapped the Maple Leafs' four-game winning streak. Jordan Staal had two assists for the Hurricanes, who killed three penalties.\n\n\"The defensemen and the forwards did a phenomenal job, and we got a couple of key blocks in there, which were huge,\" McElhinney said.\n\nMicheal Ferland scored his 11th of the season with 12:15 remaining, a power-play goal that put the Hurricanes ahead 3-1. Teuvo Teravainen assisted on the play.\n\nKasperi Kapanen answered for Toronto with 8:05 left, racing in to score his ninth of the season and cut the margin to 3-2. Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov added empty-net goals for Carolina.\n\n\"It feels good. I'm not going to lie, it was a tough way to leave Toronto, but I certainly understand what the circumstances were,\" McElhinney said. \"But it's a huge win for us, especially considering where they are in the standings.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes (10-8-3) dominated the first period and handed Maple Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen (40 saves) his first loss in seven starts.\n\nToronto (15-7-0) fell to 9-2 on the road this season.\n\n\"We weren't prepared to go, for whatever reason,\" Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock said. \"The message is pretty clear: You don't work, you don't win.\"\n\nCarolina went ahead when van Riemsdyk scored his first of the season. He took a backhand swipe at the puck after a scramble in front, beating a prone Andersen at 10:56. Toronto challenged the play for goaltender interference, but the call was upheld.\n\nStaal then won a faceoff to the left of Andersen. Calvin de Haan skated in and found Williams alone in front of the net.\n\nJohn Tavares scored his 14th of the season unassisted for Toronto later in the period to cut the lead to 2-1.\n\nCarolina outshot Toronto 29-11 in the first, a record for shots in a period by the team since it relocated from Hartford in 1997. But the Hurricanes needed more than 18 minutes to register a shot on goal in the second.\n\nCarolina killed off two penalties, keeping the lead despite being outshot 12-2. The final shot total was 45-32 in favor of the Hurricanes.\n\nCarolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said his team hasn't made changes to its penalty kill, but he acknowledged it has improved.\n\n\"The first few games we had some (tough) bounces, but that happens on the penalty kill,\" he said. \"Really nothing has changed, and the guys have gotten more comfortable with things. Honestly, I just think the bounces have been going our way.\"\n\nNOTES: Announced attendance was 12,562. ... Tavares' goal was his 11th of the season on the road. ... Williams' goal for Carolina was his 100th with the team. He became the ninth player in NHL history to score at least 100 goals and win the Stanley Cup with two franchises. Williams scored 103 goals for the Los Angeles Kings and was part of championship teams in 2012 and 2014. He also played on Carolina's 2006 Stanley Cup-winning squad. ... Toronto entered as the least-penalized team in the NHL, and Carolina ranked second. ... Carolina activated forward Victor Rask, who missed the first 21 games with a hand injury, and sent Clark Bishop to the AHL. ... It was the first of three meetings between the teams this season. The Maple Leafs return to Raleigh on Dec. 11, and the Hurricanes visit Toronto on April 2.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMaple Leafs: At Columbus on Friday.\n\nHurricanes: Host Florida on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tom Wilson missed Washington's first 16 games due to a suspension for an illegal check. In the five games since his return, Wilson has shown just how valuable he is to the Capitals.\n\nWilson scored 54 seconds into the contest to set the pace and Washington defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 4-2 Wednesday night for its first three-game winning streak of the season.\n\nAndre Burakovsky, Michal Kempny and Devante Smith-Pelly added goals for the defending Stanley Cup champions.\n\nThis win was easier for the Capitals, whose previous two victories came in overtime. Braden Holtby stopped 37 shots for Washington.\n\nWilson was originally suspended for 20 games for an illegal check to the head of St. Louis forward Oskar Sundqvist in the teams' preseason finale. That suspension was reduced to 14 games by a neutral arbitrator, but by the time the decision was rendered, Wilson had already missed 16 games.\n\nHad the 20-game suspension stood, this would have been Wilson's first game. Instead, it was his first home game, and he got a loud reception.\n\nWilson, who scored in his first game, upended Chicago goalie Corey Crawford on the way to the goal. Crawford stopped 23 shots. In his previous three games, he'd allowed just two goals.\n\n\"Sometimes when you have to watch some games for a while, you pick up some different things you can add,\" Capitals coach Todd Reirden said.\n\n\"He's played great since he's been back, and we're fortunate to get him back earlier than expected.\"\n\nWashington has had an uneven start in its defense of the Cup. With Wilson's suspension and injuries to key players, they're hoping to get on a roll now.\n\n\"We're demanding of each other to get back there,\" Wilson said of the team's quest for back-to-back Stanley Cups.\n\n\"There was adversity at the beginning of last year,\" he said. \"That's how you build a team.\"\n\nBurakovsky knows how difficult the Capitals' task is.\n\n\"Obviously, it was a shorter summer for us and a shorter time to prepare ourselves for the season,\" Burakovsky said. \"So, just to get back after a year that we had, I think it's tough to get in and get going right away. So, we're building our game slowly and tonight I think we did exactly what we wanted.\"\n\nBrandon Saad and Erik Gustafsson scored for Chicago, which began a streak of seven road games in its next nine contests.\n\nBlackhawks coach Jeremy Colliton replaced longtime coach Joel Queeneville on Nov. 6, and the team is 2-3-2 since. Chicago has lost eight straight games in Washington.\n\n\"I thought the effort was there and we looked like we were going to climb back into it multiple times during the game,\" Colliton said. \"Some self-inflicted wounds there that made it difficult on the road against a cup winner. That's kind of the story today.\"\n\nKempny whose goal midway through the second period gave Washington a 3-0 lead, was happy his first goal of the season came against his former team.\n\n\"It feels really nice,\" Kempny said. I have to say, it wasn't an easy game for me to play. I know a lot of guys from Chicago. I was there almost two seasons. . It feels a little bit weird. The first period I was really excited from the game. After the first I was trying a little bit to settle down and keep playing my game and help my team to win.\"\n\nNOTES: Washington forwards Evegeny Kuznetsov and T.J. Oshie were out with upper body injuries for the third straight game. . Forwards Luke Johnson, Chris Kunitz and D Brandon Manning were all healthy scratches for Chicago for the second straight game. . Capitals F Alex Oveckhin was penalized for slashing in the second period, just his fourth penalty in 21 games. ...

(AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Joel Embiid is on a mission to win the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards. If he keeps up this pace, he'll make it easy on voters.\n\nEmbiid had 31 points and 19 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 121-120 on Wednesday night after Anthony Davis missed the third of three free throws with 2.5 seconds left.\n\nEmbiid reached at least 30 points and 15 rebounds for the 12th time this season. He was serenaded frequently with loud chants of \"M-V-P! M-V-P!\" from the raucous home crowd.\n\n\"If we win 50 to 55 games and have these numbers, I think I have a pretty good chance,\" Embiid said.\n\nDavis had 12 points and 16 rebounds in a showdown between two of the NBA's top big men. Davis entered averaging 27.6 points per game, just below Embiid's 27.9. The Pelicans center was coming off an impressive 29-point, nine-rebound outing in New Orleans' 140-126 victory over San Antonio on Monday.\n\nBut, like most of the rest of the league this season, he was no match for Embiid.\n\n\"The reality of how important he is to our team is ever-present,\" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. \"How can we all not notice how dominant he's been?\"\n\nEmbiid had his way with New Orleans, finishing 11 of 23 from the field and 7 of 9 from the free-throw line. He also was 2 of 4 from beyond the arc. With his strength and size inside, as well as ability to shoot from outside, Embiid has been nearly impossible to guard this season. He has double-doubles in 18 of Philadelphia's 20 games, leading the NBA.\n\n\"As stupid as it sounds, we did a pretty good job on him,\" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. \"That's a hell of a compliment to him to say we did a good job.\"\n\nThe 76ers are 10-0 at home this season. They looked in control, up nine points with just under 2 \u00bd minutes to play, before a late surge by the Pelicans.\n\nEmbiid fouled Davis on a 3-point attempt, and Davis calmly swished the first two free throws before the third went in and out. Davis grabbed the rebound, but his wild attempt at a winning shot was off the mark.\n\nBen Simmons added 22 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the 76ers, who won their fourth straight. Philadelphia is the lone team in the NBA undefeated at home.\n\nThe Pelicans had won three in a row and six of seven. E'Twaun Moore and Jrue Holiday led New Orleans with 30 points apiece, and Julius Randle had 22 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThe 76ers were seemingly in control when Wilson Chandler hit a 3-pointer to make it 119-110 with 2:24 left. But consecutive 3-pointers by Moore and Nikola Mirotic pulled the Pelicans within 119-118 with 1:08 left. J.J. Redick, enduring a rare cold shooting night, scored on a drive with 53.2 seconds to play to put Philadelphia ahead three. Davis misfired on a 3, but Philadelphia's lead remained 121-118 after Simmons missed a 10-foot jumper to set up the game-deciding sequence.\n\nHOME SWEET HOME\n\nThe 76ers have a long way to go to get anywhere close to the 1985-86 Celtics, who hold the NBA home regular-season record of 40-1. But Philadelphia clearly is stamping out its home court as a tough place for opponents.\n\n\"There's pride and we don't want to let anyone down here,\" Simmons said.\n\nAS FULTZ TURNS\n\nPhiladelphia played without guard Markelle Fultz. The 2017 No. 1 overall pick was on the bench but not in uniform after his agent informed the team Tuesday that Fultz would not practice or play with the team until consulting a specialist for his right shoulder. The demand from Fultz's representative came a day after the guard was benched for T.J. McConnell in the second half of Philadelphia's 119-114 win over the Suns on Monday.\n\nFultz played just 14 games last season due to a shoulder injury that may or may not have affected his shot, which has become one of the most scrutinized in the NBA. The 20-year-old is averaging 8.2 points and 3.1 assists in 23 minutes per game this season shooting just 42 percent from the field.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nPelicans: Davis reached 10,000 career points with a dunk late in the first half. ... New Orleans dropped to 2-7 on the road. The Pelicans will play their next two away from home, at the Knicks on Friday and at Washington on Saturday. .. G Elfrid Payton had successful surgery Tuesday on the little finger on his left hand, the team said. He is expected back in six weeks.\n\n76ers: Embiid chided McConnell for missing a layup in the first half and McConnell shot back, \"So what!\" ... Jimmy Butler had 13 points in his fifth game with the 76ers. ... Redick, normally a sharpshooter, missed all seven of his 3-point attempts.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPelicans: At Knicks on Friday night.\n\n76ers: Host Cleveland on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Sidney Crosby's been around long enough to realize the issues currently plaguing the Pittsburgh Penguins can't be solved in one shift, one period or even one game.\n\nThat sure didn't stop the Pittsburgh captain from trying. Crosby scored a spectacular goal and set up two others during a 5-1 victory against the Dallas Stars on Wednesday night in his return to the lineup after missing three games with an upper-body injury.\n\n\"I think our team gets a foot taller when he's in our lineup because of the inspiration that he is for our group,\" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said.\n\nFor a night, it looked like it.\n\nThe Penguins began the day at the bottom of the Eastern Conference thanks to a 1-7-2 slide, unfamiliar territory for a team less than 18 months removed from back to back championships. The defense has been shaky at best and the goaltending not much better.\n\nSullivan preached patience and on Tuesday stressed the team had no plans to abandon the frenetic style of play that has become its trademark during his hugely successful three-year tenure.\n\nIt's a style that hardly looks out of place when Crosby's familiar No. 87 is on the ice.\n\nDesperately needing a spark two days removed from a nightmarish loss to Buffalo in which the Penguins gave away a three-goal lead over the final 30 minutes, Crosby provided one. He set up Jake Guentzel for a goal less than 4 minutes into the game and provided a highlight-reel marker later in the opening period when he raced down the right side, held off Dallas defenseman Esa Lindell and flicked a rebound past Anton Khudobin to give Pittsburgh a 3-0 advantage just 10:04 into the game.\n\nThe captain is officially back and doing his thing. pic.twitter.com/w4EHJXsXYt \u2014 Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) November 22, 2018\n\n\"I had some room to take it to the net,\" Crosby said. \"Sometimes they go in. Sometimes you get a save sometimes you draw a penalty. It was good to see it go in.\"\n\nEvgeni Malkin, Patric Hornqvist and Tanner Pearson also scored for the Penguins. Creating offense, however, is rarely an issue for Pittsburgh. The biggest development against Dallas may have been the play in front of Casey DeSmith. Pittsburgh surrendered three shots in the first period, a season-low 19 in all and didn't get sloppy after staking him to a massive lead. DeSmith finished with 18 saves, his shutout attempt ending 7:55 into the third period when Mattias Janmark scored.\n\nIt was the lone highlight for the Stars. Khudobin, starting in place of injured Ben Bishop, stopped just 11 of 16 shots and was removed when Pearson beat him with a slap shot on a breakaway to make it 5-0. Rookie Landon Bow played well in his NHL debut, stopping all 14 shots he faced.\n\n\"Pretty embarrassing tonight,\" Dallas forward Jamie Benn said. \"I think we let our goalie down, and we let each other down. Tough night.\"\n\nIt tends to happen when Crosby is at the top of his game. He slid a backhand pass across the ice to Guentzel for a one-timer that slipped between Khudobin's pads to give the Penguins the lead 3:58 into the first period. Malkin's wrist shot on the power play just over 2 minutes later doubled Pittsburgh's advantage, the Russian star flexing as the red goal light came on.\n\nCrosby's ninth of the season wrapped a frantic three-goal first-period outburst by Pittsburgh against a team that had allowed just 10 goals in the first period all season.\n\n\"I don't think I prepared our team well enough,\" Dallas coach Jim Montgomery said. \"We weren't ready to dig in. We weren't ready to win faceoffs. Ultimately that preparation falls on the head coach.\"\n\nIt would get no better for Dallas in the second. DeSmith denied Tyler Seguin on a breakaway and moments later Hornqvist flipped in a rebound to push it to 4-0. The sequence repeated itself when DeSmith got a pad on a shot by Janmark, leading to a breakout that ended with Pearson \u2014 acquired in a trade with Los Angeles last week \u2014 ripping a slap shot for his second goal in as many games.\n\n\"It's a heck of a shot, the goal he scores tonight,\" Sullivan said. \"My hope is he's going to gain a whole lot of confidence from scoring a couple games in a row. That was our hope when we acquired him, that he could help us in that area.\"\n\nNOTES: The Penguins went 1-for-3 on the power play. The Stars were 0-for-2 with the man advantage. ... Dallas scratched Bishop (lower-body injury), D Julius Honka and F Gemel Smith. ... Pittsburgh scratched D Chad Ruhwedel and F Daniel Sprong. ... Pittsburgh is 6-0-1 against the Western Conference."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "bmutzaba", "title": "Behind the scenes at Singapore's Changi Airport", "description": "", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/flights/2018/11/21/behind-the-scenes-at-singapores-changi-airport/38577205/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f6f6498bf62bd84a980bf50db6de7e978aba6f6/c=0-381-1200-1059/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636783477005452629-2018-Singapore-Changi-feature-21.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T02:40:20Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nAvailable to all passengers for a fee of about $15, a pool provides a relaxing way to beat the heat and pass the time at Singapore Changi International Airport (October, 2018.)

(Photo: NBC, Will Heath/NBC)\n\nOne thing we're thankful for this holiday? \"Saturday Night Live,\" which is reliably funny when tackling the traditions of Thanksgiving.\n\nTo celebrate Thanksgiving Eve, NBC is airing some of its top sketches about the holiday in a two-hour special Wednesday. Fortunately, there are a number of bits to choose from, including many festive songs from Lil' Baby Aidy rapping about being a \"Back Home Baller,\" to Adam Sandler strumming a Thanksgiving song and Garth and Katt making up words about \"Directions to Grandma's House.\"\n\nThere are also plenty of sketches set at the dinner table with relatives, from a clip that's almost 40 years old to a favorite from a couple of years ago. (Honorable mention: Here's a bizarre Thanksgiving sketch that was cut for time in 2016, but deserves to be seen today.)\n\nHere are eight of the best Thanksgiving episodes to ever air on \"SNL.\"\n\n8. Thanksgiving Dinner\n\nIn a sketch from 1979, Bill Murray, Laraine Newman, Jane Curtin and Paul Shaffer are relegated to the kids' table in the basement, despite being well into adulthood. They wind up earning their assigned seats, however.\n\n7. Debbie Downer: Thanksgiving Dinner\n\nRachel Dratch's Debbie Downer knows just what tidbits to share in order to make her peers feel uncomfortable. She's such a downer, even the turkey leaves the table in this 2004 clip.\n\n6. Target Commercial\n\nDo post-election gatherings with the family stress you out? This parody Target commercial from 2016 invites Thanksgiving guests to come enjoy \"the big empty parking lot you can just come sit in for a sec.\"\n\n5. Adam Sandler on Thanksgiving\n\nIn a 1992 Weekend Update segment, Adam Sandler plays us his best Thanksgiving song ... which incorporates plenty of random facts that rhyme with words about how he loves to eat turkey \"in a big brown shoe.\"\n\n4. Garth and Kat sing Thanksgiving songs\n\nFred Armisen and Kristen Wiig's musical duo Garth and Kat clearly make up the words to the song \"Directions to Grandma's House\" on the spot in 2011. But the line \"Who loves the tin foil?\" is a winner, and so is special guest Chris Martin, who makes a cameo.\n\n3. Penelope: Thanksgiving\n\nWiig, playing another one of her popular characters in 2010, is a one-upper working at a soup kitchen for Thanksgiving. The character Penelope is especially funny next to Anne Hathaway's do-gooder Mary. She's a little more thankful than everyone else, so...\n\n2. Back Home Ballers\n\nThe catchy, all-girl rap details the benefits of coming back in town to see your folks on Thanksgiving: \"They wait on me like I'm sickly, that's a life of a back home baller,\" goes the song from 2014.\n\n1. Thanksgiving Miracle\n\nThe only thing that can keep a family from having contentious discussions about politics, racism and gender norms? Adele. Everyone loves Adele. They did in 2015 and they still do today.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fWIH2u"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Drake downs UMKC 66-63 behind Ellingson's 13 points", "description": "Brady Ellingson scored 13 points with three 3-pointers and six rebounds and Drake held off UMKC 66-63 for the Kangaroos' sixth straight loss", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/drake-downs-umkc-66-63-behind-ellingsons-13-points/38583625/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T02:27:05Z", "content": "KANSAS CITY, Mo.

(AP) \u2014 The Indiana Pacers paid so much attention to Kemba Walker on Wednesday night they seemed to forget about the rest of the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nWalker drew plenty of attention from the Pacers defense in the pick-and-roll after his recent scoring outburst, which allowed his teammates to get open looks from 3-point range.\n\nThe NBA's leading scorer going into the game finished with 16 points and a season-high 11 assists as the Hornets defeated the Pacers 127-109.\n\nWalker had scored 103 points in his previous two games, including 60 against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. But the two-time All-Star only attempted 10 shots against the Pacers.\n\n\"About time he decided to start passing the ball,\" joked Hornets coach James Borrego, who has encouraged Walker to shoot as much as he can this season.\n\nBorrego said the Hornets offense starts with Walker.\n\n\"He generates so much for us,\" Borrego said. \"I think this is where we have to go as a team right now. The more teams want to put pressure on him, put two guys on the ball, you see what we can accomplish without Kemba having to go for big numbers.\"\n\nJeremy Lamb was one the beneficiaries of the open looks, scoring 21 points on a career-high five 3-pointers. He also attacked the rim well.\n\n\"Kemba can facilitate, he can score, he can do whatever he wants on the court,\" Lamb said. \"Today he facilitated and we were able to knock down some shots.\"\n\nCharlotte shot 62 percent from 3-point range, making a season-high 18 of 29 shots from beyond the arc.\n\n\"Whatever the defense give me, I'm trying to take advantage of that and tonight when they were up in the pick-and-rolls I was just getting rid of the basketball and my teammates were just making shots,\" Walker said.\n\nSaid Borrego: \"Teams will have to decide how they want to play us with Kemba. But no matter what they do, I trust our guys are getting better and understanding spacing.\"\n\nDwayne Bacon had 18 and Cody Zeller 15 for the Hornets, who improved to 6-3 at home.\n\nBojan Bogdanovic had 20 points for the Pacers, who played for a second straight game without Victor Oladipo, who remains out with a sore right knee. Indiana had its three-game winning streak halted.\n\n\"Walker did a good job of scoring when he had opportunities but setting his teammates up and they were knocking down shots,\" Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. \"Just couldn't get stops tonight. Sometimes that happens.\"\n\nTIP INS:\n\nPacers: Domantas Sabonis was 7 of 7 for 15 points before rolling his ankle midway through the second quarter. He returned in the second half, but never scored again and fouled out with 6 minutes left.\n\nHornets: Marvin Williams was taken to the locker room in the third quarter with a face contusion and a bloody nose after taking a knee to the head from Young while on the floor. He returned to the bench, but did not play. ... Malik Monk broke out of a 0-for-14 slump from beyond the arc by making 3 of 6 3-pointers.\n\nKAMINSKY SEES ACTION\n\nFrank Kaminsky had 11 points off the bench, which was more than he had scored all season (nine).\n\nBorrego praise Kaminsky for having a \"fantastic\" attitude and continuing to work hard, even though he had only played a limited role in five games this season after being a role player last year under coach Steve Clifford.\n\n\"I didn't know when the opportunity was going to come,\" Kaminsky said. \"Obviously with Willy being hurt wasn't how I wanted it to happen. But coach has told me all season so far just to stay ready, be ready for whatever comes and then when you get the opportunity you've got to be ready to take it. I was just really excited that I got that chance tonight.\"\n\nBRIDGING THE GAP\n\nRookie Miles Bridges had a nice stretch late in the third quarter to help push Charlotte's lead to 21 points. He knocked down back-to-back 3-pointers and then rejected shots by Thaddeus Young and Cory Joseph seconds later.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPacers: Host Spurs on Friday night.\n\nHornets: Visit Thunder on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bourama Sidib\u2026 [+2036 chars]", "fulltext": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 From the perspective of Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, it didn't really look like his team was hitting the gas pedal on offense in the second half against Colgate on Wednesday night.\n\nThen again, compared to the team's performance in the first half, almost anything would have been an improvement.\n\nTyus Battle scored 24 points and Elijah Hughes and Oshae Brissett added 17 each to lead Syracuse past Colgate 77-56 in the Carrier Dome, snapping a two-game losing streak that had dropped the Orange from the national rankings.\n\nThe Orange led just 35-32 at halftime after shooting just 12 for 34 overall and 2 of 10 from 3-point range. But after trailing the Raiders 43-41 with 16:15 remaining in the game, Syracuse closed with a 36-13 run. Syracuse hit 14 of 26 field goals in the second half, including 5 for 10 from long range.\n\n\"You have to make shots. The way we shot in the first half, we were fortunate to be able to get the lead,\" Boeheim said. \"We missed seven or eight layups right around the basket (in the first half). We've got to make those. The second half, it looks like we made a lot of shots, which we really didn't. When you're not making any shots, making a few helps.\"\n\nBourama Sidibe led Syracuse (3-2) on the boards with 10 rebounds as the Orange claimed a 46-30 edge on the glass.\n\nJordan Burns and Will Rayman paced Colgate (4-2) with 13 points apiece. The Raiders hung in with Syracuse in the first half on the strength of an 8-for-23 effort from 3-point range. But the Orange clamped down to limit Colgate to 4 for 17 from long range in the second half. The Raiders managed just six field goals in the game that weren't 3-pointers, and at one stretch went 12 minutes in the second half without a field goal.\n\n\"Obviously, they made some adjustments in the zone in the second half and took away some of the things that we were able to do in the first half,\" said Raiders coach Matt Langel. \"And we weren't able to make some adjustments after that. We didn't get the ball behind the zone quite like we needed to. They left some of the interior options open and we weren't able to capitalize on those.\"\n\nBattle helped SU take control with 16 second-half points.\n\n\"He's a scorer. His first step, I think, is elite,\" Langel said.\n\nBattle also hit all three of his 3-pointers after going just 1-for-11 from that range in the team's first four games.\n\n\"I just stepped up and took them with confidence. That's really it,\" he said. \"I'm not going to stop shooting them. I knew they were going to start falling.\"\n\nOrange guard Frank Howard, who had been sidelined since September with an ankle injury, saw his first action of the season. He got the start and hit the Orange's first basket of the game, a 3-pointer, at the 1:07 mark. Those were his only points on a 1-for-5 shooting night, although he paced Syracuse with five assists in 19 minutes of play.\n\n\"It's good to have Frank back. He made a couple really smart plays to start the second half,\" Boeheim said. \"When you haven't played in eight weeks, it's very hard.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nColgate: The Raiders should be heartened by their effort, validating what had been the school's first 4-1 start since 2007.\n\nSyracuse: The Orange, ranked 16th in the preseason, fought past a pesky opponent to pick up some much-needed momentum after dropping a pair of games to Connecticut and No. 21 Oregon in the Empire Classic in New York.

(AP) \u2014 With a nine-day layoff between games, Buffalo's players challenged each other in practice to stay sharp.\n\nThey may have given each other a tougher test than Dartmouth did on Wednesday night.\n\nNick Perkins had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and No. 22 Buffalo scored the first 15 points and cruised to a 110-71 victory.\n\n\"I didn't think we were going to have any problem scoring,\" coach Nate Oats said. \"Our practices are really intense, almost game-like. We didn't even talk about Dartmouth for the first four days. We were really more concerned about us.\"\n\nFive players scored in double figures for Buffalo (4-0), which tied its record for points in a game since moving to Division I in 1994-95. The Bulls, who played without leading scorer C.J. Massinburg, have won their first four games for the first time since 1986-87, when they were in Division III.\n\nBuffalo cracked the AP Top 25 for the first time last week.\n\n\"We've been a having a target on our backs since we've been winning the past year,\" Perkins said. \"It's something that we're used to. It got a little more intense with the number next to our name. Everybody outside of our conference is going to come at you.\"\n\nDavonta Jordan and Jayvon Graves scored 16 points apiece for Buffalo, while Jeremy Harris and Jeenathan Williams each had 11.\n\n\"Davonta got to the rim at will, and Jeremy was getting to the rim,\" Oats said. \"Any questions about whether we had rust or we weren't going to be ready to play went out of the window in the first four or five minutes of the game.\"\n\nIan Sistare scored 18 points for Dartmouth (3-2), all in the first half, and Chris Knight added 17.\n\nMassinburg was sidelined with a sprained knee suffered Monday in practice. The senior guard had a career-high 43 points in the Bulls' win over then-13th-ranked West Virginia, and is averaging 20.3 points per game. He's expected to return sometime next week.\n\nBuffalo made its first five shots. Dartmouth, meanwhile, missed its first eight before Sistare converted inside, and the Big Green never recovered.\n\n\"They're really, really good at the beginning of possessions,\" Dartmouth coach David McLaughlin said. \"They run their stuff, but they're really good at the end of possessions on the glass. If we were doing well at the glass, we were suffering in transition, and vice versa.\"\n\nDartmouth made a push to make the game competitive in the first half, pulling within 28-25, but Buffalo used its size and speed to get easy baskets. Ten different players scored in the first half as the Bulls built a 55-39 lead at the break.\n\n\"We talk about pounding the stone,\" Oats said. \"At some point, they're going to crack with as hard and as fast as we play. It's going to blow the game wide open. We force teams to play fast.\"\n\nSTATS\n\nBuffalo shot 45 of 76 from the floor. The field-goal total was the most since Jan. 27, 1976, when the Bulls had 46 against Brockport State while playing at the Division III level.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nBuffalo is just the third team from the Mid-American Conference to be ranked in the AP Top 25 since 2000. The others were Kent State in 2008 and Ball State in 2001.\n\nDartmouth fell to 3-55 against ranked teams. Its last victory over a ranked team was March 13, 1956, when the Big Green beat No. 14 West Virginia, 63-61.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDartmouth: At San Francisco on Saturday.\n\nBuffalo: Hosts Marist on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON - Democrats won the popular vote in the House by the largest margins since the Watergate scandal and resignation of Republican President Richard Nixon, according to an analysis by NBC News.\n\nThe analysis found Democrats led Republicans in House races by a whopping 8.6 million votes in this year's midterms. NBC News reports that number is the largest margin that Democrats have defeated Republicans in a midterm House election since 1974.\n\nThat midterm race, shortly after Nixon resigned, allowed Democrats to win the popular vote by 8.7 million votes, NBC reported.\n\nSome have made comparisons between the administrations of Trump and Nixon as special counsel Robert Mueller continues to examine the role of Russia in the 2016 election and whether the president attempted to obstruct justice and end the probe.\n\nNixon also resisted investigations after his administration attempted to distance itself with five men who broke into the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate hotel.\n\nThe coverup led to Nixon's resignation from the presidency in 1974.\n\nMore: The election that won't end: 2 House seats in New York, 1 in California remain in question\n\nMore: Meet the Democrats who could lead the investigations into President Donald Trump\n\nMore: These are the historic firsts for women, minority and LGBTQ candidates in 2018\n\nThis year's midterms flipped nearly 40 seats, allowing Democrats to take control of the House and setting the stage for two years of confrontations with President Donald Trump when they take power in January.\n\nDemocrats are expected to leverage their new majority to wield Congress' oversight powers. They could demand Trump\u2019s tax returns, subpoena his Cabinet members and investigate suspected ties to Russia. And they can block the president\u2019s legislative priorities, whether it\u2019s funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border or curbing entitlement programs.\n\nThe election was also a historic one for women, people of color and the LGBTQ community. Female candidates spearheaded Democratic gains. At least 80 women had been elected to the House. Sixty-nine of the House women are Democrats, including 27 of 28 newcomers, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\n\nJared Polis was the first gay man to win a governor's race. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Ayanna Pressley became Massachusetts' first black congresswoman. Minnesota's Ilhan Omar and Michigan's Rashida Tlaib became the first Muslim women elected to Congresss.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump is warning House Democrats about spending the remaining years of his presidency investigating him and his administration.

But he's a great kid, he deserves success and sometimes you just have to get lucky. We haven't been really lucky around here,\" Pitino said.\n\nKalscheur made a contested 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left, lifting Minnesota to a 68-66 win over Washington in the final of the Vancouver Showcase on Wednesday.\n\nWashington led 66-65 and had possession, but Jaylen Nowell was called for an offensive foul with 12.8 seconds left. Minnesota didn't appear to have a good look as Kalscheur was guarded by Washington's Noah Dickerson. But the freshman got enough space \u2014 perhaps with the help of an extra step \u2014 to get off the difficult shot that swished. It was just his second 3-pointer of the game.\n\nKalscheur looked to have shuffled his feet before putting up the shot.\n\n\"When it left his hand I said 'He made it,'\" Dickerson said. \"I (saw) the look in his eyes.\"\n\nNowell had a shot from about 35 feet at the buzzer that wasn't close.\n\nThe final game of the inaugural event wasn't pretty as both teams suffered from stretches of sloppy play and offensive inefficiency. But it got the exciting conclusion it hoped thanks to Minnesota's late rally.\n\nJordan Murphy led Minnesota (5-0) with 18 points \u2014 all in the second half \u2014 and 11 rebounds. Alex Coffey added 17 points and Kalscheur finished with nine points, including the three biggest.\n\n\"That was insane. That was something you would typically see in March Madness or something,\" Murphy said.\n\nDickerson matched his career high with 28 points for Washington (4-2) and Nowell added 22, but the Huskies were outscored 14-7 over the final six minutes and continued to struggle with finding a third scorer. David Crisp had eight points but no one else scored more than two.\n\n\"The ball stopped. We didn't get a lot of flow, didn't get a lot of movement,\" Washington coach Mike Hopkins said of the offensive issues late. \"They were killing us inside and then they were just beating us down court later in the game. We still had the one-point lead. ... We've got to learn from it and move forward.\"\n\nKalscheur, who scored 18 of 25 points in the first half versus Santa Clara, was scoreless until hitting a corner 3-pointer with 7:37 left to pull the Gophers within 54-52. Every time Washington was on the verge of pulling away, Minnesota had a mini spurt to stay close. Washington wasn't able to build its lead to more than five after as the teams matched shot for shot, interspersed with some sloppy possessions.\n\nWashington still led 63-58 with 3:23 left but Kalscheur was fouled shooting a 3 and hit all three. The Gophers pulled even on Coffey's driving layup and after a Washington miss, Murphy put the Gophers up 65-63 with two minutes left.\n\nNowell answered with a tough driving basket and Crisp split free throws for a 66-65 lead. Minnesota had several chances on its next possession but ended up turning the ball over with 38 seconds left. Washington answered with its own turnover as Nowell was called for a charge as Coffey played excellent defense to draw the foul that set up Kalscheur's winning shot.\n\n\"We had a chance to not put ourselves in that position and that's the frustrating part,\" Hopkins said\n\nTOUGH TURNAROUND\n\nPlaying for the third time in four days, both teams showed signs of fatigue during a lethargic first half. It was an exceptionally tough turnaround for Washington whose win over Texas A&M finished after 10:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday night and was back on the court less than 17 hours later.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMinnesota: After seeing Kalscheur hit six 3-pointers in the first half a day earlier, all of the Gophers struggled from deep early against Washington. The Gophers were 1 of 6 on 3s in the first 20 minutes and 4 of 12 for the game. ... Minnesota shot 26 percent and was 7 of 15 on free-throws in the first half. The Gophers finished at 38 percent shooting and were 22 of 33 at the line.\n\nWashington: The 20 points by Minnesota in the first half were the fewest allowed by Washington since giving up 15 against Oregon State in January 2015. ... The Huskies missed all seven 3-point attempts in the first half. Their first 3 came with 18:32 left on Nowell's corner 3. ... Dickerson posted consecutive 20-point games for the third time in his career.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMinnesota: The Gophers are at Boston College next Monday as part of the ACC/Big Ten Challenge.\n\nWashington: The Huskies get a break before hosting Eastern Washington on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Nick Mullens is getting an extended look as the San Francisco 49ers' starting quarterback, and an important test awaits Sunday.\n\nMullens will make the first road start of his NFL career against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his first chance to show how he handles a hostile environment after making his first two starts at home.\n\nAfter the 49ers lost No. 1 quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to a season-ending knee injury in Week 3, C.J. Beathard got the first crack at replacing him.\n\nBeathard failed to impress over five starts, and the 49ers (2-8) turned to Mullens, who hadn't played a snap in the NFL before his Nov. 1 start against Oakland.\n\nHe threw for 262 yards and three touchdowns in that victory and played solid again in a Nov. 12 loss to the New York Giants. Now Mullens, an undrafted free agent who spent all of last season on San Francisco's practice squad, will have his poise tested on the road.\n\n\"That definitely is a big challenge,\" Mullens said Wednesday. \"I haven't played on the road yet. But I think this team is excited. It's important we start fast. It's important for me to keep my same mindset. Don't let the environment impact the way you play.\"\n\nMullens has completed 71 percent of his passes for 512 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions in two games. Those numbers, along with the leadership he has shown, have placed him squarely in the 49ers' thoughts regarding next season. Assuming Garoppolo makes a healthy return by training camp, which is expected, Mullens will be a legitimate contender for the backup role.\n\nBut coming off a bye week, he's trying to help the 49ers finish this season strong after a disappointing first 10 games. Tampa Bay's defense, on paper, would suggest Mullens can find his comfort zone Sunday.\n\nThe Buccaneers have allowed the fifth-most yards per game in the NFL (395.9), and they sport the league's worst turnover ratio at minus-23.\n\nTampa Bay (3-7) has not generated a single defensive takeaway since Justin Evans made a first-quarter interception in the third week against Pittsburgh. Entering Sunday, the Buccaneers have played 32 consecutive quarters without a takeaway.\n\nThe 49ers haven't been much better with a minus-15 turnover ratio, second-worst in the NFL.\n\n\"I think that's one of the reasons for both teams not having much success,\" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said.\n\nMullens has a unique method for trying to prepare for a road game, one that he used even before becoming the 49ers starter.\n\nHe found audio files of artificial crowd noise, via Apple Music, slips on his headphones and listens to it at home, calling out signals over the noise as if he was at the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"I have a very strict routine that I try to stick to, and it helps me prepare,\" Mullens said. \"And that does involve calling out the plays and envisioning the plays and seeing them in your head.\"\n\nGiven that preparation, it was somewhat surprising to hear Mullens say that he actually did take a couple days off during his bye week and spent it with his wife.\n\nShanahan said he didn't talk much to Mullens during the break.\n\n\"You let him get away,\" the coach said. \"He's heard enough of me for the time being.\"\n\nNOTES: Garoppolo, who until recently was using crutches in his recovery from surgery for a torn ACL, has been cleared to at least watch practice from the sidelines, which he did Wednesday as a light drizzle fell. . Receiver Pierre Garcon (knee) did not practice but did agility work on the side. Guard Joshua Garnett (thumb) was held out. Linebacker Reuben Foster (hamstring) and center Weston Richburg (knee) both were limited.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Against a black backdrop, giant white letters delivered the heartfelt message.\n\nCleveland wanted to say something.\n\n\"THANK YOU, LeBRON,\" it said.\n\nEight years after he was treated like a thug, LeBron James was welcomed back properly.\n\nBack on the court where he performed for 11 seasons, and under the title banner he helped raise, James returned to Cleveland and rallied the Los Angeles Lakers to a 109-105 win on Wednesday night over the Cavaliers, who played their best game of the season against their former teammate but couldn't stop him when it mattered most.\n\nJames finished with 32 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. He also scored or assisted on 11 straight points as the Lakers overcame a 99-91 deficit in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut basketball took a backseat to James' homecoming, which was so different than his return in 2010, when betrayed Cleveland fans unleashed their fury on him.\n\nThere were no profane chants this time. No derogatory signs. No venom.\n\nOnly love, and James felt it.\n\n\"From the time we landed yesterday, it just felt a different way,\" he said. \"I'm a different person. We're all different from eight years ago, both good and bad. But more importantly, this experience has been great. So it's all about growth and we all have grown from that moment eight years ago. So I kind of leave the past in the past and always focus on the present and see what happens in the future.\"\n\nThe Cavs, who came in a league-worst 2-13, gave James and the Lakers all they could handle. And even after giving up an eight-point lead, they had a chance to tie late, but Kyle Korver missed a wide-open 3-pointer with 17 seconds left and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope made four free throws in the final 15 to seal it for Los Angeles.\n\nJordan Clarkson had 20 points and Tristan Thompson 14 and 15 rebounds for Cleveland.\n\nFrom the moment he stepped back onto Quicken Loans Arena floor, James was treated like a returning champion.\n\nOn the night before Thanksgiving, Cleveland said thanks to the Northeast Ohio son, the one who ended the city's 52-year championship drought.\n\n\"A hero has come back,\" Cavs coach Larry Drew said before tip-off.\n\nJames was the last Lakers player introduced before the game, presented with a line familiar to all Cavs fans: \"A 6-foot-8 forward from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School,\" said arena announcer Sean Peebles. \"Welcome home! LeBron James.\"\n\nThe crowd roared and stood as James walked out and huddled with his new teammates, who must have wondered what was in store for them.\n\nBut unlike that ugly night of Dec. 2, 2010, when James returned with the Miami Heat and was subjected to a toxic, charged atmosphere of hatred unlike anything seen before or since, this was a night for celebration \u2014 and maybe more closure.\n\nJames has moved on.\n\nCleveland, too.\n\nWith 8:09 left in the first quarter, James was saluted by the Cavs with a moving video tribute during a timeout. Images of James' playing days with Cleveland \u2014 highlighted by the Cavs' historic comeback to win the 2016 title \u2014 were shown along with video clips of his impact on the community, including his opening of the I Promise School in his hometown of Akron.\n\nJames was touched by the presentation. He bit his lower lip while walking back onto court and pointed to all corners of the building in appreciation, his chance to reconnect with a fan base he'll always share a special, if not complicated, relationship.\n\n\"I appreciate these fans, just as much as they appreciate me,\" he said. \"Every single night we stepped on the floor, they always showed their appreciation to not only myself but to my teammates over these 11 years, especially the last four years \u2014those championship runs that we were making. So that was just my salute to them for them appreciating what I was able to accomplish with my teammates and coaches along those four years.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nLakers: Coach Luke Walton is impressed with James' knack for blocking out external distractions. \"The great ones have that ability,\" he said. \"When they're on the basketball court nothing else matters, other than what they're trying to do. Their focus level seems to somehow get higher with the louder the noise gets. I don't know how. I don't know why.\"\n\nCavaliers: Did not commit a turnover in the first half. ... Starting G George Hill missed his sixth straight game with a sprained right shoulder sustained on Nov. 4. Hill has ramped up his on-court workouts in recent days and could be back soon. ... Drew said he was unaware of Smith's comments accusing the Cavs of \"tanking.\" Drew believes his team is playing hard, and promised to nothing but coach his team to win. \"To coach to lose, I don't understand that, I don't know how to do that,\" he said. \"I don't know how anybody can do that. That's something I would never, ever do.\"\n\nSCHOOL DAY\n\nEarlier in the day, James made a surprise visit to his I Promise School, a refurbished elementary for at-risk kids he founded and plans to expand.\n\n\"It was grandparent's day,\" he said. \"We kept it that way, we didn't tell none of the kids until I actually walked into all six of the classrooms individually, spent a good amount of time with those classrooms, my third and fourth graders. It was great. It was a good way to go into Thanksgiving, all of being thankful, the great lives they've had.\"\n\nHOME COOKING\n\nFollowing the game, the Lakers feasted on hamburgers, french fries and shakes from Swenson's, an Akron drive-in restaurant favored by James.\n\nSitting at his locker, James sipped on a banana shake and smiled.\n\n\"I'm good,\" he said. \"I got my hometown food.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLakers: Host Utah on Friday.\n\nCavaliers: At Philadelphia on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A palpable vitriol for James was undeniable.\n\nBut much changed between then and Nov. 21, 2018.\n\nFirst and foremost, he returned to the Cavs in 2014 and delivered a championship to the franchise, city and region after trailing Golden State 3-1 in the 2016 Finals. The Cavaliers played in four consecutive Finals and were appointment viewing. Plus, his philanthropic organization \u2014 the LeBron James Family Foundation \u2014 continued to help kids in Akron, Cleveland and northeast Ohio.\n\nHis legacy among Cavs fans was set.\n\nBy the end of the 2017-18 season, it became apparent that James might leave the Cavs again, and on the first day of free agency on July 1, James announced he planned to sign a four-year deal with the Lakers.\n\nThis time, fans and the organization weren\u2019t as angry.

Nowitzki was on schedule to be ready for the start of this season before a setback led to tendon soreness just before the start of training camp in September.\n\nNowitzki spoke alongside Rawlings before the ceremony during the Mavericks' game against Brooklyn.\n\n\"It's just hard when I haven't done much for eight weeks and there's a 40-year-old basically starting from scratch to try to get back in shape to play NBA minutes,\" Nowitzki said. \"Hopefully soon. Hopefully, somewhere in December I'll be ready and the body will respond the right way.\"\n\nNowitzki is set to become the first player to spend all 21 seasons with the same team. Until he makes his debut, he will technically share the record of 20 seasons with Kobe Bryant, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2016.\n\nThe 2007 NBA MVP said he started running on a treadmill about two weeks ago and has steadily increased the intensity. Nowitzki has played in a couple of games involving staff members during practice. But until he goes through several full practices, his debut will have to wait.\n\n\"The reason why we're taking it so slow now is once I get out there, I want to finish the rest of the season healthy,\" Nowitzki said. \"I don't want to come back too soon now and then have setbacks again like I did with the Achilles a few years ago. Next thing you know I missed another few weeks.\"\n\nNowitzki said the significance of this debut hasn't made him any more anxious than the painstaking wait when all indications were the surgery wouldn't affect what could \u2014 and many presume will be \u2014 his final season.\n\n\"I've been antsy,\" he said. \"Had the surgery in April and it's been nothing but rehab and treadmills. Love to step out there soon and get the kick of competing, the crowd involved. It's just something I miss. And once my career is over, that's for sure something I'll miss, the kick, the rush, the adrenaline.\"\n\nNowitzki said he wasn't ready to decide how the injury will influence a decision on a possible 22nd season.\n\nEither way, Rawlings didn't want to wait past this season to honor the player who led the Mavericks to their only championship as the NBA Finals MVP in 2011 and is the highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history with 31,187 points, seventh on the all-time list.\n\nRawlings lauded Nowitzki for his willingness to be visible in public, mentioning that he was elected the same night Nowitzki was celebrating a birthday and they ended up at the same club.\n\n\"That was LIT!\" Nowitzki interrupted, drawing laughs.\n\n\"A kid came here that was skinny and didn't really know much about life and only lived at home,\" Nowitzki said earlier. \"Like I said earlier, grew into a man here. Off the court, try to help out, try to help this great city be better. Try to represent the city the right way.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Melvin Gordon of the Chargers is quietly stating his case that there is more than one elite all-purpose running back in Los Angeles.\n\nEven though the Rams' Todd Gurley has commanded most of the attention when it comes to discussing the league's top running backs, Gordon is showing that he should be in that conversation as well.\n\nGoing into Sunday's game against Arizona, the fourth-year back has six straight games where he has had 120 yards or more from scrimmage. He is averaging 132.1 yards from scrimmage per game, which is second to Gurley. He is also averaging 6.4 yards per touch, which is fourth, while Gurley is averaging 5.9 yards, which is tied for sixth.\n\nGordon has 42 receptions and is on track to surpass last year's career high of 58. The increased receptions are fine with Gordon as long as he gets the ball.\n\n\"Coach (Anthony) Lynn especially told me this year, 'Don't really focus on the carries. Let's just worry about the touches.' He made that big this year,\" Gordon said. \"I knew when I heard that, it's just an opportunity for me \u2014 whether it's catching or running (the ball). As long as I'm getting the opportunity, I can take that.\"\n\nWhen Gordon has caught the ball out of the backfield, he has made the most of it. He is the only back in the league that has more than 40 receptions and 100 rushing attempts to average over 10.5 (10.7) yards per catch. He is also tied for second in the league with four catches of 25 or more yards.\n\nThe receptions have also taken less of a toll on Gordon's body instead of running between the tackles 20-25 times a game.\n\n\"It can definitely help keep a back fresh, but their touches are just like carries to him. Check-downs, swing passes, those are just extended runs. We're doing a good job of finding him in those situations,\" Lynn said.\n\nGordon missed the Week 7 game against Tennessee because of a hamstring injury, but says he feels good for this point of the season.\n\n\"I'm just trying to lift heavy on the legs still and trying to get my extra conditioning in when I can,\" he said. \"I'm banged up like everybody else. I have little nicks here and there. I'll probably be good on Saturday. I'll probably be back to where I need to be and then, obviously, the next day you're back at war.\"\n\nWhen Gordon has carried the ball, he's still been one of the tougher backs to take down. According to SportRadar, Gordon is fourth in rushing yards after contact (399) and second in broken tackles with 27.\n\nGordon could have a prime opportunity for his fourth 100-yard rushing game of the season on Sunday. Arizona (2-8) comes into the game with the fourth-worst run defense in the league,\n\nCardinals coach Steve Wilks faced Gurley in Week 2 and said that both Gordon and Gurley are similar backs.\n\n\"I say similar because they both are what I consider very potent receivers out of the backfield,\" Wilks said. \"You know they can move them around well out of space as well as making you miss and have the capability to take it all the way.\"\n\nWilks said Gordon does take less hits when catching more than compared to running the ball.\n\n\"Yeah, you take the run between the tackles, and you're still going to get hits. Last week he didn't get hits because he ran for 50, 60 yards, whatever it was. It takes less off your body, the pounding between the tackles, yes, it does in that way.\"\n\nNotes: DT Corey Liguet was placed on injured reserve as he underwent surgery for his quad tendon. The surgery was performed by Dr. Jonathan Glashow in New York, and the estimated recovery time is approximately 6 to 9 months. To fill Liguet's roster spot, the Chargers claimed DT T.Y. McGill off waivers from the Philadelphia Eagles. McGill was with the Chargers the first four games this season. . DE Joey Bosa was listed as a full participant in practice for the first time this season. He played in his first game last Sunday against Denver after missing the first nine games because of a bone bruise to his left foot.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Fortunately, there are a number of bits to choose from, including many festive songs from Lil' Baby Aidy rapping about being a \"Back Home Baller,\" to Adam Sandler strumming a Thanksgiving song and Garth and Katt making up words about \"Directions to Grandma's House.\"\n\nThere are also plenty of sketches set at the dinner table with relatives, from a clip that's almost 40 years old to a favorite from a couple of years ago. (Honorable mention: Here's a bizarre Thanksgiving sketch that was cut for time in 2016, but deserves to be seen today.)\n\nHere are eight of the best Thanksgiving episodes to ever air on \"SNL.\"\n\n8. Thanksgiving Dinner\n\nIn a sketch from 1979, Bill Murray, Laraine Newman, Jane Curtin and Paul Shaffer are relegated to the kids' table in the basement, despite being well into adulthood. They wind up earning their assigned seats, however.\n\n7. Debbie Downer: Thanksgiving Dinner\n\nRachel Dratch's Debbie Downer knows just what tidbits to share in order to make her peers feel uncomfortable. She's such a downer, even the turkey leaves the table in this 2004 clip.\n\n6. Target Commercial\n\nDo post-election gatherings with the family stress you out? This parody Target commercial from 2016 invites Thanksgiving guests to come enjoy \"the big empty parking lot you can just come sit in for a sec.\"\n\n5. Adam Sandler on Thanksgiving\n\nIn a 1992 Weekend Update segment, Adam Sandler plays us his best Thanksgiving song ... which incorporates plenty of random facts that rhyme with words about how he loves to eat turkey \"in a big brown shoe.\"\n\n4. Garth and Kat sing Thanksgiving songs\n\nFred Armisen and Kristen Wiig's musical duo Garth and Kat clearly make up the words to the song \"Directions to Grandma's House\" on the spot in 2011. But the line \"Who loves the tin foil?\" is a winner, and so is special guest Chris Martin, who makes a cameo.\n\n3. Penelope: Thanksgiving\n\nWiig, playing another one of her popular characters in 2010, is a one-upper working at a soup kitchen for Thanksgiving. The character Penelope is especially funny next to Anne Hathaway's do-gooder Mary. She's a little more thankful than everyone else, so...\n\n2. Back Home Ballers\n\nThe catchy, all-girl rap details the benefits of coming back in town to see your folks on Thanksgiving: \"They wait on me like I'm sickly, that's a life of a back home baller,\" goes the song from 2014.\n\n1. Thanksgiving Miracle\n\nThe only thing that can keep a family from having contentious discussions about politics, racism and gender norms? Adele. Everyone loves Adele. They did in 2015 and they still do today.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fWIH2u"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "ULL beats Tulane 68-61 in Gulf Coast Showcase 3rd-place game", "description": "Marcus Stroman scored a career-high 26 points and Louisiana-Lafayette beat Tulane 68-61 on in the Gulf Coast Showcase third-place game", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/21/ull-beats-tulane-68-61-in-gulf-coast-showcase-3rd-place-game/38583343/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T01:09:51Z", "content": "ESTERO, Fla.

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Mike Munchak revels in projects such as Chukwuma Okorafor. The Pittsburgh Steelers offensive line coach loves few things more than taking raw talent, particularly talent with an unconventional background, and turning into something far more substantial.\n\nThe list of Munchak's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s includes starting left tackle Alejandro Villanueva, a former Army officer who did three tours in Afghanistan before starting his NFL career. Ditto Matt Feiler, who went undrafted after a career at Division II Bloomsburg, but has forged a path from practice squad flyer to dependable reserve.\n\nNow it may be Okorafor's turn. The rookie third-round pick practiced at right tackle with the starters on Wednesday with Marcus Gilbert still dealing with a knee injury and Feiler \u2014 who has made five straight starts in Gilbert's place \u2014 dealing with a pectoral issue.\n\nIt's uncertain whether Feiler will be ready to play on Sunday when the Steelers (7-2-1) visit Denver (4-6), leaving Okorafor as the next best option to line up across from Broncos star linebacker Von Miller.\n\nAll the 21-year old Okorafor \u2014 who was born in Nigeria and spent a portion of his childhood there before moving to the United States at age 12 \u2014 may have to do is find a way to keep a six-time Pro Bowler who already has 10 sacks this season from disrupting Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nNo pressure or anything.\n\n\"He's know what he's doing,\" Okorafor said on Wednesday. \"Got to just keep on watching film and keep playing.\"\n\nRoethlisberger, for his part, doesn't expect Okorafor or Feiler or whoever might be at right tackle to be able to handle Miller by himself.\n\n\"Nobody can really block Von Miller to tell you the truth, so we'll have to put a couple guys over there,\" Roethlisberger said.\n\n\"We are not going to be crazy and make one guy do it. We'll have to put a couple guys over there because he and (Bradley) Chubb are pretty special.\"\n\nMaybe, but the Steelers like what they've seen from Okorafor, whom they took with the 92nd overall pick in the draft after a solid career at Central Michigan. The 6-foot-6, 320-pounder is big but athletic and carved out a role as a blocking tight end in running situations. There's never any doubt when Okorafor is in the game. Because he wears No. 76, he's required to check in with the referees when he reports. That won't happen if he simply lines up next to right tackle David DeCastro.\n\nHe's more than happy to enjoy his anonymity and do his job, one that is far different than what he envisioned when the phone rang in April with the Steelers on the other end. Munchak, a Hall of Fame offensive lineman in his own right, likes to turn his players into students of the game. Okorafor is doing his best to be a sponge.\n\n\"No offense to my coach back in college, but like it's kind of a whole new level of looking at plays, looking at your technique and every single play,\" Okorafor said.\n\nOkorafor hardly considers himself the same player he was six months ago, a tribute to Munchak's approach. Quick to use his sense of humor to get a player's attention, Munchak has taken a bit of a more professorial approach with Okorafor. It's working. Okorafor watches film and admits he's stunned at how far he's come in six months, all of it a tribute to Munchak.\n\n\"Coach Munch knows what he's doing, he knows how to train guys,\" Okorafor said. \"Every guy plays differently and takes coaching a different way. You can't force the same type of coaching on every single guy and think it's going to work.\"\n\nIt's one of the reasons the Steelers have ripped off six straight wins, five of them with Feiler making the first starts of his NFL career in place of Gilbert. Pittsburgh kept humming along anyway. The expectations won't change if Okorafor jogs into the huddle with the starters in Denver.\n\n\"He's got all the tools, he's just young,\" DeCastro said. \"I remember being a rookie and the game was fast. There was a lot going on and there's things I didn't know back then that I learned and experienced and made my life easier. Just got to come in there and play fast when he has to, take care and pick him up when we can.\"\n\nNOTES: DE Stephon Tuitt (elbow) did not practice. ...

The win was the 664th of Tennessee coach Rick Barnes' career. It moved him past John Wooden on the all-time Division I wins list.\n\n\"It means I've been around a while,\" Barnes said.\n\nTrailing 77-70 with 6:51 left, Louisville coach Chris Mack got called for a technical foul when he didn't like an over-the-back call on Dwayne Sutton. The Cardinals could never recover, trailing by as many as 15.\n\n\"I complained during the game, so I'm not going to again complain now,\" Mack said. \"I thought when Dwayne got the ball it was compleley clean. It's basketball. I shouldn't have received the technical. That's my fault. It'll be the last one of this year.\"\n\nJordan Nwora had 23 points and 10 assists to lead Louisville (3-1).\n\nThe second game of the doubleheader was No. 2 Kansas against Marquette.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Rams quarterback Jared Goff completed 31-of-49 for 413 yards and four touchdowns while Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for 478 yards, six touchdowns, and three interceptions on 33-of-46 passing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the offense that provided points. Los Angeles linebacker Samson Ebukam returned a fumble for a touchdown along with an interception, and Kansas City defensive end Allen Bailey returned a fumble for a score.\n\n\u201cSo many different things happened in that game. Great quarterback play, great pass rush, turnovers, strip sacks, interceptions,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI mean, everything happened in that game \u2014 penalties kept drives alive. It was a really fun game to watch on tape.\u201d\n\nThe Texans aren\u2019t strangers to getting involved with shootouts with the Chiefs. On Oct. 8, 2017, quarterback Deshaun Watson completed 16-of-31 for 261 yards and five touchdowns as Houston fell 42-34 to the Chiefs on Sunday Night Football at NRG Stadium."}]
