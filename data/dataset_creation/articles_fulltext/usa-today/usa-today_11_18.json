(AP Photo/John Amis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Yet another last-minute loss might be the one that ends the Atlanta Falcons' playoff hopes.\n\nBrett Maher's 42-yard field goal as time expired gave the Dallas Cowboys a 22-19 win over the Falcons on Sunday. Atlanta (4-6) has lost two straight after reviving its season with three straight wins.\n\nThe scenario at the end of the game seemed depressingly familiar for the Falcons. Four of the team's six losses have come either on the opponent's final possession or with the Falcons denied on their final opportunity.\n\n\"It's aggravating at the end of the day,\" said cornerback Robert Alford. \"... We did do some good things today. We can't just hold our heads down. But at the end of the day we've got to learn to finish games.\"\n\nAtlanta also was denied late in narrow defeats to the Bengals (37-36), Saints (43-37 in overtime) and Eagles (18-12).\n\nThe close losses have come in a season the team has lost both starting safeties and both starting guards to season-ending injuries. Linebacker Deion Jones came off injured reserve this week after missing two months but was inactive against Dallas. Running back Devonta Freeman also is on injured reserve and may return late in the season.\n\nThe Falcons might have to close the regular season with six straight wins to make the playoffs. That's a lot to ask, especially as they enter a short work week before Thursday night's game at NFC South-leading New Orleans.\n\nThe Falcons played in the Super Bowl only two years ago and won a playoff game last year. Now, only an unlikely winning streak could extend that modest streak of postseason appearances.\n\n\"For sure it's uphill,\" Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. \"We know that. When you go into a locker room, it's emotional and guys are upset. ... Honestly, all our focus, all our energy, and intent are right into this week's preparation. That's the best thing we can do right now.\"\n\nJulio Jones' brilliant 34-yard touchdown catch over cornerback Chidobe Awuzie with 1:52 remaining tied the game at 19-all. Then Quinn gambled on a defensive stop as he burned timeouts in hopes his defense could make a stop and give the ball back to Matt Ryan and the offense.\n\nInstead, the Cowboys used a 10-play drive to set up Maher's game-winning field goal.\n\n\"We have been in position, but just have not been able to finish,\" said defensive tackle Grady Jarrett, who vowed he wouldn't give up on the season.\n\n\"Ain't no way around it,\" Jarrett said. \"It is what it is. You've got to go back to work or you're going to sulk. I ain't sulking.\"\n\nBefore Jones' late touchdown catch, Atlanta's only offense came on four field goals by Matt Bryant, who was perfect in his return after missing three games with a hamstring injury. Bryant, 43, used a heating pad on the sideline to stay loose.\n\n\"It was a good game, I guess, as far as I got through everything OK,\" Bryant said. \"Obviously, I'd rather have the win.\"\n\nHighlights? There weren't many. Jones had six catches for 118 yards. He's had a touchdown catch in three straight games but didn't talk with reporters after the game. Vic Beasley Jr. had two sacks .\n\nA pass from Ryan bounced off the hands of rookie Calvin Ridley and was intercepted by rookie linebacker Leighton Vander Esch in the fourth quarter, setting up Ezekiel Elliott's 23-yard touchdown run for a 19-9 lead.\n\n\"The ball got on me quick and the dude picked it,\" Ridley said.\n\nThe Falcons rallied to pull even, but again couldn't win late.\n\n\"We have won a lot of games on the other side of it but this year, unfortunately, we have been on the wrong side of that,\" Jarrett said. \"We have got to find a way to get right.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. \u2014 Joey Logano bumped his way into the finals. The 28-year-old Team Penske driver\u2019s run to his first career Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series was clean, although no less dramatic.\n\nLogano didn\u2019t need to nudge defending series champion Martin Truex Jr. like he did to earn a spot among the Championship 4 last month. Logano just sped past Truex with 11 laps left in Sunday\u2019s Ford EcoBoost 400 to claim both the race win and the championship at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing night,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI know what second felt like, and I know how much it stinks. I didn\u2019t know what winning felt like, but it feels really, really good.\u201d\n\nLogano finished second to seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson in 2016 after a fourth-place finish in the finale two years ago and, before Sunday, Logano hadn\u2019t finished any higher at this 1.5-mile track in nine previous starts.\n\nStill, Logano declared himself the favorite after bumping Truex at Martinsville \u2014 even if he didn\u2019t have a title like the other three Championship 4 drivers (Truex, Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch). Those three also were each seeking a second Cup title.\n\n\"You can't just be confident and say it because then it's just kind of BS, right?\" Logano said. \"You have to believe it inside.\n\n\"When you put yourself in high-pressure situations, you find more out of yourself. I think that move at the end of the race shows it. You refuse to lose. You really do.\"\n\nBIG THREE: Leave Homestead disappointed as Logano celebrates\n\nNIGHTMARE: Wind wreaks havoc for skydiver during pre-race festivities\n\nThe Championship 4 contenders were the class of the field at Homestead and finished 1-2-3-4. Truex held on for second; Harvick, the 2014 champion, came home third; and Busch, the 2015 champ, finished fourth.\n\nBusch, after a couple of missteps earlier in the race, rebounded on the final pit stop as the leaders came in when Daniel Suarez was spun out with 20 laps left. Busch had been holding out for a yellow because he was on s different pit strategy than the leaders.\n\n\u201cI was optimistic about it but didn\u2019t think it would be that short-lived,\u201d Busch said. \u201cI figured I could at least maybe lead three or four laps, but Martin got a good restart.\u201d\n\nTruex raced for the final time with Furniture Row Racing, which announced in September it would cease operations at season\u2019s end. Truex will drive the No. 19 Toyota next year and team with Busch\u2019s Joe Gibbs Racing.\n\nAfter he passed Busch on the final restart, it looked like Truex could send off the one-car Denver-based operation with another celebration before Logano made the pass with 11 laps left.\n\n\u201cJust didn\u2019t play out the way we needed it to,\u201d Truex said. \u201cI had nothing for him at the end. I needed 15, 20 more laps, and that\u2019s just the way it goes. I\u2019m not sure what else to say.\u201d\n\nLogano said he was thinking Truex could get him back for Martinsville as he passed him.\n\n\"Well, you never know,\" Logano said. \"He raced me hard. He raced me the same way that I would have raced him. We ran each other hard and tried to, but there was nothing dirty.\"\n\nBrad Keselowski finished fifth, Matt Kenseth sixth, Chase Elliott seventh, Clint Bowyer eighth, Aric Almirola ninth and Kurt Busch 10th.\n\nThe first caution of the weekend not counting the yellow flags after stages came on lap 139 for debris. Neither Friday\u2019s Camping World Truck Series nor Saturday\u2019s Xfinity Series races had \u201cnatural\u201d cautions.\n\nThe second came after Kyle Larson clipped the wall in turn 4 with 75 laps left. Larson was third at the time and led the most laps (45) than any driver not in the Championship 4.\n\nThe wall giveth and the wall taketh away. pic.twitter.com/2mVR7OGFnK \u2014 NASCAR (@NASCAR) November 18, 2018\n\nKyle Buch\u2019s crew \u2014 one of the most dominant this season \u2014 had its second miscue of the race as the air gun got caught under the car during the caution for Larson. That cost Busch four spots. Earlier in the race, a tire changer dropped a lug nut.\n\nHarvick raced minus his crew chief Rodney Childers and car chief Robert Smith, who were suspended for the final two races of the season after NASCAR found Harvick\u2019s No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford had an illegal spoiler after a victory at Texas Motor Speedway on Nov. 4.\n\nThe race\u2019s start was delayed a few minutes to clean up oil left on the track by Regan Smith\u2019s Chevrolet during the pace laps. That came minutes after a skydiver towing a flag got caught on the catch fence near turn 1. The skydiver was not injured, according to a track spokesperson.\n\nFollow Perez on Twitter @byajperez\n\nFORD ECOBOOST 400 RESULTS\n\nSunday at the 1.5-mile Homestead-Miami Speedway (starting position in parentheses):\n\n1.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 England surged into the UEFA Nations League finals tournament on Sunday, and Belgium threw away its place in a stunning 5-2 loss at Switzerland.\n\nOn a day of come-from-behind wins and twisting fortunes for the World Cup's beaten semifinalists, England edged Croatia 2-1 to avenge defeat when the teams met in Russia in July.\n\nEngland had to beat Croatia to advance over group leader Spain and trailed late, before Jesse Lingard leveled in the 78th and captain Harry Kane got the decisive goal in the 85th.\n\nBelgium, which finished third in Russia, seemed certain to join England and host Portugal in the inaugural Final Four of world soccer's newest tournament in June.\n\nThe top-ranked team still needs a trophy to back up its status and eased into a quick 2-0 lead against Switzerland.\n\nNeeding to score at least four to advance, the Swiss got three by halftime and added two more later to shock the Belgians.\n\n\"Too many individual errors. I have no words,\" Belgium defender Toby Alderweireld said.\n\nThe group was settled on a head-to-head tiebreaker with both teams on nine points. Switzerland's three-goal margin outweighed Belgium's 2-1 win in Brussels last month.\n\nSunday's dramatic games between top 10-ranked teams added to the strong impression made by the first Nations League.\n\nUEFA created the competition \u2014 amid some skepticism given the busy soccer calendar \u2014 to replace mostly meaningless and unpopular international friendly games.\n\nIt gives unheralded national teams in the lower tiers a route to qualify for the European Championship through a subsequent playoff round.\n\nAt the top, the best national teams get guaranteed games against each other and fight for a trophy in the odd-numbered years between World Cups and Euros.\n\nPortugal, England and Switzerland will be joined in the Final Four by either France or the Netherlands. The Dutch will advance if they get at least a draw on Monday in Germany, which has already been relegated to the second tier.\n\nThe Nations League Final Four draw takes place Dec. 3 in Dublin.\n\nBELGIUM COLLAPSE\n\nBeaten by France in the World Cup semifinals, Belgium won the third-place game against England in Russia and made a smooth start to the Nations League.\n\nMany thought an overdue trophy could come next year for the so-called golden generation led by Eden Hazard, though missing the injured Kevin De Bruyne on Sunday.\n\nNot now.\n\nThorgan Hazard scored after 66 seconds and 17 minutes in Lucerne but, by halftime, Ricardo Rodriguez scored a penalty and forward Haris Seferovic struck twice to bring the Swiss within one goal of advancing. They got two more, both from headers gifted by poor Belgian marking.\n\nDefender Nico Elvedi scored to make up for a bad mistake gifting Hazard his early opener, and Seferovic clinched his first international hat trick in the 84th, winning over home fans who are often criticizing him.\n\nENGLAND RISING\n\nEngland started a tough three-team group with a home loss against Spain, and trailed again at Wembley Stadium on Sunday when Andrej Kramaric scored in the 57th. That result would have been enough for Croatia to advance, despite its opening 6-0 rout by Spain in September.\n\nThings can change fast in the rapid-fire Nations League groups, and England scored twice late on to win the group and condemn Croatia to relegation into the second tier.\n\n\"I've never seen (Wembley) like this in an England shirt,\" said Kane, captain of an England team riding a wave of acclaim and affection at home under coach Gareth Southgate.\n\nBELARUS ADVANCES\n\nIn League D, Belarus sealed winning Group 2 with a sixth straight shutout in a 2-0 win at San Marino, making Luxembourg's 1-1 draw at Moldova immaterial.\n\nBelarus joins Georgia in being promoted to League C in two years' time, and taking their places in the League D playoffs in March 2020.\n\nThose playoffs featuring the four fourth-tier group winners will send one of Europe's lowest-ranked teams to the 2020 European Championship tournament.\n\nThe other two playoff entries are decided Monday and Tuesday, with Macedonia and Kosovo currently leading their groups.\n\nIn other games Sunday, Austria won 2-1 at Northern Ireland in a League B group already won by Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nIn a League C group, Finland had already won promotion and Estonia was already relegated before the final round of games Sunday ended with Hungary beating Finland 2-0, and Greece losing 1-0 at home to Estonia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel grabbed the headset and adjusted to calling the defensive plays as quickly as he could Sunday.\n\nAndrew Luck kept the Titans off-balance the rest of the afternoon.\n\nOn a day quarterback Marcus Mariota left with an injured right elbow, the biggest question coming out the game was the health of defensive coordinator Dean Pees, who was taken to a nearby hospital during the first quarter.\n\n\"Dean's doing OK. They took him to the hospital, they evaluated him, and they're going to keep him overnight for some tests,\" Vrabel said following the 38-10 blowout at Indianapolis. \"Everything that I've heard as of now has been very positive.\"\n\nWithout Pees, the Titans' usually strong defense didn't look like itself.\n\nTennessee (5-5) entered the game with the league's lowest-scoring defense, the fewest touchdowns allowed and back-to-back second-half shutouts.\n\nThis time, Luck carved up the Titans, going 23 of 29 with 297 yards, threw three touchdown passes, no interceptions and avoided being sacked in his fifth straight game.\n\nThe Colts jumped to a 24-0 lead, Luck improved to 10-0 against Tennessee and threw at least three TD passes in his seventh straight game, tying Dan Marino for the third-longest streak in NFL history. Only Tom Brady (10) and Peyton Manning (eight) remain ahead of Luck.\n\nHow much Pees' absence affected the Titans wasn't immediately clear. But after forcing a punt on Indy's first series, it was a struggle to even slow down the Colts (5-5).\n\nPees managed to walk out of the coaches' box without help, but the medical workers who had been called for assistance asked him to sit in a wheelchair to take him downstairs for further examination. The team issued a statement just before halftime saying Pees had been transported from Lucas Oil Stadium after he developed a \"medical issue.\"\n\nThe 69-year-old Pees, who retired briefly after last season, was in everybody's thoughts.\n\n\"I want to start by wishing Dean Pees the best,\" Colts coach Frank Reich said. \"I hope he's doing OK. So our thoughts and prayers are with him.\"\n\nLuck began his postgame news conference with the same sentiment.\n\n\"First off, I hope Dean Pees is all right,\" Luck said. \"He's a pretty famous name in this league.\"\n\nVrabel declined to answer what prompted the call for emergency personnel, nor did he have an update about Mariota, who missed Week 2 with a right elbow injury before returning in relief in Week 3. Mariota finished 10 of 13 with 85 yards and one interception before leaving the game after he was sacked for the fourth time.\n\nBy then, the Colts already had a 1-yard TD run from Marlon Mack, a 22-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri, a 68-yard TD pass from Luck to T.Y. Hilton and an 18-yard scoring run from Jordan Wilkins to make it 24-0.\n\nBlaine Gabbert's 6-yard pass and a 15-yard penalty on Indy safety George Odum set up the Titans for a 42-yard field goal.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 A once-promising season is spiraling dangerously out of control, and the Cincinnati Bengals can't even agree on the proper path to turning themselves back into a postseason contender.\n\nThere's no doubt that the defense has to get better. Yet the offense hasn't exactly been racking up the points without injured wide receiver A.J. Green.\n\n\"That's an individual that we need,\" Bengals safety Shawn Williams said.\n\nAfter watching his team give up more than 500 yards in total offense in three straight games, most in the Super Bowl era, coach Marvin Lewis fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin and took over the unit.\n\nLewis was pleased with the baby steps the Bengals took in a 24-21 loss to Baltimore on Sunday, even though they surrendered 403 yards \u2014 including 265 on the ground \u2014 to a team led by a quarterback making his first NFL start.\n\nWith four losses in five games, the Bengals (5-5) find themselves lumped with several other AFC teams on a ledge, in danger of falling out of the playoff picture.\n\n\"It's a race now, and that's what we're here for,\" Lewis said. \"It's now a race to the finish. And we'll be a better football team coming out of this than we were coming in. That's what's exciting for me.\"\n\nOK, the defense allowed the Ravens to convert half their 16 third-down tries and gave up 15 first downs rushing. But the 24 points allowed compared favorably to the previous four games \u2014 28 to Pittsburgh, 45 to Kansas City, 34 against Tampa Bay and the final insult, 51 at home against New Orleans.\n\n\"It was a step forward for us on defense,\" linebacker Vincent Rey insisted. \"Now we have to put the pedal to the metal.\"\n\nLewis knows all about leading a defense, given that he owns a Super Bowl ring from his time as a coordinator in Baltimore. The transition from Austin to Lewis was smooth, even if the results weren't ideal.\n\n\"I have no complaints,\" cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said. \"I got the calls, I got the checks, everything. We were playing fast, rallying to the ball.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the defense didn't get much support from the Cincinnati offense. Operating without Green, who has a toe injury, the Bengals were limited to 255 yards overall and scored only one touchdown before halftime.\n\n\"We didn't come out fast like we wanted to,\" tight end C.J. Uzomah said. \"Whether it was us hurting ourselves or just not executing, whatever the case may be, we just didn't get it done offensively.\"\n\nBengals quarterback Andy Dalton engineered a 34-23 win over Baltimore earlier this season and orchestrated a comeback victory last year to knock the Ravens out of the playoff picture on the final Sunday of the season.\n\nOn this day, he was a pedestrian 19 for 36 for 211 yards and two scores.\n\n\"A.J., if he'd have been out there, the coverage may have been different,\" Dalton said. \"But I think at the end of the day, we just got to make the plays.\"\n\nDalton sees only one way for the Bengals to turn their season around: by winning next Sunday at Cleveland, possibly one of the few teams struggling more than the Bengals.\n\n\"For us, it's all about winning the next one. ... It doesn't matter if we don't win. We've got to put our focus on this week.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Arkansas (2-1) twice led by double-digits in the s\u2026 [+2167 chars]", "fulltext": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) \u2014 An overtime loss in the season opener might have proved instrumental for Arkansas in a narrow win against Indiana.\n\nThe Razorbacks squandered a late lead in a 73-71 overtime loss to Texas, and the same fate loomed large again Sunday as the Hoosiers erased a double-digit Arkansas lead in the second half.\n\nThis time, the Razorbacks (2-1) found a way to hang on as Mason Jones' free throw with 2.5 seconds left provided Arkansas a 73-72 win in the Hardwood Showcase.\n\nDaniel Gafford scored a career-high 27 points for Arkansas, but it was Mason who delivered the big rebound and free throw that secured the win. It was a little redemption for Mason, who missed the front end of a one-and one with 1:01 left and Arkansas clinging to a 72-69 lead.\n\n\"I knew I was going to make that free throw,\" Mason said. \"I like the pressure.\"\n\nIn a similar situation against Texas, Mason missed a late shot and Texas rallied to tie and force overtime. Mason said Arkansas coach Mike Anderson told him he'd get another chance, and Sunday it presented itself.\n\n\"We learned a lot from that Texas game,\" Jones said. \"I just knew to be ready when the chance came again and I was ready this time.\"\n\nIndiana (3-1) had a chance to take the lead with under 15 seconds left, but two shots under the Hoosiers' basket would not fall and Jones rebounded the second miss and was fouled by De'Ron Davis with 2.5 seconds left. It was a foul Indiana coach Archie Miller did not totally agree with.\n\n\"We had a shot to win the game, had a tap to win the game and had an unfortunate call that put them on the line,\" Miller said. \"It was a 50-50 play. I don't know if he fouled him or not, but I know it was a tough call.\"\n\nJones hauled in the key rebound, but Gafford did not let Jones take all the credit in the post-game interviews.\n\n\"I tipped that rebound out, by the way,\" Gafford laughed.\n\nJones made the first free throw to give Arkansas a 73-72 lead. Indiana called a time out after Jones' free throw, and Anderson instructed Jones to deliberately miss the second free throw.\n\n\"I have been harping on guys to make free throws, so asking him to miss one, I don't remember asking a player to miss a free throw in a while,\" Anderson said. \"It was a perfect miss.\"\n\nIndiana only had time for a desperation heave as the buzzer sounded.\n\nArkansas rode the second half play of Gafford, who also grabbed 11 rebounds. At one stretch in the second half, Gafford scored 10 straight Arkansas points to help the Razorbacks hold on against a furious Indiana rally.\n\n\"I wasn't playing weak like I usually do,\" Gafford, who passed up entering the NBA Draft to return to Arkansas for his sophomore season, said. \"Today I let the game come to me instead of trying to just go and take it. Letting the game come to you, it comes more smooth.\"\n\nAnderson said Gafford was a force at both ends, as his blocked shot just seconds after the opening tip set an early tone.\n\nMiller said his team would benefit from playing against Gafford later in the season.\n\n\"He's a very good player,\" Miller said. \"He was a really tough handle for us today. He pretty much neutralized the game. He was dominant. That is something that is going to help us moving forward and defending the caliber of big like that.\"\n\nArkansas led 38-35 at halftime on Gabe Osabuohien's 3-pointer from the right perimeter. Then Isaiah Joe, who finished with 13 points, opened the second half with a 3-pointer for a 41-35 lead. The Razorbacks would stretch the lead to 10 points twice \u2014 45-35 with 17:08 left on Gafford's dunk, and 51-41.\n\nIndiana rallied with an 11-2 run fueled by freshman Romeo Langford, who finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds, and eventually took a 58-57 lead on Juwan Morgan's layup with 8:58 left.\n\nArkansas recaptured a five-point lead at 63-58 on Gafford's inside shot, before Indiana surged again to twice tie the game late.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers played just eight players as they have battled some early season injuries. Six of the eight logged more than 20 minutes including Langford, who played 38 minutes.\n\nArkansas: The Razorbacks had all nine players reach the scoring column Sunday, getting contributions off the bench to help the scoring. Jones also delivered a huge performance with 11 points and seven assists without a turnover.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nArkansas appeared to be rolling to a big win when Jones completed a three-point play to give the Razorbacks a 10-point lead at 51-41 with 14:16 left. But the Hoosiers rallied by outscoring Arkansas 17-6 over the next five-plus minutes to take a 58-57 lead.\n\nJuwan Morgan and Langford fueled the run, scoring nine of the Hoosiers' 17 points with Morgan's inside bucket giving Indiana the lead.\n\nHIGHLIGHT REEL\n\nLangford is projected to be a high lottery pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, and he lived up to that lofty status Sunday. Langford a 6-foot-6 guard in just his fourth college basketball game, showed off a variety of skills with slashing drives and long range. His back-to-back 3-pointers in the second half helped Indiana erase a 10-point deficit.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nThis was just the third meeting between the two teams, and first since 2008 when Arkansas defeated Indiana in an NCAA Tournament game. . Arkansas is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its 1994 national championship under former coach Nolan Richardson. Anderson was a longtime assistant coach and former player for Richardson.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndiana will return home Tuesday to host Texas-Arlington in the second game of the four-game Hardwood Showcase.\n\nArkansas will host Montana State on Wednesday in Bud Walton Arena in its second game of the Hardwood Showcase.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 The play went for an 82-yard gain, not a great moment for the Detroit defense. The way it ended epitomized the Lions' gritty victory.\n\nDarius Slay hustled back and tackled DJ Moore on a long reception in the third quarter, preventing a Carolina touchdown. The Panthers eventually missed a field goal on that drive, and the Lions went on to win 20-19 on Sunday.\n\n\"That's a huge play, that's a great effort play,\" Detroit coach Matt Patricia said. \"Great hustle, great pursuit, that's a really fast guy that he's chasing. Fortunately, we've got a faster guy for that moment.\"\n\nAfter three straight losses, Detroit's playoff hopes seemed remote entering this game, but the Lions clearly haven't given up. Even after an injury to rookie running back Kerryon Johnson, Detroit was able to take the lead in the fourth quarter and then hold on. Kenny Golladay's acrobatic 19-yard touchdown catch put the Lions up 20-13 with 5:13 remaining, and after Carolina scored a TD of its own with 1:07 left, Cam Newton threw incomplete on a 2-point conversation attempt.\n\nThis was the first of three straight home games for the Lions. Detroit (4-6) will try to take another step back toward contention when it hosts Chicago on Thanksgiving.\n\nJohnson departed with an apparent left knee injury after rushing for 87 yards and a touchdown. That injury took away one of Detroit's most promising young players, but the Lions still had another one on the field in Golladay. The 6-foot-4 receiver had eight catches for 113 yards, and some of his receptions were on passes that seemed up for grabs.\n\nGolladay caught a 36-yard pass from Matthew Stafford on third-and-15 in the fourth quarter. Moments later, he leaped backward and came down with his touchdown catch, putting the Lions ahead.\n\n\"He comes to work, he runs his tail off, and he tries to make plays as much as he possibly can,\" Stafford said. \"He doesn't say much, and those guys with that quiet confidence, I feel good about.\"\n\nSlay is a little more chatty, and he backs up his confidence with his play. With the Lions up 10-7 in the third quarter, Moore caught a short pass near the left sideline, then broke back to the middle and raced toward the end zone . Slay finally ran him down at the Detroit 12.\n\n\"I thought for sure that was going to be a touchdown, because I didn't think anyone could run him down from behind,\" Carolina receiver Jarius Wright said. \"The Lions have some speed back there, though.\"\n\nThen the defense held, and Graham Gano missed a field goal.\n\n\"We don't want to quit, we want to keep going, we want to tackle him and just give us a chance to try to get out of a bad situation,\" Patricia said. \"It's unfortunate that that play happened, but certainly again proud of our guys with the mental toughness to settle down and then just play the next couple plays.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' quarterback merry-go-round may be in motion again.\n\nAfter starting Ryan Fitzpatrick for the first four games, switching to Jameis Winston for the next three and going back to Fitzpatrick for the last three, coach Dirk Koetter is at a crossroads again after the Bucs dropped a 38-35 decision to the New York Giants on Sunday.\n\nFitzpatrick started the game and was lifted in the third quarter after throwing three interceptions that helped the Giants take a 24-7 lead.\n\nWinston, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 draft, came in and led the Bucs on four touchdown drives, getting them within three points twice only to throw a late interception to B.W. Webb on a desperation pass in the final 30 seconds.\n\nKoetter refused to say who would start Sunday at home against the San Francisco 49ers. He had weighed going back to Winston this week.\n\n\"It was close,\" Koetter said. \"I told you all along, his day was going to come back. That's water under the bridge right now.\"\n\nAsked whether he was second-guessing himself, the coach didn't hesitate.\n\n\"No. You can second-guess every play out there,\" he said.\n\nWinston was outstanding. He completed 12 of 16 passes for 199 yards, and his only turnover was the last pass.\n\n\"It was pretty obvious he came in and lit it up,\" Koetter said, adding he probably would decide on a starter Monday.\n\nThe path to Winston seems clear at this point.\n\n\"I'm not worried about that,\" Winston said of the prospect of starting the final six games. \"I'm worried about finding a way to win. I don't have that much control over that but my play can speak. That's the only thing I can control. I'm going to try to do my best if I get the opportunity to execute.\"\n\nFitzpatrick was 13 of 21 for 167 yards when he was lifted. He scored a second-quarter touchdown on a fourth-down 1-yard run off what seemed to be a broken play, and he had an opening drive stopped at the Giants' 5 on a failed fourth-down quarterback sneak.\n\nThe turnovers did him in. He was intercepted by defensive back Michael Thomas at the Giants' 13 on the next to last play of the first half. He saw linebacker Alec Ogletree return an interception 15 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter and then had safety Curtis Riley intercept a rainbow toss into the end zone with 9:42 left in the quarter.\n\nHe pretty much knew he was done by that point.\n\n\"After the third one in the end zone there I thought that would probably be the decision,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I was proud of the way that Jameis went in there and played.

But mothers who clean pacifiers by sucking on them have infants with a lower allergic response, according to research from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.\n\nVideo: Lead researcher discusses findings\n\nThe study interviewed 128 mothers over an 18-month period and asked how they cleaned their babies' pacifiers. Of the 74 whose babies used one, 72 percent said they wash them by hand, 41 percent said they sterilized and 12 percent said spit-cleaned the baby soothers.\n\nThe scientists found that babies whose mothers spit-cleaned pacifiers had lower levels of IgE, an an antibody associated with allergic responses. Elevated IgE levels typically indicate a higher risk of having allergies and allergic asthma.\n\n\"We found that parental pacifier sucking was linked to suppressed IgE levels beginning around 10 months, and continued through 18 months,\" said Dr. Edward Zoratti, an allergist and study co-author. \"Further research is needed, but we believe the effect may be due to the transfer of health-promoting microbes from the parent\u2019s mouth.\"\n\nYou follow that? Spreading the germs from a parent's mouth was found to boost the child's immune system.\n\nThe research does not prove cause and effect, and it is unclear whether the lower IgE production seen among these children continues into later years.\n\nLike All the Moms?

Obviously last year was a little glitch in the system, but for the past what, 10, 11, 12 years, this team has taken pride on being a very physical team, and that's what gives us the best chance to win.\"\n\nGasol's shooting helped the Grizzlies overcome their own sluggish offensive start. He was 4 of 7 from 3-point range and Memphis hit 12 overall.\n\n\"It's a game-changer,\" Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of Gasol's outside shooting. \"Those shots break games open for you.\"\n\nGasol scored 18 points in the second half.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns had 15 points and 20 rebounds for the Timberwolves. They had won three straight games since trading Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia.\n\n\"There was a physicality to the game that we probably didn't respond to as well as we could have or should have,\" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said.\n\nThe Wolves entered the game with the second-fewest turnovers in the NBA at 12.5 per game, but the Grizzlies were active early and forced Minnesota into eight turnovers in the first quarter. The Wolves had averaged 113 points per game in winning the first three games of the homestand after trading Butler.\n\n\"They play slow,\" Minnesota forward Robert Covington said. \"They played a part in it. We can't allow them to dictate our pace. We got to get the ball out, in transition we need to use our athleticism. Tonight, we weren't able to do that.\"\n\nDario Saric, who came over from the 76ers along with Covington, hit three 3-pointers and scored 11 points in the fourth. Saric hit a 3 to draw the Wolves within eight points, but Gasol hit a pair of 3s on consecutive possessions after a timeout.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nGrizzlies: Memphis is 26-8 against Minnesota over the past decade. . The Grizzlies shot 33.3 percent in the first quarter and had six of their 12 turnovers. ... Memphis has won two in a row on the road for the first time since March 15-16, 2017.\n\nTimberwolves: Minnesota held Memphis to 17 points in the first quarter, a season low for a Wolves opponent in any quarter. ... Derrick Rose scored a team-high 18 points on 6-of-11 shooting off the bench for Minnesota. ... The Wolves are 7-2 at home. . Towns had his fifth double-double in the past seven games.\n\nGREEN RETURNS\n\nForward JaMychal Green returned to the Grizzlies' lineup after missing 12 games with a broken jaw. Bickerstaff said he wanted to use Green in short increments. Off the bench, Green had eight points and eight rebounds in 21 minutes.\n\n\"I felt a little rust, got to get my legs back underneath me,\" Green said. \"But other than that, it was just fun to be out there. We played great defense tonight, we got a lot of stops. We're moving the ball well offensively.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGrizzlies: Return home Monday night for the second game of the back-to-back against Dallas.\n\nTimberwolves: Finish their five-game homestand Wednesday night against Denver.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Watt (99) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018 in Landover, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 Alex Smith seemed to know immediately this was bad. Really, really bad. He covered his face with both hands, then a white towel, before his fractured right leg was placed in an air cast and he was carted off the field.\n\nOne of his predecessors as quarterback of the Washington Redskins, Joe Theismann, was at Sunday's game and sensed the same \u2014 all-too-familiar with what a season-ending broken leg looks and feels like.\n\nExactly 33 years to the day after Theismann's gruesome injury during a nationally televised game , Smith went down with breaks to his right fibula and tibia midway through the third quarter of Washington's 23-21 loss to the visiting Houston Texans on Sunday and was replaced at QB by backup Colt McCoy. Redskins coach Jay Gruden said Smith would have surgery \"right away.\"\n\n\"I saw a pile of people go down, and then I saw Alex's leg in the position it was in. And I turned away after that. It brought back vivid memories,\" said Theismann, hurt when hit by Lawrence Taylor during a Redskins' victory over the New York Giants on Nov. 18, 1985.\n\n\"This date has always been a day in my life that I'll never forget,\" Theismann said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"My immediate thought was that my heart went out to him. I feel so bad for him. I know the road ahead. We're somewhat similar in age (when the injuries happened). He's not 25 or 26 years of age. I was 35; he's 34. How long will it take to come back? What is the severity?\" Theismann added, saying he sent Smith a text message of support. \"I worry less about Alex and his football career than I do Alex and wanting to be able to do the things in life he wants to do.\"\n\nSmith was in his first season with the Redskins after arriving in a trade from the Kansas City Chiefs. He had thrown two first-half interceptions Sunday, one returned 101 yards for a TD by Texans safety Justin Reid, as Washington fell behind 17-7.\n\nMcCoy helped Washington score a pair of TDs, including on his 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jordan Reed on the backup QB's first pass in a regular-season game since 2015.\n\nNow Gruden will have a short week to help McCoy make his first NFL start since 2014: Washington (6-4) plays at Dallas (5-5) on Thanksgiving Day with first place in the NFC East on the line.\n\n\"I've still got to knock a little rust off,\" said McCoy, who went 6 for 12 for 54 yards passing and ran five times for 35 yards after replacing Smith.\n\nMcCoy tried to lead the Redskins to the go-ahead points, but their last drive stalled, and Dustin Hopkins tried a 63-yard field goal that fell well short.\n\nThe injury came when Smith was first hit by cornerback Kareem Jackson, then by defensive end J.J.

(Photo: Mark Ralston/AFP)\n\nSomewhere, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and John Wayne are wondering what the heck happened to the place they used to call home.\n\nWhen Gil Cisneros was declared the winner of the race for the House seat representing California\u2019s 39th Congressional District on Saturday night, the Democrats completed a historic sweep of all seven districts in Orange County, which, until recently, was regarded as a bastion of conservatism.\n\nThe area south of Los Angeles was long known as Reagan country, the place the conservative icon said was \u201cwhere all good Republicans go to die.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe largely suburban county, with a population of 3.2 million, was Nixon\u2019s birthplace, and it\u2019s the site of his presidential library.\n\nIts airport is named after Wayne, the legendary movie cowboy who was an avowed and prominent Republican.\n\nAnd now its will send seven Democrats to the U.S. House, flipping four seats and helping them take control of a legislative chamber that had been in Republican control since 2011.\n\nDemocrats needed a net gain of 23 seats to attain majority in the House and they have added 38, putting their lead at 232-200, with three races yet to be decided. In California, the Democratic advantage stands at an overwhelming 45-8.\n\nDemocrats had targeted seven Republican-held seats in California that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. They claimed six of those, capitalizing on President Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the state and attacking incumbents who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and/or supported the 2017 tax bill, which limited deductions in high-tax states like California.\n\nMore: Win while losing? Beto O'Rourke, Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum may still be rising voices\n\nMore: Florida recount: Sen. Bill Nelson concedes following manual recount; Rick Scott heads to Senate\n\nCisneros edged out Republican Young Kim after trailing by almost 3,900 votes on Election Night to join Harley Rouda, Katie Porter and Mike Levin as Democratic newcomers to the House from Orange County.\n\nRouda's victory was especially noteworthy: He defeated 15-term Republican incumbent Dana Rohrabacher.\n\n\u201cIn one of the most diverse districts in the country, I learned that, for all of our differences, we all care about the same things,\u2019\u2019 said Cisneros, a Navy veteran turned philanthropist who won a $266 million lottery jackpot in 2010 and has emphasized education in his campaign.\n\n\u201cMost of all, we want to live in a world brought together by hope, not divided by hate.\u2019\u2019\n\nHis remarks and the county\u2019s vote appeared to represent a repudiation of Trump and his harsh rhetoric, especially in matters related to immigration. Latinos make up 35 percent of the Orange County population and Asians 21 percent. Non-Hispanic whites account for 40 percent.\n\nThe county\u2019s increasingly diverse demographics and changing politics over the past two decades had allowed Democrats to make enough inroads that they entered the election with three incumbents \u2013 Linda Sanchez, Lou Correa and Alan Lowenthal, all runaway repeat winners \u2013 and to foster dreams of adding to their delegation.\n\nBut given the region\u2019s history, not even the most optimistic Democrats could have expected a sweep.

Every golfer in the world knows what the Masters is so I'm nothing special on that. But that tournament, that atmosphere, just everything ... it's tough at home to sit back and watch that on television.\"\n\nAfter Rodgers sent a birdie attempt of 21 feet past the cup on the second extra hole, Howell's putt died in the cup and capped a comeback in which he went bogey-double bogey on his first two holes to lose the lead he had held through the first three rounds.\n\n\"The way I started today, I just honestly thought I shot myself in the foot again,\" Howell said. \"I thought that was pretty much over. I had seen this movie before.\"\n\nHowell closed with a 3-under 67, birdieing Nos. 15-17, to match Rodgers at 19-under 263 in the final PGA Tour event of the year. After making the 36-hole cut on the 2-under number, Rodgers shot 61-62 on the weekend.\n\nHowell had a 22-foot birdie attempt on the final hole to win in regulation, but the ball turned away from the cup inches from the edge. Both players had birdie looks on the first playoff hole, with Rodgers missing from 27 feet and Howell from 14 feet off the front fringe.\n\nThe 39-year-old Howell also won in 2002 at Kingsmill.\n\nRodgers' 17-under 123 weekend was one shot off Troy Matteson's PGA Tour record for consecutive rounds of 122 set the 2009 Frys.com Championship. He finished second for the third time in four years.\n\n\"I fought as hard as I could,\" said Rodgers, who broke Tiger Woods' scoring record at Stanford and tied his victory record. \"I didn't really back down. I stayed aggressive and I made birdies all the way to the finish. It's a testament to how well Charles played.\"\n\nWebb Simpson (65) had a 12-foot birdie opportunity at the final hole to join the playoff, but missed. He lost the RSM Classic in sudden death to Ben Crane in 2011.\n\nLuke List (65) and Bryan Blaum (66) tied for fourth at 17 under and Tour rookie Cameron Champ, who took the lead after Howell's early stumbles and was in a four-way tie for first with Howell, Rodgers and Simpson with seven holes to play shot 69 and finished alone in sixth at 16 under.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Eight of them qualified this weekend, the penultimate round of games, led by former champions Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Algeria.\n\nNigeria is back at the tournament \u2014 for the first time since it won the title in 2013 \u2014 after a 1-1 draw with South Africa in Johannesburg on Saturday. A Nigerian state governor promised the team $25,000 for every goal in the crucial game but one was enough as Nigeria secured the point it needed to guarantee it one of the two qualifying places from the group.\n\nIvory Coast, the 2015 African champion, made sure of its place despite an underwhelming qualification campaign when it drew 1-1 in Guinea on Sunday. The result qualified both teams. Morocco's place was confirmed after Malawi surprisingly lost 2-1 in Comoros. That eliminated the Malawians and caused their federation head, Walter Nyamilandu, a newly elected member of the FIFA Council, to complain about the makeup of the Comoros squad. It's almost completely foreign-born players and Comoros' goals against Malawi were scored by French-born players El Fardou Ben Nabouhane and Nasser Chamed.\n\nNyamilandu claimed on Twitter that Comoros \"buy citizenship to make a national team\" and called it \"immoral.\" There was no sign of an official protest by Malawi, though.\n\nAlgeria is through after winning 4-1 in Togo, helped by two goals from Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez. Other teams to qualify this weekend were Mali and Uganda.\n\nLIBYA HOPES\n\nWar-torn Libya, which has twice in the last five years had to back out of hosting the African Cup because of its civil war, still has a chance to qualify. Libya crushed Seychelles 8-1 and faces South Africa in a decisive game in the final round of qualifying in March to see who joins Nigeria at the African Cup from that group. Although it's a \"home\" game for Libya, the North Africans haven't played on home soil for five years because of the conflict, instead holding their home games in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt.

He turned 65 on Nov. 10.\n\nMiles signed a five-year contract that will pay him $2,775,000 annually with retention bonuses of $775,000 due in November 2020 and $500,000 in November 2022.\n\n\"Since the beginning of our search, we focused on identifying and recruiting an experienced head coach with a track record of success on and off the field,\" Kansas athletic director Jeff Long said in a statement. \"Les Miles is exactly what we need right now.\"\n\nAs the Kansas job closed on Sunday, the Colorado job came open. Athletic director Rick George announced that Mike MacIntyre, AP national coach of the year just two seasons ago when he led Colorado to 10 wins and a spot in the Pac-12 title game, was being let go. The Buffaloes started the season 5-0 and have lost six in a row.\n\n\"There's no doubt that the 2016 season was magical, and it appeared we were headed back to taking our place among the nation's elite,\" said George in a statement. \"However, analyzing the direction of the program over the last two years, I felt this is the necessary time to make a change.\"\n\nMiles is 142-55 in 15-plus seasons as a head coach at Oklahoma State and LSU. He won a Bowl Championship Series national championship in 2007 at LSU and played for another BCS title after the 2011 season. But a 21-0 loss to Alabama in that game was the beginning of a slow decline for LSU \u2013 at least by comparison to Alabama.\n\nWhen Miles was fired early in the 2016 season after a loss at Auburn, the knock was that he had been unwilling to evolve offensively, sticking to a conventional power-based offense while most of college football \u2013 including rival Alabama \u2013 moved toward the fast-paced spread. While out of coaching, Miles has indicated he was ready to adjust to the changed offensive game.\n\nMiles is taking on a difficult challenge. He will replace David Beaty, who is 6-41 in four seasons. The school announced earlier this month he would finish the season, but would not return as coach. After a 55-40 loss Saturday at No. 6 Oklahoma, the Jayhawks dropped to 3-8. The program has not had a winning season since 2008.\n\nLast spring, Miles described his philosophy of winning in a difficult situation:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look around, right or left,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look ahead. Go fight.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, LSU announced it had reached a settlement with Miles on his coaching buyout for a $1.5 million payment, which appeared to open up the possibility for the former coach to move into a new job.\n\nMiles was 28-21 in four seasons at Oklahoma State from 2001-04, including 2-2 against rival Oklahoma. He is credited with helping to lay the foundation for Mike Gundy\u2019s success at the school.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "McCowan scores 23 as No. 6 Mississippi St routs Coppin St", "description": "Teaira McCowan scored 23 points to lead seven Mississippi State players in double figures as the sixth-ranked Bulldogs routed Coppin State 110-38", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2018/11/18/mccowan-scores-23-as-no-6-mississippi-st-routs-coppin-st/38559475/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:11:47Z", "content": "STARKVILLE, Miss.

Coach Vic Schaefer rounded up his team shortly after the second Final Four banner was raised to the rafters and spoke to them about what it represented and the new standard in place in Starkville.

They\u2019re probably comfortable sticking with Colt McCoy but would be doing their fans and other players a disservice if they didn\u2019t at least explore the idea of signing a more dynamic option.\n\nNathan Peterman recently hit the market.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nAnd if only Joe Flacco was healthy the Ravens might release RG III to return to \u2026 nah, can\u2019t even complete that sentence.\n\nHere are some serious names:\n\nQuick thoughts on available quarterbacks: Sam Bradford\n\nPaxton Lynch (Redskins worked him out this year)\n\nRyan Mallet\n\nMatt Moore And, yes, Colin Kaepernick \u2014 Ben Standig (@BenStandig) November 18, 2018\n\nThe Kaepernick line actually makes more sense than you might think \u2026\n\nCurrent #Redskins Quarterback coach Kevin O'Connell was\n\nColin Kaepernick's Offensive Coaching Assistant in San Francisco in 2016, for what it's worth. Kaepernick and Colt McCoy have also worked together. There really is no QB who makes more sense for the #Redskins to sign. \u2014 Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoRCC) November 18, 2018\n\nBut of course you have to ignore a lot of what we know about Redskins owner Daniel Snyder to make this leap. First off, he\u2019s steadfastly resisted discussions about changing the name of his team \u2014 even though it\u2019s been pointed out that a \u201credskin\u201d refers to the bloody scalp of a Native American \u2014 so he\u2019s probably not exactly aligned with Kaepernick\u2019s worldview on racism. Second, he was identified by ESPN as one of the owners who advocated for a policy that would force players to stand.\n\nSo Snyder is almost certainly not going to let his player personnel people even begin to contemplate signing the player who initiated the kneeling protest in the first place; that ESPN article had him mentioning (seemingly non-existent) polls showing a vast majority of Americans think players need to stand (which isn\u2019t true) and telling other owners his sponsors, many related to the D.C.-centric defense industry, weren\u2019t happy about the protests. So Kaepernick in a Washington uniform is beyond far-fetched, even if it gives Snyder a better chance at some rare post-season success.\n\nArguing about how effective Colin Kaepernick would or would not be seems inconsequential to this discussion, but my colleague Steven Ruiz wrote one of the definitive pieces on this subject so you can read it here. His main takeaway:\n\nLook, Kaepernick is not a good quarterback. He\u2019s not as bad as his detractors will have you believe, either. He\u2019s a slightly below average starter. Slightly below average quarterbacks have no trouble finding jobs in the NFL. Josh McCown is a bad quarterback who has no problem finding a job every season. Kaepernick\u2019s inability to find a job has nothing to do with his talent or playing style, so let\u2019s stop pretending it does. Maybe then I can finally stop writing about Kaepernick.\n\nBeing a below-average starter would, of course, put Kaepernick solidly above everyone on the above list except, maybe, Sam Bradford. Both of those players are fairly effective when surrounded by other good players while directed by good coaches.\n\nIf the Redskins even pretend to do their \u201cdue diligence\u201d on replacing Smith, it means bringing these guys in for a workout to assess where they stand. Bradford has a long injury history. Kaepernick, of course, hasn\u2019t been in an NFL practice since the 2016 season (though it\u2019s probably worth noting that until today McCoy hadn\u2019t thrown a pass in a regular-season game since the final one of the 2015 season, when he completed 7 of his 11 attempts \u2014 his only throws that year.)\n\nThe point is, Washington leads a lousy division and has a fairly clear shot at the playoffs. From there, who knows what might happen? In 2012, an untested Kaepernick stepped in for an injured Smith and then retained the job as he lead the San Francisco 49ers into the playoffs \u2026 and all the way to the Super Bowl, where he led an epic near-comeback.\n\nBut a few years later he started kneeling during the playing of the national anthem as a way of getting people to talk about issues like systemic racism and inequality and now nothing else seems to matter.\n\nThe NFL isn\u2019t a meritocracy, and winning isn\u2019t all that matters or even the most important thing and the Redskins will likely never even bother to call the player who literally replaced the QB they just lost and took his team within a few points of a championship just a few years ago."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andrew Joseph", "title": "Did an uncalled pass interference rob the Redskins of a win against the Texans?", "description": "Looks that way.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/redskins-refs-pass-interference-video-doctson-texans-field-goal-nfl-officiating-reaction", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/usp-nfl_-houston-texans-at-washington-redskins.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:05:56Z", "content": "The Redskins have a lot to be discouraged about following their 23-21 loss to the Texans on Sunday.

Before diving into the end zone for the game-winning score, Roethlisberger found receiver Antonio Brown streaking down the field on a 78-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter and connected with tight end Vance McDonald on an 11-yard touchdown pass with 2:28 left to play in the game.\n\nThe Steelers improved to 7-2-1 and have won six in a row, while the Jaguars dropped to 3-7 after losing their sixth straight.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "AP Top Stories November 18 P", "description": "Here are the top stories for Sunday, November 18th: Trump comments on Saudi role in Khashoggi death; Result reached in Florida Senate recount; A WWII fighter plane crashes; A snow day for a panda in Washington.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/18/ap-top-stories-november-18-p/38559275/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5968715837001_5968712762001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:03:49Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Steelers rally to stun Jaguars in final seconds, 20-16", "description": "Steelers rally to stun Jaguars in final seconds on Roethlisberger TD, 20-16", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/18/steelers-rally-to-stun-jaguars-in-final-seconds-20-16/38559395/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5c3f1d88641f63c4752ac456d8ccd29671a65a73/c=0-248-2655-1741/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/f53cbeaf5adf42cead9a93234bf30715.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:03:34Z", "content": "Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Vance McDonald, right, catches an 11-yard pass for a touchdown over Jacksonville Jaguars outside linebacker Telvin Smith, center, and free safety Tashaun Gipson (39) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 18\u2026 [+10206 chars]", "fulltext": "Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Vance McDonald, right, catches an 11-yard pass for a touchdown over Jacksonville Jaguars outside linebacker Telvin Smith, center, and free safety Tashaun Gipson (39) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Jacksonville, Fla. (AP Photo/Gary McCullough) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Ben Roethlisberger was far from perfect until the fourth quarter, and that was all that mattered for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOne week after Roethlisberger had a perfect quarterback rating, he overcame three interceptions and a 16-0 deficit by leading two late scoring drives. He lunged in from the 1 for the winning score with 5 seconds left for a 20-16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.\n\nThe Steelers (7-2-1) won their sixth straight and likely ended any playoff hopes for the Jaguars, who eliminated Pittsburgh in the divisional round last year. The Jaguars (3-7) dropped their sixth in a row in a game they controlled until the final five minutes.\n\nLeonard Fournette ran for 95 yards and caught two passes for 46 yards that led to the Jaguars' only touchdown when he launched himself from the 4 and scored for a 16-0 lead with 2:09 left in the third quarter.\n\nRoethlisberger, who now has 10 turnovers in his last three games against Jacksonville, took over from there.\n\nHe got safety Tashaun Gipson Sr. to bite on a pump fake and found Antonio Brown open deep in the middle of the field for a 78-yard touchdown.\n\nStill trailing by 10 points with just under six minutes remaining, Roethlisberger found tight end Vance McDonald in the back of the end zone to cut the lead to 16-13 with 2:28 remaining.\n\nThe Jaguars went three-and-out, and Roethlisberger led a 68-yard drive. He hit JuJu Smith-Schuster on the left sideline for a 35-yard gain to the 27 that at least got the Steelers in field goal position.\n\nJames Conner dropped a sure touchdown when he got behind linebacker Telvin Smith Sr., but Roethlisberger hit Brown over the middle to the 2.\n\nTEXANS 23, REDSKINS 21\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 Justin Reid returned an interception 101 yards to help the Texans overcome a mistake-prone Deshaun Watson for their seventh consecutive victory.\n\nWashington's loss came at a significant price when quarterback Alex Smith suffered a gruesome ankle injury on a sack in the third quarter. Smith's right ankle turned the wrong way as he was sacked by Kareem Jackson and J.J. Watt on a play eerily similar to Joe Theismann's broken leg that came exactly 33 years ago to the day.\n\nColt McCoy replaced Smith and threw for a touchdown pass and led a long scoring drive for Washington (6-4), which likely will have to rely on the journeyman quarterback the rest of the way.\n\nAdrian Peterson's touchdown that put the Redskins up 21-20 early in the fourth quarter was the first lead change in a game involving the Redskins all season.\n\nWatson threw for a touchdown and had two interceptions, completing 16 of 24 passes and taking three sacks. Houston (7-3) turned over the ball three times, but kept its winning streak going after Redskins kicker Dustin Hopkins missed a 63-yard field-goal attempt with 3 seconds left.\n\nPeterson ran for two touchdowns to continue climbing the NFL rushing chart, but was bottled up on a lot of his other carries. Peterson's 3- and 7-yard TD runs gave him 105 in his career and moved him past former Redskins star John Riggins into sole possession of sixth, one behind Jim Brown for fifth.\n\nPeterson finished with 51 yards on 16 carries.\n\nCOWBOYS 22, FALCONS 19\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Brett Maher shook off a missed extra point and kicked a 42-yard field goal on the final play.\n\nMatt Ryan threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones for Atlanta's only touchdown with 1:52 remaining to tie the game. But Dallas drove 51 yards in 10 plays, setting up Maher's winning kick as time expired .\n\nThe Cowboys (5-5), who gained a game on Washington in the NFC East, gave their playoff hopes a boost. Atlanta (4-6) lost its second straight game and now faces long odds to reach the postseason \u2014 especially playing in the NFC South, where the Falcons trail New Orleans and Carolina.\n\nAfter a field goal battle between Maher and Atlanta's Matt Bryant left the Falcons with a 9-6 lead heading to the final period, Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott scored on a pair of runs to push the Cowboys to a 19-9 lead.\n\nGrinding for every yard, Dallas needed 14 plays to cover 75 yards for the game's first TD, Prescott's 4-yard run after faking a handoff to Elliott. Prescott had a couple of 17-yard passes \u2014 one to Amari Cooper, another to Cole Beasley \u2014 but no other play on the possession went for more than 5 yards.\n\nMaher hooked the extra point, however, leaving the Cowboys with a 12-9 lead.\n\nThey quickly extended the margin. On Atlanta's next possession, Ryan threw a short pass to Calvin Ridley cutting over the middle. The ball was thrown a bit too hard, the rookie couldn't hang on and it ricocheted into the arms of Dallas linebacker Leighton Vander Esch . He returned the interception 28 yards to the Atlanta 31.\n\nTwo plays later, Elliott darted through a big hole up the middle, shook off an attempted tackle from Damontae Kazee at the 15 and powered in for a 23-yard touchdown. Maher connected on this extra point, giving the Cowboys a 10-point lead with 12:26 remaining.\n\nBEARS 25, VIKINGS 20\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Khalil Mack had a sack and fumble recovery, Eddie Jackson returned an interception for a touchdown and Chicago beat Minnesota to tighten its grip on the NFC North.\n\nMack and Jackson led a dominant effort by the defense. And Chicago (7-3) took a big step toward its first division championship since 2010. The Bears have won a season-high four in a row. And the past two have come against the NFC North after they dropped 10 straight to division opponents.\n\nChicago simply suffocated the Vikings (5-4-1), dominating in total yards (308-268) and time of possession (34:29-25:31) even though quarterback Mitchell Trubisky had his difficulties.\n\nTrubisky was 20 of 31 for 165 yards and a touchdown, but had two passes intercepted by Anthony Harris.\n\nBRONCOS 23, CHARGERS 22\n\nCARSON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Brandon McManus kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired and snapped the Chargers' six-game winning streak.\n\nDenver got the ball at its 8 with 1:51 remaining, and Case Keenum orchestrated a seven-play, 76-yard drive. Keenum, who was 19 of 32 for 205 yards, completed five passes for 86 yards during the drive, including a 30-yarder to Courtland Sutton to the Denver 16. Keenum then spiked the ball and McManus kicked the field goal as time expired.\n\nPhillip Lindsay had 11 carries for 79 yards and Sutton had three receptions for 78 yards. Denver (4-6) had lost six of seven coming into the game.\n\nPhilip Rivers threw for 401 yards and two touchdowns. The 15-year veteran, who completed 28 of 43 passes, also became the sixth quarterback in league history to throw at least two touchdown passes in each of his team's first 10 games to start a season.\n\nIt was not one of the cleanest games for Rivers or the Chargers (7-3), though. Rivers threw two interceptions and Los Angeles committed 14 penalties, including 10 in the first half. Mike Badgley, who made three field goals, also missed an extra point that ended up looming large.\n\nSAINTS 48, EAGLES 7\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Drew Brees passed for 363 yards and four touchdowns, and the Saints won their ninth straight with a demolition of Philadelphia that was the Eagles' worst loss by far since they won last season's Super Bowl.\n\nBrees completed 22 of 30 passes and did not turn over the ball, giving him 25 TD passes and only one interception this season. Brees' fourth touchdown seemed to encapsulate New Orleans' audacious approach to the game. He hit running back Alvin Kamara in stride down the right sideline for a 37 yards on a fourth-and-7 play that gave the Saints (9-1) a 45-7 lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\nBrees' other touchdown passes went for 3 yards to Austin Carr, 15 yards to rookie Tre'Quan Smith, and 23 yards to Michael Thomas. Smith finished with 10 catches for 157 yards, while Thomas' four catches for 92 yards made him the first receiver in Saints history to surpass 1,000 yards receiving in each of his first three seasons.\n\nMark Ingram rushed 16 times for 103 yards, including touchdowns of 14 yards and 1 yard. Kamara added 71 yards to help New Orleans finish with 546 total yards and score at least 40 for the sixth time this season.\n\nCarson Wentz was intercepted three times. Time will tell if the lopsided loss marked the beginning of the end of the Eagles' title defense. Philadelphia (4-6) remained two games behind Washington (6-4) for first place in the NFC East, but more injuries befell its already-depleted lineup.\n\nCOLTS 38, TITANS 10\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck threw three touchdown passes and Marlon Mack and Jordan Wilkins both ran for scores. Indy (5-5) has won four straight for the first time since November 2014. Luck remained unbeaten in 10 starts against the Titans.\n\nTennessee (5-5) lost quarterback Marcus Mariota in the final minute of the first half after he reinjured his right elbow. Titans defensive coordinator Dean Pees also was taken to a nearby hospital for observation after medical workers were called to the coaches' box during the first quarter.\n\nThe 69-year-old Pees retired briefly after last season.\n\nLuck's mastery over Tennessee did not change. He shredded the league's best scoring defense by going 23 of 29 with 297 yards with two TD passes to T.Y. Hilton. Luck has thrown at least one TD pass in a league-high 33 consecutive games and three or more in seven straight.\n\nAdam Vinatieri added another milestone to his growing list by celebrating his 210th career win over a 23-season career with New England and Indy. That's one more than George Blanda won during a 26-year career that spanned four decades. Earlier this season, Vinatieri, the league's oldest active player at age 45, also broke Morten Andersen's career records for field goals and scoring earlier this season.\n\nRAVENS 24, BENGALS 21\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson juked and sprinted for 117 yards in his first NFL start, Gus Edwards ran for 115 and the Ravens ended a three-game losing streak.\n\nFlashing the moves that enabled him to win the 2016 Heisman Trophy at Louisville, Jackson zipped in and out of the pocket for 27 carries. Though the Ravens (5-5) relied heavily on the run, Jackson also completed 13 of 19 passes for 150 yards with an interception.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco did not practice all week and was inactive with a right hip injury. That created an opening for Jackson, the 32nd overall pick in the NFL draft.\n\nBefore Sunday, the former Louisville star occasionally took snaps in running situations and replaced Flacco in the fourth quarter of two blowouts. Having to carry the load by himself, Jackson responded with a solid performance in a game the Ravens had to win.\n\nDown 21-13 in the second half, Baltimore rallied to hand the sinking Bengals (5-5) their fourth loss in five games.\n\nEdwards, an undrafted rookie free agent, scored on an 11-yard run and barreled in for the conversion late in the third quarter. Jackson then directed a 55-yard drive that ended with a field goal by Justin Tucker with 8:12 remaining.\n\nCincinnati's Randy Bullock missed a potential tying 52-yard field goal with 3:59 left, and Andy Dalton's fourth-down pass from the Baltimore 37 with 1:42 to go was knocked away by Marlon Humphrey.\n\nLIONS 20, PANTHERS 19\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Cam Newton threw an incomplete pass on a 2-point conversion with 1:07 left, letting the Lions hold on. Newton had time and receiver Jarius Wright open in the end zone, but the star quarterback sailed the pass high. Carolina coach Ron Rivera went for the win after Newton threw his third touchdown pass to DJ Moore, perhaps because usually reliable kicker Graham Gano missed an extra point and a field goal earlier in the game.\n\nThe Lions (4-6) recovered an onside kick to seal the victory and end a season-high three-game losing streak. They were in a position to win after Matthew Stafford threw a go-ahead, 19-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Golladay with 5:19 left.\n\nThe Panthers (6-4) have lost two straight for the first time this season.\n\nNewton was 25 of 37 for 357 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. Moore had seven receptions for 157 yards and a score.\n\nStafford was 23 of 37 for 220 yards with a touchdown. Golladay had eight catches for 113 yards and a touchdown.\n\nGIANTS 38, BUCCANEERS 35\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Saquon Barkley ran for a career-high 142 yards and scored three touchdowns as the Giants got consecutive games for the first time since December 2016.\n\nEli Manning also threw two touchdowns and linebacker Alec Ogletree returned one of the Giants' four interceptions 15 yards for another score in New York's biggest point output of the season.\n\nThe Giants (3-7) never trailed as Manning found a wide-open Barkley on a 6-yard TD pass on the opening series, and the No. 2 overall pick in the draft scored from 5 yards on the second possession to give New York the lead for good.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. had four catches for 74 yards, including an 8-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter.\n\nTampa Bay (3-7) made things interesting after Jameis Winston replaced a turnover-plagued Ryan Fitzpatrick in the third quarter and led four touchdown drives. The last score came on a 41-yard pass to Mike Evans with 2:22 to play and got the Bucs within 38-35.\n\nThe Bucs got the ball back at their 20 with 23 seconds to play, but B.W. Webb intercepted Winston's long throw down the sideline to ice the win and send Tampa Bay (3-7) to its fourth straight loss.\n\nRAIDERS 23, CARDINALS 21\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Daniel Carlson kicked a 35-yard field goal as the game ended in a matchup of teams scraping the bottom of the NFL standings.\n\nThe Raiders (2-8), who had lost five straight, matched the record of the Cardinals.\n\nDerek Carr threw for two touchdowns and had completions of 32 and 20 yards on the final drive that led to Carlson's winning kick. Carlson also had field goals of 49 and 21 yards in the second half.\n\nArizona rookie Josh Rosen threw for three touchdowns, two to Larry Fitzgerald, but was intercepted twice. Both picks led to first-half touchdowns for Oakland. David Johnson rushed for a season-best 137 yards, including a 53-yarder that set up Rosen's 5-yard TD pass to Fitzgerald that gave the Cardinals a 21-20 lead with 5:02 to play.\n\nLater, Johnson had a 57-yard touchdown run called back by a holding penalty and also had a key drop. That possession also featured an unnecessary roughness penalty on tight end Jermaine Gresham that helped force the punt to Oakland.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gary McCullough) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Ben Roethlisberger threw two interceptions on his first 12 passes. The Pittsburgh Steelers failed to score in the first half for the first time in more than two years, and they still trailed by 10 approaching the 2-minute warning.\n\nSo when Big Ben muscled his way over the goal line with 5 seconds left for a 20-16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, he wasn't sure where to rank this comeback.\n\n\"Horrible games that you find a way to win? Pretty special,\" he said.\n\nOne week after Roethlisberger had a perfect quarterback rating, he overcame three interceptions and a 16-0 deficit by leading touchdown drives on the Steelers' last two possessions, and Pittsburgh escaped with its sixth straight victory.\n\n\"Really, really awesome fight,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. \"The bottom line in our business is winning, and we took care of business. Style points were quite ugly, or few, but we got the job done.\"\n\nRoethlisberger hit Antonio Brown on a 78-yard touchdown to get on the board, found JuJu Smith-Schuster on a pair of shoulder fades down the sidelines and took care of the final score on his own. The Steelers had one timeout from the 1 when Roethlisberger rolled to his right and barely got the ball across.\n\n\"I don't know what option I am, but it's way down the list,\" he said. \"You just find a way.\"\n\nThe Steelers (7-2-1) likely ended any playoff hopes for Jacksonville (3-7), which beat them twice last year, including the divisional playoffs. The Jaguars, who controlled the game until the last five minutes, now have dropped six in a row.\n\nAs much as Roethlisberger led the Steelers, the defense gave him a chance.\n\nJacksonville ran only 11 plays in the fourth quarter for minus-7 yards, including three of their six sacks of Blake Bortles\n\n\"We have to be able to get first downs and close the game out,\" Jaguars coach Doug Marrone said. \"If you just had one first down on any of those drives, you had a chance to win that football game, and we weren't able to do that.\"\n\nLeonard Fournette ran for 95 yards on 28 carries, and he caught two passes for 46 yards that led to the Jaguars' only touchdown when he launched himself from the 4 and scored for a 16-0 lead with 2:09 left in the third quarter.\n\nRoethlisberger, who now has 10 turnovers in his last three games against Jacksonville, took over from there.\n\nAfter the long TD to Brown, Roethlisberger found tight end Vance McDonald in the back of the end zone to cut the lead to 16-13 with 2:28 remaining.\n\nPittsburgh kicked off and the Jaguars went three-and-out, and then Roethlisberger led a 68-yard drive. He hit Smith-Schuster on the left sideline for a 35-yard gain to the 27 that at least got the Steelers in field goal position.\n\nJames Conner, throttled in the running game, dropped a sure touchdown when he got behind linebacker Telvin Smith Sr., turning his eyes to goal line as the ball bounced off his hands. No matter. Roethlisberger hit Brown over the middle to the 2, and after a pair of penalties, he delivered the winner.\n\nRoethlisberger was 27 of 47 for 314 yards, 170 of them in the fourth quarter.\n\nEven with the early turnovers, Jacksonville only managed three field goals from Josh Lambo in the first half. Bortles was largely ineffective, throwing for just 104 yards. His biggest gains were to Fournette out of the backfield.\n\nSTEELER SACKS\n\nPittsburgh came into the game tied for the league lead with 31 sacks and got to Bortles six times. Javon Hargrave and T.J. Watt each had two. Watt now has 17 career sacks, the most by a Steelers player in his first two seasons since Keith Willis, who had 15 in 1982 and 1983.\n\nTwo sacks, by Vince Williams and Cameron Heyward, came early in the fourth quarter after the Jags took over on the Pittsburgh 41.\n\n\"We were in this position last year and we gave up big plays at the end of the game,\" Hargrave said, referring to the 45-42 playoff loss to Jacksonville. \"So we knew we had to make stops. We did that gave our offense a chance to come back, and they did.\"\n\nRAMSEY SHINES\n\nOne week after Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey tweeted after a loss to the Colts that \"when I'm gone from here, y'all gone miss me,\" he had his best game of the year. Ramsey had two interceptions, none bigger than in the end zone over Brown.\n\nWith the Steelers trailing 9-0 in the third quarter, Roethlisberger threw to Brown over the middle. Ramsay reached over Brown's helmet and juggled the ball before pulling it in. He tried to run out of the end zone, stumbled and kept going until he was ruled down by contact.\n\nRamsey also broke across the middle on Brown and made a diving pick, somehow keeping the ball off the turf on a play initially ruled incomplete but overturned on review.\n\nRUNNING GAME\n\nJames Conner came into the game with 771 yards rushing, tops in the AFC. He didn't have much room against Jacksonville, gaining 25 yards on nine attempts.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nJacksonville lost right guard A.J. Cann to a hamstring injury and he did not return. Tomlin said linebacker Anthony Chickillo hurt his ankle late in the game on a special teams play.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSteelers: On the road against the Denver Broncos next Sunday.\n\nJaguars: At the Buffalo Bills next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2013 Lamar Jackson delivered a victory in his starting debut as the Ravens starting quarterback. Thanks in part to his run-heavy performance, the Ravens improved to 5-5 on the season with a 24-21 win over the visiting Bengals.\n\nHere are three things we learned from Lamar Jackson\u2019s starting debut:\n\n1. Jackson is a great athlete but a subpar passer \u2026 for now\n\nJackson brought a level of excitement as he took the field for the first time Sunday afternoon. His world-class athleticism gives Ravens fans hope of a spark that their team has lacked for some time. Sure enough, Jackson displayed impressive speed, dizzying elusiveness and a strong competitive fire. He gave the Bengals fits as he rushed for 117 yards on 27 carries, and the threat of his rushing ability helped create for his teammates, including undrafted running back Gus Edwards, who rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown on 17 attempts.\n\nBut although Jackson boasts an electrifying factor we haven\u2019t seen from a quarterback since Robert Griffin III\u2019s rookie year in Washington in 2012, the Ravens rookie remains limited as a passer. Jackson finished with just 150 passing yards and an interception on 13 of 19 attempts.\n\nBaltimore did a good job of trying to keep things simple for Jackson. But against a team with a more prolific offense, Jackson will have to assume a larger workload as a passer if he\u2019s to thrive as a starter.\n\nJackson did show some impressive flashes. There were times where he scrambled away from defenders and fired strikes downfield as coverage broke down. And at times, he had some nice zip on the quick-hitters dialed up for him. But you could see his hesitation on times that his primary read was covered.\n\n2. Flacco should get his job back when healthy\n\nBecause Jackson has his limitations as a passer, the Ravens should go back to Joe Flacco once he\u2019s healthy again, if they want to contend for a wildcard berth.\n\nThis offense isn\u2019t sustainable. It might be OK next week against the Raiders. But the challenge will intensify the next two weeks against Matt Ryan and the Falcons and against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. Jackson isn\u2019t ready to get into a shootout with either of those quarterbacks.\n\nAs Jackson continues to play, he should gain comfort with the concepts of an NFL passing attack and the defensive schemes he will face. And offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg can do a better job of using the play-action to create more downfield opportunities for Baltimore\u2019s offense. But at 5-5, the Ravens still have hope for the playoffs, so it\u2019s not time to turn to Jackson just because he represents the future. Perhaps Flacco has shown signs of decline, but he still gives this offense more of a chance to operate like a pro attack, and for that, he should remain the starter.\n\n3. Cincinnati has real problems\n\nEarly in the year, the Bengals looked like a team that could be a contender. Their offense was putting up points behind effective outings from Andy Dalton, and their defense was getting after opposing quarterbacks. But things have really changed since then.\n\nDalton and Co. struggled to move the ball Sunday, and the defense offered little resistance against the run. Their saving grace was the fact that the Ravens didn\u2019t trust Jackson to air it out. The firing of defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, and the corresponding larger role taken on by head coach Marvin Lewis, did nothing to improve this unit. Yes, Cincinnati is missing two of the top three inside linebackers on the roster, but this unit still has to play better. Jackson is fast, but the Bengals looked ill-prepared for the zone-read concepts that Jackson and the Ravens ran with great frequency.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Johnson, Knaus reach checkered flag of championship pairing", "description": "Seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson and crew chief Chad Knaus are parting ways after 17 years together", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/11/18/johnson-knaus-reach-checkered-flag-of-championship-pairing/38559133/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a45dc532d7a04b1ac35dd04c8df15d617e5a22f0/c=0-328-4404-2805/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/3bd7b8261a3b456884ed0fde256d78ff.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:38:48Z", "content": "Jimmie Johnson stands near his car before the NASCAR Cup Series Championship auto race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Homestead, Fla.

The Johnsons and Knauses posed for family snapshots, and security held off scores of well-wishers wanting to sneak a closer look.\n\nThe NASCAR season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway has featured goodbyes in recent years, with stars like Gordon, Tony Stewart and Dale Earnhardt Jr. leaving the series. This moment had the feel of a retirement party for Johnson \u2014 but it was just the swan song for one of the most dominant driver-crew chief pairings in NASCAR history.\n\nJohnson and Knaus have parted ways after 17 years, seven NASCAR championships, and an unmatched mark of success in the sport over the last 20 years.\n\nThey couldn't grasp greatness one more time, finishing 14th in the finale and going winless in a season for the first time in Johnson's Cup career. They hugged on pit road and toasted to their tenures with beers before they officially put their partnership on ice.\n\n\"He is my brother, there is just no way around it,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson turned the farewell weekend into a throwback party that celebrated his earlier years. The 43-year-old Johnson stunned the sport when he showed up at the track without his salt-and-pepper facial hair for the first time in nearly a dozen years. Johnson tweeted a photo of a razor with the caption, \"I'm all in for the throwback weekend!\" Johnson, a fitness freak, looked about as baby-faced as he did as a rookie in 2002. NASCAR poked fun at Johnson's retro look with a tweet that said, \"2002 called, it wants its look back.\" Johnson's former look still was stamped on his official emoji on his Twitter feed.\n\nHe was clean shaven \u2014 and ready for a clean break from Knaus.\n\nThe two are still close friends but there were no signs of tears or tissues as they talked shop for the last time as a team. Johnson slid into the Chevy \u2014 sporting a vintage Lowe's paint scheme \u2014 and adjusted his helmet. Knaus took a knee by the car window on the grid and flipped through pages of the playbook that hid the secrets of their race strategy. Knaus smacked the top of Johnson's helmet as he walked off to the pit stall.\n\nBut the sights and sounds of a reason for their breakup enveloped the track: UFC ring announcer Bruce Buffer bellowed the race introductions for the four championship drivers. Defending series champion Martin Truex Jr. waved to the crowd on a parade lap as Knaus dabbed drool from son Kip's chin.\n\nOnce the most feared team in NASCAR, the 48 made a sudden dip into oblivion. Johnson's 17th season has been his worst and he was knocked out of the playoffs in the first round, ending his run at a NASCAR-record eighth Cup championship. He hasn't won since Dover 2017, an unthinkable string of 59 straight losses.\n\nSponsor Lowe's also is leaving NASCAR. Johnson will be funded by Ally Financial Inc. for all 38 races in the next two NASCAR seasons, the remaining years on Johnson's contract. Ally ensures that Johnson will have just one look in what is probably his final two years chasing sole ownership of the championship record.\n\n\"We can't wait to see you rocking a No. 48 Ally car on the tracks in 2019,\" the financial company tweeted.\n\nJohnson wore an old-school Lowe's hat from 2002.\n\n\"We can't say enough good things about our #lowes48 guys and everyone at HMS. It's been an incredible ride,\" Lowe's Racing tweeted.\n\nJohnson, Knaus and 17 crew members lined the 48 for a final team photo before the farewell race.\n\n\"A bitter sweet day to say the least,\" Johnson tweeted. \"@loweshomeimprovement took a chance on me and the 48 team back in 2002... thank you for making this kids racing dreams come true.\"\n\nJohnson will try and rebound in Daytona with new crew chief Kevin Meendering. Knaus, a Hendrick lifer, will call the shots for William Byron and the No. 24 team next season.\n\n\"I've got a lot of work to do with my new team, we've got a lot of work to do with this new package and we've got to come out stronger,\" Johnson said.\n\nBut as much as the pomp marked the end of an era, Johnson isn't going anywhere. Johnson, married and with two young daughters, is still driven to top Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt and stand alone as NASCAR's greatest champion.\n\nHe may get No. 8 \u2014 just without Knaus.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Ohio State recognized that and they kept going to that well and it didn't run dry.\"\n\nAndre Wesson, a junior, had 11 points, two shy of his OSU best.\n\nFreshmen Duane Washington Jr. scored 14 points, Jaedon Ledee added 12 and Luther Muhammad had 11 for the Buckeyes.\n\n\"Kaleb's aggressiveness offensively set the tone,\" Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann said.\n\nDamani Applewhite scored 15 points and Aramani Hill had 11 for the Bulldogs (1-4).\n\nOhio State shot 55 percent from the floor (28 of 51) to the Bulldogs' 37 percent (23 of 62).\n\nHE SAID IT\n\nGarvin on the Buckeyes' 18 assists: \"I believe Ohio State is a very unselfish basketball team. They don't care who scores.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nThe Wesson brothers outscored the Bulldogs 24-21 in the first half, with Andre contributing seven points. . Ohio State is 18-0 against Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference teams such as South Carolina State . The Bulldogs shot 15.8 percent (3 for 19) from 3-point range after making 26.7 percent (4 of 15) in the previous game vs. Cleveland State. . OSU's C.J. Jackson made one 3-pointer and needs two for 100 in the senior's career.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSouth Carolina State: The Bulldogs are trying to develop a winning culture with a batch of new players. Only Applewhite and Janai Raynor-Powell return from last season's team that finished 10-22 for Garvin. Early indications are it will be another tough season for the Bulldogs but playing a team the caliber of Ohio State can be of value in the long haul.\n\nOhio State: Chris Holtmann, the 2017-18 Big Ten coach of the year, expected the Buckeyes to take a step back with six new faces but the early results continue to be positive with road wins at Cincinnati and Creighton.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouth Carolina: Plays the fifth of eight straight road games Tuesday at Purdue Fort Wayne.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 In the days leading up to his first NFL start, Lamar Jackson experienced a stomach ache and insomnia.\n\nWhen the rookie quarterback finally got on the field, Jackson inflicted a whole lot of pain on the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nJackson juked and sprinted for 117 yards, Gus Edwards ran for 115 and the Baltimore Ravens ground out a 24-21 victory Sunday to end a three-game losing streak.\n\nFlashing the moves that enabled him to win the 2016 Heisman Trophy at Louisville, Jackson zipped in and out of the pocket for 27 carries. Though the Ravens (5-5) relied heavily on the run, Jackson also completed 13 of 19 passes for 150 yards with an interception.\n\n\"We came out with a win, so it was pretty good, I guess,\" Jackson said. \"I had butterflies before the first tackle, but after the first tackle, it was game on.\"\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco did not practice all week and was inactive with a right hip injury. That created an opening for Jackson, the 32nd overall pick in the NFL draft.\n\nBut Jackson missed practice Thursday with a stomach ailment that led to a trip to the hospital, where he was treated and released. Then, sleep eluded him Saturday night.\n\n\"I think I stayed up all night,\" Jackson said. \"I was ready to play last night.\"\n\nBefore Sunday, Jackson occasionally took snaps in running situations and replaced Flacco in the fourth quarter of two blowouts. Having to carry the load by himself, Jackson responded with a solid performance in a game the Ravens had to win.\n\n\"It wasn't pretty, wasn't perfect, but it was us,\" coach John Harbaugh said. \"It was the Ravens, and we won the football game.\"\n\nDown 21-13 in the second half, Baltimore rallied to hand the sinking Bengals (5-5) their fourth loss in five games.\n\nEdwards, an undrafted rookie free agent, scored on an 11-yard run and barreled in for the conversion late in the third quarter. Jackson then directed a 55-yard drive that ended with a field goal by Justin Tucker with 8:12 remaining.\n\n\"My teammates had my backs, and I had theirs,\" Jackson said.\n\nCincinnati's Randy Bullock missed a potential tying 52-yard field goal with 3:59 left, and Andy Dalton's fourth-down pass from the Baltimore 37 with 1:42 to go was knocked away by Marlon Humphrey.\n\n\"I definitely thought we were going to go down there, we were going to score and win the game,\" Dalton said.\n\nThis was a tough defeat for the Bengals, who were soaring at 4-1 in October but now stand at .500 for the first time after letting Jackson run rampant.\n\n\"We weren't able to get him stopped enough,\" said Bengals coach Marvin Lewis, who fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday after the unit allowed 500 yards in three straight games, an NFL record in the Super Bowl era. Lewis took control of the defense, which was better this time around despite allowing 265 yards rushing.\n\n\"I thought they played hard,\" Lewis said of his defense. \"I thought they played better and did a good job on assignments.\"\n\nJackson ran 10 times for 64 yards and five first downs , Alex Collins scored on a 7-yard run to cap the opening drive, and the Ravens took a 13-7 halftime lead when Tucker drilled a 56-yard field goal.\n\nIt all came apart for Baltimore in the third quarter. Jackson threw his first NFL interception , a pick by Shawn Williams, whose 22-yard return set up a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Matt Lengel for a 14-13 lead.\n\nOn the next series, Jackson was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 from the Baltimore 45. Dalton turned the gamble into a touchdown, hitting John Ross on the right side of the end zone for a 22-yard score.\n\nBut the Ravens rallied.\n\nKEEP 'EM GUESSING\n\nThough Jackson lacks experience, he certainly knows how to keep a defense guessing. More than Flacco, anyway.\n\n\"It's like two different offenses,\" Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict said. \"With Joe Flacco, he just stands back there and isn't very mobile but throws the ball hard. This guy (Jackson) is very unpredictable.\"\n\nBut can he win a game with his arm?\n\n\"I don't know how well he throws the ball,\" Burfict said. \"But I guess we'll find out.\"\n\nROOKIE QBS\n\nThis is the first season in NFL history in which five rookie quarterbacks selected in the first round of the same draft have started at least one game. Jackson joined the Jets' Sam Darnold, the Bills' Josh Allen, the Cardinals' Josh Rosen and the Browns' Baker Mayfield.\n\nGRIFFIN DEBUT\n\nAlso on Sunday, Robert Griffin III made his debut with Baltimore after being on the inactive list for the first nine weeks. Griffin lined up as a receiver in the second quarter but did not touch the ball.\n\nREADY AND RESTED\n\nThe Ravens improved to 9-2 after a bye under Harbaugh, and they're 14-3 since 2002 following an extra week off.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBengals: WR A.J. Green (toe) was inactive after dressing for warmups.\n\nRavens: OT James Hurst (back) was inactive for a fourth straight week. ... OT Ronnie Stanley twice limped off the field. He's had ankle issues lately.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBengals: A matchup next Sunday against visiting Cleveland should be particularly meaningful for former Browns coach Hue Jackson, hired as an assistant by Cincinnati on Tuesday.\n\nRavens: A three-game homestand concludes for Baltimore against the struggling Oakland Raiders.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Tenally) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 Justin Reid intercepted the ball in the end zone and saw nothing but green grass in front of him.\n\n\"I saw the daylight and I have to hit it,\" Reid said. \"I wasn't going to let anyone stop me.\"\n\nNo one's stopping the Houston Texans right now.\n\nReid's 101-yard interception return touchdown was the big play Houston needed to overcome a mistake-prone Deshaun Watson and beat the Washington Redskins 23-21 on Sunday, tying the franchise record with their seventh consecutive victory.\n\nFrom a gruesome , season-ending injury to Redskins quarterback Alex Smith to three turnovers, it wasn't pretty, but the Texans (7-3) became the first team since the 1925 New York Giants to win seven in a row after starting 0-3.\n\n\"With this team, you never know where the play's going to come from,\" defensive end J.J. Watt said. \"You never know who's going to make it \u2014 offense, defense, special teams \u2014 but you've got to find a way. For the seventh time, we found a way.\"\n\nWhile Watson was 16 of 24 for 208 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions, Smith broke his right tibia and fibula on a sack by Kareem Jackson midway through the third quarter and will require surgery. Smith's right leg turned the wrong way in eerily similar fashion to Joe Theismann's broken leg on a Lawrence Taylor sack exactly 33 years ago to the day.\n\n\"I know it was very painful for him and heartbreaking for a lot of people,\" Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. \"He's a great guy and hard worker and one of the key leaders on this football team. These things happen in pro football, unfortunately. Just hate to see them happen with a guy like Alex.\"\n\nColt McCoy replaced Smith and threw for a touchdown pass and led a long scoring drive for Washington (6-4), which likely will have to rely on the journeyman quarterback the rest of the way. When a McCoy-led drive finished with an Adrian Peterson touchdown to put the Redskins up 21-20 early in the fourth quarter, it was the first lead change in a game involving the Redskins all season.\n\n\"You pray for opportunities to get to play,\" said McCoy, who was 6 of 12 for 54 yards. \"You don't like to see it how it happened today.\"\n\nHouston went ahead for good on a 54-yard field goal by Ka'imi Fairbairn, who missed a 44-yarder earlier. The winning streak stayed alive when Redskins kicker Dustin Hopkins missed a 63-yard field-goal attempt with 3 seconds left.\n\n\"We just have belief,\" Watson said. \"Everyone keeps fighting. No one is doubting each other. Regardless, we try to play complementary football, but when the offense needs the defense to help us out, they do that and vice-versa.\"\n\nEMPTY SEATS\n\nEven though there were plenty of empty seats and a total attendance of 61,593 that was far below a sellout, Redskins cornerback Josh Norman called the crowd \"electrifying.\" Norman last week criticized fans for not having players' backs at home and said the team plays better on the road.\n\n\"What an atmosphere, right?\" Norman said. \"You guys came out and you showed up in a big way. We can't be more proud and excited to be among you guys. ... I applaud you all, for sure.\"\n\nPETERSON'S UP AND DOWN DAY\n\nPeterson ran for two touchdowns to continue climbing the NFL rushing chart, but was bottled up on a lot of his other carries. Peterson's 3- and 7-yard TD runs gave him 105 in his career and moved him past former Redskins star John Riggins into sole possession of sixth all time, one behind Jim Brown for fifth.\n\nPeterson finished with 51 yards on 16 carries.\n\nQUIET THOMAS\n\nIn his second game with the Texans, Demaryius Thomas was a non-factor. Watson only threw his way twice \u2014 once on a play wiped out by a penalty \u2014 and the former Broncos receiver did not have a catch.\n\nThomas stayed in Houston during the bye week in Houston to study the playbook and watch film after making a handful of newcomer mistakes in his debut. Thomas had three catches for 61 yards in that game, but disappeared from the offense Sunday.\n\nMR. RELEVANT\n\nWashington receiver Trey Quinn made a major impact in his return after missing more than two months with a high-ankle sprain. Quinn, who was \"Mr. Irrelevant\" caught four passes for 49 yards starting in place of injured wideout Jamison Crowder and would have been the emergency QB had McCoy gone down.\n\nINJURIES\n\nTexans: RG Zach Fulton left with a shoulder injury on the first drive, and LG Senio Kelemete left with an ankle injury in the second quarter. ...

(AP) \u2014 Crazy as it may sound, the New York Giants are starting to believe they have a chance to make a run at the playoffs.\n\nIt's amazing what a couple of wins can do for a team after a 1-7 start.\n\nSaquon Barkley ran for a career-high 142 yards and scored three touchdowns as the Giants held off the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 38-35 on Sunday to win consecutive games for the first time since December 2016.\n\n\"I think there is some excitement going around,\" said Eli Manning , who hit 17 of 18 passes for 231 yards and two touchdowns. \"It is good. It is a good feeling to have in the locker room and you see some growth. You see the improvement.\"\n\nWhat the Giants (3-7) are doing is making plays and finishing. The running game has picked up and it's opened up the passing game, and the defense is forcing turnovers. The group intercepted four passes in sending the Bucs (3-7) to their fourth straight loss with linebacker Alec Ogletree returning one 15 yards for a touchdown.\n\n\"I just know that we're playing better and I just love to see these guys in here after the game with smiles on their faces,\" said receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who caught an 8-yard touchdown pass. \"We just put it all together, so it's always a lot more fun when you win.\"\n\nPlaying in the NFC East also helps increase the belief the Giants are not dead.\n\nWashington, which fell to Houston and lost quarterback Alex Smith for the season to a broken leg, leads the division with a 6-4 record. No other team has a winning record.\n\n\"We've got a long way to go, there are a lot of things we've got to get better at, but if we can just keep battling and fighting, who knows?\" coach Pat Shurmur said. \"That would be a fun thing for everybody to write about.\"\n\nThe Giants never trailed as Manning found a wide-open Barkley on a 6-yard TD pass on the opening series, and the No. 2 overall pick in the draft scored from 5 yards out on the second possession to give New York the lead for good.\n\n\"We're finishing games and we're finishing drives, and that's what we weren't doing in the first half of the season,\" Barkley said of his first winning streak as a pro.\n\nTampa Bay made things interesting after Jameis Winston replaced a turnover-plagued Ryan Fitzpatrick in the third quarter and led four touchdown drives. The last score came on a 41-yard pass to Mike Evans with 2:22 to play and got the Bucs within 38-35.\n\nThe Bucs got the ball back at their 20 with 23 seconds to play, but B.W. Webb intercepted Winston's long throw down the sideline to ice the win.\n\nAfter Tampa Bay got within 31-28, Manning, whose only incompletion came on a short pass to Barkley late in the second quarter, connected with tight end Evan Engram on a 54-yard pass and run on the second play after the kickoff, and Barkley capped the drive with a 2-yard run with 3:52 to play.\n\nThe Winston-to-Evans TD pass closed the gap to three points again.\n\n\"It hurts me when I have to see my team lose a game because I turned the ball over,\" Winston said. \"And I'm sure it hurts Fitz. And I'm sure it hurts anyone that has a hand in what they believe led the other team to winning. That's our main focus. We have to find a way to win.\"\n\nFitzpatrick scored on a fourth-down 1-yard run for the Tampa Bay, which squandered a chance to score on its opening possession when Fitzpatrick was stopped on a quarterback sneak inside the Giants' 5.\n\nEvans recovered a fumble in the end zone in the third quarter to start the comeback, Peyton Barber tallied from 5 yards out and Adam Humphrie s and Evans caught TD passes in the fourth quarter to get the Bucs within three points twice.\n\nWinston finished 12 of 16 for 199 yards and two touchdowns. Barber rushed for 106 yards on 18 carries. Evans had six catches for 120 yards. Fitzpatrick was 13 of 21 for 167 and the three interceptions.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBuccaneers TE O.J. Howard left the game in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury. Giants DL Kerry Wynn left the game in the second half with a concussion.\n\nWELCOME SACK\n\nJason Pierre-Paul, the Giants' 2010 first-round draft pick, returned to face his old team for the first time since being traded in the spring. He had 1\u00bd of the Bucs' four sacks. He helped Manning up after the first sack.\n\n\"I just said to him: 'Get up, stop falling,' but no, I was just helping him up because that used to be my old teammate and I'm not trying to hurt him, I'm just trying to play football and have good sportsmanship,\" Pierre-Paul said.\n\nKareem Martin had the Giants' first and only sack in the last three games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBuccaneers: Host the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.\n\nGiants: Travel to Philadelphia to face the Eagles on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rey Del Rio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Cam Newton took a shotgun snap and set up in a clean pocket, surveying the field from sideline to sideline. The star quarterback had time and an open receiver in the end zone, giving the Carolina Panthers a chance to convert a go-ahead, 2-point conversion against the Detroit Lions.\n\nNewton, though, wasted the opportunity by sliding to his left and sailing an off-balance throw behind and over Jarius Wright.\n\nInstead of earning a comeback win to bolster playoff hopes, Newton's errant pass with 1:07 left allowed Detroit to hold on for a 20-19 win over Carolina on Sunday.\n\n\"I let this team down and I've just got to be better,\" Newton said.\n\nCarolina coach Ron Rivera went for the win after Newton threw his third touchdown pass to rookie receiver DJ Moore , who leaped in the corner of the end zone to make the catch.\n\n\"I think you go for 2 on the road,\" Rivera said.\n\nRivera would not budge on the reasoning behind the aggressive call when pressed whether he made it because usually reliable kicker Graham Gano missed an extra point and a field goal earlier.\n\n\"I was going for the win,\" he said. \"That's the bottom line.\"\n\nNewton's line looked good, going 25 of 37 for 357 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. But with a chance to help the Panthers (6-4) avoid losing two straight for the first time this season and at least improve their wild-card positioning, Newton failed to deliver a relatively simple pass in a pressure-packed situation.\n\n\"This game is such a humbling game at times,\" he said. \"Today, I was humbled.\"\n\nDetroit coach Matt Patricia insisted he wasn't surprised by Rivera's decision.\n\n\"They had good momentum going into that situation,\" Patricia said.\n\nThe Lions (4-6) recovered an onside kick to seal the victory and end a season-high three-game losing streak. They were in a position to win after Matthew Stafford threw a go-ahead, 19-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Golladay with 5:19 left. Stafford rolled to his right and threw toward the end zone, connecting with Golladay, who leaped just inside the 5 and landed in the end zone with a score that stood after review.\n\n\"He just gave me a nice, pretty, high ball,\" Golladay said. \"I like balls like that for me to just use my size, hands, athletic ability to go up there and make the catch.\"\n\nStafford was 23 of 37 for 220 yards with a touchdown. Golladay had eight catches for 113 yards and his go-ahead touchdown help keep Detroit's fading hopes of saving its season alive.\n\n\"We're playing for everything,\" linebacker Jarrad Davis said. \"We went down so many games, we know we can't lose another one, so it's do or die at this point.\"\n\nPIVOTAL PLAY\n\nMoore turned a short pass into an 82-yard gain in the third quarter and would have scored if Darius Slay didn't tackle him at the 12. Slay was on the opposite side of the field when Moore made his catch, and the cornerback chased down the speedy receiver from behind.\n\n\"That's a huge play,\" Patricia said. \"Great hustle.\"\n\nFour plays later, Gano hit the left upright on a 34-yard field goal after making 28 straight for the longest active streak in the NFL. Gano also missed an extra point in the fourth period, leaving Carolina in a 13-13 tie and leading to its decision to go for the 2-point conversion.\n\n\"This is a really tough game to swallow because I could have helped us get a win,\" Gano said. \"But I can't try to tear my technique down and start over.\"\n\nSILVER LINING\n\nMoore, a first-round pick, made the most of his opportunities to play more without injured receiver Torrey Smith in the lineup. Moore had seven receptions for 157 yards \u2014 both season highs \u2014 and the score that pulled the Panthers within a point late in the game.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nPanthers: Newton left the game briefly in the third quarter with an apparent ankle injury. CB Donte Jackson went out in the second quarter with what looked like an ankle injury, but returned.\n\nLions: Detroit rookie RB Kerryon Johnson left in the third with a left knee injury and didn't return after running for 87 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Patricia said he didn't have an update on Johnson's condition.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPanthers: Host Seattle on Sunday.\n\nLions: Host Chicago on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck followed the perfect plan Sunday.\n\nHe threw three more touchdown passes again, avoided getting sacked again and helped Adam Vinatieri achieve another record-breaking moment by leading the Colts to their fourth straight win.\n\nLuck and T.Y. Hilton hooked up twice for scores, Marlon Mack and Jordan Wilkins each ran for one touchdown and the Colts' defense stymied Tennessee in a 38-10 drubbing that gave Luck a 10-0 record against the Titans.\n\n\"Andrew was just unbelievable,\" coach Frank Reich said after his quarterback improved to 10-0 in the series. \"I mean every throw was with pinpoint accuracy.\"\n\nHis timing was spot on, too.\n\nWith some of the franchise's greatest players in attendance, Luck went 23 of 29 for 297 yards and finished with a rating of 143.8. He tied Dan Marino for the third-longest streak of consecutive games with three or more TD passes (seven) in league history. Only Tom Brady (10) and Peyton Manning (eight) remain ahead of Luck on the list.\n\nHilton caught nine passes for 155 yards in front of Reggie Wayne and Marvin Harrison, the top two receivers in each of the Colts' most prominent receiving categories.\n\nAnd the victory, the 210th regular-season win of Vinatieri's career, allowed the 45-year-old to break George Blanda's record as Indy (5-5) moved squarely back into the playoff hunt.\n\nFor the Titans (5-5), it was all too familiar.\n\nThey've lost to Luck when he never gave them a chance, when he rallied the Colts late, when he was pulled early and even when he was hurt. This loss might have been the most frustrating yet.\n\nAfter defensive coordinator Dean Pees was taken to a nearby hospital when medical workers took him out of the press box in a wheelchair during the first quarter, first-year coach Mike Vrabel took over play-calling duties and Luck skewered the league's top-ranked defense.\n\nLosing starting quarterback Marcus Mariota with an injured right elbow in the final minute of the first half certainly didn't help.\n\nVrabel provided no postgame update on Mariota but said Pees would be kept overnight for further tests. The 69-year-old Pees retired briefly after last season, and Luck and Reich both said they hoped Pees would be all right.\n\nTennessee, meanwhile, has some soul-searching to do.\n\n\"They were ready to go. They played much better than we did. They coached much better than we did,\" Vrabel said. \"We have to drop this and lose it after we make the corrections, and get going.\"\n\nLuck made it look easy.\n\nAfter Mack's 1-yard run and Vinatieri's 22-yard field goal gave Indy an early 10-0 lead, Luck connected with Hilton on a 68-yard TD pass. Wilkins' 18-yard scoring run made it 24-0.\n\nAll the Titans could muster was a 42-yard field on the final play of the half \u2014 after Mariota left and only after the Colts drew an unnecessary roughness penalty.\n\nIndy put it away by winning a replay challenge that turned a Hilton's 11-yard catch into a 14-yard TD and a 7-yard scoring pass from Luck to Dontrelle Inman in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I cannot speak to the previous years,\" Luck said of his mastery over Tennessee. \"I'm just happy we're 1-0 this year against Tennessee and we'll face them again, obviously, when that time comes.\"\n\nWAYNE'S WORLD\n\nWayne became the 15th member of the Colts' Ring of Honor on Sunday during a halftime ceremony where he was surrounded by former teammates including Manning, Marvin Harrison and Edgerrin James, and NFL Hall of Fame executive Bill Polian, who drafted Wayne in 2001.\n\nHe played in a franchise-record 211 games and caught 1,070 passes for 14,345 yards and 82 TDs in 14 seasons \u2014 all in Indy.\n\n\"This (blue) jacket looks pretty damn good on me, thank you,\" Wayne said before jogging to the end zone to thank the fans \u2014 as he did for years just before kickoff.\n\nSTAT PACK\n\nTitans: Mariota was 10 of 13 with 85 yards and one interception before leaving. Blaine Gabbert went 11 of 16 with 118 yards, one TD and one interception after replacing Mariota. ... Tennessee allowed five sacks. ... The Titans gave up a season-high point total.\n\nColts: Luck was not sacked for the fifth consecutive game, breaking a tie for the fifth-longest streak in the league since sacks became an official stat in 1982. Luck has not been sacked in 214 consecutive dropbacks. ... Starting center Ryan Kelly left in the fourth quarter with a knee injury and did not return. He said his knee will be examined Monday.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\nTitans: \"I was able to get the headset switched over, and everybody on the staff, just like they do with Dean, was able to help out,\" Vrabel said.\n\nColts: \"I guess I knew they kept that stat, but I didn't know I was close,\" Vinatieri said of passing Blanda.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTitans: Vrabel returns to Houston next Monday.\n\nColts: Welcome former division foe Miami to Indianapolis next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It is lower than the Boeing 747, which is 8.7 meters (28.5 feet).\n\nQ: How easy is it to land the largest jumbo jets?\n\n\u2013 Azlan Allam\n\nA: A pilot with significant experience can transition to a very large airplane quickly. There is little difference in the handling characteristics, but the flight deck height and wingspan require practice.\n\nThe 747 and A380 pilots I know characterize both as easy airplanes to fly.\n\nQ: How much fuel does a jetliner hold in gallons?\n\n\u2013 Richard, Sebring, Florida\n\nA: The A380, the largest airplane in commercial airline service, can hold nearly 86,000 U.S. gallons of jet fuel. Other airplanes hold much less, such as the A321 that holds up to 7,800 U.S. gallons.\n\nQ: Why do the most modern A320s have the tall, upswept winglets (sharklets) rather than the smaller wing fences at their wingtips that the older models had? Has Airbus discovered that the new winglets are more effective than their older wing fences? If so, why does the A380 have similar style of wing fences as the older A320s?\n\n\u2013 Jennifer von Geldern, Yuba City, California\n\nA: The large winglets (sharklets) are more fuel-efficient than the earlier smaller fences. The A380 aerodynamic engineers found that the fences are efficient enough. Each wing is different.\n\nQ: In the last few years, I've flown a couple of long haul flights on the A380 (Air France) and A330 (Iberia). Neither of them had A/C vents at the seats. Needless to say, both flights got quite warm. I assume this is for cost reasons?\n\n\u2013 Bret, Morgan Hill, California\n\nA: When an airline orders a new airplane they can specify if they do not want air vents. It is a cost savings, however most airplanes are delivered with passenger air vents. I am surprised to hear that an A380 was ordered without them.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\n\nLoading...\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2018/11/18/airbus-380/2018306002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "Trump tweet crudely transforms Rep.

Because of his public statements, Democrats have called for him to recuse himself from the investigation.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has proposed tying legislation protecting Mueller from any interference by Whitaker to the next government spending bill. And outgoing Republican Sen.

It's the first Monday night game in Los Angeles since 1985. It's also just the second time that teams meeting on Monday night in Week 11 or later have each had one or fewer losses.\n\nWhile most of the attention will be focused on quarterbacks Jared Goff and Patrick Mahomes, it is also an opportunity for the crew of Joe Tessitore, Jason Witten and Booger McFarland to show improvement in what has at times been a trying first year.\n\nThat is especially true for Witten, whose transition from the playing field to the booth has not gone quite as well as former teammate Tony Romo's move to CBS. Witten has had some noticeable flubs but has owned up to them.\n\n\"Hell, I'm not perfect,\" Witten said during a teleconference last week. \"Certainly with Tony and the success that he had, I really try not to live in that world and fully embrace it and continue to get better and evaluate it. I think with the flubs, I certainly do not deny it, I don't try to hide it and as you said, that's really all you can do in those moments is self-deprecate and move forward.\"\n\nThree-man booths can take time to develop, but time has not been on the side of recent announcing teams. The last three \"MNF\" booths with two analysts have lasted two or three seasons.\n\nThe challenge of developing chemistry is tougher since McFarland is down on the field hovering above the action instead of next to Tessitore and Witten. \"MNF\" producer Jay Rothman said there are cameras set up where the announcers can see each other and that interruptions have been rare.\n\n\"I think it's going to be something unique and different that no other, no other broadcast can offer, which is offense, defense, young, old, I consider myself old, guys talking about football and having a conversation that pulls the viewer in,\" McFarland said.\n\nTessitore said the group's biggest improvement has been late in games when they have been close.\n\n\"I think that's when the three of us are at our best,\" he said. \"I never doubt our ability to document, assess, talk strategy, scheme, players, in the moment quickly and just let it happen. Where I think this crew has gotten better in recent weeks, and I think it's going to continue to get better, is having really good cohesive conversation that flows and finds a rhythm.\"\n\nBoth teams already have wins on Monday night this season. The Rams defeated the Raiders in Week 1 and the Chiefs rallied to beat the Broncos in Week 4. Witten said while everyone is looking at the matchup between the quarterbacks, the chess match between coaches Sean McVay and Andy Reid is even more interesting.\n\n\"The Rams having a season that they had last year with a young head coach, a lot of hype, a lot of expectations and they have met that,\" he said. \"On the other side, it's kind of the opposite. I mean, Andy Reid has really reinvented himself offensively in Kansas City, making a decision to trade Alex Smith who had taken that team to multiple playoff appearances, and Patrick Mahomes, I mean, he's worth the price of admission.\"\n\n\"Monday Night Countdown\" analyst Louis Riddick said the game moving to Los Angeles from Mexico City might make it even better.\n\n\"If this doesn't grab your attention, I don't know what does. Now with it being played stateside, a lot of people will be lucky to go to this game,\" he said.\n\nESPN has not been fortunate with great late-season matchups in recent years, but that isn't the case this season. Monday's game is part of five straight weeks of games with playoff implications. The network is also pleased with the ratings, which are up four percent from last season, averaging 11.4 million viewers.\n\nThis week's matchup has a chance to be the most widely-watched \"MNF\" game on ESPN. The record is the 2009 game between the Vikings and Packers, when Brett Favre's return to Green Bay drew 21.839 million viewers.\n\n\"There are those teams from a ratings perspective that are just global teams that move the meter \u2014 the Steelers, Packers, Patriots and Cowboys,\" Rothman said. \"Historically, Kansas City has not been one of those that move the meter ... and L.A. is sort of getting there, but it's going to be interesting to see.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Just trying to shoot a lot and play the game I used to play the whole season.\"\n\nAlexander Radulov had two goals and an assist, Tyler Seguin had a goal and two assists, and Roope Hintz also scored for the Stars, who have won two straight. Jamie Benn had three assists, Jason Spezza had two to top 900 points in his career, and Ben Bishop stopped 37 shots.\n\nDallas improved to 4-4-1 on the road in the opener of a stretch of seven of eight away from home.\n\n\"We're in a tough stretch in the schedule,\" Spezza said. \"When you have games like this, have contributions from up and down the lineup everybody feels a part of that and it's a good springboard going into some tough games coming up.\"\n\nAnthony Beauvillier and Scott Mayfield scored for the Islanders, who lost in regulation for the third time in 12 games (7-3-2). Thomas Greiss had 16 saves, but was pulled after giving up three goals on six shots in the first 7:08 of the second period. Robin Lehner came on and finished with 11 saves.\n\n\"We didn't play 60 minutes,\" Mayfield said. \"We lost a lot of battles. It just wasn't there. We'll look at video, keep it in-house. ... Guys know we threw away two points. We've got to be better.\"\n\nMayfield pulled the Islanders to 4-2 just 24 seconds into the third as his centering pass from the left side of the goal went off Bishop's stick and in.\n\nRadulov then scored twice in less than two minutes to help the Stars pull away.\n\nFirst, he restored Dallas' three-goal lead as he scored with a backhand on a breakaway at 7:35. Radulov then tapped in a puck lying in the crease with Lehner out of position for his eighth of the season and 100th of his career to make it 6-2 at 9:16.\n\nTrailing 1-0 after one period, the Stars went ahead with four goals in the second.\n\nLindell tied it as he got a pass from Seguin in the center above the circles and beat Greiss at 2:09.\n\nHintz put the Stars ahead with his first career goal as he got a pass from Spezza in the left circle and fired a shot through Greiss' five-hole at 4:40.\n\n\"It's nice to get the goal today and get the win, too,\" Hintz said.\n\nSpezza got his 900th point on the play.\n\n\"I love being a part of guys' first goal, they always remember you,\" the 35-year-old said. \"I had high expectations of myself a lot of years and I guess that leads to good production.\"\n\nLindell gave Dallas a two-goal lead as he got his second of the game and third of the season with a one-timer from the right faceoff dot that also went through Greiss' legs at 7:08.\n\nThat prompted Islanders coach Barry Trotz to pull Greiss in favor of Lehner.\n\nSeguin made it 4-1 as he knocked in the rebound of a shot by Radulov for his sixth with 5:53 left in the middle period.\n\nBeauvillier, who had his first career hat trick and four-point game Thursday night against the Rangers, got the Islanders on the scoreboard 3:36 into the game off a pass from Leo Komarov.\n\nNOTES: Benn has six assists and nine points in his past 10 games. ... Seguin has seven goals and 12 assists in 18 games against the Islanders. ... Dallas has won three straight meetings with the Islanders, and four of the past five. ...

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Maybe both teams already were looking ahead to The Game.\n\nWhatever it was, Michigan and Ohio State struggled with middling Big Ten teams Saturday. Instead of easy tuneups, the games against 5-5 teams nearly became nightmare traps.\n\nOhio State played horrendous defense and escaped with a 52-51 overtime win only because Maryland quarterback Tyrrelle Pigrome misfired on a 2-point conversion try. Michigan, holding onto one of the coveted top 4 spots in the College Football Playoff ranking, trailed Indiana 17-15 at halftime before escaping with a 31-20 victory .\n\nBut both prevailed, preserving the enormity of the annual heavyweight fight. The Big Ten East and a chance to play Northwestern for the conference championship hangs in the balance. If No. 4 Michigan wins out, it almost certainly will secure a spot in the playoff.\n\nThe No. 10 Buckeyes likely would be satisfied with a conference championship in this season of injuries, inconsistent play and off-the-field turmoil, but a victory also would preserve a sliver of a playoff possibility for them. Of course, ruining a championship run for the hated rival Wolverines would be a welcome byproduct of a win in Columbus.\n\nOhio State has won the past six in the series, which means that in four seasons at Michigan, coach Jim Harbaugh has yet to win the one game he was brought to Ann Arbor to win. As far as how the teams have matched up, this may be his best chance so far.\n\nSo it'll be another big one.\n\n\"It's the game everybody wants, it's the game we want,\" Michigan safety Josh Metellus said. \"Last stop on the revenge tour. We take this one personal. You know, Thanksgiving week, great week, great week for football, and this is one of those games you're just all hyped up for, the reason you come to Michigan.\"\n\nOhio State (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten, CFP No. 10) scored a lot of points on Saturday, running back J.K. Dobbins \u2014 handling the bulk of the carries because of a quad bruise to Mike Weber \u2014 piled up a career-high 203 yards and quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. broke two more single-season passing records. The Buckeyes will need all that firepower when they face Michigan and the nation's top defense.\n\nBut the Ohio State defense has been as flimsy as the offense has been explosive. The unit allowed Maryland to pile up 595 yards of offense, including 298 on the ground by freshman running back Anthony McFarland.\n\n\"We've had some really good defensive play at times but not consistent,\" Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano said. \"Rest assured, every waking minute we have we're going to try to get that fixed. The one thing we have going is that we're 10-1 and we still have a chance. We'll have to go out next week and find a way.\"\n\nMichigan (10-1, 8-0, CFP No. 4) needed a school record six field goals from Jake Moody to get past scrappy Indiana. Star defensive end Chase Winovich left the game midway through the third quarter with an apparent shoulder injury, but Harbaugh said X-rays and CAT scans were negative. There's no word yet on whether he'll be available for the Ohio State game.\n\nHistory has shown that records and results from the week before don't mean much when these two teams clash the Saturday after Thanksgiving, usually in frigid temperatures under gray clouds and with snow swirling in the air.\n\n\"(This) game,\" Dobbins said, \"is what I left Texas to come up here for.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Sarah Jarvis, news-press.com)\n\nMELBOURNE, Fla. \u2014 It's official: Republican Gov. Rick Scott will be the next U.S. senator from Florida.\n\nThe incumbent, Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson, conceded Sunday afternoon after the results of the manual recount showed Scott with 10,033 more votes.\n\nNelson conceded via a video statement, cutting off any further legal challenges in the race.\n\n\u201cNow the campaign truly is behind us, and that\u2019s where we need to leave it,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \u201cWe must do what Americans have always done: come together for the good of our state and our country. My focus will not be on looking backward, but on doing exactly what I ran on: making Washington work.\u201d\n\nTrump posted a congratulatory tweet on Scott\u2019s victory. \u201cFrom day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!\u201d\n\nIn his video statement, Nelson, who never mentioned Scott by name, was less conciliatory.\n\n\u201cI will continue to fight on and on for the inalienable human rights that are the soul and glory of the American experiment: civil rights, women\u2019s rights, LGBT rights, and the sacred right to vote,\" Nelson said.\n\nFrom day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2018\n\nIn another close statewide contest, Democrat Nikki Fried hung on through the recount process to defeat Republican Matt Caldwell in the agriculture commission race by 6,753 votes out of more than 8 million cast. She will replace Nelson as the only Democrat holding statewide office in Florida.\n\nRepublican former congressman Ron DeSantis will be the state's next governor after Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum conceded Friday afternoon. A machine recount that ended Thursday showed DeSantis with a 32,463 vote lead.\n\nThe state cabinet is set to certify the election results Tuesday.\n\nFor Nelson, 76, this could be the final act in a career in public service that began in 1972, when he was elected to represent the Space Coast in the Florida Legislature. He subsequently served in Congress and as the state\u2019s insurance commissioner before being elected to his first of three terms to the Senate in 2000.\n\nNelson's loss to Scott was only the second loss in a career that has included 14 election victories.\n\nBut Nelson's longevity was not enough to overcome the millions of dollars of Rick Scott's personal fortune that the former health care CEO poured into the race. Scott used a good portion of the $64 million of his own money he put into the campaign on TV ads decrying Nelson as a \"career politician.\" One noted that the Ford Pinto was the most popular car in America when Nelson was first elected.\n\nScott, on the other hand, has run for office just three times, winning two terms as governor before seeking the Senate seat. The fact the he won each race by a margin of 1.2 percentage points or less illustrates how closely divided the state's voters are.\n\nConfusing Broward ballot\n\nIn fact, had it not been for a poorly designed ballot in Broward County, the Senate race likely would have been even closer than it was.\n\nIn Broward, a Democratic stronghold, some 30,000 voters didn\u2019t record a choice in the Senate, an unusually high number for such a high-profile race.\n\nNelson's recount hopes rested on discovering that those \"undervotes\" were the result of machine-counting errors. But both machine and manual recounts showed that in the vast majority of cases, voters simply left the race blank.\n\nThe most likely reason: The Senate race, the first listed, was on the lower left corner of the ballot, below voter instructions, a placement that could have made it easy to overlook, especially for infrequent voters not well-versed in the election process.\n\nHad those 30,000 voters followed the rest in the county, who gave nearly seven out of 10 votes to Nelson, the margin would likely have been in the hundreds, not thousands, and possibly could have given Nelson the win.\n\nLow voter turnout in heavily Republican Bay County, which was devastated by Hurricane Michael in October, likely also depressed Scott's vote, making the final margin closer than it otherwise would have been.\n\nThis year's drama marked the second time in less than two decades that the rest of the country looked on while Florida struggled with elections results.\n\nIn 2000, the legal battles over the presidential election results dragged on until the middle of December until the U.S. Supreme Court shut down recount battles, essentially handing the state \u2014 and the White House \u2014 to George W. Bush who won the Sunshine State by 537 votes over Al Gore.\n\nThis year's recounts went much smoother in part due to changes in state law that detailed when and how recounts were to be conducted. The lack of such uniform standards were at the heart of many of the legal battles in 2000.\n\nThe state and federal governments also helped counties upgrade aging election equipment following the 2000 election.\n\nBut the strain on the system of conducting three simultaneous statewide recounts \u2014 never before had even one been done \u2014 and legal battles over absentee and provisional ballots showed there are still improvements to be made.\n\nIncoming Florida Senate President Bill Galvano said Friday that lawmakers will discuss changes to the state\u2019s election laws.\n\nBy the next election cycle, he said, \u201cvoters are going to want to have more in terms of assurance that their votes are going to be properly counted.\u201d\n\nRecount issues\n\nAmong the problems that arose during the recount:\n\nHow to verify signatures on absentee and provisional ballots? Currently, election officials simply compare signatures on such ballots with signatures they have on file. But lawsuits pointed out that signatures change over time and election officials have no particular expertise in handwriting analysis.\n\nHow long should absentee ballots be accepted? Those coming from within the United States must be received by 7 p.m. on election day while those coming from overseas can be accepted up to 10 days after the polls close. In both cases, the ballots need to be postmarked no later than election day.\n\nThe time line for recounts. Election workers toiled around the clock for days after a machine recount was ordered in the Senate, governor and agriculture commission races. Three of the state's 67 counties didn't complete their recounts by the state-mandated deadline. Manual recounts were much smoother, but those only involved the 90,000 or so ballots showing no or too many candidates marked in a race, not the more than 8 million cast statewide.\n\nA bigger issue is the state's election equipment. The new technology introduced post-2000 to replace antiquated voting machine is now also becoming outdated. Mechanical problems played a role in Palm Beach, Broward and Hillsborough counties missing the machine-recount deadline.\n\nGrants from the state and federal governments helped counties upgrade their voting equipment following the 2000 election, but counties have been responsible for maintaining and upgrading it, costs they typically put off for as long as possible.\n\n\"They are going to have to deal with technology and how to pay for it,\" said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida. \"Now the counties have to pay for it and election equipment is very expensive.\"\n\nScott will join fellow Republican Marco Rubio in the Senate Jan. 3. It will be the first time since Reconstruction that Florida has had two GOP senators.\n\nLt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera will fill out the final days of Scott's term as governor until DeSantis takes office Jan. 8\n\nIt's unclear what's next for Nelson, who grew up in Brevard County.\n\nHe has continued to call the Space Coast \"home\" throughout his career, though he hasn't lived here since being elected Insurance Commissioner in 1994. He still owns land in Malabar, though he lives in Orlando when not in Washington.\n\nContact McCarthy at 321-752-5018 or jmccarthy@floridatoday.com\n\nMore: Profile of Rick Scott\n\nMore: Florida recount: Things smoother than in 2000, but fixes needed; Gillum ends campaign\n\nMore: Florida recount: Hand recount complete in Broward in what is not a good sign for Nelson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/18/florida-recount-sunday-update-rick-scott-bill-nelson/2048541002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Warren's FTs send UT Arlington past UC Davis 68-59", "description": "Brian Warren scored 18 points, Radshad Davis scored 12 and UT Arlington beat UC Davis 68-59", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/18/warrens-fts-send-ut-arlington-past-uc-davis-68-59/38558511/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T20:35:09Z", "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) Brian Warren scored 18 points, Radshad Davis scored 12 and UT Arlington beat UC Davis 68-59 on Sunday.

Win in the trenches. But here\u2019s to hoping that Rice\u2019s football philosophies have evolved.\n\nThe buzz that surfaced Sunday about the Browns considering Rice for their head coaching job \u2013 quickly disputed in statements from Cleveland GM John Dorsey and Rice \u2013 prompted a flashback from a visit with her in 2009, shortly after she finished her duties with the Bush administration.\n\nIt happened to be the only interview that I\u2019ve conducted when the premises, a hotel conference room in Dana Point, Calif., were swept by the Secret Service and a snoopy K-9 operative.\n\nRice was there as keynote speaker to kick off NFL owners meetings, at the request of Roger Goodell.\n\nMore: Titans defensive coordinator Dean Pees leaves Colts game with medical issue\n\nMore: NFL Week 11 matchups to watch: Can Khalil Mack, Bears rattle Vikings' Kirk Cousins?\n\n\u201cI like the game, technically,\u201d Rice told me. \u201cI like the strategy of the game. I love to imagine how my teams would play. My teams would run the ball. You control territory. It's also the case when you run the ball, not only do you control the clock, but I think it is demoralizing to an opponent. Scoring quickly is exciting. It's fun. But it doesn't really demoralize a defense like four yards, six yards, seven yards, little pass, four yards, eight yards. That's the way you want to play ball.\"\n\nYeah, tell that to Patrick Mahomes, the Kansas City quarterback who demoralizes and beats defenses with quick, deep strikes. And don\u2019t tell that to Browns fans pumped up by the presence of new franchise quarterback Baker Mayfield. Of course, let\u2019s allow Rice the benefit of the doubt when considering that with Mayfield, she might build her offense differently than once envisioned.\n\nAs for her ideal defense, Rice might still mesh with the mindset of interim coach Gregg Williams, preferring an aggressive defense that is heavy on the blitz.\n\nWould that be \u201c46\u201d style or the zone-blitz flavor?\n\n\u201cBuddy Ryan \u2026 there always looked like there were 14 people on the field when Buddy Ryan's defenses were out there,\u201d Rice replied. \u201cBut I'd probably have more of a Dick LeBeau defense.\"\n\nAh, the zone blitzes.\n\n\"What a concept, right?\u201d Rice said. \u201cDrop back big defensive linemen. I like defensive linemen in coverage.\u201d\n\nStill, when Rice told one long-time NFL coach during those NFL meetings about how she might even blitz while in a prevent defense, you might imagine the reaction.\n\n\u201cNorv Turner and I had a little exchange about the prevent defense,\u201d she said. \u201cHe mentioned that I'd feel differently the first time I blitzed and they went long -- 70 yards for the touchdown.\u201d\n\nWe know now her approach to defense has evolved since then. In her statement Sunday she said she would love to call a couple of plays next season but \"at no time will I call for a 'prevent defense.'\"\n\nRice\u2019s football roots don\u2019t put her in the mix to coach the Browns, but they are indeed rich. Her father coached football and served as athletic director at Fairfield Industrial High School in Birmingham, Ala. (where her mother was English teacher for Willie Mays). Although her father, who went on to become a minister, did the bulk of his coaching before Rice was born, he routinely took her to watch high school games as she grew up.

(Amanda Inscore/The News-Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNAPLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Lexi Thompson was the best this week, and Ariya Jutanugarn was the best all season.\n\nNeither left any doubt about that Sunday.\n\nThompson shot a 2-under 70 to finish at 18-under 270 and win the LPGA's season-ending CME Group Tour Championship by four strokes over Nelly Korda. The win makes this the sixth consecutive year that Thompson has won at least once, extending the longest such active streak on the LPGA Tour.\n\n\"Golf is my life,\" Thompson said. \"But it is just what I do. I'm coming to realize that. Still not there some of the days because it is so much a part of my life, but it is just a sport. There is so much to life other than that, my family and my friends and just loving every bit of that and just being grateful for what I have.\"\n\nJutanugarn took the other two big prizes that were up for grabs this week, clinching the yearlong Race to the CME Globe prize \u2014 and the $1 million bonus that comes with that \u2014 as well as the Vare Trophy for winning the season's scoring title. The world No. 1 already had wrapped up player of the year honors, and finished 2018 with a 69.415 scoring average to edge Minjee Lee (69.747) for the top spot there.\n\nJutanugarn shot a 66 on Sunday, finishing the week tied for fifth at 12-under 276.\n\n\"It felt great today,\" Jutanugarn said. \"I'm very proud of myself.\"\n\nJutanugarn briefly lost the lead in the projected Globe standings on Sunday after Brooke Henderson made three birdies on her first seven holes to grab the top spot. Jutanugarn reclaimed the advantage with four birdies in a six-hole stretch midway through her round, and the trophy was just about locked up when she birdied the par-5 14th almost simultaneously to Henderson making bogey on the par-3 16th.\n\nThe 13th hole Sunday provided the shift that Thompson used to hold off Korda. They went to the tee of that par-4 with Thompson up by two; she made birdie, Korda made bogey, and Thompson was suddenly up four with five holes to play.\n\n\"It was just very special to win in front of all my family and friends,\" Thompson said.\n\nJutanugarn finished in style, rolling in a 15-footer for birdie on the final hole to cap the year where she swept the LPGA's biggest prizes.\n\n\"It means so much to me because like to be honest, after 2016 I never expected anything,\" Jutanugarn said. \"I feel like I achieve like too much already in my life, so I never think I can do anything more than that. So this year ... just like unbelievable.\"\n\nIt was the 10th career win for Thompson, who grabbed the lead on Friday and kept it the rest of the way. She hadn't finished better than a tie for ninth in any of her last eight starts \u2014 but Tiburon Golf Club has been a haven for the native South Floridian, who is 31-under in her last seven rounds at the tour championship there.\n\nThe win also helped ease the pain of last year's tour championship for Thompson. She had a 2-foot par putt on the 72nd hole \u2014 one that could have meant a tournament win, the world No. 1 ranking and player of the year honors \u2014 but pushed it right and wound up losing to Jutanugarn by a shot.\n\nThere was no final-hole angst this time, and the role reversal was complete. Like Thompson in 2017, Jutanugarn departed with the Globe and the Vare Trophy; like Jutanugarn in 2017, Thompson got the win in the season finale.\n\nAmong other notables, Brittany Lincicome (67) tied for third at 13 under with So Yeon Ryu (68), Lydia Ko went 68-68 on the weekend to finish 12-under alongside Jutanugarn, Marina Alex (69) and Carlota Ciganda (70). Nasa Hataoka finished alone in ninth at 10-under, and first-round leader Amy Olson shot a 68 to finish at 9 under and in a group with Henderson and Sei Young Kim.\n\n\"To finish top 10, top five, whatever it's going to be, going into the offseason, obviously I made a few extra dollars because I'm not playing until January,\" Lincicome said. \"I feel pretty good about it.\"\n\nThe 2019 LPGA schedule is expected to be released in full later this month. The year begins with the inaugural Tournament of Champions in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, from Jan. 17-20. Winners from the last two LPGA seasons are eligible for that field, which means there should be about 36 pros playing along with some celebrity participants and amateurs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

England won 2-1. (AP Photo/Rui Vieira) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Harry Kane's goalless streak was only five minutes from extending to eight games when the captain finally found the net again for England.\n\nAs Ben Chilwell floated a free kick into the penalty area, Kane slid in, stretched out his right foot and nudged the ball into the Croatia net.\n\nIt came four months too late to secure a place for England in the World Cup final. But the World Cup Golden Boot winner ensured England went some way to avenging the Moscow semifinal loss to Croatia by turning the tables with a 2-1 victory at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\n\nWhile England advanced to the final four of the inaugural UEFA Nations League, Croatia was relegated to the second tier.\n\nAny doubts about what soccer's newest international competition means to England were dispelled in the relief and glee on Kane's face as he darted toward the crowd in celebration before being leapt on by Jesse Lingard as the Wembley crowd roared.\n\nRarely in the 11 years since English soccer's national stadium was rebuilt has there been such tension for an international game. Not, perhaps, since the opening months when England was beaten by Croatia and denied a place at the 2008 European Championship.\n\n\"I've never seen (Wembley) like this in an England shirt,\" the 25-year-old Kane said. \"We are going to enjoy it so I hope the fans do too.\"\n\nFor a competition that only debuted in September \u2014 to replace some largely meaningless friendlies \u2014 it has been quickly embraced in soccer's often-cynical heartland. The comeback from such a young side demonstrated a fortitude so often missing from a country that hasn't won a major title since the 1966 World Cup.\n\n\"The most important thing is the connection with the fans,\" England coach Gareth Southgate said. \"The energy that came back to the team in those difficult moments helped us get over the line.\"\n\nNow England has seven months to contemplate just how meaningful winning the Nations League would be in June. Portugal secured the hosting by winning its group on Saturday. Switzerland sealed the third spot on Sunday night by beating Belgium 5-2, before France or the Netherlands complete the lineup on Monday.\n\n\"It's another semifinal, two wins away from winning a trophy,\" Kane said. \"We showed that we can beat the big teams. Croatia and Spain are two of the very best in the world. So this is kind of our next step after the summer.\"\n\nCroatian players have said since July that they were inspired in the semifinal by what they perceived as arrogant undertones in the \"Football's Coming Home\" lyric in the \"Three Lions\" team anthem. Croatia went on to lose to France in the World Cup final.\n\nThe song was played immediately after the final whistle on Sunday and even cited by Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic to congratulate England.\n\n\"It's coming home,\" Dalic said in his only post-match comments in English. \"Very soon.\"\n\nFatigued after going the distance to beat Spain on Thursday, Croatia was unsettled throughout the first half by England's pace. But Croatia found its stride in the second half, taking the lead after 12 minutes after cutting through England down the right.\n\nJosip Brekalo played in Nikola Vlasic, who cut the ball across to Andrej Kramaric. Switching the ball between his feet, the midfielder twisted unchallenged before raising a shot into the roof of the net, via a deflection off Eric Dier's thigh.\n\n\"We let a soft goal in,\" Southgate said, \"and it is a real test of resilience and patience.\"\n\nThe game turned on Southgate's double substitution in the 73rd minute that saw Jadon Sancho and Lingard enter. The impact was felt within five minutes and the set pieces that served England so well on the run to its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years proved decisive again.\n\nJoe Gomez's long throw-in was headed down by Kane through the legs of Hrvoje Millic and Lingard tapped in from close range for his second goal in two games after scoring in a 3-0 friendly win against the Unites States on Thursday.\n\nAt the other end, Lingard came to England's rescue. Domagoj Vida's header had beaten goalkeeper Jordan Pickford but Lingard cleared off line.\n\nParity was maintained but England was still facing relegation from Group A4. Only a win would secure top-tier status and with it a place in the semifinals.\n\nFor the first time since the last-16 World Cup game against Colombia, and after 747 frustrating minutes, Kane found the target in an England shirt again.\n\n\"Harry is the best goalscorer in the world,\" Southgate said. \"We have huge belief in him. He is so hungry to lead the team on and further.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Each wing is different.\n\nQ: In the last few years, I've flown a couple of long haul flights on the A380 (Air France) and A330 (Iberia). Neither of them had A/C vents at the seats. Needless to say, both flights got quite warm. I assume this is for cost reasons?\n\n\u2013 Bret, Morgan Hill, California\n\nA: When an airline orders a new airplane they can specify if they do not want air vents. It is a cost savings, however most airplanes are delivered with passenger air vents. I am surprised to hear that an A380 was ordered without them.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\n\nLoading...\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2018/11/18/airbus-380/2018306002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andrew Joseph", "title": "Officials refused to review questionable call with ASU's Pac-12 South title on the line", "description": "More officiating problems in the Pac-12.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/pac-12-refs-officials-arizona-state-oregon-2-point-call-review-darby-catch-south-title", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/usp-ncaa-football_-arizona-state-at-oregon.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T19:57:55Z", "content": "Arizona State went into Saturday\u2019s game against Oregon controlling its destiny in the Pac-12 South.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Jake Browning has been the quarterback for more victories than any other player in Pac-12 Conference history.\n\nHe's rewritten the record book for No. 16 Washington and despite the undue criticism that has come his way by the fan base at times through his career, will long be regarded as one of the great quarterbacks to wear the Huskies' purple and gold.\n\nThe capper to his career could come next Friday when the Huskies face No. 7 Washington State in the Apple Cup. No quarterback in Washington history has ever beaten Washington State four times, and a victory over the Cougars would keep alive Browning's hope of closing his career by playing in the Rose Bowl.\n\nHe's been a conference offensive player of the year, has taken Washington to the College Football Playoff and has already won one Pac-12 title. Yet going 4-0 in his career against Washington State would a difficult accomplishment to top.\n\n\"I think I would want to beat them regardless,\" Browning said following Washington's 42-23 win over Oregon State on Saturday. \"It's a good situation to be in, but I'm not going to prepare harder because there's more on the line. We want to beat the Cougs.\"\n\nThe winner of the Apple Cup will face Utah in the conference championship game on Nov. 30. This was the situation that faced both teams two years ago, also in a game played in Pullman, and Browning was outstanding, throwing three touchdowns in the first quarter of a 45-17 rout. It was the best of his three games against the Cougars; Washington has outscored Washington State 131-41 in those three meetings.\n\n\"I think we've been able to run the ball every single year,\" Browning said. \"I don't totally remember all the games to be honest, but most of the times we do well on offense it's because we've been executing well and be able to get explosives. Those are probably the main keys.\"\n\nBrowning is an enigma in the history of Washington quarterbacks. Saturday's victory over Oregon State was the 37th game Washington has won with Browning as quarterback, breaking a Pac-12 mark he shared with Marcus Mariota and Kevin Hogan. He is the first four-year starting quarterback in school history and will leave Washington as the career leader in seemingly every important passing category.\n\nBut he's been the focus of critics, especially later in his career. Some of it has been fair, but much of it has seemed unfounded for someone who's had so much success. Whether it's his average throwing arm, his sometimes baffling mistakes an experienced starter shouldn't be making, or Washington's failures in past big games against Alabama, Penn State and Auburn, Browning has worn the brunt of blame during his tenure.\n\n\"I think it's something I'm proud of, but if you're proud of not folding mentally or giving up on a season, then you've got some pretty low standards,\" Browning said. \"Just keep battling, keep doing our deal, and get ready for the Cougs. One game at a time.\"\n\nThat sounds like something Washington coach Chris Petersen would say, but it only highlights how close the coach and quarterback have been through their career. There've been rough patches, like earlier this year when Browning was surprisingly benched in a loss at California, but Petersen has been one of Browning's staunchest defenders.\n\n\"These guys we are talking about are as good as they come,\" Petersen said. \"You ask them to do something and they do it, they take care of business, they're always all-in, it's been awesome being around them.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Nobody talks about that. That\u2019s a far greater victory than it is for the other side.\"\n\nTrump also focused on the Senate wins on Twitter the morning after the election.\n\nThe president said the Democrats did well because \"I wasn't on the ballot.\"\n\nWallace pointed out that Trump had told voters to make the midterm election about him and to \"pretend I'm on the ballot.\"\n\nMore: Donald Trump says he 'should have' commemorated Veterans Day at Arlington\n\nMore: Fox News host Chris Wallace tells Trump world sees him as \u2018beacon for repression\u2019\n\n\"I have people that won\u2019t vote unless I\u2019m on the ballot, OK?\" Trump said. \"And I wasn\u2019t on the ballot.\"\n\nThe president said that Republicans won in states where he campaigned and held rallies, particularly touting Republican victories in Florida, Georgia and Ohio.\n\n\"I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor,\" he said.

I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\"\n\nThe president said Whitaker's past statements \u2013 including that the Russians did not meddle in the 2016 election, that the Trump campaign did not collude with any Russians and that Mueller's investigation could be killed by cutting off its funds \u2013 \"really can be viewed either way,\" although he did not elaborate on how else they can be interpreted.\n\nWould he stop Whitaker from intefering in Mueller's work?\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be up to him, Trump said. \"I think he\u2019s astute politically.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nOklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley reacts during the second half against the Kansas. (Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWe are almost at the end of the college football season, which means there\u2019s not much more misery to go around. By this point, there\u2019s more apathy than anger, which is understandable given the nature of fandom. When you root for a team that loses or disappoints week after week, a certain numbness and acceptance sets in over time, dulling the pain of ineptitude. By this point, most fans of teams that have massively underachieved are checked out and just ready for it to be over.\n\nSo if it\u2019s not the fans of losing teams that are feeling the most acute agony right now, we turn our attention to the handful of teams that are frustrating in different ways. It\u2019s the game that slipped away that will ultimately keep your team out of the College Football Playoff. It\u2019s the key injury that will forever linger as a \u201cwhat-if\u201d over the program. Or it\u2019s the team that keeps winning but does so in the most fatalistic manner possible.\n\nThough all but a few fan bases in the country would be willing to change places with Oklahoma fans, the Sooners\u2019 10-1 record may qualify as the least enjoyable run to a potential playoff bid in history.\n\nWinning is supposed to be fun in college football, but watching Oklahoma is a real chore. With a defense that can\u2019t stop anybody, the Sooners basically put their fans through an endurance test every week. Though Kyler Murray is probably having an even better season at quarterback than Baker Mayfield did when he won the Heisman Trophy, it\u2019s not particularly exciting to watch the Sooners play. Instead, its four hours of frustration and dread, knowing that as soon as its offense scores, the defense has to go back on the field.\n\nAt this point, after giving up 524 yards to Kansas in a 55-40 win on Saturday, you wonder if Lincoln Riley might be better-served just going onsides kick every time. It probably couldn\u2019t yield any worse results than the Oklahoma defense is producing on its own.\n\nNot only has the mid-season firing of Mike Stoops not made any difference, but the Sooners seem even worse now under Ruffin McNeill. Maybe they\u2019ll be good enough on offense to win a fourth consecutive Big 12 title. But short of winning a national championship, which seems highly unlikely to happen, it\u2019s going to be hard for Oklahoma fans to reconcile the win-loss record under Riley with the feeling that half the program is a downright embarrassment.\n\nAnd for that reason, Oklahoma is No. 1 in the Misery Index, a weekly measurement of knee-jerk reactions based on what each fan base just watched.\n\nMORE IN MISERY\n\nArkansas: Though a lot of college football fans think of Arkansas as one of the more difficult jobs in the SEC, the Razorbacks averaged nearly eight wins a year from 1998 through 2011. It was indisputably a good program and at times a very good one. In other words, as hard as it may be for Arkansas fans to accept what has happened this decade, going 4-19 in the SEC since 2015 is not normal. Though Chad Morris may get things turned around \u2014 the recruiting class he\u2019s putting together has built some hope \u2014 this season, and particularly Saturday\u2019s 52-6 loss to Mississippi State, is a reminder that there will be no quick fix.\n\nTexas Tech: Just when it seemed like Kliff Kingsbury had finally pulled through the uncertainty of whether he was the long-term answer for his alma mater, the Red Raiders decided to go on a four-game losing streak that keeps him in the purgatory of .500 football. Though quarterback Alan Bowman missed the last two games while recovering from a collapsed lung, it\u2019s still not a great look to gain just 181 yards in a 21-6 loss to Kansas State. Even if Texas Tech finishes with a win over Baylor, it's hard to make the case that the program has progressed under the 39-year old Kingsbury, whose career record is 35-39. Simply put, after six years of investment in him as a young head coach, the trajectory is flat. Thus, you\u2019re going to hear more and more fans who think the school can do better.\n\nMichigan State: The chosen scapegoat for Spartan fans is co-offensive coordinator Dave Warner, who chose to throw the ball 16 times over Michigan State\u2019s final 17 plays in a 9-6 loss to Nebraska on a day when it was having far more success with the run. The bottom line for the 6-5 Spartans is that they\u2019ve underachieved this year largely because quarterback Brian Lewerke didn\u2019t progress as expected and freshman Rocky Lombardi, who played Saturday, is still pretty green. Regardless of the specific reason, this is the second time in the last three years Michigan State won\u2019t finish as a top-25 team, which is pretty rare in the Mark Dantonio era.\n\nTRENDING TOWARD MISERY\n\nTennessee: One game will define whether Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s first season will be viewed as a success or failure. If the Vols can beat Vanderbilt, they\u2019ll be 6-6 while building a narrative that Pruitt exceeded expectations heading into an important recruiting class. If they finish 5-7, the story will be that Tennessee got blown out five times by 25 or more points, which points directly at Pruitt\u2019s defense and an inability to keep his team in games. Tennessee has rarely looked more overwhelmed than in Saturday\u2019s 50-17 loss in Neyland to Missouri.\n\nWest Virginia: The dream season is not going to happen. It will be a very good season for the Mountaineers regardless, but with their playoff hopes hanging in the balance, they got outscored 21-10 in the fourth quarter by Oklahoma State and lost, 45-41. West Virginia\u2019s offense played well enough to win but stalled out in critical situations (5-for-18 on third down) and couldn\u2019t capitalize on a 4-1 margin in turnovers. The Mountaineers can still get to the Big 12 title game if they beat Oklahoma next Friday, but even that would feel a bit empty since a playoff bid is now off the table.\n\nArizona is 5-6 in Kevin Sumlin\u2019s first year. (Photo: William Mancebo, Getty Images)\n\nArizona: The bad moments this season for Arizona have been exceptionally bad, but the Wildcats have never looked worse than in a 69-28 loss to Washington State. A snapshot: Immediately after the Cougars scored to make it 34-14 halfway through the second quarter \u2014 yes, the second quarter \u2014 Arizona\u2019s Cedric Peterson flat-out fumbled the kickoff. Washington State\u2019s Kainoa Wilson picked it up cleanly off the turf and ran it in for yet another touchdown without running an official play. Arizona was picked as a sleeper to win the Pac 12 South in Kevin Sumlin\u2019s first year, but at 5-6 with Arizona State still to play, the Wildcats could very well miss the postseason.\n\nHouston: Halfway through the season, it seemed like a lead-pipe lock that the Cougars would run away with the American\u2019s Western division and get a shot at UCF to earn a New Year\u2019s Six bowl bid. Instead they have to go on the road to Memphis, which is now in the driver's seat for the division, without starting quarterback D\u2019Eriq King, who was injured in last Thursday\u2019s win over Tulane. Meanwhile, the ugly sideline spat between head coach Major Applewhite and star defensive lineman Ed Oliver \u2014 over a jacket of all things \u2014 put Houston in the headlines for reasons it wanted nothing to do with.\n\nColorado State: This has been just a horrendous season for Mike Bobo\u2019s squad with only three wins, but it looked like the Rams were going to have reason for a big celebration Saturday after knocking off Mountain West leader Utah State on a \u201cHail Mary\u201d as time expired. Only they didn\u2019t win, as receiver Preston Hill was ruled ineligible because he stepped out of bounds before his acrobatic 34-yard catch.

(Photo: Malcolm Denemark/FLORIDA TODAY)\n\nBy noon Sunday, Florida's 67 counties have to report their final vote totals to the state. And those will almost certainly show Republican Gov. Rick Scott the winner over incumbent Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nFormer Republican congressman Ron DeSantis is the governor-elect after Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a Democrat, officially bowed out Saturday.

Tim Shortt, FLORIDA TODAY\n\nWhile many around the country have been pointing fingers at Florida and asking \"What, you guys again?\" the recount process this time around was actually much smoother than in the 2000 presidential election fiasco. Then, legal battles continued into the middle of December when the U.S. Supreme Court eventually shut down recount efforts, effectively handing the election to George W. Bush who won Florida by 537 votes over Al Gore.\n\nMore: What is going on with Florida's elections? An illustrated guide\n\nMore: Legal wrangling dominates Florida election recount between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott\n\nNew state laws written after 2000 set uniform statewide standards for how and when to conduct recounts. That remedied most of the issues that 2000's court battles focused on.\n\nElection map shows how voters voted in Florida Governor, Senate and House races (Photo: FLORIDA TODAY)\n\nChanges in state and federal law also meant counties had to replace antiquated voting equipment such as punch-card machines, which infamously produced \"hanging chads\" in Palm Beach County.\n\nIn the end, the process worked largely as it was supposed to, though with some notable glitches. Sixty-four of the state's 67 counties were able to complete machine recounts of millions of ballots in three statewide races, though there had never been such a recount in even one race before. And a manual review of ballots showing no or too many votes was proceeding without drama.\n\nStill, that doesn't mean there are not more election changes coming as the result of this year's election.\n\nMore: Florida felons' restored voting rights will have national, personal impacts\n\nMore: With Florida recount over, Andrew Gillum's last chance to become governor rests with the courts\n\nIncoming Florida Senate President Bill Galvano said Friday that lawmakers will discuss changes to the state\u2019s election laws.\n\nBy the next election cycle, he said, \u201cvoters are going to want to have more in terms of assurance that their votes are going to be properly counted.\u201d\n\nSusan MacManus, a professor at the University of South Florida who became \"the world's most quoted political scientist\" during the 2000 recount, said the difference between the two was \"night and day,\" despite what casual observers might think.\n\nBut she also said the drama of the last week and a half still exposed some weaknesses in how we conduct elections. She also notes similar or worse problems could have easily happened in just about any other state, but came to light here because Florida is the one state in the union that regularly has whisker-thin margins in statewide elections.\n\nAmong the areas she sees as likely to be addressed are the methods used to verify signatures of absentee and provisional ballots, the timeline for conducting recounts and new standards for voting equipment across the state.\n\nMore: Florida recounts, lawsuits, chaos: Why the state's political polarization is grabbing the spotlight again\n\nMore: Fact check: President Trump, GOP making false claims of election fraud\n\n\"We fixed things and other states followed,\" MacManus said of the changes made following the 2000 election. \"And this time around we will probably fix things and other states will follow.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Bill Posey, then a freshman state senator from Brevard County who chaired the election reform effort after the 2000 election, noted the measure passed with broad bipartisan support even though some of his fellow GOP lawmakers grumbled the reforms would help Democrats more where problems with ballots were more prevalent.\n\n\"Our elections are bulletproof,\" Posey said last week. \"Except for gross incompetence or intentional fraud at the highest levels, there is no other reason for every voter in Florida not to feel their vote was counted.\"\n\nA crowd protests outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Lauderhill, Fla. A possible recount looms in a tight Florida governor, Senate and agriculture commission race. (AP Photo/Joe Skipper) (Photo: Joe Skipper, AP)\n\nIndeed, Florida was not the only state with election problems, just the most high profile:\n\nIn Georgia, voting hours had to be extended and the governor's race wasn't decided until Friday when the Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams conceded.\n\nScanning machines jammed in New York City.\n\nSome precincts in Maryland actually ran out of ballots, causing voting lines to back up for hours while additional ballots were trucked in.\n\nAubrey Jewett, a political science professor at University of Central Florida, says Florida boasts one of the most comprehensive election processes in the nation.\n\nBut it's not insulated from human error or the polarizing nature of Florida's evenly split electorate, which magnifies the impact of mistakes or confusion that would be surmountable in many other states, he said. So despite major strides since Bush v. Gore, Florida remains the bloodiest battleground heading into 2020, he said.\n\nMore: Florida recounts stir unpleasant memories, baseless charges\n\nMore: Florida election recounts bring out 'darker angels' as partisans sling unfounded claims\n\n\"After 18 years and a population growth of 5 to 6 million we're still evenly divided, perhaps more evenly divided,\" Jewett said. \"That feeds into everything else: We're huge to presidential elections, to control of the Senate, to control of the House. I suspect we will be just as tightly divided in two years, so the possibility of very close elections are quite high, if you ask me.\"\n\nWhat this year's election exposed was not so much problems with Florida's election laws, but with aging voting equipment.\n\nFollowing the 2000 election, state and federal aid helped counties replace outdated election machinery such as punch-card systems.\n\nSorted ballots are seen Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Fla. The Florida recount continued Monday in Broward County. (Joe Cavaretta /South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) (Photo: Joe Cavaretta, AP)\n\nBut individual counties are responsible for maintaining and upgrading election equipment. They have historically been reluctant to spend money to do so until forced to.\n\nProblems with aging equipment first popped up on election night and continued through the machine-recount process:\n\nBroward County was slow to report election day totals from some voting precincts because of transmission issues. It did finish its machine recount in the nick of time, but it took 17 minutes to upload the results to the state putting it two minutes past the deadline, leading the state to reject the numbers.\n\nPalm Beach County\u2019s tabulating machines went on the fritz during the recount due to age and overwork causing it to not finish its machine recount.\n\nThe electricity went out in Hillsborough County during a machine recount, resulting in an 846-vote deficit. Officials there didn't submit the recount numbers because of the discrepancy.\n\n\"Counties need to catch up with their technology,\" MacManus said.\n\nShe also pointed to another voting problem that is out of the hands of lawmakers or election officials: Voter education.\n\nThe recount in Broward County, which the Nelson campaign pointed to as key to closing the gap with Scott, was mostly finished after just two hours Friday. (Photo: Sarah Jarvis, news-press.com)\n\nTens of thousands of potential voters move to Florida each year and the election systems here often are different from those in their home states. Voter registration drives sign up an additional tens of thousands of new voters each year.\n\nMacManus cited the problems with the Senate race in Broward as a case where lack of voter education added to the election woes.\n\nMore: Florida election recounts bring out 'darker angels' as partisans sling unfounded claims\n\nSome 30,000 voters there cast no vote in the Senate race. A poorly designed ballot, with the Senate contest tucked into the lower left corner below voter instructions, made the race easy to overlook. But knowledgeable voters would have known that they didn't vote in the high-profile race and looked more carefully at their ballots. After all, 684,000 people in the county did manage to cast a vote in the race.\n\nMacManus said parties need to do more to teach newly registered voters how to actually vote.\n\n\"It is not enough just to register them,\" she says. \"You really have to take time to educate and mentor them.\"\n\nEmployees at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office count ballots from the Mid-term election, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018, in Lauderhill, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) (Photo: Wilfredo Lee, AP)\n\nVoters, both in Florida and around the country, also need to learn that vote counting is never completed on election night. Late arriving absentee ballots and provisional ballots aren't counted until days after polls close. And technology glitches inevitably lead some precincts to be slow in reporting results. That's why election results aren't certified until 10 or more days after voting ends.\n\nMore: This is why US election ballots routinely go missing\n\nBut in most elections, those late votes aren't going to change a race and a winner can be unofficially declared within a few hours of polls closing. But that is not the case in races with razor-thin margins like the Florida ones that went on to recounts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Walker, who oversaw a variety of election-related legal challenges, asked why state officials have repeatedly failed to anticipate problems in elections.\n\n\u201cWe have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this,\u201d he said.\n\nContributing: Ledyard King\n\nFollow John McCarthy on Twitter: @JournalistJohnM\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/18/florida-recount-some-fixes-still-needed-gillum-concedes/2048129002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andrew Joseph", "title": "Julio Jones took away an interception from the Cowboys with a vicious hit", "description": "Julio Jones can play safety.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/julio-jones-falcons-cowboys-hit-tackle-video-heath-nfl-interception", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/screen-shot-2018-11-18-at-12-15-54-pm.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T19:18:19Z", "content": "Julio Jones is an All-Pro wide receiver, but given the Falcons\u2019 injury situation in the secondary, he could probably hold his own as a safety.

The rest of the rankings were mostly unchanged after a weekend with few big games or surprising results.\n\nLed by unanimous No. 1 Alabama, the top six stayed the same as last week. Clemson was No. 2, followed by Notre Dame, Michigan, Georgia and Oklahoma.\n\nWashington State moved up a spot to No. 7 and UCF jumped three spots to No. 8, season highs for both schools.

From 1963-2017, there have been only two seasons in which the Black Knights appeared in the AP Top 25. In 1985, Army was No. 19 for one week on its way to a 9-3 season. In 1996, Army went 10-2 and was ranked in four of the final five polls of the season. The Cadets finished 25th that season.\n\nArmy managed just one winning record from 1997-2015. But under coach Jeff Monken, who took over in 2014, Army has had three straight winning seasons. The Black Knights head into the Navy game on Dec. 8, looking for a third straight victory against the Midshipmen and a second consecutive 10-win season.\n\nMonken said reaching the Top 25 was not so much the goal for Army as finishing in the Top 25. But you can't do one without the other.\n\nThe Cadets are on a seven-game winning streak since losing in overtime at Oklahoma on Sept. 22.\n\n\"The two biggest games of the year are coming up,\" Monken said Sunday of Navy and a bowl game. \"We'd trade any ranking for a win over Navy to be sure.

The previous high was 51 teams ranked in 2008.\n\nThe Panthers, who were 3-4 and 0-3 vs. ranked teams on Oct. 7, are ranked for the first time since Dec. 4, 2016.

Philadelphia was already without cornerback Ronald Darby and safety Rodney McLeod, who also have knee injuries.\n\n___\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nFormer Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann is among the few players who knows exactly what current Redskins quarterback Alex Smith went through while suffering a season-ending broken leg - and Theismann was at the stadium when Smith got injured.\n\nTheismann tells The Associated Press he turned away when Smith's lower right fibia and tibia were broken in the third quarter of Washington's 23-21 loss to visiting Houston on Sunday.\n\n\"It brought back vivid memories,\" says Theismann, whose career ended when his leg was broken against the New York Giants on Nov. 18, 1985 \u2014 33 years ago to the day.\n\n\"The irony of today is just hard to believe,\" Theismann says.\n\n___\n\n5:27 p.m.\n\nThe Eagles say starting center Jason Kelce and starting safety Avonte Maddox each will miss the rest of Philadelphia's game in New Orleans.\n\nBoth injuries occurred in the first quarter. Kelce hurt his left elbow at the end of the Eagles' second possession. Maddox hurt his knee helping to defend an incomplete pass in the end zone on New Orleans' second possession.\n\nMaddox's injury further decimates a secondary that came in without Jalen Mills, who was scratched because of a foot injury.\n\nPhiladelphia was already without starting cornerback Ronald Darby and starting safety Rodney McLeod with knee injuries.\n\nThe latest injures occurred while New Orleans, which came in on an eight-game winning streak, was in the process of building an early 17-0 lead.\n\nThe Eagles cut it to 17-7 on a 28-yard TD run by Josh Adams about halfway through the second quarter.\n\n___\n\n5:20 p.m.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers defensive tackle Corey Liuget has been carted to the locker room with a knee injury during the second quarter against the Denver Broncos. The Chargers say he will not return.\n\nLiuget missed the first four games due to a violation of the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. He has provided a lift to the team's pass rush unit since returning.\n\nThe Chargers had a 13-7 lead at halftime.\n\n___\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nDerek Carr and Josh Rosen are trading touchdown passes in the desert.\n\nCarr has thrown for scores to Jared Cook and Brandon LaFell for the visiting Oakland Raiders in Arizona. Rosen has touchdown tosses to Larry Fitzgerald and Christian Kirk for the Cardinals.\n\nRosen and Kirk connected on a 59-yard score.\n\nThe game between two of the worst teams in the league was tied at 14-all midway through the second quarter.\n\n___\n\n4:35 p.m.\n\nRedskins quarterback Alex Smith's season is over.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden says Smith is done for the year because of a broken tibia and fibia in his right leg. Smith was hurt in the third quarter of Washington's 23-21 loss to Houston.\n\nPlayers from both teams walked off the sidelines to offer good wishes to Smith, who waved his right hand to fans as he was driven away.\n\nFormer Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, whose career ended with a broken leg during a game in 1985, tweeted: \"I feel so bad for him.\"\n\n___\n\n4 p.m.\n\nColts kicker Adam Vinatieri added another record-breaking moment to his career when Indianapolis beat the Tennessee Titans 38-10.\n\nVinatieri participated in his 210th regular-season win, snapping a tie with the late George Blanda for the most in league history.\n\nIt has been a milestone season for the 45-year-old Vinatieri, the oldest active player in the league. He broke Morten Andersen's career records for field goals and scoring earlier this season.\n\nAnd now Vinatieri has more wins in 23 seasons than Blanda accrued in a 26-year career that spanned four decades.\n\nAndrew Luck also moved into a tie for third all-time by throwing at least three touchdown passes in his seventh straight game. He's tied with Dan Marino, who did it during the 1986 and 1987 seasons. Only Tom Brady (10) and Peyton Manning (eight) remain ahead of Luck.\n\n___\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nDetroit rookie Kerryon Johnson left the game against Carolina in the third quarter with an apparent left knee injury and is questionable to return.\n\nJohnson has 87 yards on 15 carries on the day, including Detroit's only touchdown so far. The Lions lead 13-7.\n\nThe Panthers also had a scare in the third quarter when quarterback Cam Newton appeared to hurt an ankle, but he missed only one play and was back for his team's next possession, early in the fourth.\n\n\u2014Noah Trister reporting from Detroit\n\n___\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nWashington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith has been carted off the field with an air cast on his injured right ankle after being sacked by Houston Texans defenders J.J. Watt and Kareem Jackson midway through the third quarter.\n\nSmith covered his face with both hands, then a towel, as he was checked by medical personnel on the field.\n\nPlayers from both teams walked off the sidelines to offer good wishes to Smith, who waved his right hand to fans as he was driven away.\n\nFormer Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, whose career ended with a broken leg during a game in 1985, tweeted: \"I feel so bad for him.\"\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nCarolina kicker Graham Gano's streak of successful field goals is over.\n\nGano had made 28 in a row \u2014the longest active run in the NFL\u2014 before hitting the left upright from 34 yards in the third quarter at Detroit. The Lions then drove for a field goal to take a 13-7 lead over the Panthers.\n\nGano's streak only included the regular season. He missed a field goal in the playoffs last season.\n\nBacked up at his own 6-yard line in the third quarter, Carolina's Cam Newton completed a short pass to D.J. Moore along the left sideline, and the speedy receiver turned it into an 82-yard gain.\n\nBut the Lions hustled back and tackled Moore at the Detroit 12, and then the defense held. Gano's miss meant the Panthers came away with no points.\n\n\u2014Noah Trister reporting from Detroit\n\n___\n\n2:58 p.m.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers have made another switch at quarterback.\n\nJameis Winston is behind center, replacing starter Ryan Fitzpatrick after he was removed following his third interception against the New York Giants.\n\nNew York had a 24-14 lead on the visiting Bucs late in the third quarter.\n\n___\n\n2:50 p.m.\n\nFor the first time since Nov. 6, 2016, the Pittsburgh Steelers have been shut out in the first half.\n\nBen Roethlisberger, who last week against Carolina posted a perfect quarterback rating (158.3), was 8 of 19 for 53 yards and two interceptions against the Jacksonville Jaguars headed into halftime trailing 9-0.\n\nRoethlisberger now has nine turnovers in his last three games against the Jaguars, including five in a 30-9 regular-season loss at home last year.\n\nBlake Bortles hasn't been much better, but the Jaguars are leaning on the run. In one 15-play possession, the Jaguars had 12 consecutive rushes.\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans lost their defensive coordinator in the first quarter and may have lost quarterback Marcus Mariota in the final minute of the first half against the Colts with an undisclosed injury.\n\nMariota was injured after being sacked by Denico Autry. He sat on the ground briefly before walking to the sideline and then to the locker room, even though the Titans were forced to use a timeout which would have allowed Mariota to stay in the game.\n\nBackup Blaine Gabbert replaced Mariota and completed a six-yard pass on third-and-14. But an unnecessary roughness call on Indianapolis' George Odum moved the ball to the Colts 24 and set up Ryan Succop for a 42-yard field goal to cut the Titans' deficit to 24-3.\n\nDefensive coordinator Dean Pees was transported to an Indy hospital after leaving the press box in a wheelchair. The Titans later issued a statement saying he had left the stadium for further observation.\n\nTennessee came into the game with the league's top-ranked scoring defense.\n\n___\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nJust as the Washington Redskins appeared on the verge of their first lead change of the entire season, Alex Smith threw an interception that was returned 101 yards for a touchdown by Houston Texans safety Justin Reid.\n\nThe play put Houston ahead 17-7 late in the second quarter at Washington.\n\nThe Texans were up 10-7 in the matchup of division leaders when the Redskins were driving with a chance to do something they hadn't managed this season: taking a lead in a game during which they trailed.\n\nOn first-and-goal from the 7, Smith threw an incompletion. On second down, he was sacked for a loss of 2 yards. And on third-and-goal, he threw into the end zone for Jordan Reed, but the tight end cut in and the ball went outside \u2014 right into the arms of Reid.\n\nOn Washington's ensuing possession, Smith was picked off again, this time by Brennan Scarlett.\n\n___\n\n2:19 p.m.\n\nThe Giants say that safety Landon Collins is expected to return after being evaluated for a concussion. He was taken to the locker room in the second quarter of New York's game against Tampa Bay after trying to keep Bucs quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick out of the end zone on a fourth-down scramble.\n\nThe Giants led 14-7 late at halftime.\n\n___\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nCurrent Redskins running back Adrian Peterson has pulled even with former Redskins RB John Riggins for the sixth-most rushing TDs in NFL history.\n\nPeterson's 104th score on the ground came 46 seconds into the second quarter Sunday, cutting Washington's deficit to 10-7 against the Houston Texans in a matchup of division leaders.\n\nNext in Peterson's sights is Jim Brown, who is fifth on the league's list with 106 rushing touchdowns.\n\nThe record of 164 is held by Emmitt Smith.\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nNew York Giants safety Landon Collins has been taken to the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion in the second quarter of the game against Tampa Bay. He appeared to get hurt after failing to keep Bucs quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick out of the end zone on a fourth-down scramble on a broken play from the 1.\n\nThe Giants were leading 14-7 late in the first half.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nOne of Tennessee's assistant coaches left the press box during the first quarter of Sunday's game at Indianapolis.\n\nIt was unclear which coach it was or what happened. But emergency personnel were called to the coaches' box after someone came out of the box and asked for assistance. The coach walked out under his own power but was asked to sit in the wheelchair so they could take him to a lower level for further examination.\n\n___\n\n1:35 p.m.\n\nSaquon Barkley has two touchdowns already for the New York Giants.\n\nThe star rookie caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to open the scoring for the Giants against the visiting Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nBarkley added a 5-yard scoring run to give New York a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter. At 2-7 entering Sunday, the Giants are looking for back-to-back victories for the first time this year.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nRookie quarterback Lamar Jackson is off and running in his first career start for the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nJackson took the field to cheers from the home fans on the Ravens' opening series against the Cincinnati Bengals, then handed off to running back Alex Collins.\n\nJackson rushed for 12 yards on a keeper on his second play. He's starting for Joe Flacco, who is out with a sore right hip.\n\nThe drive ended with a 7-yard touchdown run for Collins for a 7-0 lead. Jackson had 46 yards on the ground in the drive.\n\nThe Ravens are trying to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\n___\n\n11 a.m.\n\nSo where are the Patriots, Bills, Jets and Dolphins this week?\n\nOn byes.\n\nIn a rarity for the NFL, the entire AFC East is off in Week 11. Also not playing this week are San Francisco (2-8) and Cleveland (3-6-1).\n\nThe Patriots (7-3) have a two-game lead over Miami (5-5) in a division New England has ruled seemingly forever. The Jets and Bills both are 3-7, far out of contention for the playoffs.\n\nNew England returns next Sunday at the Jets, while Miami is at Indianapolis and Buffalo hosts Jacksonville.\n\nOnly two teams remain without byes and they are among the NFL elite. Kansas City (9-1) plays at the Rams (9-1) on Monday night, a game moved from Mexico City to Los Angeles because of the poor field conditions at Azteca Stadium.\n\nThe Chiefs and Rams are off in Week 12.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Taylor each scored 13 for UCF (4-1). Taylor was scoreless on 0-of-7 shooting in the first half before making 3 of 4 from the field, including both of his 3-point shots, and 5-of-7 free throws after the break.\n\nDawkins hit back-to-back 3s to open the second half to give the Knights a 34-32 lead, their first of the game.

(AP Photo/Terry Renna) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 NASCAR is open to wholesale changes for 2020 that could include everything from doubleheaders, midweek races, a tightened schedule, shorter races, and even a potential shared event schedule with IndyCar.\n\nSteve Phelps, named president of the sanctioning body last month, insisted NASCAR can weather its current decline and work out of its downturn. But it's going to take changes that are being discussed among the sport's stakeholders.\n\nThe first significant change comes next season with a rules package that NASCAR is adamant will dramatically improve the on-track product. The next big fix would be to the 2020 schedule.\n\n\"We've heard from our fan base that they would like to see more short-track racing, they want to see more road courses, they want to see less cookie-cutter tracks,\" Phelps said Sunday. \"We are looking with our broadcast partners and with our tracks and with our teams and drivers to get input on what each of them thinks would be an ideal schedule, and then we're obviously doing fan research.\n\n\"Do I believe that everything is on the table? I do.\"\n\nPhelps held his first news conference as NASCAR president just hours before the championship-deciding season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Brian France had typically represented NASCAR at the annual event, but France took leave as chairman and CEO following his August arrest on drunk driving charges.\n\nJim France stepped in as interim chairman and CEO following his nephew's arrest, but the word \"interim\" was dropped from his title shortly after the change. NASCAR also replaced Brent Dewar as president with Phelps, and the leadership group for the family owned business is clearly in transition.\n\n\"I can't speak to if Brian is coming back or not,\" Phelps said. \"I do know that Jim France is our chairman and CEO. I do know that Jim France is incredibly involved in this sport, at the racetrack, off the racetrack. I can assure you that Jim France is talking to a lot of people. He's talking to Roger Penske and he's talking to Jack Roush and he's talking to racetrack owners. He's talking to drivers. He's talking to sponsors.\n\n\"That's what Jim does, and he is driving this sport. As we look to 2019, we are going to execute against Jim's vision.\"\n\nAt least four times Phelps stressed that Jim France is now running NASCAR even though the second son of the founder is primarily behind the scenes. Bill France Jr., the eldest son of NASCAR founder Bill France, was chairman for 31 years and ruled the sport as a benevolent but firm dictator.\n\nBrian France replaced his father in 2003 and had been soundly criticized throughout the industry as absent and aloof. Jim France's primary focus had been on other France properties \u2014 International Speedway Corp. and IMSA's sports car series, for example \u2014 until he replaced his nephew in August. Phelps said Jim France has been at every race since taking on his new role.\n\nBut Phelps was not able to answer if the France family is looking to sell some or all of NASCAR, or discuss NASCAR's recent bid to purchase all of sister company ISC's public stock.\n\n\"If you look at the message that has been sent ... it's that we're going to double down on this sport because we believe in it. We believe this sport is going to grow. We believe this sport, its best days are ahead,\" Phelps said.\n\nCollaboration with NASCAR's many stakeholders is at its most promising level because all industry participants need the health of the sport to improve. Many big sponsors have left NASCAR, last year's championship team is closing because its sponsor left, and Truck Series champion Brett Moffitt doesn't have a job lined up for next season. Television ratings hit lows in 26 events this season, and the mood has generally been less than upbeat for most of the season.\n\nPhelps, though, remains optimistic.\n\n\"We have faced some headwinds. We're hitting those head on,\" Phelps said. \"We always have work to be done. I've been accused of being Pollyannaish before, but I believe the state of sponsorship in this sport continues to accelerate in a positive manner.\n\n\"Do we have a lot of work in collaboration with our race teams and our racetracks? We do. And that's what we're doing. We are going to be laser focused on driving consumption.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Utah won 30-7. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Two years after he was named AP coach of the year, Mike MacIntyre's run at Colorado ended Sunday when he was fired amid a six-game skid in his sixth season.\n\n\"It was a difficult decision because Mike is a knowledgeable coach and he has really elevated this football team since 2013,\" athletic director Rick George said after asking quarterbacks coach Kurt Roper to serve as interim head coach for Colorado's final game next weekend.\n\nGeorge lauded MacIntyre's dogged focus on character, classroom and community service but said, ultimately, his program just wasn't successful enough on the scoreboard.\n\n\"What this came down to was that I wanted to see more consistency with winning seasons,\" George said. \"Mike had an amazing 2016 season. We really hoped that that kind of achievement would be continuous, but unfortunately that didn't happen.\"\n\nMacIntyre was voted AP college football coach of the year after leading the Buffaloes to a Pac-12 South title and 10 victories in 2016. That was his only winning season at Colorado, going 20-40 overall and 6-38 in the Pac-12 in the other five.\n\nMacIntyre is due about $10 million from the five-year extension he signed after that 2016 season.\n\nAs his extension was being finalized, MacIntyre fell under scrutiny over his improper handling of domestic abuse accusations against former secondary coach Joe Tumpkin by a former girlfriend. Tumpkin called the defensive plays during the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29, 2016, and resigned a month later. MacIntyre's contract extension was held up for a few months by the Board of Regents.\n\nAfter an outside investigation, MacIntyre, George and Chancellor Phil DiStefano were reprimanded, with DiStefano serving a 10-day suspension and MacIntyre and George ordered to make $100,000 donations to domestic violence causes.\n\nGeorge said he had no regrets over signing MacIntyre to that extension. \"He deserved it and his staff deserved it,\" George said.\n\nThe Buffs slipped to 5-7 last season but began this year with five straight victories and moved into the AP Top 25 again.\n\n\"Six weeks ago, we're 5-0 and the talk of the country,\" George said. \"That's where Colorado should be every year and every season, we should be the talk of the country. But we're not there and that's why I made the decision.\"\n\nThe Buffs have lost several starters in the program's worst rash of injuries in 33 years, none more impactful than a turf toe that sidelined star sophomore receiver Laviska Shenault Jr. for a month.\n\nColorado tied a program futility mark by blowing a 28-point second-half lead against Oregon State last month. The following Monday, George went to MacIntyre and told him he still had his support.\n\n\"But as the next three weeks went by my gut told me I needed to ... bring on new leadership,\" George said.\n\nHe made the move now, he said, to inject some energy into the team because it can still earn a bowl berth with a victory Saturday over California: \"We've still got a lot to play for.\"\n\nFollowing Colorado's 30-7 loss to Utah on Saturday, MacIntyre maintained his belief that he'd keep his job in Boulder, where his son, Jay, was one of several seniors celebrated in pregame festivities.\n\n\"I don't feel like it's my last game,\" MacIntyre said. \"We've got one more, hopefully we can win that and go to a bowl game.\"\n\nMacIntyre, who had taken a photo of a bison heading into a storm into his weekly news conference with buzz already building about his job being in jeopardy, said Saturday the nature of coaching is being asked when you'll leave whether you're winning or losing.\n\n\"I could've left (for) three good places, and stayed,\" MacIntyre said. \"That's just the way it is. When you're losing, they want to get rid of you. You never can win as a head coach on that and I understand that.\"\n\nAsked if he now figures he should have parlayed his success in 2016 into another job elsewhere, MacIntyre said: \"No, I shouldn't have left, that's why I stayed. A lot of people told me to leave, just like a lot of people told me not to come here. I wanted to come here.\n\n\"My family loves it here. I definitely feel like this program has (progressed). You all saw it before I got here, it was abysmal. I feel like we've come a long way. This has been a tough stretch, there's no doubt about it. But no, you don't second guess anything like that, you do what you feel like is the right thing to do at the time.\"\n\nMacIntyre then quoted senior receiver Kabion Ento, who spoke up after Saturday's loss, saying, \"We've got one more to win one more.\"\n\nA day later, that was no longer the case for MacIntyre but for Roper, his close friend of 20 years.\n\n\"We all understood when we got into this profession what this profession is like,\" Roper said. \"But it doesn't make these days any easier when they happen.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP College Football Writer Ralph D.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Browns' coaching search isn't quite ready to cross gender or diplomatic lines.\n\nGeneral manager John Dorsey, who opened the possibility of hiring a woman to be Cleveland's next coach, said Sunday that the team has not discussed former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a candidate to become the club's ninth coach since 1999.\n\nESPN, citing an anonymous league source, reported that the team would like to interview Rice, an ardent Browns fan since childhood, for its coaching job.\n\nHowever, Dorsey said she is not on the team's current list of candidates.\n\n\"Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is a great leader, possesses the highest possible character and also happens to be a Browns fan,\" Dorsey said.\n\n\"I have the utmost respect and admiration for all she's accomplished and was honored to meet her for the first time earlier this season. Our coaching search will be thorough and deliberate, but we are still in the process of composing the list of candidates and Secretary Rice has not been discussed.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Dorsey said he would consider a wide-range of candidates.\n\n\"I just want the best possible head coach to move this thing forward regardless of age,\" he said. \"It could be a woman, too. I am serious. Who knows?\"\n\nThe 64-year-old Rice would be an historic and outside-the-box candidate for the Browns, who fired Hue Jackson last month after he won just three games in two-plus seasons and went 0-16 in 2017.\n\nThere has never been a woman interviewed for a head coaching job in the NFL.\n\nOn her Facebook page, Rice professed her deep love for the Browns and said confidently, \"I know they will hire an experienced coach to take us to the next level.\"\n\n\"On a more serious note, I do hope that the NFL will start to bring women into the coaching profession as position coaches and eventually coordinators and head coaches,\" she wrote. \"One doesn't have to play the game to understand it and motivate players. But experience counts \u2014 and it is time to develop a pool of experienced women coaches.\n\n\"BTW \u2014 I'm not ready to coach but I would like to call a play or two next season if the Browns need ideas! And at no time will I call for a \"prevent defense.\"\n\nRice's last reference is common among die-hard Browns fans, who still bemoan then-coach Marty Schottenheimer's decision to play soft coverage in the 1986 AFC championship game when Denver quarterback John Elway drove the Broncos 98 yards to a game-tying touchdown in the final seconds. \"The Drive\" as it's known helped the Broncos beat the Browns 23-20 in overtime, denying Cleveland a trip to the Super Bowl.\n\nRice discussed her love for the team during a visit to the Browns' headquarters in 2010. Her passion for the Browns dates to her early years in Alabama, where she and her father watched games together and cheered for Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown on teams coached by Paul Brown.\n\nRice has become increasingly involved in sports, serving on the College Football Playoff selection committee and chairing a commission on college basketball.\n\nShe served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush from 2005-09.\n\nDorsey said interim coach Gregg Williams will be interviewed for the full-time position following the season.\n\nThe Browns have a bye this week and will face Cincinnati next Sunday, when they'll have a reunion sorts with Jackson, who was hired by the Bengals as a special assistant to coach Marvin Lewis.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tim Ireland) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Despite beating Novak Djokovic in straight sets to win the ATP Finals at only 21, Alexander Zverev knows keeping pace with the Serb isn't going to be easy.\n\nZverev claimed the biggest title of his career with a 6-4, 6-3 upset on Sunday, becoming the youngest champion of the season-ending event since Djokovic claimed the first of his five titles a decade ago \u2014 also at age 21.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" said Zverev, who also became the first German winner since 1995. \"I've won one (year-end title). He's won five. He's won, I don't know what, 148 titles more than me. Let's not go there for now. I hope I can do great ... but just chill out a little bit.\"\n\nTop-ranked Djokovic was attempting to tie Roger Federer's record of six titles but followed the same path as the Swiss great, who lost to Zverev in the semifinals at the O2 Arena.\n\nDjokovic's serve hadn't been broken all tournament until the final. Zverev did it once in the first set and three times in the second, completing the victory with a spectacular backhand winner up the line.\n\n\"There's a lot of similarities in terms of trajectory ... in our careers,\" said Djokovic, who ended a two-year Grand Slam title drought by winning Wimbledon this year, before going on to claim his 14th major trophy at the U.S. Open. \"Hopefully he (Zverev) can surpass me.\"\n\nBoth players began the match in the same form that had seen them earn straight-sets semifinal victories a day earlier, with few points going against the server.\n\nIt was Djokovic, who had lost just two of his previous 37 matches and defeated Zverev in the round robin, who began to feel the pressure as consecutive forehand errors gave up his first break of the tournament for 5-4.\n\nFans gave Zverev a huge ovation as he stepped up to serve for the set, and it appeared to inspire him. Three straight aces brought up three set points, the second of which he took when Djokovic sent another forehand long.\n\n\"I was making way too many unforced errors,\" Djokovic said. \"From 4-4 in the first set, my game really fell apart.\"\n\nZverev even began to win the longer rallies, an area of the game that Djokovic usually dominates. A 26-shot duel brought up another break point in the opening game of the second set and, although Djokovic saved it, Zverev won another lengthy exchange moments later with a forehand winner to go 1-0 up.\n\nWith the biggest win of his career in sight, Zverev began to show some nerves. Although he is the only active male player outside of the Big Four of Djokovic, Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray to possess three or more Masters titles, the young German has only reached one Grand Slam quarterfinal.\n\nTwo double faults and two backhand errors gifted Djokovic an immediate break back, but Zverev quickly refocused to win a 28-shot rally on his way to breaking in the following game.\n\n\"I lost my serve once against him today,\" Zverev said. \"I think this is a pretty good stat, especially as he's the best returner we have in the game.\"\n\nFrom there he remained solid on serve, before ending with a flourish. A backhand winner on the run drifted past the helpless Djokovic and Zverev sunk to the ground in tears.\n\n\"This trophy means a lot, everything,\" Zverev said. \"You only have so many chances of winning it. You play against the best players only.\"\n\nDjokovic sportingly crossed the net to embrace the player who will now be considered among the favorites in Australia in two months' time to end the Serb's run of two consecutive Grand Slam victories.\n\n\"I've had most success in my career in Australia,\" said Djokovic, who has won six times in Melbourne. \"Hopefully I can keep that going.\"\n\nEarlier, American pair Mike Bryan and Jack Sock saved a match point in the deciding tiebreaker to beat Pierre-Hughes Herbert and Nicolas Mahut 5-7, 6-1, 13-11 for their first ATP Finals doubles title together.\n\nHaving failed to take advantage of five championship points during the first-to-10 match tiebreaker, Bryan and Sock then had to save one against their French opponents before finally closing out victory.\n\n\"It was a hell of a match,\" Bryan said.\n\nThe 40-year-old Bryan has now won the tournament five times. He won four times with his usual partner \u2014 and brother \u2014 Bob, who has been out with an injured hip since May.\n\nSock and Bryan have dominated since teaming up, winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Open before finishing their season in style in London.\n\n\"It's been a hell of a ride,\" Bryan said. \"This could be our last hoorah because Bob's training back in Florida.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who previously had threatened to cut federal funding to California, promised \"substantial\" funds in the wake of the horrific fires that have swept the state, Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday.\n\nBrown, speaking on CBS' Face the Nation, called Trump's pledge a \"big, big win\" for his state.\n\n\"The president not only has signed a presidential declaration giving California substantial funding, but he said and pledged very specifically to continue to help us,\" Brown said, \"that he's got our back. And I thought that was a very positive thing.\"\n\nBrown spoke a day after Trump visited the burned-out remains of Paradise, until recently a city of 27,000 that was essentially destroyed when a wildfire roared through two weeks ago. The Camp Fire has killed 77 people \u2014 the death toll increased by only one on Sunday night \u2014 and destroyed more 10,300 homes in the area.\n\nThe fire, which has burned 234 square miles, or 150,000 acres, was 65 percent as of 7 p.m. PST Sunday, Cal Fire reported. More than 1,000 people have been reported missing.\n\n\"Firefighters made good progress throughout the day to strengthen and improve containment lines,\" Cal Fire said. \"Crews have continued to work in steep and rugged terrain to implement direct and indirect control lines which will aid in stopping the fire's forward progress.\"\n\nFull containment is expected by Nov. 30.\n\nBrown, a Democrat frequently at odds with the president, acknowledged Sunday that there has been some contentious \"back and forth\" between Trump and California leaders in the past.\n\n\"But in this, in the face of tragedy, people tend to rise above some of their lesser propensities,\" Brown said. \"So I think we're on a good path.\"\n\nDays after the Camp Fire began burning, Trump tweeted a threat to withhold federal payments to California, accusing the state of \"poor\" forest management.\n\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly fires in California,\" Trump tweeted. \"Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nMore: 'This is very sad to see': Trump surveys California wildfire devastation\n\nMore: Dog found 'protecting the only house left on the block' after Camp Fire\n\nBrown said Sunday that long-term forest health will require reducing carbon emissions. He said he did not press Trump on the argument that climate change is a crucial factor in the rise in more deadly and destructive fires the state has been combating in recent years.\n\n\"You can mull the science, but I'll tell you every year it's going to get clearer and clearer,\" Brown said. \"I think in less than five years even the worst skeptics are going to be believers.\"\n\nHe said the Camp Fire was moving at 100 yards a second, trapping residents with no chance to flee.\n\n\"If you're going to live this close to the forest, if the climate is going to keep changing, you're going to have to build some kind of underground shelters,\" Brown said. \"So that you can go in and protect yourself.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/18/california-fires-gov-brown-says-trump-has-got-out-back/2047825002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Ravens rookie QB Jackson poised to start with Flacco out", "description": "Ravens rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson is poised to make his first career NFL start with Joe Flacco out when Baltimore hosts the Cincinnati Bengals", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/18/ravens-rookie-qb-jackson-poised-to-start-with-flacco-out/38557555/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T17:40:00Z", "content": "Ravens rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson is poised to make his first career NFL start with Joe Flacco out when Baltimore hosts the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.

The deal includes several other incentives in a sign that athletic director Jeff Long plans to invest heavily in the program.\n\n\"Even though I knew Coach Miles, in the end you don't know until they sign on the dotted line,\" Long said. \"You have a number of coaches you're talking to because you have to talk to them. You don't know who is going to jump in the boat with you to tackle this project until they do.\"\n\nThe 65-year-old Miles was considered the front-runner for the Jayhawks' job from the moment David Beaty was told he would not be retained two weeks ago. Miles has a close relationship with Long dating to their days together at Michigan, and Miles made it clear he wanted back in coaching.\n\nThe path toward a deal became much easier last week, when LSU announced Miles had agreed to a lump sum of $1.5 million of the remaining $6.5 million he was owed under terms of his buyout.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Miles said, when asked whether he always planned on coaching again. \"The further I got away from it the more I desired it. I was prepared for a lifetime to be a coach, and 10,000 hours supposedly makes you an expert. I think I'm closing in on that 10,000 hours.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks, who lost to sixth-ranked Oklahoma on Saturday to leave Beaty with a 6-31 record in three-plus seasons, will finish out their year under their former coach Friday against Texas.\n\n\"I'm around,\" Miles said, \"but I'm not going to be a distraction.\"\n\nMiles has been out of coaching since 2016, when he was fired by LSU after a 2-2 start that left him with a 114-34 record with the Tigers. His support among Tiger fans had waned considerably in a span of just a few years, even though Miles won at least 10 games in seven of his 11 full seasons, twice reached the national title game and beat Ohio State for the '07 championship.\n\nThe most common criticism was Miles had been unable to keep up with the times, sticking to an unexciting and often-stagnant attack during college football's offensive explosion.\n\n\"I did very much look to myself and what I needed to change to make us more successful as an offensive coach,\" Miles said. \"We did have an inspection but did not take a negative view.\"\n\nMiles had inherited a winner when he was chosen by LSU to succeed Nick Saban in 2005, but he had proven with Oklahoma State he could also build from scratch.\n\nThe Cowboys had just one winning season in 12 years before Miles, their program in similar shape to the Jayhawks. But the longtime college and pro assistant thrived in his first head job, finding some overlooked prospects, developing them and eventually reaching three straight bowl games.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Coach Miles will have an immediate impact on our football program and our university,\" Chancellor Douglas Girod said. \"Together as Jayhawks, we will rebuild our football program the right way, winning championships and continuing to graduate young men of character.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks haven't had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2008, the year before Mark Mangino was forced to resign under pressure. Turner Gill won five games over two seasons before getting fired, and Charlie Weis managed six wins in two-plus seasons before he was let go.\n\nBy that point, the program had become the laughingstock of the Big 12.\n\nThe Jayhawks were woefully short on scholarship players, their facilities were decrepit, their fanbase had grown apathetic and the even the administration seemed to have little interest in supporting football. Beaty's contract lagged far behind his peers financially, and there was little money at his disposal for hiring assistant and other administrators.\n\nLong has promised to rectify those issues, even announcing that a $300 million renovation to aging Memorial Stadium had been put on the backburner while money was invested in the program itself.\n\nThe first and most important investment came in the head coach.\n\nMiles would earn $15.125 million by fulfilling his five-year contract. He also can earn a series of incentives: $1 million for reaching the national title game; $350,000 for a playoff semifinal; $100,000 for a New Year's Six game; $100,000 for making the Big 12 title game; and $75,000 for any other bowl game. Miles also can earn $50,000 each for being the Big 12 and national coach of the year, $15,000 for having a Broyles Award-winning assistant and up to $50,000 for the team's GPA.\n\nHis contract also includes a one-year, one-time rollover extension that is triggered by winning six games in a season, and benefits such as a country club membership and moving expenses.\n\n\"The national profile of four football program has improved immediately and dramatically today,\" Long said, \"but more importantly we have a leader that loves the game of football, believes in what the game does to build character in young men and prepares men for what happens after football.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

His support among Tiger fans had waned considerably in a span of just a few years, even though Miles won at least 10 games in seven of his 11 full seasons, twice reached the national title game and beat Ohio State for the '07 championship.\n\nThe most common criticism was Miles had been unable to keep up with the times, sticking to an unexciting and often-stagnant attack during college football's offensive explosion.\n\n\"I did very much look to myself and what I needed to change to make us more successful as an offensive coach,\" Miles said. \"We did have an inspection but did not take a negative view.\"\n\nMiles had inherited a winner when he was chosen by LSU to succeed Nick Saban in 2005, but he had proven with Oklahoma State he could also build from scratch.\n\nThe Cowboys had just one winning season in 12 years before Miles, their program in similar shape to the Jayhawks. But the longtime college and pro assistant thrived in his first head job, finding some overlooked prospects, developing them and eventually reaching three straight bowl games.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Coach Miles will have an immediate impact on our football program and our university,\" Chancellor Douglas Girod said. \"Together as Jayhawks, we will rebuild our football program the right way, winning championships and continuing to graduate young men of character.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks haven't had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2008, the year before Mark Mangino was forced to resign under pressure. Turner Gill won five games over two seasons before getting fired, and Charlie Weis managed six wins in two-plus seasons before he was let go.\n\nBy that point, the program had become the laughingstock of the Big 12.\n\nThe Jayhawks were woefully short on scholarship players, their facilities were decrepit, their fanbase had grown apathetic and the even the administration seemed to have little interest in supporting football. Beaty's contract lagged far behind his peers financially, and there was little money at his disposal for hiring assistant and other administrators.\n\nLong has promised to rectify those issues, even announcing that a $300 million renovation to aging Memorial Stadium had been put on the backburner while money was invested in the program itself.\n\nThe first and most important investment came in the head coach.\n\nMiles would earn $15.125 million by fulfilling his five-year contract. He also can earn a series of incentives: $1 million for reaching the national title game; $350,000 for a playoff semifinal; $100,000 for a New Year's Six game; $100,000 for making the Big 12 title game; and $75,000 for any other bowl game. Miles also can earn $50,000 each for being the Big 12 and national coach of the year, $15,000 for having a Broyles Award-winning assistant and up to $50,000 for the team's GPA.\n\nHis contract also includes a one-year, one-time rollover extension that is triggered by winning six games in a season, and benefits such as a country club membership and moving expenses.\n\n\"The national profile of four football program has improved immediately and dramatically today,\" Long said, \"but more importantly we have a leader that loves the game of football, believes in what the game does to build character in young men and prepares men for what happens after football.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(The team has denied it.)\n\nIt\u2019s seems sort of useless to put much thought into this one, if true. Clearly an organization that has been utterly woeful for as long as anyone can remember would be floating ideas meant to change the discussion around it.\n\nThis is not to say that Condoleezza Rice \u2014 the former Secretary of State \u2014 isn\u2019t accomplished. She is, of course. And she\u2019s brilliant. There are few organizations anywhere that wouldn\u2019t be helped by having her apply her time and knowledge to them. She does have sports experience, as she recently chaired the Commission on College Basketball.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t make much sense to want her to work as a coach. True, the job of an NFL head coach is partially CEO. You\u2019re managing assistant coaches who do the intricate work of creating game plans while also dealing with the big personalities of the players charged with carrying those plans out on the field. It\u2019s a management job. Condi Rice can do that.\n\nIt\u2019s also still a football job, and there\u2019s no evidence Rice can \u2014 or wants \u2014 to do that. Bill Belichick, Andy Reid, Sean McVay \u2026. these coaches are succeeding because they study the game endlessly, and find ways to innovate even though it\u2019s just 11 guys on 11 guys, same as it always was. They create mismatches by understanding how their slot guy can get open if the deep safety is forced to look to his left by play action; they further create different mismatches by showing the same look a week later with a different intended result. It\u2019s all in the detail \u2014 and their attention to it puts their players in positions to succeed, which in turn gives those coaches the standing they need to in turn manage those players.\n\nRice could learn those things. She could almost certainly learn them more quickly than the average person. But it would still take time. A lot of time. And there are plenty of women who\u2019ve already put in that time and deserve better jobs in football.\n\nIt\u2019s admirable that Browns general manager John Dorsey is openly saying he\u2019d hire a woman as head coach, but naming this name cheapens the idea. This would be a gimmick hire.\n\nA better thing to do would be finding the women who have already dedicated themselves to football and opening pathways for them to reach this point.\n\nThat means calling Kathryn Smith, who was the first woman to become a full-time assistant coach in the NFL but wasn\u2019t retained by the Bills when Sean McDermott became coach.\n\nOr reaching out to current 49ers assistant Katie Sowers, the second woman to become a full-time NFL assistant \u2014 and only openly gay coach in the league. A former player herself, she\u2019s obviously earned the trust of Kyle Shanahan and her hours of film study with one of the brightest offensive minds in the game would be put to good use in an expanded role.\n\nOr Dorsey could seek out Jen Welter, who broke the gender barrier by joining the Arizona Cardinals for training camp in 2015.\n\nMaybe these women would be interested, maybe they wouldn\u2019t be. But I promise you this much: by talking to them, Dorsey could quickly compile a list of bright, promising women coaches from across the country who aspire to work at the highest levels. That network exists. He can connect with it. And he can make a difference by giving those women chances that they have previously been denied.\n\nThat\u2019s the way forward for women in football, if Dorsey has any real interest in taking it."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "The Latest: NASCAR says 'everything in play' as changes loom", "description": "The Latest: 7-time series champ Jimmie Johnson shaves for season finale, going with a baby-faced look for the first time in nearly a dozen years.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/11/18/the-latest-nascar-says-everything-in-play-as-changes-loom/38557353/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6bdcedc33bd6e4e6acee4a23f76d3005366fd04/c=0-178-3434-2110/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/c554fd55a8c34b0593fdfafe72977c11.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T17:01:47Z", "content": "NASCAR President Steve Phelps speaks during a news conference before the NASCAR Cup Series Championship auto race at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Homestead, Fla.

(AP) \u2014 The Latest on NASCAR's Cup Series championship (all times local):\n\n6:30 p.m.\n\nJoey Logano has won his first Cup Series championship, passing defending champion Martin Truex Jr. after the final restart and then driving away from the field.\n\nLogano called him the favorite in the days leading up the season finale and ended up playing the spoiler role. He finished ahead of the \"Big Three\" of Truex, Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch.\n\nLogano was the runner-up in 2016 and missed the playoff field last year.\n\nTruex finished second, followed by Harvick and Busch.\n\nThe 28-year-old Logano was once dubbed \"Sliced Bread\" as a rising star. He never quite lived up to expectations \u2014 until now. His championship gives team owner Roger Penske a second.\n\n___\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nKyle Larson has won the second stage of NASCAR's championship race, passing Kevin Harvick just before the start-finish line.\n\nHarvick was second, followed by fellow championship contenders Joey Logano and Martin Truex Jr. Kyle Busch was sixth.\n\nThe highest finisher among Harvicj, Logano, Truex and Busch will earn the Cup Series title. The other 36 drivers have mostly stayed out of the way, although Larson has proven to be one of the fastest cars in the field.\n\n___\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nThe controversial pit stall selections of Joe Gibbs Racing drew scrutiny after the first stage of Sunday's championship race.\n\nDenny Hamlin missed his pit stall when he headed in for service and had to back up. It cost the pole-sitter valuable time and again spotlighted that Hamlin had not picked the first pit stall and instead allowed teammate Kyle Busch to take the spot.\n\nBusch is racing for the championship and Joe Gibbs Racing felt it needed Busch in the first pit stall to have a clear exit back onto the race track. His stop was problematic, too.\n\nBusch's crew struggled to get all the lug nuts on his Toyota and it cost Busch six spots in the running order.\n\nBusch was ninth and lowest of the four title contenders when the second stage began. Hamlin restarted 17th.\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nKevin Harvick has won the first stage of NASCAR's championship race. He gains nothing for crossing the finish line first after the opening 80 laps, but it shows he's the one to beat at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nKyle Larson was second, followed by fellow championship contenders Kyle Busch, Joey Logano and Martin Truex Jr.\n\nHarvick took the lead following the first round of pit stops and faced no real challenges for the lead.\n\nThe highest finisher among the four title contenders will earn the trophy. The other 36 drivers have mostly stayed out of the way.\n\n___\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nFurniture Row Racing gathered at Martin Truex Jr.'s car for one final group photo moments before the start of NASCAR's season finale.\n\nFurniture Row is closing after the race at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nThe No. 78 is trying to win its second consecutive title and its pre-race ceremonies were a mixed emotion of excitement and sadness. Most of the crew members had family and children with them at the car, and most were wearing either the standard black Furniture Row shirts or something to honor Truex.\n\nThe group photo was delayed as the team waited for owner Barney Visser to get to the car.\n\nVisser is shutting down the team because it lost its primary sponsor, and Visser said it's too expensive to fund a competitive car without assistance.\n\n___\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nJimmie Johnson slid into the No. 48 Chevrolet for the final time with crew chief Chad Knaus calling the shots.\n\nJohnson and Knaus are parting ways after 17 years together. Sponsor Lowe's also is leaving NASCAR.\n\nJohnson and Knaus chatted with former Hendrick Motorsports great Jeff Gordon before they rolled off pit road. Johnson strapped on his helmet as Knaus kneeled by the car window and they went over the playbook.\n\nKnaus smacked Johnson on the top of the helmet before he left for the pit stall.\n\nHomestead has marked a time to say goodbye to departing stars such as Gordon, Tony Stewart and Dale Earnhardt Jr. over the last few years. It seemed like a retirement scene at the 48. Johnson and Knaus were mobbed by fans, media and family wanting one final snapshot of one of the more successful driver-crew chief pairings in NASCAR history.\n\n___\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nCarlos Slim Domit, the son of a billionaire businessman who has long backed driver Daniel Suarez, says he will continue to support NASCAR's first Mexican champion in 2019.\n\n\"It's been a very nice season and hopefully we have good news for next year,\" Domit said Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway. \"We all feel very proud of what he has accomplished.\"\n\nSuarez, who won the 2016 Xfinity championship, is out at Joe Gibbs Racing after just two seasons in the Cup Series as the team makes room for Martin Truex Jr. Suarez has been linked to Stewart-Haas Racing as a potential landing spot.\n\nSuarez won the pole at Pocono and had just three top-five finishes this season. He's 20th in the standings.\n\nSuarez declined this weekend to discuss his 2019 plans.\n\nDomit said NASCAR has \"been supporting diversity for a long time,\" and Suarez's success was an example of that commitment.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nActor Josh Dallas showed up for the NASCAR finale and professed his love for IndyCar.\n\nDallas is serving as the grand marshal at Homestead-Miami Speedway and will give the command for drivers to start their engines.\n\nBorn in Louisville, Kentucky, Dallas grew up watching races. But when asked for details, he laughed and acknowledged he was an IndyCar fan who has been to several Indianapolis 500 events.\n\n\"I'm an Andretti guy,\" he said.\n\nHe also is a Martin Truex Jr. guy. Dallas says he's pulling for the defending Cup Series champion to repeat because he \"loves Truex's story.\"\n\nFurniture Row Racing, a one-car team based in Denver, teamed with Truex in 2014 and dominated the series in 2017. The team also is shutting down after the finale because of sponsorship troubles.\n\nDallas is best known for his roles as Prince Charming in the ABC television series \"Once Upon a Time\" and Fandral in the Marvel Comics adaptation of \"Thor.\" He currently stars in the NBC drama series \"Manifest.\"\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nNASCAR believes it can weather its current decline and the best days for the sport are ahead.\n\nTo get there, NASCAR President Steve Phelps says \"everything's in play\" as the sanctioning body tries to lead the sport out of its downturn.\n\nPhelps held his first news conference as NASCAR's president on Sunday just hours before the championship-deciding season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. He said nothing is off limits in discussions for the 2020 schedule, which may include doubleheaders, midweek races, a tightened schedule, shorter races and even a potential shared event schedule with IndyCar.\n\nPhelps reiterated the France family is optimistic about the future of NASCAR and that Jim France has been heavily involved since replacing nephew Brian as chairman and CEO in August.\n\nBrian France was charged with drunken driving in August and has been on leave from his family business. Phelps replaced Brian France at the annual state-of-the-sport meeting with reporters and offered an optimistic outlook on the future of NASCAR.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

O'Neill acknowledged that \"the entire world is worried\" about tensions between the two superpowers.\n\nThe struggle to find common ground did not bode well for a crucial meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping scheduled for the G-20 meeting in Argentina at month's end.\n\nTrump was conspicuously absent from the Asia gathering, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. Pence and Xi swapped barbs, setting a contentious tone for trade talks involving 60 percent of the world economy.\n\nO'Neill said the talks broke down over language about the World Trade Organization. The U.S. has adamantly opposed the way WTO treats China as a market-driven economy rather than one dominated by state-supported industries.\n\nThe same, sharp differences that have crippled trade between the two nations also made working out common language for a communique impossible, O'Neill concluded.\n\n\"There were two big giants in the room, what can I say,\" O'Neill said.\n\nIn his speech to the group, Xi urged the business and political leaders to promote free trade.\n\n\"The world today is going through major development, transformation and change,\" Xi told the group. \"While economic globalization surges forward, global growth is shadowed by protectionism and unilateralism.\"\n\nPence pitched that the United States offered nations in the region a better option for economic partnership and criticized Chinese \u201cauthoritarianism and aggression.\u201d He said the U.S. seeks \"collaboration and not control\" and blasted a Chinese road-building program as forcing debt on poorer neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe don't drown our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce or compromise your independence,\" Pence said. \"The United States deals openly and fairly.

Our vision excludes no one. We only ask that nations respect their neighbors\u2019 sovereignty, embrace free, fair, and reciprocal trade, and uphold individual rights.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods. The administration also has warned that duties on another $267 billion in goods could be coming, which would subject to tariff virtually all Chinese-made products shipped into the U.S.\n\nChina retaliated by levying tariffs on $110 billion worth of a wide variety of U.S. products, including farm equipment, soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars.\n\n\"The entire world is worried about the debate about trade relations between China and, of course, the United States,\" O'Neill said. \"This is a situation that both countries need to sit down and resolve.

(The team has denied it.)\n\nIt\u2019s seems sort of useless to put much thought into this one, if true. Clearly an organization that has been utterly woeful for as long as anyone can remember would be floating ideas meant to change the discussion around it.\n\nThis is not to say that Condoleezza Rice \u2014 the former Secretary of State \u2014 isn\u2019t accomplished. She is, of course. And she\u2019s brilliant. There are few organizations anywhere that wouldn\u2019t be helped by having her apply her time and knowledge to them. She does have sports experience, as she recently chaired the Commission on College Basketball.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t make much sense to want her to work as a coach. True, the job of an NFL head coach is partially CEO. You\u2019re managing assistant coaches who do the intricate work of creating game plans while also dealing with the big personalities of the players charged with carrying those plans out on the field. It\u2019s a management job. Condi Rice can do that.\n\nIt\u2019s also still a football job, and there\u2019s no evidence Rice can \u2014 or wants \u2014 to do that. Bill Belichick, Andy Reid, Sean McVay \u2026. these coaches are succeeding because they study the game endlessly, and find ways to innovate even though it\u2019s just 11 guys on 11 guys, same as it always was. They create mismatches by understanding how their slot guy can get open if the deep safety is forced to look to his left by play action; they further create different mismatches by showing the same look a week later with a different intended result. It\u2019s all in the detail \u2014 and their attention to it puts their players in positions to succeed, which in turn gives those coaches the standing they need to in turn manage those players.\n\nRice could learn those things. She could almost certainly learn them more quickly than the average person. But it would still take time. A lot of time. And there are plenty of women who\u2019ve already put in that time and deserve better jobs in football.\n\nIt\u2019s admirable that Browns general manager John Dorsey is openly saying he\u2019d hire a woman as head coach, but naming this name cheapens the idea. This would be a gimmick hire.\n\nA better thing to do would be finding the women who have already dedicated themselves to football and opening pathways for them to reach this point.\n\nThat means calling Kathryn Smith, who was the first woman to become a full-time assistant coach in the NFL but wasn\u2019t retained by the Bills when Sean McDermott became coach.\n\nOr reaching out to current 49ers assistant Katie Sowers, the second woman to become a full-time NFL assistant \u2014 and only openly gay coach in the league. A former player herself, she\u2019s obviously earned the trust of Kyle Shanahan and her hours of film study with one of the brightest offensive minds in the game would be put to good use in an expanded role.\n\nOr Dorsey could seek out Jen Welter, who broke the gender barrier by joining the Arizona Cardinals for training camp in 2015.\n\nMaybe these women would be interested, maybe they wouldn\u2019t be. But I promise you this much: by talking to them, Dorsey could quickly compile a list of bright, promising women coaches from across the country who aspire to work at the highest levels. That network exists. He can connect with it. And he can make a difference by giving those women chances that they have previously been denied.\n\nThat\u2019s the way forward for women in football, if Dorsey has any real interest in taking it."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Wochit, Wochit, Wochit", "title": "'SNL' host Steve Carell trolls 'Office' fans", "description": "It was a mini-reunion for fans of \"The Office\" on this episode of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Host Steve Carell, who played Michael Scott on the popular show, was pressured by former cast members for a reboot.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/tv/2018/11/18/snl-host-steve-carell-trolls-office-fans/38556775/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/32314a24526b0450fa578b036dd877be10d51f15/c=4-0-1916-1080&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636781298746031079-VPC-SNL-OFFICE-DESK-THUMB.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:42:57Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "William Cummings, USA TODAY", "title": "Fox News host Chris Wallace tells Trump world sees him as 'beacon for repression'", "description": "Fox host tells Trump he's 'beacon for repression'", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/18/trump-fox-news-interview/2047428002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kgw.com/assets/GANNETT/images/3524d297-6758-4080-a1a0-6197eaba41be/3524d297-6758-4080-a1a0-6197eaba41be_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:42:07Z", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Fox News host Chris Wallace went after President Donald Trump for his attacks on the news media in an interview that aired Sunday, telling the president he is \u201cseen around the world as a beacon for repression\u201d because of his rhetoric.

And he told the president that \"leaders in authoritarian countries like Russia, China, Venezuela, now repress the media using your words.\"\n\n\"I can\u2019t talk for other people, I can only talk for me,\" Trump replied.\n\n\"But you\u2019re seen around the world as a beacon for repression,\" Wallace said.\n\nTrump again tried to explain that his attacks on the media were only aimed at coverage he says is false and unfair.\n\nWallace told Trump that the president doesn't \"get to decide what\u2019s fair and what\u2019s not.\"\n\n\"I can tell what\u2019s fair and not and so can my people and so can a lot of other people,\" Trump replied.\n\nWallace said he is on record as saying that he thinks some news coverage of Trump is biased. But he refused to accept Trump's distinction between \"fake news\" and the media as a whole, even as Trump explained to Wallace, \"I\u2019m not calling you that.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re all together,\" Wallace told the president, explaining it didn't matter if he was referring to CNN, The New York Times or Fox News. \"We\u2019re in solidarity, sir.\"\n\nFox News joined other media outlets in filing briefs in support of CNN's lawsuit demanding the return of correspondent Jim Acosta's White House credentials, which were revoked after a heated exchange with the president. A federal judge on Friday ordered Acosta's credentials be returned.\n\n\"It\u2019s fine, I mean it\u2019s not a big deal,\" Trump said of the judge's ruling. He said his administration is now creating a clear list of rules for reporters to follow during White House news conferences.\n\n\"And if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president said he is also considering having the White House news briefings be held off camera. \"Although I\u2019ll probably be sued for that,\" he added.\n\nAt one point in the interview, Wallace asked Trump about the criticism from retired Navy Adm. William McRaven \u2013 a former SEAL who led the operations that hunted down Saddam Hussein and killed Osama bin Laden \u2013 who has called Trump's attacks on the press \"perhaps the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\"\n\nTrump dismissed McRaven as a \"Hillary Clinton fan\" and an \"Obama-backer\" and implied bin Laden should have been caught sooner.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/18/trump-fox-news-interview/2047428002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Kelly Tyko, Guest Editor", "title": "Black Friday 2018: Lowe's sales are on appliances, smart home, and more", "description": "This year, during Lowe's Black Friday sale, you can find great savings on vacuums, power tools, holiday decorations, and more.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/18/black-friday-2018-lowes-sales-appliances-smart-home-and-more/38557137/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38b2e6935d2caa4e96e963348fcbb385c228e98b/c=6-0-2994-1688/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636781364751858276-GettyImages-646823290.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:40:04Z", "content": "Lowe's sticks with tradition by discounting big appliances for Black Friday (Photo: Joe Raedle / Getty Images) Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

They each have eight wins so far and combine to have led almost 34 percent of the year\u2019s total laps.\n\nTruex has the third-best odds (11/4), and Logano \u2014 who previously said he considers himself the favorite since he qualified for the championship event first a few weeks ago \u2014 is fourth (7/2).\n\n\u201cLogano may be just out of reach,\u201d Earnhardt said but, \u201cHe had a pretty good lap late in practice (Friday) that looked like he may be right up there in the middle of the battle.\u201d\n\nThe first-year broadcaster \u2014 who ended his NASCAR Cup Series career at Homestead a year ago \u2014 thinks Logano and the No. 22 Ford team might have a critical advantage over the others.\n\n\u201cOn pit road, Logano has the edge,\u201d Junior continued. \u201cAs far as his pit crew, I think they have the most speed and stability and consistency, so that\u2019ll be helpful to him. And he\u2019ll need every bit of that Sunday night to be able to take these guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, that advantage might only be during caution-flag pit stops. Per NASCAR.com, No. 22 team crew chief \u201cTodd Gordon\u2019s 48.2 percent position retention on green-flag pit cycles is tied for the worst rate among full-time crew chiefs.\u201d\n\nBut Earnhardt also said he saw positives from Truex in practice. The No. 78 Toyota team finished Saturday\u2019s final practice session in second behind Logano.\n\n\u201cTruex showed a little more speed than I thought he was gonna have, so that gives me a little bit more confidence in his opportunity and his chance to win,\u201d Earnhardt added."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Kim Willis, USA TODAY", "title": "Kate McKinnon spoofs Fox News' Laura Ingraham, voter fraud and 'feel facts' on 'SNL'", "description": "'Saturday Night Live' went all in on conspiracy theories, \"feel facts\" and Fox News in Kate McKinnon's opening, in which she played Laura Ingraham.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/18/snl-kate-mckinnon-spoofs-fox-news-laura-ingraham-feel-facts/2047637002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8c8f234469696ee0daf83dc0b9ba9df75ff3fc4b/c=0-249-4736-2925/local/-/media/2018/04/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636604334034499332-AP-2018-CinemaCon---Big-Screen-Achievement-Awards-99471727.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:25:04Z", "content": "It was a mini-reunion for fans of \"The Office\" on this episode of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Host Steve Carell, who played Michael Scott on the popular show, was pressured by former cast members for a reboot.

This experience has been possible only because I wanted to stop using alcohol and drugs. When the pain of using became worse than the pain of not using, I was finally willing to do something about my problem. This willingness led me to a rehabilitation program where I received effective education about addiction, personal and group therapy, and introduction to Twelve Step recovery programs. Even as my mind slowly cleared, it became evident that people who wanted to stay clean went to meetings \u2014 regularly. I also learned that there is a great disparity between people who need recovery and those who want recovery.\n\nThe bottom line is: I was, and still am, willing to do whatever it takes to stay drug and alcohol-free. However, I\u2019m one of very few who chose this path.\n\nI\u2019ve been to enough funerals to remind me that addiction takes no prisoners; it kills. Until I find a methodology that brings me more peace of mind and comfort in my heart, I\u2019ll keep coming back to the meetings.\n\nRon Bikacsan; Nashville, Tenn.\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nAs a 35-year hepatologist (liver specialist) and a 20-year recovering alcoholic, I can say there\u2019s no proven medical treatment for alcoholism, only sedative use for easing withdrawal. Psychiatrists have no patience, interest or success in using individual therapy for alcoholics. No form of psychotherapy has been proven to be effective. Group experience, i.e. Alcoholics Anonymous and residential treatment centers have very good results. Using 5 to 10 percent success rate as a measure of Twelve Step success is misconception. That includes those who are sent by the courts, dragged there by families and told to go by employers. Nobody will have success when forced to go. The success rate of someone who wants to get better, can be honest about their issues, and has the opportunity to be in an residential 90-day program followed by regular AA meetings will likely do well.

Trump simply chose to skip this event due to apathy, and only after taking a little heat does he now choose a convenient scapegoat \u2014 his own Secret Service! Unbelievable.\n\nNotice how Trump never steps up to accept responsability? The buck never stops with this finger-pointing commander in chief. When the stock market goes up, he claims all the credit. When it falls, he quickly blames others. As a veteran, I cannot respect this phony draft dodger who couldn\u2019t care less for fallen heroes \u2014 or veterans, for that matter.

Even as other groups have won the right to vote and hold office, white men have continued to hold a monopoly on political power. The question, whether Americans will have elected leaders who reflect their own life experiences is urgent. The midterm elections marked a historic, if incomplete, shift in the power structure. Across the country, women of all races were on the ballot in record-breaking numbers.\n\nMore women than ever before will serve in Congress and state legislatures starting in January. Yet these victories also remind us how difficult it is to challenge the system that zealously defends the white male status quo. The demographics of Senate will remain largely unchanged. America is changing.

It came four months after England lost by the same score to Croatia in its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years.\n\nCroatian players have said since July that they were inspired by the perceived arrogance of the \"Football's Coming Home\" lyric in the \"Three Lions\" team anthem.\n\nThe song was played immediately after the final whistle at Wembley Stadium where Croatia won 11 years ago to deny England a trip to the 2008 European Championship.\n\nAndrej Kramaric scored 12 minutes into the second half to put Croatia up, but Kane set up substitute Jesse Lingard's equalizer in the 78th. The Tottenham striker netted the winner with a sliding kick seven minutes later for his first goal for England since the round of 16 at the World Cup and clinch top spot in Group A4.\n\nThe Nations League Final Four tournament will be played in June in Portugal. The other two finalists will be Belgium or Switzerland and France or the Netherlands.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They each have eight wins so far and combine to have led almost 34 percent of the year\u2019s total laps.\n\nTruex has the third-best odds (11/4), and Logano \u2014 who previously said he considers himself the favorite since he qualified for the championship event first a few weeks ago \u2014 is fourth (7/2).\n\n\u201cLogano may be just out of reach,\u201d Earnhardt said but, \u201cHe had a pretty good lap late in practice (Friday) that looked like he may be right up there in the middle of the battle.\u201d\n\nThe first-year broadcaster \u2014 who ended his NASCAR Cup Series career at Homestead a year ago \u2014 thinks Logano and the No. 22 Ford team might have a critical advantage over the others.\n\n\u201cOn pit road, Logano has the edge,\u201d Junior continued. \u201cAs far as his pit crew, I think they have the most speed and stability and consistency, so that\u2019ll be helpful to him. And he\u2019ll need every bit of that Sunday night to be able to take these guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, that advantage might only be during caution-flag pit stops. Per NASCAR.com, No. 22 team crew chief \u201cTodd Gordon\u2019s 48.2 percent position retention on green-flag pit cycles is tied for the worst rate among full-time crew chiefs.\u201d\n\nBut Earnhardt also said he saw positives from Truex in practice. The No. 78 Toyota team finished Saturday\u2019s final practice session in second behind Logano.\n\n\u201cTruex showed a little more speed than I thought he was gonna have, so that gives me a little bit more confidence in his opportunity and his chance to win,\u201d Earnhardt added."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, George Schroeder, USA TODAY", "title": "College Football Playoff Projection: Notre Dame aces another test, while others devour cupcakes", "description": "While other contenders devoured cupcakes, Notre Dame aced a test.

Well, maybe you see why coaches hate playing triple-option teams.\n\nAnyway, Cupcake Saturday is finished, and we\u2019re all \u2013 this no doubt includes Saban \u2013 glad to have gotten through it.\n\nThere was actually a big showdown scheduled at Yankee Stadium. But then Notre Dame treated Syracuse like those SEC teams treated their FCS victims. The takeaway is pretty simple: It is long past time to acknowledge Notre Dame is really good, y\u2019all. Get ready for Notre Dame in your final Football Four.\n\nAlso, we know the Pac-12 has been declared out of this race, but Washington State sure looks like a contender to be seriously considered, huh?\n\nAs always, remember we pick the bracket as if the season was over.*\n\nFootball Four\n\n1. Alabama \u2013 Alabama was tied at halftime with The Citadel, and it might have been a very good thing for the Crimson Tide. Yeah, the Tide won 50-17 \u2013 but this way, Saban actually has a reason to get on his guys as they head into the Iron Bowl.\n\n2. Clemson \u2013 The Tigers started slow, then turned it on for another blowout. Bad news for opponents (and potential Playoff opponents): Clemson\u2019s defense seems to get better each week. Duke had 127 first-quarter yards, then 135 in the next three.\n\n3. Notre Dame \u2013 Another week of \u2018maybe finally these guys will\u2019 ... only Notre Dame won\u2019t lose. Not even close. The Irish dominated Syracuse 36-3 \u2013 holding the Orange 41 points below their scoring average \u2013 to move to 11-0. The only remaining obstacle is a 5-6 USC bunch that just lost to 3-8 UCLA.\n\n4. Michigan \u2013 The Wolverines seemed sluggish \u2013 they trailed at halftime \u2013 but outlasted Indiana, setting up a showdown in Columbus with archrival Ohio State for the Big Ten East crown.\n\nFour More**\n\n5. Georgia \u2013 Hard to glean much from a game against UMass, but Georgia did what it was supposed to against an outmanned bunch. After the glorified scrimmage, the Bulldogs face Georgia Tech. Get through that, and the SEC championship game will be a de facto Playoff quarterfinal.\n\n6. Oklahoma \u2013 Kyler Murray is special \u2013 and it\u2019s a very good thing for Oklahoma, because its defense is especially bad. The Sooners beat Kansas 55-40 but let the Jayhawks run free (especially Pooka Williams). They might have been a little flat after that Bedlam victory -- but their defensive issues remain very real and alarming. Now comes a trip to West Virginia on Black Friday.\n\n7. Washington State \u2013 Yeah, yeah, we know: The Pac-12 is out of it. But Washington State sure looks good \u2013 a 55-point first half (FIFTY-FIVE!!!) against Arizona \u2013 and the Rose Bowl would be nice, huh? If the Cougs can win the Apple Cup \u2013 never an easy deal \u2013 they\u2019ll head to the Pac-12 title game.\n\n8. UCF \u2013 The Knights got all that fun, free publicity with \"College GameDay\" in town, then gave up a fumble-touchdown on the first series. And from there it was all UCF. A great night for the, uh, defending national champions.\n\nA Few More After That***\n\nOhio State \u2013 Why aren\u2019t the Buckeyes in the top eight? Did you watch that narrow, oh-so-lucky escape (52-51 in OT) at Maryland? Urban Meyer did, and every second of it seemed agonizing. Ohio State gets its shot to win the Big Ten East against Michigan \u2013 but its defense Saturday (and for most of the season) does not provide much reason for optimism.\n\nUtah State \u2013 The ol\u2019 illegal touching rule bailed out the Aggies, who gave up a hail-mary touchdown on the game\u2019s final play at Colorado State, only to learn \u2013 phew! \u2013 the receiver had gone out of bounds. Next up, they\u2019ll take their 10-game winning streak to Boise State.\n\nLSU \u2013 Cupcake week meant Rice \u2013 which had lost 10 consecutive games \u2013 visiting Tiger Stadium. Make that 11 in a row. LSU remains on track to get to a New Year\u2019s Six bowl.\n\nWest Virginia \u2013 The Mountaineers\u2019 Playoff hopes went bust; Oklahoma State popped \u2018em in a thriller in Stillwater. But West Virginia has Oklahoma at home on Black Friday, with Big 12 title hopes alive.\n\nTexas \u2013 The Longhorns dominated Iowa State and now need only to beat Kansas (yeah, we know) to reach the Big 12 championship game.\n\nFutile Four****\n\nUSC \u2013 Losing to UCLA is never a good thing for USC. This time, it might be the end for Clay Helton as the Trojans fell to 5-6 ahead of a date with No. 3 Notre Dame. For USC fans, there\u2019s this disconcerting question: If Chip Kelly\u2019s first UCLA team \u2013 which is now 3-8 \u2013 can win the Crosstown Clash, what happens in a couple of years?\n\nColorado \u2013 On Oct. 6, Colorado beat Arizona State to move to 5-0. After a 30-7 home loss Saturday to Utah, the Buffs are 5-6 and coach Mike MacIntyre is out; the school announced his dismissal early Sunday afternoon. \u201cYou all saw the program before I got here,\u201d MacIntyre told reporters Saturday after the loss. \u201cIt was abysmal.\u201d What is it now? Wherever the Buffs are headed, a new coach will be taking them.\n\nTennessee \u2013 Remember last week, when the Vols stuffed Kentucky? Yeah, good times. This week, though ... sigh. Missouri whipped Tennessee 50-17. Derek Dooley returned to Neyland Stadium as Missouri\u2019s play-caller and called some nice plays. Now the Vols play Vanderbilt with a bowl berth for the winner.\n\nVirginia Tech \u2013 After a 38-14 loss to Miami, the Hokies are 4-6. They\u2019ve lost four in a row, and four in a row at home. To get to a bowl game, they\u2019ve got to beat Virginia and then add a game Dec. 1 (a game with East Carolina was canceled because of Hurricane Florence); reports have Marshall lined up, but only if it\u2019s needed for a shot at a bowl. Things are not good at all in Blacksburg.\n\n* The season is not over.\n\n** Don\u2019t be worried that your team sits just outside the cut. This is a weekly snapshot.

(AP Photo/David Graham) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Joey Logano raced into NASCAR anointed as its next star. He was 18, dubbed \"Sliced Bread\" because of all the hype, and in way over his head.\n\nIt made Logano an easy target on and off the track and threatened his career. Logano was out of a job five years after he arrived but given a second chance by Roger Penske, the titans of motorsports.\n\nNow he's part of Penske's storied history as NASCAR's newest champion.\n\nThe underdog on paper but the favorite in his mind, Logano busted up The Big Three and won an improbable first NASCAR title by soundly beating a trio of former champions. Logano won the season finale Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway to grab the Cup title in a season in which he barely contended until the playoffs began.\n\nThe year was dominated by Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr., with Logano calling the championship field \"The Big Three and Me.\"\n\nBut Logano kicked it into another gear during the playoffs with two victories and eight top-10 finishes in the postseason. He led a race-high 80 laps but the title was slipping away in the waning laps until Team Penske teammate Brad Keselowski spun Busch teammate Daniel Suarez for a race-changing caution.\n\nHe was fourth on the restart with 15 laps remaining but powered his way alongside leader Truex, used a strong move in the outside lane three laps later to take over the top spot, and Logano pulled away to win for Penske.\n\n\"We were the favorite. We executed down the stretch like nobody's business,\" Logano said. \"I knew we had a short-run car. I said it before the race started that if it was anything longer than 25 laps we were going to be in trouble. That showed all day. But it came down to the short run and we are champions. NASCAR champions.\"\n\nLogano won the title in his 10th season at NASCAR's top level, six years after Penske rescued him from the unemployment line.\n\nHe started with Joe Gibbs Racing as a teenager, made his debut days after his 18th birthday and was pushed into the Cup Series prematurely when Gibbs needed a replacement driver for Tony Stewart.\n\nWhen Logano didn't deliver for Gibbs he was grabbed by Penske, who won got his first Cup title in 2012 with Keselowski, the driver who pushed for Logano to be hired as his new teammate.\n\n\"I think when it's time to go, he's the guy,\" Penske said. \"I couldn't ask for a better result and a guy that delivers it for the whole team.\"\n\nGibbs, who saw his former driver beat current driver Busch for the title, was pleased for Logano.\n\n\"I think it's great for them and Joey,\" Gibbs said. \"Great kid, great family. I'm sure he's going to make a great champion.\"\n\nLogano's title closes a banner year for Penske.\n\nPenske also this season was elected into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, won the Indianapolis 500 for a record 17th time and celebrated Team Penske's 500th victory as an organization.\n\n\"Every time I think about how we succeed and how we can be better, one thing is 'What's your brand?'\" Penske said. \"This kind of winning, not only on the racetrack but in business, drives a great Penske brand.\"\n\nTeam Penske also has been the cornerstone for Ford the last six seasons, and Logano gave the manufacturer its first Cup title since 2004.\n\nNASCAR's final weekend concluded with three new champions from three different teams representing all three manufacturers. Brett Moffitt won the Truck Series title in a Toyota for Hattori Racing, Tyler Reddick won the Xfinity Series title in a Chevrolet for JR Motorsports, and Ford finally got a title on what is officially called \"Ford Championship Weekend.\"\n\nLogano screamed so hard when he crossed the finish line that he later joked he thought he pulled a muscle. Then he explained how far he's come from a kid in Connecticut who showed so much talent so young that Hall of Famer Mark Martin stamped him NASCAR's next superstar when Logano was around 15 years old.\n\nNow he's 28, a 10-year veteran at NASCAR's top level, and a champion in the second act of his career.\n\n\"I'm the kid who every single time I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up I said 'A NASCAR champion.' I said it every single time,\" Logano said. \"Not a lot of kids in Connecticut say that.\"\n\nTruex finished second in his final race with Furniture Row Racing. The team is closing because it lost its primary sponsor midway through Truex's championship reign.\n\n\"It's a tough way to lose,\" Truex said. \"I had nothing for him at the end. That's just the way it goes. I don't know what else to say. It hurts a little, and I'm going to miss all of the guys.\"\n\nHarvick was third and Busch fourth as the title contenders followed each other across the finish line.\n\n\"We weren't even close,\" said Busch, who used strategy to keep up with the other title contenders.\n\n\"We were so bad tonight on the racetrack and on pit road that nothing was kind of going our way. So it was just not all there the way that we needed it to, and sometimes it all falls into place and falls your way, and other times you've got to be able to go out there and go earn it, and we didn't have either.\"\n\nIn fact, Busch's crew had one of its worst races of the year on pit road as the front-tire changer had hiccups on two stops. It negated any advantage Busch gained when team owner Gibbs forced Denny Hamlin not to take the first pit stall and leave it open so Busch would have an easier exit back on the track. But he lost six positions during one stop, four in another, and his team had to gamble on strategy to stay in contention.\n\nIt was Busch who said losing the title would be most disappointing if it went to Logano because Logano wasn't in the same league as the Big Three all season. But Logano was adamant he was the favorite, in part because he wasn't even supposed to make the final four after just one regular season victory. Busch and Harvick ended the season with eight wins each, while Truex had four.\n\n\"Lots of wins,\" Busch said. \"Forget about it now, move on.\"\n\nThe title is redemption for Logano, who could have washed out of the sport when Gibbs cut him from the team. But he reinvented himself under Penske and became comfortable as an aggressive driver, even when it cost him.\n\nLogano was the favorite to win the 2015 title but missed the finale because a feud with Matt Kenseth cost him on the track. He was the championship runner-up in 2016, and a penalty kept his No. 22 out of last season's playoffs.\n\nLogano this season had to move Truex out of his way in the final turn at Martinsville Speedway last month to earn his berth in the championship race. Logano was criticized for his aggressiveness, and Truex promised he'd prevent Logano from winning the Cup, but Logano insisted he made the necessary move to win a championship.\n\nAnd in the final 15-lap shootout to the finish, Logano simply drove around the outside of Truex and pulled away. If Truex had any intention of stopping Logano he had to catch him first, he couldn't and finished 1.725 seconds behind.\n\nLogano's third win came at Homestead, where the champion has won the race to win the title since this format was introduced in 2014. He's NASCAR's 33rd champion and first from Connecticut.\n\nTeam Penske also won the owners' championship\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: SAEED KHAN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWorld leaders meeting for Asia-Pacific trade talks in Papua New Guinea wrapped up a divisive, two-day summit Sunday after failing to agree on a group statement amid a widening rift in U.S.-China relations.\n\nPapua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill said he will release a \"chairman's statement\" in the next few days on behalf of the 21-nation gathering. O'Neill acknowledged that \"the entire world is worried\" about tensions between the two superpowers.\n\nThe struggle to find common ground did not bode well for a crucial meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping scheduled for the G-20 meeting in Argentina at month's end.\n\nTrump was conspicuously absent from the Asia gathering, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. Pence and Xi swapped barbs, setting a contentious tone for trade talks involving 60 percent of the world economy.\n\nO'Neill said the talks broke down over language about the World Trade Organization. The U.S. has adamantly opposed the way WTO treats China as a market-driven economy rather than one dominated by state-supported industries.\n\nThe same, sharp differences that have crippled trade between the two nations also made working out common language for a communique impossible, O'Neill concluded.\n\n\"There were two big giants in the room, what can I say,\" O'Neill said.\n\nIn his speech to the group, Xi urged the business and political leaders to promote free trade.\n\n\"The world today is going through major development, transformation and change,\" Xi told the group. \"While economic globalization surges forward, global growth is shadowed by protectionism and unilateralism.\"\n\nPence pitched that the United States offered nations in the region a better option for economic partnership and criticized Chinese \u201cauthoritarianism and aggression.\u201d He said the U.S. seeks \"collaboration and not control\" and blasted a Chinese road-building program as forcing debt on poorer neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe don't drown our partners in a sea of debt, we don't coerce or compromise your independence,\" Pence said. \"The United States deals openly and fairly. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d\n\nMore: Mike Pence challenges China at Asia-Pacific economic summit\n\nMore: Pence expected to take tough line on China as he heads to Asia\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry denied leading developing nations into debt bondage.\n\n\u201cThe assistance provided by China has been warmly welcomed by our partners in this region and beyond,\u201d responded Wang Xiaolong, a foreign ministry official.\n\nAfter the summit, Pence tweeted: \"Every nation gathered here at APEC has a place in @POTUS\u2019 vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Our vision excludes no one. We only ask that nations respect their neighbors\u2019 sovereignty, embrace free, fair, and reciprocal trade, and uphold individual rights.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods. The administration also has warned that duties on another $267 billion in goods could be coming, which would subject to tariff virtually all Chinese-made products shipped into the U.S.\n\nChina retaliated by levying tariffs on $110 billion worth of a wide variety of U.S. products, including farm equipment, soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars.\n\n\"The entire world is worried about the debate about trade relations between China and, of course, the United States,\" O'Neill said. \"This is a situation that both countries need to sit down and resolve. And I believe that the G20 meeting that is going to be held very shortly will be an opportune time.\"\n\nContributing: Thomas Maresca; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/18/china-trade-entire-world-worried-after-rancorous-trade-summit/2047287002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Wochit, Wochit, Wochit", "title": "'SNL' host Steve Carell trolls 'Office' fans", "description": "It was a mini-reunion for fans of \"The Office\" on this episode of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Host Steve Carell, who played Michael Scott on the popular show, was pressured by former cast members for a reboot.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2018/11/18/snl-host-steve-carell-trolls-office-fans/38556775/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/32314a24526b0450fa578b036dd877be10d51f15/c=4-0-1916-1080&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636781298746031079-VPC-SNL-OFFICE-DESK-THUMB.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:36:19Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz, USA TODAY", "title": "Lamar Jackson to start in place of injured Joe Flacco, per reports", "description": "With their postseason hopes fading, the Ravens will turn to Lamar Jackson to make his first start at QB against the Bengals.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/ravens/2018/11/18/baltimore-ravens-lamar-jackson-start-place-joe-flacco/2047555002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/18/USAT/7c865bf5-1d69-439a-88ab-5360f8b32804-USATSI_11304489.jpg?crop=5083,2859,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:32:17Z", "content": "Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson (8) warms up prior to a game against the Denver Broncos at M&amp;T Bank Stadium.

USA TODAY\n\nTravelers walk under a sign reading \"Happy Thanksgiving'' at LaGuardia Airport in New York, on Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2013. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP)\n\nJoining the throngs of travelers boarding a plane this holiday season? If you haven't been on a plane since last year's Thanksgiving or Christmas getaway, a mixed bag of airline changes await. Among the bad news: Baggage fees are higher. On the positive side: You'll find more free in-flight entertainment and instant messaging.\n\nHere are six things infrequent fliers need to know before heading to the airport this holiday season:\n\n1. Baggage fees are higher on most major airlines: JetBlue Airways started the trend in August, boosting fees by $5 to $30 for the first bag and $40 for the second bag. American, Delta, United and others soon followed. There are a few ways to dodge them. Southwest Airlines is the only U.S. airline to allow two free checked bags.\n\n2. No frills basic economy tickets are now a thing on several airlines, and they come with heavy restrictions: United, for example, doesn't let basic economy passengers bring a standard carry-on bag. (American and Delta do.) Show up at the gate with one and you'll pay a minimum of $55 plus your bag will be checked, not brought on board. Check it at the ticket counter for normal baggage fees. Basic economy fliers on United, Delta and American also board last and get last-minute seat assignments. That means family members will likely be separated. Bottom line: check your ticket before you get to the airport to avoid any nasty surprises.\n\nCLOSE American Airlines is getting rid of an unpopular policy after pushback. Beginning September 5th, the carrier will allow passengers buying its \"basic economy\" tickets to bring a free carry-on bag and not just a personal item that fits under the seat in front of them. Buzz60\n\n3. Those in-flight alcoholic beverages will cost you a little more: Southwest raised its drink prices in March, and American Airlines boosted its drink prices in October. And, no, you can't save money by bringing your own minibottles of booze. That's against FAA regulations.\n\n4. Airlines are offering more free in-flight entertainment: American Airlines recently added free live TV on more than 100 planes, joining Delta, Southwest and JetBlue, among others. And Southwest Airlines just nixed its $5 charge for movies, joining Delta and American, which have offered free in-flight movies since 2016. The entertainment is offered on seatback screens or travelers' personal electronic devices, so check with your airline before you go and make sure your devices are charged and your headphones are in your carry-on bag.\n\n5. Staying in touch is cheaper, too: No, Wi-Fi prices haven't gone down. But some airlines are allowing free instant messaging through apps including iMessage, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. (Options vary by carrier). Southwest eliminated its $2 messaging fee in September, joining Delta and Alaska. United Airlines offers free messaging on some flights.\n\n6. Airline peanuts are becoming an endangered species: Southwest Airlines, which carries more passengers within the U.S. than any airline, eliminated the salty snack on Aug. 1 due to concerns about passenger peanut allergies. Delta is the only major airline still serving peanuts in economy class.\n\nCLOSE The next time you take a flight, your snack options may be pretzels or\u2026pretzels. That is, if you\u2019re flying Southwest, because they\u2019re getting rid of pre-packaged peanuts.

(AP) \u2014 Michigan showed off its offensive versatility and a relentless defense in winning this weekend's Air Force Reserve Tip-Off tournament.\n\nIgnas Brazdeikis scored 20 points to lead the 18th-ranked Wolverines to a 66-47 victory over Providence in Sunday's championship game.\n\nJon Teske added 17 points for Michigan (5-0), which was coming off blow-out wins away from home on Wednesday over No. 8 Villanova (73-46) and on Saturday in this tournament against George Washington (84-61).\n\nThe Wolverines made 15 3-pointers against the Colonials, but were just 6 of 18 from behind the arc on Sunday.\n\nThey found success down low in a more physical matchup with the Friars. They outscored Providence 32-22 in the paint, with Brazdeikis and Teske converting 14 of their 24 shots.\n\n\"It just kind of happened,\" Teske said. \"Our offense runs inside-out or outside-in. We were just trying to play within the game. They found me down low a couple of times. We were just moving the ball and sharing the ball. When we do that, a lot of shots fall.\"\n\nThe game was close until Michigan closed the first half on a 14-2 run and went into intermission up 35-22. Consecutive 3-pointers from Isaiah Livers pushed the lead to 44-29 early in the second half and the Wolverines pulled away late.\n\nProvidence concentrated on taking away Charles Matthews and Jordan Poole, who combined for 47 points in Michigan's semifinal win. The pair had just five and four points respectively on Sunday.\n\nSo the Wolverines went elsewhere. Livers finished with eight points and six rebounds.\n\n\"We're going to take what people give us,\" said Michigan coach John Beilein. \"Whether it's zone or man, we've seen everything. We're just trying to make the next play. Jordan Poole and Charles Matthews had great nights last night as far as scoring. They had great nights tonight, not in scoring but other areas. Jon didn't score last night. That's the way our great teams have been built.\"\n\nDavid Duke had 12 points for Providence (3-2), which was held to just 28 percent shooting by a Michigan defense that has given up an average of 47 points per game.\n\nProvidence made just two of 18 shots from 3-point range. Their 22 points down low also was a season low.\n\n\"It's not like we played the Sisters of the Poor today,\" said Providence coach Ed Cooley. \"We played against an unbelievable, well coached, well balanced team and we'll benefit from this in the long run.\"\n\nIn the other game, South Carolina routed George Washington 90-55.\n\nSouth Carolina's Chris Silva came out of a shoulder harness that he'd been wearing since the preseason and came out of his shell against George Washington.\n\nSilva scored 20 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Gamecocks in the consolation game of the Air Force Reserve Tip-Off tournament.\n\nCoach Frank Martin said Silva had been wearing the harness since hurting his left rotator cuff in a preseason scrimmage against Virginia Tech. The 6-9 senior hadn't been in double digits since a 13-point effort against USC Upstate in the Gamecocks opener.\n\n\"It was good to see him play like that,\" said Martin. \"He played aggressive today. He played with confidence offensively and defensively and no surprise, he stayed out of foul trouble.\"\n\nA.J. Lawson added 19 points and nine boards for the Gamecocks (3-2), who put the game away early against the winless Colonials (0-5).\n\nSouth Carolina scored the first 18 points, capped by a 3-pointer from Tre Campbell less than 5 minutes into the game. He was 3-for-3 from behind the arc in first half.\n\nA 3-pointer by Lawson seven minutes later pushed the lead to 40-6. The Gamecocks went into halftime up 56-18 and cruised after intermission, leading by as many as 42 points.\n\nSilva said the team was pleased with how his team bounced back from Saturday's loss to Providence, a game which the Gamecocks led by as many as nine points in the second half.\n\n\"Our team is young,\" Silva said. \"These games allow us to grow up and learn.\"\n\nTerry Nolan Jr. led George Washington with 13 points. The Colonials shot 28 percent from the field, including just four baskets on 27 shots in the first half, when the game was decided.\n\n\"We're disappointed where we're at,\" said coach Maurice Joseph. \"There's no dancing around that. We're 0-for-5. We have to own that but we have to look at the things that got us to this point. We've got to get better.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I\u2019m thankful a divided Congress can\u2019t pass anything any too radical. Stocks love legislative quiet. This is one big reason stocks consistently are positive in any president\u2019s third year \u2013 every time since 1939 \u2013 indicating a bullish 2019. Plus, so many senators, as potential presidential candidates, are already self-obsessed and launching campaigns. So they will spend precious little time on legislation \u2013 which soon becomes church-mouse quiet. Stocks should shine.\n\n\u2022 Growth: I\u2019m thankful for our strong economy, with so many more folks having jobs. Many are surely grateful for wages inching higher. Investors no doubt love corporate profits jumping despite higher wage costs. And for strong, rising corporate revenues \u2013 a sign profit growth isn\u2019t just some temporary sugar high from 2017 tax cuts.\n\n\u2022 Hope for Europe: Thankfully the European Central Bank will soon stop its stupid, so-called quantitative easing, or QE bond purchase, letting interest rates return to normality.

Their new research shows combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy can boost survival rates for various cancers. Medical breakthroughs such as these do wonders for public health and lengthening life spans.

Consider Europe, where most country cultures are much older than ours but their governments much younger and continuously less stable.

Lewis should play a big role in this week\u2019s matchup against the Colts, who struggled against the short-passing game last week.\n\nAs cliche as it sounds, getting the ball to the best playmakers in space is going to be vital in this matchup. Lewis is an extremely shifty running back that can make defenders look silly in the open-field.\n\nLewis will likely be matched up with Colts rookie linebacker Darius Leonard, who has been off to an impressive start to his young career. Leonard is leading the Colts with 97 tackles and four sacks through the teams first nine games.\n\nWith the Colts struggling last week to stop running backs in the passing game, this will be one of the most intriguing matchups to watch on Sunday afternoon.\n\nIf the Titans are able to get Lewis out in space with swing routes, screens or off tackle runs, the Colts could have a difficult time on the defensive side of the ball."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 16 Virginia Tech faces No. 23 Purdue in Charleston final", "description": "No. 16 Virginia Tech and No. 23 Purdue to square off for Charleston Classic championship", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/18/no-16-virginia-tech-faces-no-23-purdue-in-charleston-final/38556895/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T14:47:32Z", "content": "CHARLESTON, S.C.

USA TODAY\n\nTravelers walk under a sign reading \"Happy Thanksgiving'' at LaGuardia Airport in New York, on Tuesday, Nov. 26, 2013. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP)\n\nJoining the throngs of travelers boarding a plane this holiday season? If you haven't been on a plane since last year's Thanksgiving or Christmas getaway, a mixed bag of airline changes await. Among the bad news: Baggage fees are higher. On the positive side: You'll find more free in-flight entertainment and instant messaging.\n\nHere are six things infrequent fliers need to know before heading to the airport this holiday season:\n\n1. Baggage fees are higher on most major airlines: JetBlue Airways started the trend in August, boosting fees by $5 to $30 for the first bag and $40 for the second bag. American, Delta, United and others soon followed. There are a few ways to dodge them. Southwest Airlines is the only U.S. airline to allow two free checked bags.\n\n2. No frills basic economy tickets are now a thing on several airlines, and they come with heavy restrictions: United, for example, doesn't let basic economy passengers bring a standard carry-on bag. (American and Delta do.) Show up at the gate with one and you'll pay a minimum of $55 plus your bag will be checked, not brought on board. Check it at the ticket counter for normal baggage fees. Basic economy fliers on United, Delta and American also board last and get last-minute seat assignments. That means family members will likely be separated. Bottom line: check your ticket before you get to the airport to avoid any nasty surprises.\n\nCLOSE American Airlines is getting rid of an unpopular policy after pushback. Beginning September 5th, the carrier will allow passengers buying its \"basic economy\" tickets to bring a free carry-on bag and not just a personal item that fits under the seat in front of them. Buzz60\n\n3. Those in-flight alcoholic beverages will cost you a little more: Southwest raised its drink prices in March, and American Airlines boosted its drink prices in October. And, no, you can't save money by bringing your own minibottles of booze. That's against FAA regulations.\n\n4. Airlines are offering more free in-flight entertainment: American Airlines recently added free live TV on more than 100 planes, joining Delta, Southwest and JetBlue, among others. And Southwest Airlines just nixed its $5 charge for movies, joining Delta and American, which have offered free in-flight movies since 2016. The entertainment is offered on seatback screens or travelers' personal electronic devices, so check with your airline before you go and make sure your devices are charged and your headphones are in your carry-on bag.\n\n5. Staying in touch is cheaper, too: No, Wi-Fi prices haven't gone down. But some airlines are allowing free instant messaging through apps including iMessage, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. (Options vary by carrier). Southwest eliminated its $2 messaging fee in September, joining Delta and Alaska. United Airlines offers free messaging on some flights.\n\n6. Airline peanuts are becoming an endangered species: Southwest Airlines, which carries more passengers within the U.S. than any airline, eliminated the salty snack on Aug. 1 due to concerns about passenger peanut allergies. Delta is the only major airline still serving peanuts in economy class.\n\nCLOSE The next time you take a flight, your snack options may be pretzels or\u2026pretzels. That is, if you\u2019re flying Southwest, because they\u2019re getting rid of pre-packaged peanuts.

Reed, the joint overnight leader, could not find a birdie until the 10th hole and made two bogeys on the front nine to take the pressure off his playing partner.\n\nBogeys on the 10th and 12th holes opened the door for his rivals, but he steadied the nerves and bounced back with three birdies in four holes starting on the 14th.\n\n\"We got off to a flying start and everything seemed rosy in the camp.

USA TODAY\n\nThe cineplex is magical again.\n\n\"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Gindelwald\" hit theaters this weekend, bringing another chapter from J.K. Rowling's \"Wizarding World\" to screens, now with 100% more Dumbledore (played by Jude Law as a younger version of the headmaster of Hogwarts).\n\nAnd while the new film may not be quite as fantastic as the first, it's a perfect excuse to revisit the original \"Harry Potter\" movies. Here are five \"Wizarding\" films to watch before you see \"Crimes of Grindelwald,\" or if you just feel like spending time with Harry, Ron and Hermione again.\n\nIf you can't remember who Grindelwald is: 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' Parts 1 and 2\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is shown in a scene from 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.' (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nThe villain of \"Crimes of Grindelwald\" is, you guessed it, a guy named Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). If you've seen the first \"Fantastic Beasts\" movie, you were introduced to the character and his devious ways, but if you want the full background on him and how he is defeated (the \"Fantastic Beasts\" films are prequels, after all), watch or re-watch the last two \"Potter\" films. It's in these films that we learn about Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship as teens.\n\nRent or buy them on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.\n\nIf you don't know how this connects to Harry Potter at all: 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'\n\nNewt (Eddie Redmayne) and Tina (Katherine Waterston) are fugitives on a mission in 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.' (Photo: Jaap Buitendijk)\n\nEven the most devoted \"Potter\" fan might have trouble getting into the new film without watching the original \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" The 2016 film introduced us to Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), his allies and the 1920s-era Wizarding World, where the threat of Grindelwald looms large.\n\nRent or buy it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.\n\nIf you want to feel old: 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'\n\nHedwig, the owl, and Daniel Radcliffe in a scene from the motion picture \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\" (Photo: PETER MOUNTAIN, WARNER BROS.)\n\nWhen the very first \"Potter\" film hit theaters, George W. Bush was president, there were no smartphones and Redmayne was only 19 years old. It's been 17 years since Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint suited up in the Hogwarts robes for the first time, and revisiting \"Sorcerer's Stone\" will make you both nostalgic for the early \"Potter\" years and thankful that CGI has so vastly improved since that movie used it to create a terrible-looking centaur.\n\nRent or buy it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.\n\nIf you want the best of the best: 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'\n\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe, left) leads fellow students in a meeting of Dumbledore's Army, a student-run resistance organization, in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.\" (Photo: Murray Close, Warner Bros)\n\nNo offense to the devotees of \"Prisoner of Azkaban,\" but the best \"Potter\" film of all is based on the worst book: \"Order of the Phoenix.\" None of Rowling's books can really be called \"bad,\" but compared to the other six novels, \"Phoenix\" is a bit overstuffed and more tiresome. But with a zippy adaptation that excises all the books flaws, director David Yates (who directed the subsequent \"Potter\" films and both \"Fantastic Beasts\") turned the black sheep of the \"Potter\" series into a shockingly strong film.\n\nRent or buy it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/18/fantastic-beasts-crimes-grindelwald-watch-these-5-harry-potter-films-first/1975243002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY", "title": "What to do about scooters?

Giants vs. Buccaneers: Staff picks and predictions Before we look \u2026 [+2820 chars]", "fulltext": "Earlier this week, Football Outsiders compiled their list of the NFL\u2019s top 25 prospects based on very specific criteria, and it just so happens that two New York Giants rookies made the cut.\n\nBefore we look into which two Giants made the list and why they were selected, here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the FO restrictions:\n\nThird-round pick or lower, or undrafted, from the classes of 2016 to 2018\n\n500 or fewer offensive or defensive career snaps through Week 10 of 2018 (except running backs, with a maximum of 300 snaps)\n\nNo signed contract extension\n\nAge 26 or younger\n\nUnder those guidelines, the first Giants rookie named to the list was linebacker Lorenzo Carter, who checked in at No. 8 overall.\n\nWhen the Giants snagged Carter in the third round, they were making a bet on tools over production. Carter\u2019s 4.5 40-yard dash and explosive results in the vertical and broad-jump metrics made him someone who fit the NFL mold of a top edge rusher. The result at Georgia? Not so much. Carter had just 14 sacks despite serious playing time in all four seasons with the Bulldogs. Our SackSEER projection system took the middle ground, projecting him for 18.3 sacks in his first four seasons on the basis of the athleticism. Carter\u2019s early returns have been pretty good: two sacks and six hurries in a limited number of snaps. The Giants have mostly been using him behind Kareem Martin and Connor Barwin, but one can imagine a lot more late-season playing time as they try to figure out exactly what they have here. (There\u2019s also a healthy Olivier Vernon to contend with.) Carter has one of the widest variances of anyone on this list. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s a star, and we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he never became a full-time starter. If his physical profile wins out, you can expect production along the lines of another Georgia product: Bears edge player Leonard Floyd.\n\nThe next Giants rookie to make the cut seems like the more obvious \u2014 defensive tackle B.J. Hill.\n\nHill was drafted to play the 3-technique in New York\u2019s 3-4, and his main issue coming out of college was that scouts wondered about his functional strength. Hill was more of a penetrator in college, and a number of draftniks wondered how playing next to Bradley Chubb informed the damage he was able to bring. A nice three-cone drill time at the NFL combine (7.28 for an interior lineman!) helped solidify his draft position. Hill has anchored well thus far in the pros, providing a little bit of passing-down pop, with three hurries and two sacks. The run defense is far more telling for his future. If he can continue to win one-on-one inside in passing situations, the Giants will have another building block for their front seven as they look to the future.\n\nNo other Giant made the list or was considered an honorable mention, but that\u2019s strictly because of snap counts. Had it not been, there\u2019s little doubt that running back Saquon Barkley would have joined his draftmates, Hill and Carter."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jocelyn McClurg, USA TODAY", "title": "5 new books not to miss this week, including James Patterson's 'Target Alex Cross'", "description": "Look for an Alex Cross thriller from James Patterson, and a cute picture book about Meghan Markle's rescue beagle.

We've got good balance, and we just need to let things come to us.\"\n\nKamau Stokes added 16 points and Xavier Sneed had 11 for the Wildcats, who advanced to their fourth in-season tournament final under Weber.\n\n\"It'd be nice to finally get one,\" Wade said. \"We got a little antsy on offense at the beginning. We had some interesting shot selection, but once we got settled down, things started flowing. We started getting buckets.\"\n\nDevon Goodman scored 18 points and Michael Wang added 14 for the Quakers (4-1), who led by as many as eight points in the first half.\n\nAs Kansas State struggled, missing 18 of its first 22 shots, Penn was able to pull ahead 19-11 on Wang's layup with 7:16 remaining in the first half.\n\nBut the Wildcats scored 17 of the next 19 points to lead 28-21 at the half. Austin Trice's tipin with 2:46 left made it 21-all, and Wade's 3-point play at 1:35 put Kansas State ahead 24-21.\n\n\"We're a very good defensive team, and I thought we guarded them the whole night,\" Penn coach Steve Donahue said. \"But they're big and strong, and they wore us down. They're a very good basketball team. They wore us down, and we didn't make shots we typically make.\"\n\nMISSOURI 69, OREGON STATE 63\n\nJordan Geist scored 18 of his season-high 21 points in the second half, and the Tigers used a late run to pull away from the previously-unbeaten Beavers in Sunday's first semifinal.\n\nMissouri led by as many as 10 points in the first half and were ahead 32-28 at the halftime break. But Oregon State rallied in the second half to tie the game three times, the last at 48 on Tres Tinkle's layup with 9:57 remaining.\n\nHowever, Geist hit a short jumper 23 seconds later, kicking off a 13-point run by the Tigers capped by Xavier Pinson's floater in the lane for a 61-48 lead.\n\n\"We're a very young team, and we've got a lot to learn,\" said Geist, whose previous season best was six points. \"Dealing with adversity is one of the hardest things, and just playing through that. But at the end of the game, we kinda figured it out.\"\n\nKevin Puryear added 17 points for the Tigers (3-1).\n\nTinkle finished with 17 points, Stephen Thompson Jr. added 15 and Alfred Hollins 12 for the Beavers (3-1).\n\n\"That's what it came down to \u2014 we couldn't make shots, from the free throw line in the first half and at the 3-point line in both halves,\" Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle said.\n\n\"But we also didn't follow the game plan, the way we guarded screens and the way we guarded individuals. Plus, we wanted to defend without fouling. We fouled way too much because of our habits defensively.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chris Pietsch) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEUGENE, Ore. (AP) \u2014 The Oregon Ducks made what might be quarterback Justin Herbert's final game at Autzen Stadium more of a cliffhanger than they would've liked.\n\nHerbert threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns and Oregon held off a late rally by Arizona State to win 31-29 and knock the Sun Devils out of contention for a spot in the Pac-12 championship game.\n\nHerbert has not said whether he will return for his final year of eligibility for the Ducks. He was asked after the game for his takeaway on how he played against the Sun Devils.\n\n\"Fortunately it doesn't fall just on my shoulders. The defense played really well,\" he said. \"I know the feeling all too well of going against these guys every day and they played big-time football. Sometimes you have to rely on your defense and they did a great job.\"\n\nDillon Mitchell, Herbert's his favorite target this year, caught four passes for 103 yards and a touchdown against the Sun Devils.\n\nArizona State (6-5, 4-4 Pac-12) headed to Eugene on a three-game winning streak and needing a win to stay alive in its division race. But Utah defeated Colorado 30-7 in Boulder earlier in the day, giving the No. 19 Utes six wins in conference play. The Sun Devils' loss meant they could not catch Utah with just one game to go.\n\nThe Ducks (7-4, 4-4) were also bowl-eligible but had stumbled with three losses in their previous four games. Saturday's game was Oregon's last at home this season before hitting the road for the Civil War against Oregon State on Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nOregon was already eliminated from the Pac-12 North title race, which will be decided by next weekend's Apple Cup between No. 17 Washington and No. 8 Washington State. But the victory over ASU assured the Ducks would finish above .500 in coach Mario Cristobal's first year.\n\nManny Wilkins threw for 182 yards and two touchdowns for ASU. N'Keal Harry had seven catches for 105 yards. And Eno Benjamin, the Pac-12's leading rusher, had 29 carries for 149 yards.\n\nUp next for the Sun Devils is the rivalry game against Arizona.\n\n\"This team didn't end on a down note, we ended the game fighting our butts off, and that's what matters,\" Wilkins said. \"We've got a big one coming up this week and our guys are going to be ready. We're going to be dialed up and ready to go, simple as that.\"\n\nAfter Oregon built a 28-12 lead at halftime, the Sun Devils made it interesting with 11 minutes left when Brandon Aiyuk caught a 25-yard scoring pass from Wilkins to close within 28-23. Oregon answered with Adam Stack's 28-yard field goal.\n\nThe Sun Devils scored again on Wilkins' 1-yard touchdown run with 4:35 left, but the two-point conversion failed and Oregon remained in front.\n\nHerbert was intercepted on a tipped pass by ASU's Cam Phillips, but on the ensuing drive Oregon recovered a Sun Devil fumble to get the ball back with just over three minutes to go.\n\n\"I think we got rolling pretty good, and we had a couple a couple of times when we didn't get the ball rolling and I think we started pressing, I think you could see that in our players. We dropped some balls and we made some critical errors that ended up being turnovers,\" Cristobal said.\n\nCJ Verdell ran for the opening Oregon touchdown and also caught an 18-year scoring pass from Herbert, who also found Mitchell with a 57-yard scoring pass in the first half. Jaylon Redd scored on an 8-yard run.\n\nBrandon Ruiz kicked field goals from 38, 30 and 29 yards for the Sun Devils, while Wilkins had a 22-yard touchdown pass to Frank Darby.\n\n\"We fell a little short and that's kind of how it's been for us. We've lost games by one score and if you win a couple more of those, you're not sitting in this position, but our record is what it is and we fell a little short tonight,\" ASU coach Herm Edwards said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY:\n\nArizona State: The Sun Devils were without freshman linebacker Merlin Robertson for the first half after he was flagged for targeting in the third quarter of last weekend's game. Robertson has 66 tackles, five sacks, an interception and a recovered fumble this season. ... Safeties Jalen Harvey and Demonte King did not play because of injuries. ... The Sun Devils are coming off a 31-28 victory over UCLA.\n\nOregon: There were questions earlier in the week whether CJ Verdell would be able to play because of a neck injury. ... The Ducks are coming off a 32-25 loss at Utah last Saturday. ... Herbert is widely considered to be among the top quarterbacks in next year's NFL draft should he choose to leave early.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArizona State: The Sun Devils end the season at rival Arizona in the Territorial Cup on Saturday.\n\nOregon: The Ducks visit Oregon State in the Civil War rivalry game next Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 This record-setting season just keeps getting better for Gardner Minshew.\n\nWashington State's star quarterback broke a school mark with seven touchdown passes and the No. 8 Cougars routed Arizona 69-28 on Saturday night to boost their longshot bid for a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"In high school I got six one time,\" Minshew said. \"I never done seven. It was pretty crazy tonight.\"\n\nWashington State (10-1, 7-1 Pac-12, No. 8 CFP) raced out to a 55-14 lead at halftime and was not seriously threatened on the way to its seventh consecutive victory. The Cougars host archrival No. 17 Washington next Friday, with the Apple Cup winner taking the Pac-12 North title.\n\nWith their 10th win of the season, the Cougars matched a program record last accomplished in 2003. They also won their 13th straight home game and set a season high for points.\n\nMinshew, being pushed by WSU as a Heisman Trophy candidate, completed 43 of 55 passes for 473 yards and was not intercepted.\n\n\"The offensive line worked their tail off tonight,\" he said.\n\nRunning back James Williams, who scored two touchdowns, said the lopsided win was better than a recent run of close games.\n\n\"The last three or four games about gave me a heart attack,\" he said. \"I'd rather just blow a team out.\"\n\nWashington State coach Mike Leach called it a \"floodgate\" game that favored the Cougars.\n\n\"We're not that good and they're not that bad,\" he said.\n\nThis is Leach's first 10-win season at Washington State.\n\n\"We're excited about it for a night,\" Leach said. \"Tomorrow we start preparing for the next one.\"\n\nKhalil Tate threw four touchdown passes for Arizona (5-6, 4-4), which had a two-game winning streak snapped.\n\nArizona was hurt by six penalties and three turnovers in the first half, helping Washington State put the game away early.\n\n\"You can't put the ball on the ground six times,\" coach Kevin Sumlin said. \"We had a pick early in the game and turnovers and fumbles against a team that scores them kind of points, it just can't happen.\"\n\nWashington State scored on its first possession, with Williams rushing over from the 1.\n\nOn the next series, Tate was intercepted by Marcus Strong. Aided by two consecutive facemask penalties against the Wildcats, Washington State advanced to the 1-yard line. Max Borghi ran in for the touchdown.\n\nTate fired a 24-yard pass to Shawn Poindexter to cut Washington State's lead to 14-7.\n\nMinshew replied with touchdown passes to Calvin Jackson Jr. and Dezmon Patmon for a 28-7 lead.\n\nTate threw a 37-yard TD pass to Tony Ellison.\n\nMinshew hit Jackson for a 6-yard touchdown pass, but the kick failed and Washington State led 34-14.\n\nArizona fumbled the ensuing kickoff and the ball was booted into the end zone, where Kainoa Wilson fell on it for a 41-14 Washington State lead.\n\nMinshew added touchdown passes to Williams and Tay Martin for a 55-14 lead at halftime.\n\nTate threw a pair of touchdown passes in the third quarter and Minshew tossed a couple in the fourth.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe blowout win should only bolster the Cougars in the Top 25 and CFP rankings.\n\nCOLD AS ICE\n\nPlaying in 20-degree temperatures, Arizona fumbled six times, losing three. The Wildcats also committed seven penalties for 75 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArizona: The Wildcats lead the Pac-12 with an average of 206 yards rushing per game, but couldn't get much going against a stout WSU defense. They need a win next weekend to become bowl eligible.\n\nWashington State: The balanced Cougars own the nation's best passing attack (392 yards per game) and rank 20th in defense. They need two victories to win the Pac-12 and have a chance at a CFP berth.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArizona hosts Arizona State in their annual rivalry game next Saturday.\n\nWashington State faces No. 17 Washington next Friday, with a trip to the Pac-12 championship game on the line.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: NONE, MTV)\n\nIt\u2019s been called the best TV episode of the \u201890s and the best live album of all time, hailed as a masterpiece from the decade\u2019s defining band. Recorded 25 years ago in New York City on Nov. 18, 1993, Nirvana\u2019s \"MTV Unplugged In New York\" album holds a different place in the band\u2019s short-but-legendary discography, an album of transcendent folk rock that glimpsed what could\u2019ve been the band\u2019s next post-grunge era, had frontman Kurt Cobain survived long enough to see its musical leanings through.\n\nSadly, \"MTV Unplugged\" would not be the beginning of a new chapter for Nirvana but the end of one. Cobain died of suicide in April 1994, and the album would be the band\u2019s first release since his passing, released in December to a rapturous critical response, beckoning Grammy awards and millions of copies in sales.\n\nYet 25 years later, Nirvana\u2019s \"MTV Unplugged\" album isn\u2019t just remarkable for its mythology. It is a genius recording, in so many ways, the first being the way the band adapted to the acoustic format of the \"MTV Unplugged\" series, which presented an immediate challenge for a set of musicians best known for their blistering noise. Instead of just making an album of de rigueur \u201cNirvana goes acoustic\u201d tracks, the band reconfigured their sound to adapt to the setting, becoming a new band for the night, with the stripped-down instrumentals laying bare the material\u2019s naked emotion.\n\nMore: Here we are now: Nirvana's 'Nevermind' at 25\n\n'Nevermind' 25th anniversary: Ranking the songs on Nirvana's classic album\n\nEqually brilliant was the band\u2019s choice to forego their biggest hits, instead choosing a divinely inspired mix of eight Nirvana songs and six covers, including the Vaselines\u2019 \u201cJesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam,\" the traditional folk song \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\" and, most memorably, David Bowie\u2019s \u201cThe Man Who Sold the World,\u201d which is now as classic as the original.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to how deeply and intimately Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl understood their material as a band that they were able to filter through their catalog of popular hits and fan favorites, cut the songs that didn\u2019t fit the format and emerge with a track list of songs that would be transformed in the Unplugged setting. As a result, we have the acoustic versions of songs such as \u201cAll Apologies,\" \"Pennyroyal Tea\" and \u201cCome As You Are,\u201d which arguably have survived as the more enduring versions.\n\nBut the true gift of Nirvana\u2019s \"MTV Unplugged\" album is its presentation of Cobain at his peak, a showcase of his artistry that\u2019d never been seen before, and due to his untimely death, would never be seen again. Cobain\u2019s presence is never more painfully beautiful than he is on \"Unplugged,\" his vocals achingly perfect, surrounded by black candles and white lilies in a funeral-like setting that was famously his vision. On their other recordings, Novoselic and Grohl are Cobain\u2019s furiously powerful equals, but acoustically, Cobain is a singular force.\n\nAnd while nobody in the audience on Nov. 18, 1993, knew that Cobain would be dead less than a half-year later, it\u2019s impossible to listen to Nirvana\u2019s \"MTV Unplugged\" album and not hear the demons in his head, so present it\u2019s as if they\u2019re singing backup onstage. The album is equal parts tragedy and triumph, almost certainly the best live album of a generation from a band who made nearly every correct creative choice in its recording, which nevertheless endures as Cobain\u2019s personal, pre-emptive funeral mass.\n\nHad he stayed alive, Nirvana\u2019s \"MTV Unplugged\" would still be a classic; after his death, it became immortal.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/18/nirvanas-mtv-unplugged-turns-25-generations-best-live-album/2026830002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Ancer solves The Lakes, wins Australian Open by 5 strokes", "description": "Abraham Ancer went into the final round of the Australian Open with a five-stroke lead", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2018/11/18/ancer-solves-the-lakes-wins-australian-open-by-5-strokes/38556367/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ed7dd9aa82d029bfb67d75becc5b6ecc72638fe/c=0-207-3462-2154/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/4cfabc010674456cb5be4c5f00f6e84b.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T06:39:21Z", "content": "Abraham Ancer of Mexico plays from a fairway bunker on the 8th during the Australian Open Golf tournament in Sydney, Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018.

He added an empty-netter for his team-leading 11th goal \u2014 his career high is 17 set in 2014-15.\n\n\"He's a high-end player. He has been his whole life,\" Flames coach Bill Peters said. \"Takes faceoffs, kills penalties, can play 4-on-4, plays on the power play. He touches the game in a lot of different areas.\"\n\nLindholm, acquired from Carolina in the offseason, was drafted fifth overall in 2013, one spot ahead of linemate Sean Monahan.\n\nMonahan, with a goal and an assist, and Derek Ryan also scored for Calgary.\n\nConnor McDavid and Alex Chiasson scored for Edmonton, which has lost five of six.\n\nDown 2-1 entering the third period, Calgary tied it at 2:40 when Monahan rattled home a rebound of Travis Hamonic's shot.\n\nIt was the sixth time the Flames have come back to win when trailing after two periods, most in the NHL.\n\n\"A lot of times we play unreal in the third, but you don't want to chase the game too much,\" Lindholm said. \"It's not going to work all the time to be down before the third. It's something we need to work on.\"\n\nThe Flames were down 2-0 before Ryan ended a 14-game scoring drought with his second of the season at 16:23 of the second period.\n\nUntil then, the Flames' listless power play had given up just as many shots as it had generated, with two of the three allowed being breakaways.\n\nStanding tall in net was David Rittich, who improved to 6-1-0. Included in his 24 stops were three breakaways \u2014 two for Leon Draisaitl and one by Jujhar Khaira.\n\n\"It's my job. It's a great feeling, but that's why I'm in the net \u2014 making saves,\" Rittich said.\n\nWith fellow goalie Mike Smith struggling, Rittich delivered the type of quality start Calgary needed after dropping three of its previous four games.\n\n\"He was huge. There were a couple breakaways and odd-man rushes. He made some big stops. When that happens it makes you want to go hard,\" Monahan said.\n\nKoskinen, who turned aside 33 shots, fell to 4-2-0.\n\n\"It felt like we ran out of gas a little bit. We spent the whole third in our own zone,\" he said.\n\nEdmonton increased its lead to 2-0 at 3:49 of the second when Draisaitl set up McDavid on a perfectly executed 2-on-1. Rittich had no chance to get across and stop the one-timer.\n\nThe Oilers took the lead 2:29 into the game while short-handed. Playing against his former team, Chiasson broke in off the wing and slipped a backhand through Rittich's pads.\n\nIt was a physical game, especially early, with Mikael Backlund and McDavid wrestling at one point. Sam Bennett and Darnell Nurse squared off after Bennett, on the first shift of the game, rocked the Oilers defenseman with a heavy hit.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk was in the middle of the action, getting jumped by Zack Kassian late in the first period, which drew a triple minor for roughing and a misconduct on the Oilers' rugged forward.\n\n\"We had an opportunity to go ahead two or three and that may have changed the game, on some of the breakaways, but their goaltender played well,\" Edmonton coach Todd McLellan said.\n\n\"Too many penalties. Their top players didn't have to play a lot of hard minutes. They were on the power play the whole first two (periods), so by the time you get to the third, they have some gas left in their tanks and they certainly took it to us.\"\n\nNOTES: Dillon Dube (concussion) returned to the lineup after missing four games. ...

The two-time Norris Trophy winner came into the game with 11 assists and a minus-9 rating before delivering in a big way against the Blues with a goal and an assist during San Jose's second-period surge.\n\nJoe Pavelski scored the first of his two goals shortly after Karlsson's tally, and Evander Kane followed with another as the Sharks struck three times in 4:11 to take control.\n\nDell did the rest, making 30 saves as the Sharks limited odd-man rushes after giving up nine goals over the past two games.\n\n\"That's what we were striving for,\" Pavelski said. \"No breakaways. That was nice. I don't know if they had any 2-on-1s. There were a couple breakdowns here and there, but Deller was great for us. But we got the offense off of being smart. It comes when you do it right, for the most part. Tonight was a good bounce-back game for us.\"\n\nEight days after San Jose lost 4-0 in St. Louis while playing on consecutive nights and for the third time in four days, the Sharks turned the tables on a Blues team facing the same grueling situation.\n\nSt. Louis won 4-1 at Vegas on Friday but couldn't build on that win against the Sharks.\n\n\"We just can't keep coming and saying OK, it's good one night, it's not good the next night,\" coach Mike Yeo said. \"We have to demand it of ourselves that we bring it every night for 60 minutes.\"\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, the game quickly turned in the second. The Sharks began on the power play and generated several good chances without scoring, but drew another penalty to get a second shot with the man advantage.\n\nThat power play was mostly sloppy until the end, when Karlsson got a rebound in the high slot and beat Johnson high to the blocker side. Fans gave him a big ovation and Kane raced over to give him a big embrace. Karlsson had a wide smile when he was shown on the video board sitting on the bench shortly after the goal.\n\n\"You could just see it in his face that it was weighing on him, there's no doubt,\" Sharks coach Peter DeBoer said. \"But he's been playing some real good hockey, and I think he's been really solid for us lately. For me, the offense is a bonus. We know it's going to be there and the numbers are going to be there at the end of the year because they have to be based on what he's doing.\"\n\nSan Jose didn't stop there. Pavelski fed Timo Meier on a rush and Johnson made the initial save, but Pavelski won the race to the rebound and tucked it into an open net to make it 2-0.\n\nThe Sharks converted on another rush shortly after that with Karlsson setting up Kane in the high slot for a drive that beat Johnson.\n\nPavelski added another in the third period, giving him six goals in the past four games.\n\n\"I think we got away from our game a little bit,\" Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly said. \"We got a little hesitant and started watching a bit more and obviously they came. . They got confident and came at us hard and we didn't do enough to counter that.\"\n\nNOTES: Logan Couture had three assists. ... Blues forwards Alexander Steen and Jaden Schwartz and D Carl Gunnarsson all missed the game with upper-body injuries. ... Sharks forward Tomas Hertl missed his second straight game with a lower-body injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlues: Host the Los Angeles Kings on Monday.\n\nSharks: Host the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Brown caught the ball in the end zone may never end.\n\nThe Vanderbilt Commodores have no doubt Randall Haynie at least broke up the pass, and he believes he pulled it away for an interception. They know for sure that Joejuan Williams knocked down the next pass to seal a very big victory.\n\nKyle Shurmur hit Kalija Lipscomb with a 5-yard touchdown pass on the first possession in overtime, and Vanderbilt edged Mississippi 36-29 Saturday night to keep their bowl hopes alive for another week.\n\nAn unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Lipscomb for tossing the ball in the air after his TD catch gave Ole Miss the ball at the 12. Three plays later, review overturned Jordan Ta'amu's 8-yard TD pass to A.J. Brown, ruling that Brown did not maintain possession.\n\n\"I didn't think it was a catch,\" Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \"With the rule in play now, we're talking about you got to possess the ball through the catch. He didn't possess it through the catch. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure we didn't have an interception.\"\n\nOle Miss coach Matt Luke said the play was reviewed at the SEC office in Birmingham.\n\n\"It looked like he had possession, and he was down, and the guy knocked it out, that's what it looked like on the jumbotron,\" Luke said. \"That's what I saw.\"\n\nOn fourth down, Williams broke up the throw to DaMarkus Lodge at the left pylon after a defensive change by Mason.\n\n\"It was just up to me to make the play,\" Williams said.\n\nVanderbilt (5-6, 2-5 Southeastern Conference) trailed 13-0 early in the second quarter and rallied with 19 straight points to beat Ole Miss for the second time in three years. The game featured three ties in the second half, and Luke Logan's fifth field goal from 32 yards with 40 seconds left for Ole Miss set up overtime.\n\nNow the Commodores can earn their second bowl berth in three seasons by beating instate rival Tennessee in the regular-season finale.\n\nKe'Shawn Vaughn ran for 127 yards and a TD. Williams and LaDarius Wiley each had an interception in the fourth quarter, and Dayo Odeyingbo had two of Vanderbilt's three sacks.\n\nOle Miss (5-6, 1-6) lost its fourth straight despite outgaining Vandy 578-387 in total offense. Ta'amu had a career-high 457 yards passing and two TDs, and Brown finished with a season-high 212 yards and a TD. Lodge had 117 yards receiving.\n\nOle Miss appeared in total control after Brown took a pass 84 yards for a TD and a 13-0 lead. At that point, Ole Miss had outgained Vandy 271-73.\n\nMax Worship blocked a Mac Brown punt through the end zone for a safety that Mason said changed the momentum, and the Commodores drove 53 yards off the following kick.\n\nShurmur hit Lipscomb with a 2-yard TD pass with 62 seconds left in the first half to pull Vandy within 13-12. Vaughn capped the opening drive of the third quarter with a 1-yard TD run for Vandy's first lead of the game at 19-13.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nMississippi: The Rebels put up some more flashy numbers with the nation's fifth-best offense, though running back Scottie Phillips didn't play because of an injured ankle. They came in leading the SEC and ninth nationally with only nine turnovers lost all season, but the Commodores came up with two interceptions in the fourth quarter. Ole Miss also had two other TD passes overturned after reviews.\n\nVanderbilt: The Commodores showed resilience in fighting back after blowing a lead losing at Missouri last week. They have struggled all season to finish off games when either leading or with the ball needing to score in four different games until this.\n\n\"Our emphasis this past week was to finish,\" Shurmur said. \"It's something we haven't done well throughout the year, but it was good to finish here. That was great.\"\n\nPASSING CUTLER\n\nShurmur's first two TD passes tied him with Jay Cutler for Vandy's career record, then the senior took the record to himself with the TD pass in overtime. \"I'll worry about that later. Right now, it's just a great team win,\" Shurmur said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMississippi: Host Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl on Thursday night.\n\nVanderbilt: Host Tennessee on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHere are 10 observations from the slate of college football games in Week 12\n\nUSC can't afford the status quo: The meltdown scenario for Clay Helton seems to be underway after an astounding 34-27 loss to UCLA on Saturday. Though the preference of the Trojans\u2019 administration has always been to keep Helton, whose contract they extended after he won the Pac-12 title last year, the fans and boosters have been off the bandwagon for awhile. The problem is, Helton isn\u2019t doing much to make the case to the masses that he can get USC back into the strata of elite programs. In fact, at 5-6 and with Notre Dame coming next week, it\u2019s far more likely the Trojans will be home for the holidays.\n\nHelton is a solid person and has been a much-needed grown-up at a program that got into a hole by hiring immature coaches in Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian. But he doesn\u2019t have that \u201cit factor\u201d you need at one of the few places in the country where you have the resources to win a national championship. Whatever it costs for USC to make a change, you wonder at this point if the Trojans can afford not to fire him \u2014 especially with Chip Kelly across town having just gotten his big breakthrough win at their expense.\n\nMore: College football winners and losers, starting with Ohio State and Michigan\n\nNotre Dame is going to get its first playoff berth: Give the Fighting Irish credit for taking all the drama out of whether they\u2019re going to make the College Football Playoff. After a fully dominant 36-3 win over Syracuse in Yankee Stadium, all that stands between Notre Dame and a semifinal berth is a trip to USC next Saturday night. Don\u2019t buy into the brand hype or the narrative about whether all the air miles Notre Dame has logged with multiple trips to the West Coast will hurt them. The truth is, this game is a total mismatch in personnel and coaching, and only a complete choke job by the Fighting Irish could keep them out of the playoff at this point. So congrats to Brian Kelly and to ESPN, which will love the ratings boost of having the Fighting Irish in its big bonanza on Dec. 29.\n\nMore: No. 3 Notre Dame puts away Syracuse, turns eyes toward USC and unbeaten regular season\n\nMore: Notre Dame seems headed to playoff but why will it be different than last time vs. Alabama\n\nNeither Urban Meyer nor his team looks well: The Buckeyes somehow escaped College Park with a 52-51 overtime win after stopping a two-point conversion, but the most potent images were of Meyer hunched over seemingly in significant pain several times after over-the-top outbursts of emotion. Meyer talked candidly with Yahoo! Sports last month about his health issues stemming from a congenital arachnoid cyst on his brain that he\u2019s been dealing with for several years. Meyer attributed some of his pained looks on the sideline to that condition, and it certainly raises the specter of him walking away like he did in 2010 when he cited health issues in his departure from Florida.\n\nBut that\u2019s a decision for another day. In the meantime, Ohio State is quite fortunate to be 10-1 heading into the Michigan game and technically still alive for the Big Ten championship and, perhaps more remotely, the playoff.\n\nThe bottom line is, Ohio State passes neither the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 test nor the eye test right now after giving up 535 yards to Maryland including 298 on the ground to running back Anthony McFarland. Even if the Buckeyes find a way to beat Michigan at home, they haven't played a game since beating Tulane 49-6 back in September where you come away thinking this is a team that could challenge for a title. With such an inept defense, they\u2019re essentially a discount version of Oklahoma. Ohio State was stuck at No. 10 this week in the CFP rankings for that very reason, and it would need total chaos to get serious consideration.\n\nMore: No. 8 Ohio State keeps playoff hopes alive by surviving at Maryland in overtime 52-51\n\nDon\u2019t overreact to look-ahead spots: This is the time of year where every move made by the College Football Playoff contenders will get scrutinized, particularly in a situation where the margins could be very small between several teams for that No. 4 spot.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s hard to get too worked up when teams that have been playing at a high level all season come out a little flat against lesser opponents in Week 12 when they\u2019ve got their biggest games coming up over the next two weeks.\n\nThat certainly seemed to be the case with No. 1 Alabama, which likely did not enjoy Nick Saban\u2019s halftime speech very much after puttering around with The Citadel for 30 minutes. Though Alabama predictably pulled away to win 50-17 and remains undefeated heading into the Iron Bowl, the fact it was tied 10-10 at halftime was perhaps the most shocking score of the year in all of college football. It also validated Saban\u2019s decision to play quarterback Tua Tagovailoa after a week of talk in the media about whether it would be better to sit him out against a 50-point underdog after getting banged around a bit the last few games. Not only did Tagovailoa play and play well (he was 18-for-22 for 340 yards and three touchdowns), but Alabama kind of needed him.\n\nMore: The Citadel has some fun on Twitter at No. 1 Alabama's expense after entering halftime tied\n\nYou can also give a little of a pass to Michigan, which didn\u2019t seem to have a ton of intensity in the first half against Indiana and found itself trailing 17-15 before gutting out a 31-20 win. Perhaps the biggest development was that Michigan\u2019s backup kicker, freshman Jake Moody went 6-for-6 on field goals replacing Quinn Nordin, who was ill. Nordin hasn\u2019t been great this season (he\u2019s 11-for-16), so that could be something to watch for next week in what will likely be a close, low-scoring game.\n\nMore: Michigan pushes past Indiana to set up epic winner-take-all showdown with Ohio State\n\nClemson, which has basically dominated everyone since September, also might have also been caught looking ahead a bit. The Tigers trailed Duke 6-0 early and didn\u2019t get much going in the first half but cruised to a 35-6 win to close out the ACC season. Clemson needs only to beat two unranked teams, South Carolina and Pitt, to clinch a fourth consecutive playoff bid.\n\nChange seems likely at Colorado: The report from a Denver television station earlier in the week that Colorado planned to part ways with Mike MacIntyre at the end of the season may be premature, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was inaccurate. Though few considered the possibility MacIntyre might land on the hot seat at 5-0, the Buffaloes have really fallen apart since the midway point of the season and Saturday\u2019s 30-7 home loss to Utah certainly didn\u2019t bolster his case.\n\nDespite the $10 million buyout MacIntyre would be owed, there\u2019s a strong feeling in the industry he needed to at least win one of the last two games to keep his job. Colorado finishes at Cal next Saturday, but home losses by a combined score of 61-14 the last two weeks don\u2019t give MacIntyre much of a leg to stand on if athletics director Rick George decides it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nColorado is a difficult job, and MacIntyre practically worked a miracle in 2016 to get the Buffaloes to 10-4 and into the Pac-12 championship game, earning him some major national coach of the year awards including from the Associated Press. However, if you remove that year from the equation, he\u2019s just 6-38 in the Pac-12.\n\nIt\u2019s not the easiest call for Colorado, but the favorable hiring market this year might tip the scales toward change.\n\nPitt is a feel-good story: After losing to North Carolina back on Sept. 22, you\u2019d have been hard-pressed to envision Pittsburgh playing in an ACC championship game. And while it would be folly to go overboard with praise for the Panthers and Pat Narduzzi this season, they get full credit for taking advantage of a down Coastal division and clinching the title Saturday with a 34-13 win at Wake Forest. Pitt has actually played solid football for the last six weeks or so, losing only to Notre Dame, 19-14, on a late touchdown. Notably, quarterback Kenny Pickett hasn\u2019t thrown an interception since Oct. 6, and the Panthers have a strong one-two punch in the backfield with Qadree Ollison and Darrin Hall (1,900 yards combined). While the 7-4 Panthers will be a big underdog to Clemson in Charlotte, they\u2019re potentially a viable playoff spoiler.\n\nJustin Fuente should consider a drastic change: When Virginia Tech hired Fuente from Memphis, part of the deal was that the Hokies\u2019 legendary defensive coordinator Bud Foster would remain on his staff. Foster has been at Virginia Tech since 1987 and has run the defense since 1995. But arranged marriages are sometimes tricky, and there\u2019s no way around the fact Foster\u2019s defense has been outright poor this year. The last four games, Virginia Tech has given up 339 yards to a Miami team that's really struggled recently, 654 yards to Pitt, 396 yards to Boston College and 465 to Georgia Tech. Though the blame for Virginia Tech\u2019s 4-6 record goes to many places, including Fuente, his offense doesn\u2019t look the same as it did at Memphis and nothing about the way his team plays seems particularly comfortable. Fuente needs to make some changes going into his fourth year and make this program fully his. Though it would be politically tricky, to say the least, if one of those changes was Foster, it\u2019s something he probably needs to consider because what\u2019s going on right now isn\u2019t working at all.\n\nNebraska is coming: By next weekend, Nebraska is going to have either the happiest 4-8 fan base or the happiest 5-7 fan base in the country. Which one doesn\u2019t really matter. The point is, things have turned after it seemed like the Cornhuskers just couldn\u2019t get a win to save their lives for the first six weeks. The record in Scott Frost\u2019s first season never mattered much. The measuring stick was whether you could see improvement and direction, and there\u2019s no doubt Frost has succeeded on both points. Saturday\u2019s 9-6 tough-it-out win over Michigan State showed another gear for Nebraska after its offense had largely been responsible for beating Minnesota and Illinois and hanging until the end with Ohio State. Frost still has a long way to go in building the program, but Nebraska fans should be very happy with what they've seen recently.\n\nMore: Nebraska rallies for 9-6 win at home as Michigan State's sputtering offense goes cold\n\nUCF controls the Group of Five: Saturday was a showcase for the UCF program from the beginning with College GameDay on campus to a 38-13 win over Cincinnati in ABC\u2019s prime-time slot. UCF has not been a great defensive team this year, but it rose to the occasion here by winning key third/fourth downs and generating three turnovers. The Knights, which have the nation\u2019s longest winning streak at 23 straight, will be heavy favorites to go unbeaten again versus South Florida and then whoever they play in the American Athletic Conference title game. Notably, their opponent in that game could very well be Memphis, which has lost to UCF by razor-thin margins in their last two meets. The Tigers could clinch their division by beating Houston at home on Friday.\n\nShould UCF slip up, Utah State is waiting in the wings for a bid to a New Year\u2019s Six game as the highest-ranked Group of Five team. The Aggies escaped in a wild game Saturday, 29-24, when Colorado State\u2019s \u201cHail Mary\u201d game-winning pass was overturned because the receiver had gone out of bounds before the catch. Utah State is 10-1 and plays at Boise State next Saturday.\n\nOH NO! THE RECEIVER STEPPED OUT BEFORE THE CATCH!\n\n\n\nCOLORADO STATE DOES NOT GET THIS HAIL MARY FOR THE WIN! UTAH STATE WINS! pic.twitter.com/ckvr4yfhZG \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) November 17, 2018\n\nBig stakes in Volunteer state: The combination of Vanderbilt\u2019s overtime win over Ole Miss and Tennessee\u2019s blowout loss at home to Missouri sets the stage for a pretty important game, relatively speaking, between 5-6 teams next Saturday in Nashville. The narrative of Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s first season at Tennessee will hinge largely on that result, as the difference between 6-6 and 5-7 will be huge for a coach who has gained the fan base\u2019s trust to this point but hasn\u2019t had a lot of meaningful accomplishments yet. The Vols looked awful Saturday against Missouri, losing 50-17, but have had a couple highlights in wins over Auburn and Kentucky and would build some good vibes going into 2019 with a win over the Commodores. Vanderbilt\u2019s season will be remembered for missed opportunities in the fourth quarter against Notre Dame, Kentucky, Florida and Missouri, but beating Tennessee to go 6-6 would help Derek Mason\u2019s case to return in 2019. Vanderbilt has won two in a row and four of the last six against Tennessee."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Jarnkrok's hat trick leads Predators over Kings 5-3", "description": "Calle Jarnkrok recorded his first career hat trick to lead the Nashville Predators to a 5-3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/11/17/jarnkroks-hat-trick-leads-predators-over-kings-5-3/38555511/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/172c7e1089c107751c35fbc6671593a7840b9f71/c=0-440-2561-1881/local/-/media/2018/11/18/USATODAY/usatsports/fa07cc3ad52646289be198be3a8c23f6.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T05:09:10Z", "content": "Nashville Predators defenseman Dan Hamhuis (5) and Los Angeles Kings left wing Ilya Kovalchuk (17), of Russia, battle for the puck during the first period of an NHL hockey game Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn.

(AP) \u2014 Calle Jarnkrok's three goals sent many Nashville Predators fans home with a serious case of hat head.\n\nJarnkrok recorded his first career hat trick to lead the Predators to a 5-3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night.\n\n\"That was a good night for him,\" Nashville coach Peter Laviolette said. \"I thought he played terrific, forget about the goals, just the game in general. I thought he was really moving.\"\n\nKyle Turris and Nick Bonino also scored for Nashville, which snapped a three-game losing streak. Nashville defensemen Ryan Ellis and Roman Josi each had a pair of assists.\n\nAnze Kopitar had a goal and an assist, and Nate Thompson and Alex Iafallo also scored for the Kings, who have lost four of five.\n\nJarnkrok scored at even strength, on the power play and short-handed, with the short-handed goal being the eventual game-winner at 11:54 of the third period.\n\nSkating into the Kings zone on the left side, Jarnkrok fired a wrist shot over the glove of Los Angeles goaltender Cal Petersen, prompting the sellout Bridgestone Arena crowd to shower the ice with hats.\n\n\"I felt pretty hot, so I just tried to hit the net, basically, and it went in,\" Jarnkrok said.\n\nJarnkrok joins Scott Walker as the only players in Predators' history to score even strength, power play and short-handed goals in the same game.\n\n\"He's an important player in here, whether it's offensively or defensively,\" Ellis said. \"You put him out on the power play, and he showed what he can do. He got us going when we needed it.\"\n\nThe teams battled to a scoreless tie through the first period and combined for five goals in a span of 6:57, beginning at 3:18 of the second.\n\nTurris scored the game's first goal, a rare power-play effort for the Predators.\n\nStanding at the top of the left faceoff circle, Turris received a touch pass from Ellis at the center of the blue line. Turris' one-timer through traffic beat Petersen high to the glove side.\n\n\"Again, it comes down to the specialty teams,\" Kings coach Willie Desjardins said. \"It's something I do believe that we can be better in that. We'll get that part going.\"\n\nPetersen made 38 saves in his second career start. He recorded his first career win in Friday night's shootout win in Chicago.\n\n\"I appreciate the opportunity to be able to play against high-end teams in hard buildings,\" Petersen said. \"It is a little bit of a baptism by fire, I guess, and get it out of the way. When you play those games, you kind of realize that you can compete at that level and compete in that environment.\"\n\nNashville entered Saturday with the league's worst power play, clicking at just over 10 percent.\n\nThompson and Kopitar scored 19 seconds apart to take the lead.\n\nThompson's goal, his first of the season, came just five seconds after a penalty to Nashville forward Filip Forsberg expired. At the right of Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne, he found the rebound of Tyler Toffoli's shot from the point.\n\nOn the next shift, Dustin Brown stepped in front of Kevin Fiala to intercept a pass. He then skated toward the Nashville goal and slid a pass to a Kopitar in the slot, and he beat Rinne low to the stick side.\n\nRinne finished with 25 saves.\n\nJarnkrok snapped a wrist shot from the high slot over Petersen's glove at 8:05, but Iafallo found a rebound of a Kopitar shot in the left circle 2:10 later and beat Rinne on the stick side.\n\nNashville tied it at 3 at 5:44 of the third on Jarnkrok's second of the night, another power-play goal.\n\nBonino concluded the scoring with an empty-net goal with just under a minute remaining.\n\nNOTES: Kings D Dion Phaneuf played his 1,000th career game. He was taken ninth overall in the 2003 Entry Draft, which was held in Nashville. ... The Predators scored two power-play goals in a game for just the second time this season.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nKings: Visit St. Louis on Monday.\n\nPredators: Host Tampa Bay on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Cam Atkinson anchored a top line that caused the Carolina Hurricanes fits Saturday night as the Columbus Blue Jackets won 4-1 for their fifth victory in six games.\n\nAtkinson scored three goals and assisted on another, and fellow winger Artemi Panarin assisted on all of Atkinson's goals. Columbus center Pierre-Luc Dubois added two assists as Atkinson stretched his goal-scoring streak to six games.\n\n\"For all we talk about our balanced scoring, it's nice to have that one line that can do what they did tonight and really take a game over,\" said Blue Jackets assistant coach Brad Shaw, who spoke to the media after the game because head coach John Tortorella was ill.\n\nThe Blue Jackets (12-6-2) broke a six-game skid against Metropolitan Division rival Carolina (8-8-3). Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 30 shots to earn the win.\n\nSebastian Aho scored his sixth goal of the season 6:05 into the second period for the Hurricanes, cutting their deficit to 2-1 with a wraparound that slid just inside the far post. Just 1:17 later, Atkinson backhanded a pass to Zach Werenski in the slot for a wrister that beat Scott Darling on the glove side.\n\n\"It wasn't the goalie's fault,\" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said. \"We were giving point-blank shots up and you can't do that in this league.\"\n\nAtkinson completed his fifth career hat trick 3:58 later on a power play with a shot from the top of the faceoff circle to the left of Darling, increasing Columbus' lead to 4-1. Atkinson has six of his team-high 12 goals in the last four games.\n\n\"He's an easy guy to put on the ice right now,\" Shaw said. \"He's not just scoring, he's a big part of our penalty kill as well.\"\n\nPanarin leads the Blue Jackets with 16 assists and 21 points. Atkinson has 20 points, and Dubois is next with 17 for Columbus, which played penalty-free hockey for the first 34 minutes.\n\nBobrovsky preserved the three-goal lead by stopping Jordan Martinook on a breakaway while Carolina was short-handed early in the third period. Later, Dougie Hamilton clanged a shot off the far post behind Bobrovsky.\n\n\"When you think of his best five or six saves, they were all 10-bell saves,\" Shaw said, \"and they all either keep us in the game or keep them frustrated and let us feel good about what we're doing out there. He can make a huge impact in games, and he's certainly done that for us lately.\"\n\nBrind'Amour said he hadn't been upset with his team's effort all season, but he wasn't happy Saturday. Carolina had three days off before this game.\n\n\"It came down to us playing a good team and they won all the puck battles,\" he said. \"They were first to everything and they played like a first-place team and we didn't have the desperation that we needed to, and that was frustrating.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes are 2-5-2 in their last nine games. Columbus' only loss in the past 13 days came in a shootout against the New York Rangers last Saturday.\n\nThe Blue Jackets killed off all three Carolina power plays, including two late in the second period after Columbus was called for delay of game and too many men on the ice.\n\nNOTES: Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno was scratched because of a personal matter. ... Columbus has scored at least four goals in three of its last four games. ... Aho extended his point streak to four games. ...

Javon Bess led the team with 13 rebounds.\n\nThe Billikens led 33-28 at halftime but the Pirates (1-2) closed early in the second half, cutting it to 54-50 with 7:49 to play. A Wiley 3-pointer helped stretch it out to 61-51 with 4:11 to go. Seton Hall's Myles Powell sank a 3-pointer with 11 seconds left to cut it to a point, 65-64, but Sandro Mamukelashvili missed another long shot in the final seconds.\n\nPowell scored 16 points and had four steals for the Pirates.

(AP) \u2014 Another \"JFK\" may be emerging in the Bay State.\n\nBruins rookie forward Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson \u2014 coaches and teammates identify him by his initials \u2014 scored his first career goal 1:12 into the game, and Jake DeBrusk's goal less than two minutes later was all Boston needed for a 2-1 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's difficult to describe,\" said Karlsson, who was recalled from Providence of the American Hockey League on Nov. 9.\n\n\"It's a great feeling. It's nice to get the first one, just so you don't start thinking about it. It's nice to get that out of the way. Hopefully we can keep going from there.\"\n\nKarlsson scored from near the crease after Noel Acciardi stole the puck from behind the net and flipped it in front.\n\n\"Noel made a great play,\" Karlsson said. \"All credit to him. I just tried to put it in.\"\n\nDeBrusk scored his eighth goal of the season and fifth in his last six games at 2:45 of the first period. He poked in a loose puck as it rolled into the crease off the stick of Brad Marchand for a 2-0 lead, and the Bruins made it stand up.\n\nJaroslav Halak made 31 saves for Boston after giving up six goals on 25 shots in a loss at Colorado on Wednesday. He is 9-3-2 in his career against the Coyotes.\n\nBrad Richardson scored his sixth goal at 9:10 of the second period, and the Coyotes carried the play in for the rest of the period but couldn't get the equalizer.\n\n\"We had a bunch of chances and we just didn't score,\" Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said.\n\nArizona went on a power play with 1:46 remaining in the game, and goalie Darcy Kuemper left the ice 20 seconds later for a 6-on-4 advantage, but Halak was up to the task.\n\nHalak saved four shots in the final 1:03, and defenseman Jeremy Lauzon saved a potential goal when he cleared a puck away from the crease in the final seconds.\n\n\"I was just ready for the rebound,\" Lauzon said. \"I knew there were two guys in front. I turned around and the puck was right there.\"\n\nKuemper made 20 saves in his seventh consecutive start while Antti Raanta deals with a lower-body injury. Kuemper is 0-3 in three career starts against Boston.\n\nArizona outshot Boston 32-22, the Bruins' lowest shot total of the season. Boston had only three shots in the second period, the first coming with 5\u00bd minutes remaining.\n\nThe Bruins, who are 3-1-1 while playing five games in eight days, will remain in Arizona until Monday before traveling to Detroit for the final stop of a four-game trip.\n\n\"I want the guys to go sit in the sun and enjoy themselves and get vitamin D,\" coach Bruce Cassidy said.\n\nHalak saved a short-handed wrist shot by Michael Grabner on a 2-on-1 break two minutes into the second period to preserve the lead.

(AP) \u2014 Quarterback Jake Bentley chatted with one of his favorite targets in receiver Deebo Samuel, honored on Senior Night who reflected on how much he'd miss playing at South Carolina.\n\n\"I told him in winning this game, we'd have a little bit more time together,\" Bentley said.\n\nBentley threw for 339 yards and tied his career best with four touchdowns as the Gamecocks became bowl eligible with a 49-9 victory over Chattanooga on Saturday night.\n\nA.J. Turner, a junior with eight career touchdowns coming in, accounted for three TDs for the Gamecocks (6-4) against the Mocs (6-5) of the Football Championship Subdivision.\n\n\"It's not about the touchdowns, it's about us being able to play together,\" Turner said.\n\nThe win was an important one for the Gamecocks (6-4), whose time was running out at trying to make the postseason.\n\nSouth Carolina goes to powerhouse state rival No. 2 Clemson next week where it will be heavy underdogs. Without the Chattanooga win, the Gamecocks' postseason hopes would've rested on a makeup contest with Akron on Dec. 1.\n\n\"We've been through adversity this year,\" Bentley said. \"It's great to know we've got some postseason ball ahead of us.\"\n\nThe Gamecocks, who fell to FCS opponent The Citadel here three years ago, didn't want to mess around with Chattanooga. Bentley and Turner made sure they started fast with touchdowns on their first three possessions.\n\nBentley was 5-of-6 passing on South Carolina's opening possession, including a 16-yard TD throw to Turner.\n\nHe was at it again the next time he got the ball with a 12-play drive that ended with a 6-yard TD throw to Turner.\n\nTurner was front and center on the next drive, too, finishing the series with an 11-yard scoring run.\n\nTurner had only one touchdown in eight games this season before breaking out big against Chattanooga in the opening half.\n\nBentley, who was 25 of 29 passing, didn't stop after the break in adding scoring throws of 53 yards to Shi Smith and 61 yards to Samuel.\n\nBentley tied his career high of four touchdowns first accomplished in a win over Coastal Carolina in September.\n\nSamuel finished with five catches for 112 yards, his second straight game with over 100 yards receiving.\n\nChattanooga was overmatched from the start. The Mocs had a field goal and an extra point blocked. They were just one of eight on third-down tries in the opening half.\n\nChattanooga's lone TD came when receiver Bryce Nunnelly threw a 2-yard scoring pass to a wide open quarterback Nick Tiano with less than five minutes left in the game.\n\nThey were in the thick of the Southern Conference race the first two months of the season, but fell to 0-3 in November with this loss.\n\nMocs coach Tom Arth was pleased with his team's effort.\n\n\"I thought we left some plays out there,\" he said. \"That's the hard part.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nChattanooga: The Mocs made the NCAA FCS playoffs for three straight seasons from 2014-16, but have gone 9-13 the past two seasons under Arth. The team doubled its win total from Arth's first season, but struggled down the stretch as it went 0-3 in November.\n\nSouth Carolina: Beating an FCS team does not make all OK for the Gamecocks, but it does take some of the sting out of its fourth-quarter collapse at Florida a week ago. Most importantly, the victory gives South Carolina a December of bowl practices which it certainly needs to shore up its defense, which ranked 12th in the Southeastern Conference coming into the game.\n\nFACING CLEMSON\n\nThe Gamecocks head to Clemson trying to snap a four-game losing streak in the series where they've been outscored 162-66 in that stretch. South Carolina coach Will Muschamp said his team understands they need to pick things up against their rival.\n\n\"There's always a chip on your shoulder in the rivalry,\" South Carolina linebacker T.J. Brunson said. \"But you have to prepare the same way as always.\"\n\nYOUNG GAMECOCKS\n\nSouth Carolina played many of its youngest players who coach Will Muschamp believes will be a big part of the future. Quarterbacks Dakereon Joyner and Jay Urich saw time late and freshman tailback Deshaun Fenwick ran for 112 yards and a touchdown in his most significant action this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nChattanooga's season is complete.\n\nSouth Carolina travels to state rival Clemson next Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The college football spotlight isn't too bright for UCF.\n\nThe 11th-ranked Knights feel they are one of the best teams in the country and welcome any opportunity to strut to their stuff on a grand stage.\n\nMcKenzie Milton threw for 268 yards and accounted for four touchdowns Saturday night, helping the defending American Athletic Conference champions remain unbeaten and extend the nation's longest winning streak to 23 games with a 38-13 rout of No. 19 Cincinnati.\n\nThey did it in a nationally televised, prime-time matchup that capped a day in which Orlando became the epicenter of college football, with ESPN's \"College GameDay\" broadcasting from the UCF campus for the first time and giving the Knights the type of national exposure they've craved for much of their winning streak.\n\n\"It's been a long time coming, a game of this magnitude,\" Milton said.\n\n\"The whole weekend was a great opportunity for us to introduce ourselves,\" coach Josh Heupel added. \"I think it's the first chance some people have had to see our university, see the great players we have, the passion of our fans and the atmosphere in our stadium. ... I hope they like what they saw.\"\n\nMilton passed for three TDs without an interception and scored on a 3-yard run as the Knights (10-0, 7-0) clinched the AAC East Division title and a spot in the league's championship game for the second straight year.\n\nThe junior from Kapolei, Hawaii, rebounded from losing a fumble Cincinnati recovered in the end zone for a touchdown on UCF's first offensive play to complete 13 of 25 passes, including TDs of 17 yards and 42 yards to Adrian Killins and 36 yards to Tre Nixon.\n\nMalik Clements' goal-line sack and Kimoni Fitz's fumble recovery gave the Bearcats (9-2, 5-2) the early lead, but Cincinnati didn't get in the end zone offensively until Tavion Thomas scored on a 1-yard run nearly six minutes into the fourth quarter.\n\n\"That was a tough one,\" Cincinnati coach Luke Fickell said. \"The things that we pride ourselves on the entire year, in terms of playing complementary football, didn't happen tonight. There's not one finger to point. We have to play well in all three phases, and we didn't play well enough in any of the three phases tonight.\"\n\nThe first sign it might not be Cincinnati's night came when Cole Smith the missed the extra point after Fitz's TD.\n\nEven though the Bearcats eventually finished with 379 yards total offense to UCF's 402, the team's struggles were compounded when Smith missed a 38-yard field goal and then had 41-yarder blocked and returned 53 yards to set up the first of Milton's two TD passes to Killins.\n\nThe Bearcats also wasted an opportunity to trim a 21-6 deficit when UCF's Titus Davis sacked Desmond Ridder, forcing a fumble after Cincinnati drove inside the Knights 20 in the final minute of the opening half.\n\n\"We generated some momentum early in the game and gave it right back to them, whether it was a missed field goal or extra point or something like that,\" Fickell said. \"When you're playing the champs, when you're playing a team as good as they are, you can't have mishaps like that.\"\n\nTITLE GAME\n\nUCF will host the AAC championship game on Dec. 1.\n\nLOTS OF YARDS, LITTLE SCORING\n\nThe Bearcats moved the ball better than the lopsided result suggests, finishing with 252 yards rushing.\n\nRidder completed 11 of 26 passes for 127 yards and no interceptions.\n\nA week after rushing for 151 yards and scoring four TDs, including one receiving, Michael Warren II was limited to 81 yards on 18 attempts. And for only the second time this season, he failed to score a touchdown. Thomas had 79 yards rushing on 12 carries and Ridder added 70 yards rushing on 20 attempts.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nCincinnati: The Bearcats are back in the national spotlight after only winning four games a year ago in their first season under Fickell. They were beaten soundly Saturday night. Still, the future appears bright, considering they have an underclassman-laden roster that includes 35 true freshmen.\n\n\"We've still got a ways to go. I felt it tonight,\" Fickell said. \"I'm not saying we couldn't win but I still believe we've got a ways to go. I'm not going to lie to my guys. I want them to know that this is what we're going to shoot for.\"\n\nUCF: Milton has thrown for at least one touchdown in 23 consecutive games. The Knights have also scored at least 30 points in every game throughout their school- and conference-record winning streak. They'll go for their second straight undefeated regular season next week against intrastate rival South Florida.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nUCF remained one of four unbeaten teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision, along with Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame, but needed lots of outside help that didn't materialize Saturday to climb much higher than their current spot at No. 11. The Knights were 11th in the latest College Football Playoff rankings. Winning will keep them in the conversation for the CFP, however it won't silence critics who say they are undeserving of a berth because of the strength of their schedule.\n\nOnce again, Heupel defended the quality of the conference, adding that Cincinnati is a \"really good\" team that could go into any league and play \"championship-caliber football.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCincinnati: Home vs. East Carolina on Friday.\n\nUCF: At South Florida on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He missed the first five with a sprained ankle, but the team said his absence on Saturday was for \"personal reasons.\"\n\nBut Oklahoma City was in control most of the night anyway, leading by as many as 18 points and beating the Suns for the third time this season with two of the victories coming without Westbrook.\n\nGeorge said the Thunder just know each other well.\n\n\"We've been together,\" he said. \"I can't say that enough. There's no more confusion, there's no more trying to figure it out. We know what to do. We've been together long enough now to know what to do in those moments.\"\n\nT.J. Warren scored 23, Deandre Ayton 21 and Devin Booker 16 for Phoenix, which was trying to win consecutive games for the first time this season after beating San Antonio on Wednesday night.\n\nThe rookie Ayton was able to score, but still had a rough night against the physical Adams.\n\n\"That's a tough matchup,\" Suns coach Igor Kokoskov said. \"As we know, Steven Adams is one of the most dominant five-men in the league right now. ... I think he (Ayton) competed in every play, he was more vocal, he was better than the first game, second game.\"\n\nAyton said the Thunder \"just made their shots and got to the line more than us. I know that we played and I know that we competed. The emotions were flowing on the bench. Everybody was really into it. ... Every game we play against them we get better and better.\"\n\nThe Thunder outscored Phoenix 17-4 to start the second half, capped by an 11-0 run that put Oklahoma City up 64-46 on George's 20-footer with 7:05 left in the third quarter. Booker and Josh Jackson each sank 3s in an 8-0 spurt that cut it to 64-54. But Oklahoma City, dominating the game inside, rebuilt the lead to 18 before Jamal Crawford scored the last four points of the quarter to cut the Thunder's advantage to 79-65 entering the fourth.\n\nDown 93-78 after George's two free throws with 5:27 to play, the Suns mounted an 11-2 run to cut it to 95-89 on Warren's 3-pointer with 3:45 remaining. But Adams scored on an offensive rebound and broke free for a dunk and was fouled for a three-point play to boost the lead to 100-89. Phoenix never came closer than seven after that.\n\n\"If you don't defend the 3-point line, it changes in a hurry,\" Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan said, \"and that's what really changed the game but I give our guys credit when it got to six. We kind of closed out, made some plays, got it back up to 10 and it was 10 the last two minutes of the game.\"\n\nThe game was close through a sloppy first half, when neither team could shoot better than 38 percent.\n\nOklahoma City led 47-42 at the break, despite 12 turnovers.

(AP Photo/Ron Jenkins) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 Luka Doncic gave the Dallas Mavericks a glimpse of an exciting future \u2014 and extended a bad week for the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe rookie scored 24 points, including a short jumper that put Dallas in front for good, and the Mavericks beat the Warriors 112-109 on Saturday night.\n\nThe 19-year-old from Slovenia arrived in the NBA having led Real Madrid to the 2018 Euro League title. On Saturday, he hit a 10-footer in the lane with 1:10 left to put Dallas up 109-108, then sealed the game with two free throws with seven seconds remaining.\n\n\"I've been doing this when I was in Madrid, too,\" Doncic said. \"I love the last-minute shot. (But) of course it's different. It's the NBA. It's the best league in the world.\"\n\nGolden State played without injured starters Stephen Curry and Draymond Green and lost for the fourth time in six games. The Warriors dropped back-to-back games for the first time this season, and Saturday they led by eight points in the second half before the Mavs rallied.\n\nKevin Durant scored 32 points, but only three in the fourth quarter on 1-for-7 shooting. Klay Thompson added 22 for the two-time defending NBA champions. Durant missed two shots and Thompson one in the final minute, all of which could have either tied the game or put Golden State ahead.\n\n\"You don't set NBA records being frustrated,\" Thompson said. \"I'm not going to go over here and dwell on missing a couple of shots, missing a game-tying shot this early in the season.\"\n\nHarrison Barnes had 23 points for the Mavericks, who have won four in a row. It was just the second time Dallas has beaten Golden State in their past 19 meetings, the other coming on Dec. 30, 2015 \u2014 one of only nine games the Warriors lost that regular season.\n\nAn 8-0 Mavs run early in the fourth quarter, capped by Dwight Powell's three-point play, gave Dallas its first lead since early in the third quarter, 93-92, with 9:18 to play. After Golden State surged ahead again, the Mavericks hung tough and Dorian Finney-Smith's fast-break layup put Dallas back up 107-106 with 1:45 remaining.\n\n\"Our guys worked incredibly hard to wear on them throughout the game and we made their shots a little more difficult,\" Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. \"When you work as hard as we did, you get luck to go your way.\"\n\nIn addition to missing Curry (left groin strain) and Green (right toe sprain) in the midst of this rough stretch, the Warriors are still trying to repair the bad feelings caused by Green's dust-up Monday night with Durant and subsequent suspension.\n\n\"Just trying to move forward,\" Durant said. \"Are we going to talk about this the whole year? We just want to play ball. I know that's all I want to do.\"\n\nCOULDA COST THEM\n\nDallas, a 76 percent free throw-shooting team for the season, struggled in going 22 of 34 at the line, though Doncic came through when it mattered most. Dennis Smith Jr. was 2 for 7, and Barnes was an uncharacteristic 7 for 11.\n\n\"I love that we are getting to the line, to put a positive bent on it,\" Carlisle said.\n\nREPLACEMENTS COME THROUGH\n\nThe Warriors got valuable contributions from reserves Quinn Cook and Damion Lee, the latter playing on a two-way contract. Cook scored 15 points and Lee a season-high 13.\n\nLee had 11 first-half points, the same amount he had scored in 24 minutes of action all season prior to Saturday. He had eight points in a 22-11 second-quarter run that gave Golden State a 44-37 lead.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWarriors: Durant and coach Steve Kerr received technical fouls for protesting when Durant was called for traveling after being bumped in a Mavericks double-team with 1:01 left in the first quarter. Barnes' ensuing free throws gave Dallas its biggest lead, 26-18. ... Kerr said Green would \"almost for sure\" miss the team's game Sunday at San Antonio and then be re-evaluated before the Warriors host Oklahoma City on Wednesday. ... Curry said he was hopeful he would return to action later this month as he continues his rehab.\n\nMavericks: Wesley Matthews missed his second game in the past three with a left hamstring strain.

(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Even Henrik Lundqvist was impressed with his company.\n\nLundqvist passed Jacques Plante for seventh on NHL goaltender wins list with his 438th victory, and the New York Rangers beat the Florida Panthers 4-2 on Saturday night for their fifth consecutive home win.\n\n\"To look at that list there are some really good goalies who played a huge part in the history of the game,\" said Lundqvist, who had 39 saves. \"It means a lot to me but as a goalie it also means you've been part of some really good teams.\"\n\nChris Kreider had a goal and two assists for New York, which has won three of four overall. Vladislav Namestnikov, Brendan Smith and Filip Chytil also scored.\n\nNamestnikov gave the Rangers a 3-2 lead with his second of the season 2:37 into the middle period. The goal was disputed by the Panthers, but officials ruled the puck crossed the line behind Panthers goaltender Roberto Luongo.\n\n\"That controversial call, obviously, I think that affected the game,\" Florida coach Bob Boughner said. \"Confused, I still don't understand. I think it should have been 2-2 going into the third.\"\n\nKreider helped put it away with a power-play score 7:49 into the third. Lundqvist picked up an assist on Kreider's team-leading 11th goal.\n\nThe 36-year-old Lundqvist is 7-6-2 this season. The stylish Swede is the only goaltender in league history with 20 wins in 13 straight seasons.\n\n\"He did what he has been doing all year for us,\" Rangers coach David Quinn said. \"He's an elite goaltender.\"\n\nMike Hoffman had a goal and an assist for Florida, which dropped to 1-2 on a six-game trip. Aaron Ekblad also scored, and Luongo made 20 saves.\n\nThe 39-year-old Luongo is the only active goaltender with more wins than Lundqvist with 475. But he placed much of the blame for the loss on himself.\n\n\"Obviously I'm not happy with the first couple of goals I let in,\" he said. \"I have to be better than that. It's on me to bail them out when there's mistakes made but that's how hockey goes.\"\n\nThe Rangers bounced back nicely after a 7-5 loss to the Islanders in Brooklyn on Thursday, defeating the Panthers for the second time this season. New York started its current home winning streak with a 5-2 victory against Florida on Oct. 23.\n\nSince the start of the 2013-14 season, the Rangers are 12-2-3 against the Panthers. Lundqvist is 18-5-2 against Florida since November 2009.\n\nChytil opened the scoring at 3:03 of the first with his third goal in three games. The 19-year-old forward went without a goal in his first 17 games this season.\n\n\"I'm focused on every shift, this is my game,\" said Chytil, who played on a line centered by Kevin Hayes with Krieder on left wing. \"I feel great out there.\"\n\nHoffman tied it with a laser shot past Lundqvist at 4:40, extending his team-record point streak to 15 games. Hoffman has eight goals and nine assists during his streak.\n\nEkblad then put the Panthers in front at 10:11 with a one-timer past Lundqvist for his third goal of the season.\n\nNew York tied it 11:49 into the first when Smith, a healthy scratch by Quinn the previous three games, scored his second of the season. The defenseman found space between Luongo and his right post.\n\n\"I was fortunate to put that one past Luongo,\" Smith said. \"It was a good thing to get that one. We got timely goals.\"\n\nNOTES: Rangers F Ryan Strome, who was acquired Friday in a trade with Edmonton for Ryan Spooner, made his New York debut on a line with Jimmy Vesey and Brett Howden. ...

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The Texas Longhorns are on a late-season stampede toward the Big 12 title game. And given how things are unfolding around them and a sudden resurgence on defense, they like where they stand.\n\nNow if only quarterback Sam Ehlinger's throwing shoulder will hold up.\n\nEhlinger ran for a touchdown and passed for another before leaving with an injury after a hard hit late in the second quarter, and No. 13 Texas smothered Iowa State freshman quarterback Brock Purdy in a 24-10 victory Saturday night that pushed the Longhorns a big step closer to a berth in the league championship game.\n\nTexas (8-3, 6-2, No. 15 CFP) is in second place in the Big 12 and can get to the title game with a win at Kansas next week. Texas hasn't won the Big 12 since 2009. The Longhorns have won eight games for the first time since 2013.\n\nAnd lurking out there are potential title-game rematches of Texas' wildest games of the year: a 48-45 win over Oklahoma and a 42-41 loss to West Virginia.\n\nTexas can even get to the title game if it loses to Kansas, but Oklahoma beats West Virginia and Iowa State beats Kansas State next week.\n\nTexas isn't ready to talk about those scenarios yet.\n\n\"We're overachieving right now. We're winning on toughness. We're winning on grit,\" coach Tom Herman said. \"Coming from where we came from and where this program was ... we've still got a lot of football left to play.\"\n\nTexas running back Tre Watsons said the Longhorns have to \"finish the journey.\"\n\n\"We put ourselves in position to have a shot,\" Watson said.\n\nShane Buechele took over for Ehlinger after halftime and his 27-yard touchdown pass to Lil'Jordan Humphrey with 36 seconds left in the third quarter put the game out of reach. Buechele was 10 of 10 for 89 yards.\n\nIt was the second time this season Buechele has come after an Ehlinger injury and guided Texas to a win. Ehlinger injured the same shoulder against Baylor.\n\n\"Nobody is surprised when Shane comes in and doesn't miss a beat,\" Herman said.\n\nThe Texas defense played its best game in weeks with a mix of blitzes that chased Purdy all night, sacking him five times. The No. 18 Cyclones (6-4, 5-3, No. 16 CFP) also played the first half without running back David Montgomery, who was suspended for throwing a punch against Baylor a week earlier.\n\nPurdy had led the Cyclones to five consecutive wins since taking over the offense, finished with 130 yards on 10 of 23 passing.\n\n\"They were the more physical football team,\" Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \"We struggled to tackle, struggled to win at the line of scrimmage.\"\n\nAfter allowing 114 points and more than 1,600 yards the previous three games, Texas allowed the Cyclones just 225 yards and allowed the fewest points this season.\n\n\"People thought we forgot how to play defense,\" Herman said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa State: The Cyclones melted under the pressure of their biggest Big 12 game in years. The game didn't look too big for Purdy, he just didn't have any help when he needed it. Missing Montgomery for a half was critical because it not only took him off the field in running plays, it further exposed Purdy under a relentless pass rush without him there as an passing outlet or a blocker.\n\nWhen Montgomery finally got in, he ran for 33 yards on 10 carries and scored Iowa State's only touchdown.\n\n\"I learned so much just being out the first half, not being able to stand on the sideline with my guys. I let my emotion overtake the game,\" Montgomery said.\n\nTexas: Ehlinger's shoulder injury will make Texas nervous. Herman said an X-ray showed no signs of a fracture but there will be more tests on Sunday. Herman said Ehlinger had wanted to get back in the game but pain would have limited any long throws.\n\nThe Longhorns at least have the luxury of having Buechele, who was the full-time starter in 2016 and part of 2017. But if Ehlinger can't return next week, Texas fans will remember that Buechele was the starter when Texas lost at Kansas in 2016, a defeat that pushed coach Charlie Strong out after that season.\n\nBIG MAN HUMPHREY\n\nHumphrey keeps using his big body to abuse defenses. He made another move-the-pile catch in the first half when he pushed a pile of seven tacklers about 10 yards. Then he broke two tackles on his touchdown. Humphrey caught the game-winning score the previous week against Texas Tech and now has 70 catches for 1,033 yards and eight touchdowns on the season.\n\n\"He's our best player,\" Herman said.\n\nLOST TITLE HOPES\n\nIowa State started the game with the same \"win and get in\" title game hopes Texas did.

(AP Photo/Veronica Dominach) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Anthony Davis had 10 field goals for New Orleans against Denver on Saturday night. That's not a bad total, but it doesn't begin to tell the whole story about how he carried the Pelicans.\n\nDavis added 20-for-21 shooting from the free throw line and finished with 40 points, eight rebounds and eight assists as the Pelicans defeated the Nuggets 125-115 Saturday night.\n\nDavis' performance on Saturday followed a 43-point effort a night earlier in a win over New York.\n\n\"It's pretty hard to stop him, especially when he gets in a groove like that,\" said Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday, who overcame foul trouble to finish with 19 points and match Davis' assists. \"We don't think anyone can guard him in the first place.\"\n\nJulius Randle had 21 points and 10 rebounds, Nikola Mirotic had 20 points and 10 rebounds and E'Twaun Moore scored 13 for New Orleans, which won for the fifth time in six games.\n\nNikola Jokic had 25 points and 10 rebounds, Gary Harris scored 24, Juancho Hernangomez had 20 points and 11 rebounds, Monte Morris came off the bench to add 13 and Jamal Murray had 11 for the Nuggets, who lost for the fifth time in six games.\n\nDavis' assists tied a career-high and it was his seventh game with at least six assists this season. In his previous six seasons, he had just eight such games.\n\n\"I just realized that a lot of teams are scouting for me,\" Davis said. \"They didn't want me to go off I guess, so I'm just trying to find guys and guys are playing with a lot of confidence and making shots. They know and I know where they are going to be and they know where I like them to be.\"\n\nThe Pelicans made 31 of 34 free throws, and the Nuggets made 8 of 13.\n\n\"I felt we were doing things that should've generated some more free throws,\" Denver coach Michael Malone said. \"Obviously, the referees didn't see it that way tonight. They saw them getting fouled quite a bit.\"\n\nThe Pelicans, who rallied from a 19-point deficit against the Knicks, had a much easier time against the Nuggets.\n\nThough Denver got off to a fast start, New Orleans took the lead late in the first quarter and never trailed again.\n\nDavis scored 12 points as the Pelicans held a 37-35 lead after the first quarter. He wound up with 12 at halftime as his team clung to a 70-67 halftime lead and even though he had just four points in the third quarter, New Orleans took a 98-88 lead into the final period.\n\nThe Nuggets got within seven points three times early in the fourth quarter, but Davis and Holiday scored four points each during an 8-0 run that gave New Orleans a 110-95 lead midway through the quarter.\n\nThe closest Denver got after that was nine points.\n\n\"It's hard to stop him,\" Jokic said of Davis. \"He's a really great player. We didn't do a good job tonight.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNuggets: Denver was coming off a season-high point total in a 138-93 home victory against Atlanta on Monday. . The Nuggets outscored the Pelicans 58-82 in the paint.\n\nPelicans: The Pelicans had four scorers in double figures by the middle of the second quarter. ... Randle had all but six of the points and four of the rebounds that came from New Orleans' bench. . Holiday went to the bench midway through the third quarter after committing his fourth foul.\n\nPAYTON OUT INDEFINITELY\n\nPelicans G Elfrid Payton will see a hand surgeon next week to get an evaluation of the broken little finger on his left hand that he sustained against the Knicks on Friday. It was Payton's first game back in the lineup after missing nine straight due to a sprained right ankle.\n\nJOKIC COOLS OFF\n\nJokic leads the Nuggets with a scoring average of 17. 1 points per game, and he surpassed that in the first quarter. But after scoring 18 first-quarter points, Jokic cooled off. He finished with 25 points, the team-high, on 10-of-20 shooting and had 10 rebounds.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNuggets: Denver visits Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nPelicans: New Orleans hosts San Antonio on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Kyler Murray lifted Oklahoma \u2014 and boosted his Heisman Trophy campaign \u2014 with a big finish.\n\nThe sixth-ranked Sooners used every bit of offense from Murray to overshadow a huge game from Kansas freshman running back Pooka Williams Jr. in Oklahoma's 55-40 victory Saturday night\n\nMurray accounted for two of his five touchdowns in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"He's a special player,\" Kansas coach David Beaty said. \"That Heisman needs to go to him.\"\n\nOklahoma (10-1, 7-1 Big 12, No. 6 CFP) moved closer to a spot in the conference championship game in Murray's likely final home game. The Sooners earn a trip to the Big 12 title game for the second straight year by beating West Virginia on the road on Black Friday or if Kansas beats Texas.\n\nThat came just days after Oklahoma began a campaign for the baseball first-round draft pick centered around a classic image of Bo Jackson in shoulder pads while holding a baseball bat.\n\n\"I don't know whose idea it was, but I felt good about it,\" Murray said. \"It was fun. It was a once-in-a-lifetime deal.\"\n\nBut Murray was nearly outperformed by Williams.\n\nWilliams rushed for a career-high 252 yards and two touchdowns and threw for a score for Kansas (3-8, 1-7). The Jayhawks have lost seven of the past eight games.\n\nMurray sealed the game with a breakaway 75-yard touchdown run with 13:44 remaining, sparking a 20-point fourth quarter. He added another touchdown in the quarter and finished with 272 yards passing and two touchdowns. He rushed for 99 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nIt was the second time Murray had appeared to establish control for the Sooners.\n\nOklahoma led 21-17 early in the third quarter when Murray broke free for an 11-yard touchdown run. Backup running back Kennedy Brooks, filling in for injured Trey Sermon, followed with a 13-yard score to cap a night he rushed for 171 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"He did a great job,\" Murray said. \"I'm sure he'll continue to run well.\"\n\nBut Oklahoma's defense continued to struggle. The Sooners allowed 524 total offensive yards, and Kansas found a way to remain in the game.\n\n\"Defensively, we didn't tackle at all, really the whole night\" Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said. \"That's the whole story.\"\n\nOklahoma took a 48-24 lead with 12:05 remaining when Kyle Thompson blocked a punt and Curtis Bolton scooped and scored and appeared to be in control.\n\nBut Williams answered with a 42-yard touchdown run and Kansas converted the two-point conversion.\n\nMurray responded with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Grant Calcaterra. Kansas would answer with a 25-yard touchdown run by Khalil Herbert on the play following a 25-yard run by Williams.\n\n\"I still feel like we can be what we need to be,\" Riley said. \"Obviously, we didn't take the step this week that we needed to take. We felt like we had defended the run well all year. We put a lot of emphasis on our pass coverage, which we thought was better.\n\n\"We sprung some new leaks.\"\n\nOklahoma still has Murray. At the moment, that's enough.\n\nDEFENSIVE VIBE\n\nEven with struggles, Riley still believes the Sooners can perform when it counts on defense.\n\nBut they still allowed 40 points to a Kansas team that had combined for just 39 points in the previous five meetings combined between the two teams.\n\n\"This isn't the NFL,\" Riley said. \"We're not going to sign some guys off waivers.\n\n\"These moments, especially this one we're getting ready to go into, we can't sit here and feel sorry for ourselves.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nKansas: With David Beaty nearing his final week as coach, the Jayhawks have something to build from offensively. Outside of Williams' night, Peyton Bender completed 16 of 23 passes for 145 yards and the Jayhawks rushed for 348 yards.\n\nOklahoma: The Sooners' embattled defense did itself no favors. It entered the game allowing 416 yards per game, a total Kansas eclipsed in the fourth quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKansas: The Jayhawks host No. 13 Texas next week in their season finale.\n\nOklahoma: The Sooners have never lost to West Virginia since the Mountaineers joined the Big 12 in 2012.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He's in the top 10 for scoring.\n\nAnd with four more assists, he'll crack the top 10 in that category as well.\n\nThat all-around game from the 6-foot, 10-inch forward was on full display Saturday as his third straight double-double to open the season led Wisconsin to an easy 96-59 win over Houston Baptist.\n\nThe Huskies (1-2) had no answer for Happ, who scored 15 points and grabbed a game high 12 rebounds for Wisconsin (3-0).\n\nThat included rebound No. 905 in the first half, pushing him past Claude Gregory, who played for the Badgers from 1978-81. Happ now has 911 for his career.\n\n\"It's definitely something that my dad instilled in me when I was little, just to work on your ball handling, your passing, all facets of your game and don't just limit yourself to one area even though I was a little taller than a lot of the other kids,\" said Happ, whose six assists put him at 293 for his career.\n\nThe game was never in doubt as the Badgers built their first double-digit lead six minutes into the game, pushed it to 21 a little more than halfway through the first half and crossed the 30-point mark early in the second half.\n\nHapp, who played point guard through his freshman year of high school, recorded 17 assists in Wisconsin's first two games, and he could have had more than the six he had Saturday. At one point, he led the fast break, put on a nice spin move short of half court and flipped a behind-the-back pass to D'Mitrik Trice in the corner. But the 3-point attempt rimmed out.\n\n\"He's a unique type player,\" said Houston Baptist coach Ron Cottrell said. \"He doesn't shoot from the perimeter at all and yet he just tears you up inside, and he's so fundamentally sound.\"\n\nBrevin Pritzl scored 17 points for the Badgers, who had five players score in double figures.\n\nIan DuBose led the Huskies with 18 points.\n\nTO THE MONITOR -- YET AGAIN\n\nThe new emphasis on calling the \"hook and hold\" produced four trips to the monitors so referees could review plays. Officials are trying to crack down on offensive players using their \"off\" arm to lock elbows with a defender to make it appear the defensive player is committing a foul. Cottrell said the flagrant foul assessed on those plays seem to be called no matter what the intention was. \"They're basically doing what they're told to do,\" he said of the referees. \"They're painted in a box that they have to go to the monitor and have to look at this when it happens.\"\n\nLOOSE WITH THE BALL -- SORTA\n\nWisconsin came in leading the nation with just six turnovers per game. But the Badgers committed their seventh before the first half was even over as Brad Davison was whistled for a charge in the closing seconds while driving for a final shot attempt, and they finished with 10 for the game. Still, that's not too shabby. Their new average of just more than seven a game still has them in the top five nationally. \"There are times that we get a little erratic, so that will always be an area that will be a point of emphasis,\" said Wisconsin coach Greg Gard.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nHouston Baptist: Teams from the Southland Conference are now 0-7 against Wisconsin. The Huskies will presumably have better nights this season than playing on the road against a Big Ten team.\n\nWisconsin: It was an efficient tune-up before the Badgers face stiffer competition in the Bahamas in the Battle 4 Atlantis. The Badgers shot 67 percent in the first half, including 50 percent from the 3-point line, and were never really challenged.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHouston Baptist: The Huskies travel to Wake Forest on Friday.\n\nWisconsin: The Badgers head to the Bahamas to play Stanford\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It doesn't matter if we win 'em all. I will never be where I want to be. We've got to get better. Good enough is never good enough and we've got to keep pushing and fighting because everybody's going to come at you.\"\n\nTrayveon Williams ran for 167 yards and two touchdowns to lead Texas A&M to the 41-20 victory that snapped the Blazers' school-record eight-game winning streak.\n\nKellen Mond threw two touchdown passes to Jace Sternberger as the Aggies (7-4) got their second straight win after losing their previous two games.\n\nUAB (9-2), which clinched their first Conference USA West division title last week, lost for the first time since Sept. 8 in a mistake-filled game which included two interceptions by Tyler Johnston, a fumble returned for a touchdown, three missed field goals and a blocked extra point.\n\n\"I think the guys expected to win and expected to compete,\" UAB coach Bill Clark said. \"But any big game ... we can't make mistakes and shoot ourselves in the foot.\"\n\nFisher was disappointed that his team allowed more than 300 yards passing and that the Blazers were 10 of 16 on third down conversions.\n\n\"It was a good solid game but we need to play better,\" he said. \"We don't need to give up that many yards and give up that many third down conversions. So we've got to keep learning to play the passes better and get some more rush and get better.\"\n\nThings went wrong for the Blazers immediately, with Andre Wilson fumbling the opening kickoff, which was recovered by Larry Pryor and returned 17 yards for the score.\n\n\"To get 7 points like that to start off, that was huge,\" Fisher said.\n\nPryor called the play, which was Texas A&M's first fumble return for a TD since 2013, crazy.\n\n\"I shed a block and I looked up and the ball was in my hands,\" he said.\n\nUAB bounced back on the next possession, using a 10-play, 75-yard drive, capped by a 9-yard touchdown reception by Wilson to tie it at 7-7.\n\nThe first touchdown by Williams, a 9-yard run, put Texas A&M back on top 14-7 with about six minutes left in the first quarter.\n\nNick Vogel's first missed field came after that, with the 43-yard attempt clanging off the left upright and sailing right back at him.\n\n\"The three missed field goals were very uncharacteristic of Nick,\" Clark said. \"He's been solid for us all year.\"\n\nThe Aggies were up 17-7 early in the second quarter when Vogel missed again, this time his 44-yard attempt was blocked by Jayden Peevy.\n\nUAB was driving late in the second quarter when Donovan Wilson intercepted Johnston to give the Aggies the ball back. The second TD by Williams came a few plays later to extend Texas A&M's lead to 24-7.\n\nTexas A&M added a field goal on its first possession of the second half and Vogel's third miss came after that.\n\nSternberger extended Texas A&M's lead to 34-7 when he grabbed a 25-yard touchdown reception late in the third. His 20-yard catch extended it to 41-13 with about nine minutes left.\n\nThe Blazers recovered a fumble to set up a 10-yard TD reception by Wilson before Sternberger's second touchdown, but Vogel's extra point attempt was blocked.\n\nUAB entered the game leading the nation with a school-record 38 sacks and piled up seven in a win over Southern Miss last week. They didn't have nearly as much success in getting to the mobile Mond, sacking him just once.\n\n\"Pretty much the whole night, I felt really comfortable in the pocket,\" Mond said. \"I thought the offensive line did a really good job and Trayveon in protection as well.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUAB: The Blazers moved the ball well and looked good at times, but had far too many errors to beat a SEC team.\n\nTexas A&M: Mond didn't have a turnover after committing six in the last three games combined. He'll have to continue to play clean football next week when the Aggies host LSU for them to have a chance at the win.\n\nRECORD SETTER\n\nBraden Mann had a punt for 60 yards on Saturday night to give him 14 punts of 60 yards or longer this season to set an NCAA record. He passed Ryan Plackemeier, who had 13 in 2005 for Wake Forest.\n\nMOVING ON UP\n\nWilliams has 1,326 yards rushing this season to put him in fifth place on the school's single season rushing list. He's just the sixth player in school history to run for 1,300 yards in a season and he's also in fifth place on the school's career rushing list with 3,181 yards. The SEC's leading rusher has had four games this season with multiple touchdowns and seven 100-yard rushing games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUAB: Visit Middle Tennessee next Saturday.\n\nTexas A&M: Host LSU next Saturday night to wrap up the regular season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Clemson finished perfect in the Atlantic Coast Conference with a less than perfect performance that still ended with another blowout.\n\nThe No. 2 Tigers (11-0, 8-0, No. 2 CFP) beat Duke 35-6 on Saturday night, rebounding to win their six straight league game by at least 20 points after falling behind 6-0 and getting just one first down on their first three drives.\n\nThe early struggles were almost refreshing for Clemson coach Dabo Swinney, who said he appreciated the challenge of making adjustments and motivating his team in the locker room at half.\n\n\"You walk in, you win 35-6, and you have some people who are disappointed,\" Swinney said, smiling after the game.\n\nClemson finished the ACC season 8-0 for the second time in four seasons, The Tigers lost just one ACC game in 2016 and 2017, and will try to win a fourth straight conference title Dec. 1 against Pitt.\n\nFreshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence was 0 for 7 on third downs in the first half and the Travis Etienne ran for just 4 yards as the Tigers led 14-6 at the break.\n\nBut Etienne ran for 77 yards on four carries in the second half with touchdowns runs of 27 and 29 yards, and Lawrence broke it open with a 10-yard TD pass to T.J. Chase early in the fourth quarter \u2014 his final play in another Clemson blowout.\n\nLawrence was 21 for 38 for 251 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"We still won the game big,\" Lawrence said. \"That's what we came out here to do.\"\n\nDaniel Jones was 24 of 43 for 158 yards for Duke (7-4, 3-4). Collin Wareham made field goals of 32 and 34 yards, but missed a 42-yarder midway through the third quarter after Duke put together a 13-play drive.\n\nThe Blue Devils had 127 yards in the first quarter, then only 135 yards the rest of the game.\n\n\"We had opportunities there and we didn't take advantage of them. With a team of this caliber, it is going to catch up with you,\" Duke coach David Cutcliffe said.\n\nClemson had four sacks, keeping the Tigers among the national leaders.\n\nThe Tigers did get an injury scare. Senior Hunter Renfrow, whose catch in 2016 won the national title for Clemson over Alabama, left the game in the first quarter after setting a team record catching a pass in his 39th straight game.\n\nCo-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said Renfrow hit his head falling and should be back next week. \"He still knows when he is getting married,\" Scott said after the game.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nDuke: Those two first-quarter, red-zone drives that ended in field goals kept the Blue Devils from putting real pressure on Clemson for the first time in nearly two months. Duke also struggled, like many teams do, to get big plays on Clemson's defense. The Blue Devils only had two plays go over 20 yards. Duke has never beaten a team in the Top 3 in the AP poll. And for Blue Devils fans, there is perhaps a small bit of revenge on the horizon. The No. 1 men's basketball team hosts No. 19 Clemson on Jan. 5.\n\nClemson: The no-drama Tigers keep taking care of business after turning the offense over to Lawrence. Since the 27-23 win over Syracuse in Lawrence's first start (and where a blow to the head took him out in the second quarter), Clemson has outscored its opponents by an average of 42 points in the past six games. Clemson also finished 8-0 in the ACC for the second time in four seasons \u2014 the only times they've been 8-0 since the league's 1992 expansion. Florida State has done it nine times, but not since the Tigers took control of the league with the first of their three straight ACC titles in 2015.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS:\n\nClemson should remain second in the AP Top 25 and the College Football Playoff polls, just like the Tigers have since riding out their five-week dip after a 28-26 win at Texas A&M the second week of the season. Maybe No. 1 Alabama's 10-10 halftime score against The Citadel means the Tigers get a first place vote or two?\n\nPROTECTING THE QUARTERBACK\n\nLawrence has been sacked just once in the past six games and the freshman quarterback welcomes the protection from an offensive line that gets overshadowed a little by all the likely NFL Draft first round picks on the defensive line.\n\n\"It's really, really nice having guys like that,\" Lawrence said.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nDuke: The Blue Devils finish the regular season Saturday hosting a Wake Forest team that needs a win to be bowl eligible.\n\nClemson: The Tigers host South Carolina, looking for a fifth straight victory against their in-state rival. The Dec. 1 ACC championship game also is set against Coastal Division champ Pitt.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 When Joe Burrow found freshman receiver Ja'Marr Chase deep down the left sideline to the Rice 2, it marked the LSU's quarterback's 11th completion of 15 or more yards.\n\nAnd that was before five minutes had elapsed in the third quarter.\n\nBurrow passed for a career-high 307 yards and two touchdowns in less than three quarters, and No. 10 LSU rolled to a 42-10 victory over struggling Rice on Saturday night.\n\n\"For the confidence of this offense, it was important for us to click tonight,\" Burrow said. \"We wanted to move the ball without any hesitation or road blocks. For the most part, I think we did that.\"\n\nThe Tigers (9-2, No. 7 CFP) led 35-3 midway through the third quarter en route to a victory in which the only drama involved whether LSU would cover a point spread hovering around 44 points before kickoff.\n\nThe question now is whether the kind of passing proficiency Burrow and Co. achieved against a team on an 11-game skid translates in a meaningful way in a relatively high-stakes Southeastern Conference finale at Texas A&M next weekend. With a victory in that game, LSU can clinch its first 10-win season under coach Ed Orgeron \u2014 and virtually ensure a New Year's Day bowl bid\n\n\"No question, we've got to put the ball in athletes' hands in space and we did a better job of that tonight,\" Orgeron said. \"Obviously, it was against a lesser opponent. We're going to have to do a better job against a bigger opponent, but that's the kind of offense we need.\"\n\nBurrow's touchdowns went for 38 yards to Stephen Sullivan and 13 yards to senior tight end Foster Moreau, who finished with career highs of five catches and 71 yards receiving.\n\nNick Brossette rushed for two touchdowns for LSU, while Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Lanard Fournette also ran for short TDs.\n\nThe Owls (1-11) scored their first points on Haden Tobola's 51-yard field goal late in the first half. Juma Otoviano scored Rice's lone touchdown on a 5-yard run with 2:55 to play.\n\nRice QB Shawn Stankavage completed seven of 13 passes for 101 yards.\n\n\"We played hard for four quarters,\" Rice coach Mike Bloomgren said. \"We definitely could have played better and we need to play better.\"\n\nLSU outgained Rice 552 yards to 198. LSU defenders combined for four sacks, one each by linebackers Devin White and Jacob Phillips and defensive tackles Tyler Shelvin and Glen Logan\n\n\"We would have a lineman get whipped up front or something went wrong and those things are hard,\" Bloomgren said. \"It is hard to be behind the sticks in Death Valley against that defense.\"\n\nRice also set up for a field goal after LSU running back Jontre Kirkland's fumble gave Rice the ball on the Tigers 35 in the first quarter, but Jack Fox's 52-yard attempt sailed wide left.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nRice: Bloomgren, who is in his first season at Rice, spoke enthusiastically about the opportunity to take his team into LSU's Tiger Stadium, but reality set in pretty quickly. Bloomgren's rebuilding program wasn't likely to keep this game close unless LSU had come out flat. But Rice played a relatively clean game, committing no turnovers and just three penalties.\n\nLSU: With painful and relatively fresh memories of the Tigers' upset loss to Troy last season, Orgeron wanted to see his team take the field with energy, effort and focus. He also wanted to open up the offense to give that side of the ball more confidence heading into a challenging season finale. He got more or less what he wanted. And the big third-quarter lead allowed him to take a look at reserves who could wind up in bigger roles in upcoming seasons.\n\nBRENNAN'S CHANCE\n\nLSU backup quarterback Myles Brennan replaced Burrow in the middle of the third quarter, completing four of six passes for 65 yards, including a 39-yard pass down the right sideline to Justin Jefferson.\n\nBrennan, who had not previously played this season, will be eligible to take a redshirt and preserve a season of college eligibility under new NCAA rules.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRice hosts Old Dominion on Saturday.\n\nLSU visits Texas A&M on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top 25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Donovan Mitchell was much more efficient leading Utah in scoring this time.\n\nMitchell had 28 points and six assists, bouncing back from one of his worst performances of the season and leading the Jazz to a 98-86 win over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night.\n\n\"I didn't really do too much but just being in the right spot and keeping my mind focused on the game plan,\" said Mitchell, who also had three steals and made a big block as Utah pulled away in the fourth quarter.\n\nAlthough he scored 31 Friday night in Philadelphia, he made only 13 of 35 attempts and didn't have an assist as the Jazz lost to the 76ers 113-107. Against Boston, he was 10 for 21 from the field and 3 for 4 at the free-throw line.\n\n\"I had no time to think about it. I didn't watch the film from the game, actually,\" Mitchell said. \"Didn't even think about that game. Just went out there and hooped.\"\n\nRicky Rubio scored 20 points for Utah, which beat Boston for the second time in eight days and swept the season series. Rudy Gobert had 12 points and nine rebounds, and Derrick Favors finished with 10 points and eight boards.\n\nUtah improved from 15 assists in Philadelphia to 23 against the Celtics.\n\n\"We a lot of guys that can make shots, and when we move the ball, find the open man, we shoot with more confidence and they go in,\" Gobert said.\n\nBoston scored its fewest points since a 93-90 loss at Orlando on Oct. 22.\n\n\"We have to build a tougher team mindset than we have,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said.\n\nKyrie Irving had 20 points for the Celtics, who had won two in a row. Jayson Tatum finished with 10, but no other player scored in double figures for Boston.\n\n\"There are times when we play really tough. And then we just have, for whatever reason, moments in the game that turn into extended moments in the game when we're not,\" said Gordon Hayward, who was held to seven points against his former club. \"We've got to figure out how we can play a full 48 minutes and then do it again the next night when we play. We're still not there yet.\"\n\nThe Celtics were just 8 for 26 from the field in the third quarter. They had to play much of the period without Irving, who fouled Mitchell on a 3-pointer with 5:40 left. Mitchell made all three from the line to put Utah up 68-55, and then Irving picked up his fifth foul just 28 seconds later.\n\nIrving returned in the fourth, but Boston was unable to catch up. Mitchell blocked a dunk attempt by Hayward and Utah took it the other way for an alley-oop dunk by Favors from Geoges Niang to put the Jazz up 83-64 with 9:07 left to play.\n\nUtah ended a two-game losing streak, which started with a 118-68 loss at Dallas on Wednesday.\n\nDAY AFTER\n\nThe Celtics were coming off a 123-116 overtime win against Toronto. After shooting 52.8 percent Friday against the Raptors, the Celtics struggled to make 35 of 91 shots against the Jazz and went 11 of 20 from the foul line.\n\nStevens had seen enough and pulled most of his starters with about eight minutes left to play.\n\n\"He felt like we really weren't going anywhere,\" said Al Horford, who scored nine for Boston. \"It can't only be one or two guys doing the things we all have to do and be consistent with it.\"\n\nDOUBLE T\n\nIn the second quarter, Irving caught Rubio on a crossover dribble, giving himself a wide-open look at a 3-pointer that got the Celtics within 49-45 with 33 seconds left in the half. There was a brief confrontation at midcourt that led to technical fouls on Boston's Marcus Smart and Utah's Joe Ingles.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nJazz: Led 50-45 at halftime despite going 4 for 11 from the foul line in the first half. ...

We lost one of our own. We're all kind of hurting in here and thinking about his family so it was good to get a win for him.\"\n\nBrady Tkachuk and Cody Ceci added goals, and Anderson made 31 saves. The Senators have won two straight to improve to 9-8-3.\n\nPittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby missed his second straight game because of an upper-body injury. The Penguins are 1-7-1 in their last nine and 7-8-3 overall.\n\nKris Letang, Zach Aston-Reese, Matt Cullen and Patric Hornqvist scored for Pittsburgh. Matt Murray allowed three goals on 10 shots in the first period, and Casey DeSmith gave up three goals on 15 shots in relief.\n\n\"We can't be sorry for ourselves,\" Letang said. \"We have all the skill in the world, but right now it's not working, so maybe put the puck at the net and make it look a little bit nasty out there.\"\n\nAfter struggling through the first two periods and finding themselves down four goals, the Penguins rallied early in the third when Aston-Reese put in his first of the season and Cullen followed to make it 5-3.\n\nBut Drake Batherson fed Duchene for a breakaway to make it 6-3. With just under four minutes remaining, the Penguins pulled DeSmith and were able to take advantage when Hornqvist tipped a shot past Anderson.\n\nNOTES: Ottawa's Max McCormick and Christian Jaros were healthy scratches. ... Derick Brassard returned to the Penguins' lineup after missing nine games with a lower-body injury. Brassard returned to Ottawa for the first time since being acquired by Pittsburgh on Feb. 23.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nPenguins: Host Buffalo on Monday night.\n\nSenators: Host Florida on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 There was a closer on the floor when the Lakers faced the Magic, and it wasn't LeBron James.\n\nNikola Vucevic had 36 points, including eight straight in a crucial stretch of the fourth quarter, and Orlando beat Los Angeles 130-117 on Saturday night, ending the Lakers' four-game winning streak.\n\nJames was on the bench the entire fourth quarter as the Lakers went to a small lineup to trim a 21-point deficit to just 10 with more than four minutes to play. Vucevic snuffed out the rally right there, getting a three-point play against Michael Beasley and following that with five more points to push the advantage back to 13 with just over two minutes to go.\n\n\"We have other guys who could do that, but it is a responsibility I take on myself to finish out games, especially when I have it going,\" Vucevic said. \"I had a good matchup and I wanted to keep it going, that's all.\"\n\nVucevic hit 15 of 23 shots, including 10 of 14 in the second half. He got help from D.J. Augustin, who had 22 points and seven assists, and Evan Fournier, who scored 15. Terrence Ross had 13 points and Aaron Gordon and Jonathon Simmons scored 12 each for the Magic.\n\n\"When teams downsize, they're not going to be able to guard (Vucevic) 1-on-1,\" Magic coach Steve Clifford said. \"He's either going to be able to get good shots like he did tonight, or we're going to be able to play out of double-team, where he is a great passer.\"\n\nThe Lakers got 22 points from James, 19 from Lance Stephenson and 17 from Brandon Ingram, but were down 15 early in the second half and never got closer than 10 in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I give credit to that group that was out there,\" James said. \"They continued to fight.\"\n\n\"I always appreciate guys not giving up,\" Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \"If you're up or down 20, a NBA game is never over. We gave ourselves a chance and unfortunately they hit some shots that took the lead back up.\"\n\nJames averaged 29.8 points on 55.1 percent shooting during the win streak, but wasn't much of a factor against the Magic.\n\nOrlando opened the second half with back-to-back 3-pointers from Augustin and Fournier and a dunk from Vucevic that pushed the lead to 70-55. The Lakers finally extended their defense, opening easy lanes to the basket, and Augustin and Fournier took advantage.\n\nThe two went unimpeded to the rim, feeding Vucevic, who had 16 points in the quarter, or getting easy layups for themselves. Ten of the next 11 Magic baskets were layups, and Orlando led 100-81 by the end of the third.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nLakers: Lonzo Ball is shooting 51.3 percent (19 of 37) from 3-point range, but just 17.8 percent (five of 28) in road games. ... Three Lakers reserves reached double figures, led by Stephenson's 19 points. Josh Hart had 13 and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 10.\n\nMagic: Jonathon Isaac had four blocks in the first half, including two against James. He finished with five blocks and seven points. ...

USA TODAY\n\nOhio State Buckeyes quarterback Dwayne Haskins (7) threw for three touchdowns and ran for three Saturday against Maryland. (Photo: Mitch Stringer, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTechnically, Ohio State remains alive in the hunt for the College Football Playoff. The Buckeyes\u2019 tenuous grasp on a place in the conversation survived Maryland\u2019s best shot, with a 52-51 overtime win not sealed until the Terrapins\u2019 Tyrrell Pigrome missed an open teammate in the end zone on what would\u2019ve been the deciding two-point conversion.\n\nWins are wins in college football, as in any sport, and the Buckeyes will take what they can get in what has been the rockiest season of the Urban Meyer era. With the victory, OSU proceeds into next Saturday\u2019s winner-take-all matchup with rival Michigan \u2013 a game that will decide the Big Ten East Division and send the winner one step closer to a national semifinal.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Ohio State locating the sort of performance needed to defeat what is clearly the best Michigan team since Jim Harbaugh\u2019s return to the program in 2015. The Wolverines\u2019 defense, stingy as always, has been joined by a rare addition: Shea Patterson, a legitimate NFL-level quarterback. It\u2019s a first for Michigan under Harbaugh, at least.\n\nMore: Notre Dame seems headed to playoff but why will it be different than last time vs. Alabama\n\nMore: 10 observations from Week 12 in college football\n\nIt\u2019ll be the game of the week in college football, and for good reason. The question: Which team should feel the pressure?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say Ohio State, which has cobbled together 10 wins around a failed defense and an offense that alternates explosiveness with inconsistency. In what would be a stunning twist based on the recent history of this rivalry, the Buckeyes might be underdogs on their home field against the hated Wolverines.\n\nBut the pressure is really on Michigan, which remained unbeaten in Big Ten play with Saturday\u2019s 31-20 win against Indiana. Harbaugh has yet to beat Ohio State since taking over at his alma mater; when push has come to shove, the Buckeyes have had more in the tank.\n\nThe pressure is on Harbaugh and the Wolverines because if not now \u2013 if not against this specific Ohio State team, with this specific Michigan team \u2013 then when? And the pressure is only increased by the fact that Michigan, unlike OSU, is almost certainly in a national semifinal with a win against the Buckeyes and a victory against Northwestern in the Big Ten title game.\n\nHere are the rest of Saturday\u2019s winners and losers:\n\nWinners\n\nCentral Florida\n\nUCF just keeps on winning, the latest a breeze past Cincinnati in a game billed as a showdown between two of the best teams from the Group of Five. Well, the pregame billing was half right. Cincinnati\u2019s not a bad team, if not quite as good as the Bearcats\u2019 9-2 record suggests. UCF is simply a very good team, not only the best from the American Athletic Conference but likely again the top team from the non-major conferences.\n\nTexas\n\nTopping Iowa State 24-10 gives Texas eight wins in the regular season for the first time since the Mack Brown era and, in conjunction with West Virginia\u2019s loss to Oklahoma State, has the Longhorns right on the precipice of reaching the Big 12 championship game. The win total alone has made Tom Herman\u2019s second season a success. Reaching the title game is another major milestone.\n\nFlorida State\n\nThis isn\u2019t the season Florida State\u2019s fan base was hoping for from Willie Taggart\u2019s debut, but a 22-21 win against Boston College may provide the sort of boost Taggart and the Seminoles need to build toward 2019. Topping the Eagles also brings FSU one step closer to maintaining college football\u2019s longest bowl streak, though that demands a win against Florida in next week\u2019s rivalry meeting.\n\nPittsburgh\n\nThe Panthers clinched the ACC Coastal Division with a 34-13 win at Wake Forest. Now 7-4 overall and 6-1 in league play, Pittsburgh has been one of the success stories of the season\u2019s second half. And as a reward? Congratulations, Pittsburgh: Clemson will be waiting in early December. Regardless of what happens in the ACC title game, this has been a terrific season for the Panthers and coach Pat Narduzzi, who has erased any doubt over his ability to lift this program into New Year\u2019s Six bowl contention.\n\nNebraska\n\nThe 9-6 slugfest with Michigan State marked Nebraska\u2019s fourth win in five tries after an 0-6 start, with the one setback a 36-31 loss at Ohio State. The progress has been clear and undeniable: Scott Frost has the Cornhuskers storming into the offseason behind a younger cast of contributors. Look for Nebraska to be one of the trendy teams of the offseason.\n\nUtah State\n\nThe Aggies won a thriller at Colorado State 29-24 to move to 10-1 heading into next week\u2019s key divisional matchup with Boise State. Utah State\u2019s 10-game winning streak on the heels of a loss to Michigan State to open the year has this program in the midst of the most successful regular season in its history.\n\nThe Citadel\n\nThe Bulldogs were tied 10-10 with mighty Alabama at halftime. The final score was 50-17. But who cares? The Citadel scored 10 more points in 30 minutes against Alabama than LSU and Mississippi State combined. The Bulldogs should\u2019ve taken a team photo on the field at halftime.\n\n***\n\nLosers\n\nSyracuse\n\nThe neutral-site matchup with Notre Dame provided Syracuse with an opportunity to make national noise and secure a spot in a New Year\u2019s Six bowl. Instead, the Orange\u2019s potent offense managed just three points and never put any fear into what is shaping up to be an outstanding Notre Dame defense.\n\nIllinois\n\nYou\u2019d laugh if it weren\u2019t so painfully sad. Illinois paid coach Lovie Smith an ungodly sum of money \u2013 six years at $21 million \u2013 in March of 2016, at a time when no other program in the country even had Smith on its shortlist of candidates for a potential opening. The results have been uninspiring since the start, but Saturday was something off-the-charts horrific: Iowa beat the Illini 63-0 to match the program\u2019s worst margin of defeat in its history. The last time Illinois lost by 63 points was to University of Chicago in 1906.\n\nLouisville\n\nAnother week, another ugly showing from the Cardinals. This week\u2019s story: North Carolina State dropped 52 points and 518 yards of offense in a 42-point win. The first piece of good news is that Louisville lost without Bobby Petrino, who was fired last week, and it\u2019s better to lose without Petrino than with. And the best news? Louisville is one game closer to closing a miserable season.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nThe Mountaineers\u2019 playoff hopes ended in a 45-41 loss to Oklahoma State, and if you think that\u2019s painful consider the halftime score: 31-14 in West Virginia\u2019s favor. Ouch. To make matters worse, the Mountaineers are now in a tough spot in terms of reaching the Big 12 championship game. A win next week against Oklahoma should secure a major bowl, but that\u2019s the best West Virginia can hope for in 2018.\n\nVirginia Tech\n\nThe Hokies dropped to 4-6 after a 38-14 loss to Miami (Fla.), which scored 21 points in the third quarter to pull away from a game that seemed as if it could\u2019ve gone either way at halftime. What to say about the Hokies? The national perspective of this team was built on the back of a win against Florida State in the opener, which was quickly revealed as meaningless. With so many losses to personnel in the offseason and a series of injuries on both sides of the ball, maybe a losing finish shouldn\u2019t be too surprising.\n\nUConn\n\nThe Huskies lost 55-21 to East Carolina. Not much to add here.\n\nSouthern California\n\nThe clock is ticking on USC coach Clay Helton, whose team sits 5-6 after a horrendous loss to a UCLA team still rebuilding under first-year coach Chip Kelly. Both fan bases have the same thought: If Kelly is beating USC now, in his first season, will the Trojans ever beat the Bruins again? That there's doubt surrounding Helton's ability to keep USC as the dominant team in Los Angeles, let alone a team capable of winning a national championship, is why he may be coaching for his job in next week's meeting with unbeaten Notre Dame."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Hunt posts career-high 32 as E.

Oklahoma State upset West Virginia 45-41.(AP Photo/Brody Schmidt) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAs nerve-wracking as it must have been for Ohio State fans to watch the wild, back-and-forth overtime victory against Maryland , it has become just as uncomfortable to watch coach Urban Meyer endure his team's games.\n\nThe countless camera shots of Meyer bent over, hands on knees and head down, are excruciating television. As his defense allowed big play after big play to the Terrapins on Saturday, Meyer looked as if every yard was a sharp stick poking him in the neck. Each penalty on Ohio State, wiping out a positive play for the Buckeyes, seemed to zap Meyer like an electric shock.\n\n\"I'm relieved we won,\" Meyer said.\n\nThe Buckeyes coach has dealt for years with a congenital arachnoid cyst in his brain that causes what his doctor has called aggressive headaches. Meyer had surgery to address the issue in the spring of 2014.\n\nMeyer, 54, is not a sympathetic figure for most fans outside of those who root for the Buckeyes. Even in Florida, where he led the Gators to two national championships, Meyer is remembered as much for bailing out abruptly when things started going bad and leaving behind a dysfunctional team. He said health issues and a desire to spend more time with his family led him to step aside, but after a year away he landed at Ohio State, coaching the team he grew up rooting for. Meyer and the Buckeyes have been rolling ever since \u2014 80-9 with a national title.\n\nThe first taste of turmoil in Columbus for Meyer came this offseason, when he was suspended for the first three games for his handling of former assistant coach Zach Smith, who had been accused by his ex-wife of domestic abuse.\n\nMeyer has faced numerous questions since his return to the sideline about his future as Ohio State coach and his health. He has said he expects to be back in 2019. But in a season in which there has been limited drama on the field \u2014 with No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Clemson stomping toward a seemingly inevitable College Football Playoff championship matchup \u2014 whether Meyer can continue to be Ohio State coach has become the most intriguing story of 2018.\n\nAmazing as it may seem with how the ninth-ranked Buckeyes (10-1, 7-1, No. 10 CFP) have played this season, they head into the rivalry game against No. 4 Michigan (10-1, 8-0, No. 4 CFP) a victory away from winning the Big Ten East and playing for the conference title.\n\nThe playoff is still a possibility, too. But what happens at Ohio State after the games have been played?\n\nBIG 12 MADNESS\n\nIn the last four weeks, Oklahoma State has beaten No. 13 Texas, taken No. 6 Oklahoma to overtime and, now, beaten No. 7 West Virginia. Oh, and the Cowboys have also lost to Baylor.\n\nThe Big 12 race is a little bananas and Oklahoma State has epitomized the on-any-given-Saturday nature of the conference. On this Saturday, the Cowboys dealt a severe blow to both West Virginia's chances of reaching the Big 12 title game and the Mountaineers' playoff hopes. WVU led by 10 twice in the fourth quarter only to allow two touchdowns in the last five minutes.\n\nTexas beat No. 18 Iowa State with relative and surprising ease and Oklahoma allowed 40 points and more 500 yards to Kansas \u2014 and still won by two touchdowns.\n\nWest Virginia's loss means the chances of the Mountaineers and Sooners playing two straight weeks just dropped precipitously.\n\nIt will all be decided Black Friday. Texas earns a spot in the Big 12 title game by winning at Kansas. And if the Longhorns win, the winner of Oklahoma-WVU that night in Morgantown goes to the Big 12 title game the following week.\n\nIf Texas loses, it gets a little more complicated, but the Longhorns are not necessarily eliminated. Yes, the Longhorns could lose to Kansas and play for the Big 12 title \u2014 which sounds crazy but this is the Big 12.\n\nSE-SIESTA\n\nFor a half, The Citadel gave college football fans a few laughs. The Bulldogs and their triple-option were tied at half, 10-10, with No. 1 Alabama. Whoa! Early in the second half The Citadel kicked a field goal to take a 13-10, lead but a penalty took the points off the board and the re-kick was no good and that was that .\n\nThe SEC's Siesta weekend otherwise went according to plan: Eight SEC teams 398, nonconference opponents 116.\n\nAROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nHeisman Watch: Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama; Kyler Murray, Oklahom; Gardner Minshew, Washington State . That might be it for finalists. ... Oregon beat Arizona State and No. 21 Utah, which closed its conference schedule with a rout of Colorado, is the Pac-12 South champion. Been an unusual season for the Utes, with a slow start, followed by a surge, followed by some key injuries, but they will play in the conference title game for the first time since joining the Pac-12 in 2011. Utah will face the winner of the Apple Cup between No. 8 Washington State and No. 17 Washington . ... No. 11 UCF basked in the spotlight, pummeling No. 19 Cincinnati in a prime-time showcase game to run its winning streak to 23 games and clinch a spot in the American Athletic Conference championship. The Knights still have to face USF next weekend and the winner of Memphis-Houston game awaits in the AAC title game. ... Did Illinois coach Lovie Smith do something to anger Iowa's Kirk Ferentz? The Hawkeyes handed the Illini their most lopsided loss in 112 years . ... Just when it seemed Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury had worked his way off the hot seat and maybe into a contract extension, the Red Raiders have lost three straight, including a stunningly ugly setback at Kansas State. Was that K-State coach Bill Snyder's last home game? ... Pitt (7-4) joined Northwestern as unlikely division winners, blowing out Wake Forest to wrap up the ACC Coastal and its first trip to conference title game. ... In the last two weeks, USC, with a chance to win the Pac-12 South, lost to Cal for the first time in 15 years and to the worst team UCLA has fielded maybe in 30 years. Good luck, Clay Helton. ... Florida State's 36-year bowl streak is still alive after the Seminoles beat Boston College. They'll host rival No. 15 Florida next week, looking for a sixth win. ... This has been probably the best four-win season in Nebraska history. The Cornhuskers edged Michigan State for their fourth victory in the last five games. Scott Frost's team finishes at Iowa on Friday, and no matter what happens Nebraska fans have to think the program is headed in the right direction.\n\n__\n\nFollow Ralph D.

They know what it will take,\u201d said Notre Dame\u2019s Brian Kelly.\n\nThe 36-3 win on Saturday against No. 12 Syracuse will impress the Playoff selection committee, which already holds the No. 3 Irish in high esteem, and may put a slight crack into the established train of thought that has defined an eventless regular season: that there are two great teams in college football, Alabama and Clemson, and then there\u2019s everyone else.\n\nMore: Oklahoma State rallies to upset No. 7 West Virginia\n\nMore: No. 8 Ohio State keeps playoff hopes alive by surviving at Maryland in overtime 52-51\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss what they did,\u201d Syracuse coach Dino Babers said. \u201cIf they played the way they played against us they can win a national championship.\u201d\n\nThe road into a semifinal is easy. Kelly feigned ignorance at the question \u2014 \u201cI don't know that if we win our last game that we're going to the playoffs,\u201d he said \u2014 but there is no doubt undefeated Notre Dame would at worst remain third in the final rankings, and based on its resume and success against Power Five competition would\u2019ve earned a spot among the nation\u2019s top four teams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in getting compared\u201d with the two national frontrunners, Kelly said, but the comparison exists nonetheless. Notre Dame is clearly better than every team it has met since Michigan in the season opener \u2014 how that game would play out if played today is a matter of debate, though it\u2019s ultimately meaningless. And Notre Dame is good enough to have earned a berth in the national semifinals. But are the Irish good enough to beat Alabama or Clemson? Notre Dame isn\u2019t the only program to ask the question. But none are as close as the Irish to finding out the answer.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to forget the program\u2019s last foray into this conversation, a 42-14 dismantling at the hands of Alabama in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game that highlighted the enormous gap separating Notre Dame from college football\u2019s current gold standard. The lasting memory isn\u2019t of the final score, in fact, but of the full-team media availability in the days leading into kickoff: Notre Dame filed in first and was replaced by Alabama, and the difference in size and shape made it abundantly clear the Irish were lambs headed to slaughter.\n\nThere are takeaways from the Syracuse win that suggest Notre Dame could, in fact, run with the Tide and Tigers. The play of the defense bodes well for any hypothetical postseason matchup with a spread-based opponent: Syracuse had scored at least 40 points in each of its previous four games but was held to only a field goal, and a meaningless one at that, with little time left in the fourth quarter.\n\nJunior quarterback Ian Book played well, throwing for just under 300 yards with a pair of touchdowns, in his first appearance since missing last week\u2019s win against Florida State. Unheralded as a recruit, Book gives Notre Dame\u2019s passing game the depth it would need to scare an Alabama or Clemson away from the line of scrimmage.\n\nBut there were also negatives, none greater than the number of red-zone opportunities wasted even in a lopsided contest decided before the end of the first quarter. The Irish scored on six of seven drives deep into Syracuse territory, but three ended in field goals; another scoring chance ended with Book, tripping on a teammate\u2019s foot, tossing an interception in the end zone.\n\n\u201cWe just have to be a little cleaner,\u201d Kelly said,\n\nIt\u2019s enough to feed into the doubt that exists around Notre Dame. Despite its enormous pedigree, the Irish remain interlopers in the Playoff chase \u2014 this program hasn\u2019t finished in the top 10 of the Amway Coaches Poll since that 2012 season, and has lost at least four games in five of Kelly's nine seasons with the program. There simply isn\u2019t an established sense of certainty when it comes to Notre Dame, in contrast to the set-in-stone dominance of an Alabama or Clemson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there is (doubt),\u201d said senior offensive lineman Sam Mustipher. \u201cI really can\u2019t give you an answer for that. Honestly, we really don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame players and coaches speak about a different program, one bolstered by fortuitous recruiting hits \u2014 Book and Navy transfer Alohi Gilman, for example \u2014 and rejuvenated by clever hires at offensive and defensive coordinator. With one last test to come, we\u2019re about to find out just how far the Irish have come.\n\n\u201cJust because there\u2019s one week left doesn\u2019t mean the stakes have changed,\u201d said wide receiver Chase Claypool. \u201cWe\u2019re going in with the same mindset that we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Associated Press, Associated Press", "title": "Furman stuns defending champion Villanova in overtime", "description": "After being blown out by Michigan, Villanova fell to Furman in overtime at home on Saturday for its first back-to-back home losses since 2013.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/17/villanova-falls-furman-overtime-home/2044386002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/18/USAT/b8d7382b-004b-4993-8d16-b251e6f2081d-USP_NCAA_Basketball__Furman_at_Villanova.JPG?crop=4927,2756,x0,y195&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T01:58:12Z", "content": "The Furman Paladins celebrate after a victory against the Villanova Wildcats at Finneran Pavilion.

Cremo was called for a foul while going for the rebound, but Rafferty couldn\u2019t connect on the front end of a 1-and-1 with 2.6 seconds left, setting the game up for OT.\n\nRafferty said his teammates picked him up and told him to make up for the missed free throw in overtime \u2013 which he did.\n\n\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d Rafferty said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of something like this.\u201d\n\nROAR OF THE LYONS\n\nTwo days after pouring in 54 points while matching an NCAA record with 15 3-pointers in a 107-67 win over North Greenville, Lyons had more big buckets, including one that put Furman ahead 48-46 with a little over eight minutes remaining.\n\nRichey was proud of how the junior guard dealt with \u2018Nova\u2019s defense, especially after he was held to five points in the first half.\n\n\u201cHe was mature enough to know he had to play within our team concept,\u201d Richey said. \u201cHe got going in the second half.

(AP Photo/Paul Battaglia) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 A year after finishing with the worst record in the NHL, the Buffalo Sabres are making a habit of rallying in their second year under coach Phil Housley.\n\nJason Pominville scored with 1:30 remaining and Buffalo extended its winning streak to five games with a 3-2 come-from-behind victory over the Minnesota Wild on Saturday.\n\nRookie defenseman Rasmus Dahlin had his second career goal and added an assist for the Sabres, who rallied from a two-goal deficit to post their longest winning streak since 2012.\n\n\"I think it just goes to show we have a different group, different mindset and different attitude,\" Pominville said after his ninth goal of the season. \"We stuck with it, found a way, and again it just shows a lot about our group. We had a tough, tough schedule.\n\n\"Playing in Winnipeg last night, going through customs, flying here, 5 o'clock game, they didn't play. So, it shows a lot about our team.\"\n\nJake McCabe also scored and Linus Ullmark made 37 saves for Buffalo. The Sabres recovered from a 1-0 deficit on Friday in a shootout win in Winnipeg. They've won four times in 11 games when trailing after two periods.\n\n\"Coming into training camp, our conditioning, our checking detail, I think they're getting rewarded right now for that hard work,\" Housley said. \"It's tough going into Winnipeg and getting two points there, and then getting two points in Minnesota, where they've only lost one game, they're pretty deadly in this building.\"\n\nMatt Dumba scored for the third straight game and Devan Dubnyk stopped 26 shots for the Wild. Zach Parise added another goal, becoming the highest-scoring Minnesotan in NHL history. The Wild lost for just the fourth time in their last 15 games and the second time in regulation in 10 home games.\n\n\"The back-to-back games, if you could have made it 3-nothing, 4-nothing, then they would have said, 'Let's go home,'\" Minnesota coach Bruce Boudreau said. \"You're exhausted, you're tired, you're back-to-back and then you come in. But if you let them hang around, fatigue leaves you. You become more into the game and wanting to win it.\"\n\nDahlin scored with 7:02 remaining in the third, poking a loose puck past Dubnyk after the goaltender couldn't get a handle on it.\n\nPominville capitalized after Buffalo's Jack Eichel tried to grab a loose puck in the offensive zone following a dump-in. The puck trickled out to Pominville, who quickly spun and sent a shot past an unsuspecting Dubnyk.\n\n\"I think we probably could have stepped on their throats a little bit, the way the first period was going,\" Dubnyk said. \"It's always disappointing to give up a lead and especially when it's late.\"\n\nParise scored the 341st goal of his 14-year career, surpassing Dave Christian's 340 goals and previous top mark in league history for a player born in Minnesota.\n\nDumba, who signed a five-year, $30 million contract in the offseason, scored his eighth goal of the season. The total is second among defenseman in goals and just six away from the career-high 14 he scored last season.\n\nMcCabe scored his second goal of the season to start the comeback after Dahlin, the first-overall pick in this year's draft, cut through the Wild defense to spot a wide-open McCabe on the backside.\n\n\"It's so easy to play on this team because we always know, if we're down two goals, we know we're going to get back,\" Dahlin said. \"I love to have that feeling. I love to play on this team.\"\n\nNOTES: It's Buffalo's first five-game winning streak since March 19-27, 2012. It's the first time since the 2009-10 season that Buffalo has had 26 points through the first 20 games. ... Minnesota is 11-3-2 in its last 16 games against the Sabres, outscoring them 54-31 in the process. ... Wild F Joel Eriksson Ek was a healthy scratch for the first time this season. Eriksson Ek had missed six games earlier with a lower-body injury. ... D Casey Nelson returned to the lineup for Buffalo after being a healthy scratch for four straight games. ...

Harris scored a career-high 31 points and went 9-of-11 from the field and New Mexico State held off a late New Mexico rally to win 98-94 on Saturday.\n\nTerrell Brown added 20 for the Aggies (3-1).\n\nVance Jackson had 27, Anthony Mathis 22 and Corey Manigault 20 for the Lobos (2-1).\n\nBut that wasn't enough to overcome New Mexico State's hot shooting as the Aggies went 30-for 53 from the field and 12-of-23 on 3-pointers. Harris hit all six of 3-pointers.\n\n\"He had 31 on 11 shots (attempted), that's the model of proficiency,\" New Mexico State coach Chris Jans said of Harris. \"I don't know many players who can top that. It's been coming. He got into one of his zones. We've all seen that. The basket just looked like the ocean to him. He is becoming a real leader. He certainly led us to the victory.\"\n\nThe Lobos tried different defenses to slow Harris down, to little avail.\n\n\"If you start to get down to the nitty gritty, they had one terrific player tonight,\" said Lobos coach Paul Weir. \"He changed the dynamic of the game in a lot of ways. The emotional stuff you talk about or we talk about, as all that plays out, independent of that are things that are going to happen on the court. And I thought A.J. Harris was one. That was one of the best performances since I've been here of an individual on us. He was the difference in the game. He was lights out.\"\n\nNew Mexico State gained control of the game early in the second half, reeling off a 13-0 run while holding the Lobos scoreless for 4\u00bd minutes to go up 60-44, and later 75-56.\n\nBut in the final two minutes, New Mexico trimmed a 92-79 deficit to 96-94 before C.J. Bobbitt hit two foul shots with 0.7 seconds left to seal it.\n\n\"It's way more fun to win and learn from your mistakes than lose and have to grow that way,\" Jans said. \"Certainly we didn't do a very good job of managing the game down the stretch. I've got to help them better. They wouldn't go away. Credit to them, they kept fighting. They made shots, we couldn't get any stops.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNew Mexico State now has won four straight in the bitter rivalry for the first time since the 1993-94 seasons. The teams will meet again Dec. 4 in Las Cruces, N.M.\n\n\"It means a lot to us,\" Jans said. \"It didn't take me very long to figure out how important this rivalry was to our fan base and our university. So I made it important to our players. They dove into it. It's nice to start the series on the road with a win. Certainly it wasn't easy. Now they have to come back to our place in a couple of weeks.\"\n\nThe Lobos still own the overall advantage 121-100 and 36-16 in the Pit. Weir, who coached the Aggies for one season and was an assistant with New Mexico State for nine seasons before taking on the Lobos program before the 2017-18 season, is 0-3 against his former team.\n\nNEW COACH: The Aggies added New Mexico State graduate and former Los Angeles Laker assistant coach Casey Owens to its staff on Saturday as director of operations.

(Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt wasn't perfect. Far from pretty. At times, it was dirty.\n\nBut Michigan has now won 10 in a row.\n\nAnd next week, at Ohio Stadium, the Wolverines will play for everything.\n\n\"On to the next game. On to the big game. On to the championship game,\" Michigan's Jim Harbaugh said Saturday night. \"Onward.\"\n\nMichigan fought through offensive hiccups and a few defensive lapses Saturday, but still got 250 yards and a touchdown from Shea Patterson and a program-record six field goals from freshman kicker Jake Moody to notch a 31-20 win over visiting Indiana.\n\nThe win pushes Michigan to 10-1 and 8-0 in Big Ten play. A win next week at rival Ohio State (10-1, 7-1) would give the Wolverines the outright Big Ten East championship for the first time and push the Wolverines into the league title game on Dec. 1 in Indianapolis.\n\nMore: No. 8 Ohio State keeps playoff hopes alive by surviving at Maryland in overtime 52-51\n\nMore: No. 3 Notre Dame puts away Syracuse, turns eyes toward USC and unbeaten regular season\n\nHarbaugh, meanwhile, became the first Michigan coach since Fielding H. Yost to win double-digit games in three of his first four seasons in charge of the program.\n\nSaturday's win might have come at a cost, though, as senior defensive end Chase Winovich left the game in the second half after appearing to suffer an upper-body injury. Harbaugh said afterward that all X-rays and CAT scans given to Winovich, at the stadium and the hospital, came back negative. Harbaugh did not know his status for next week immediately after the game.\n\nAlso, reserve running back Berkley Edwards was carted off the field on a stretcher after taking a hit to the head late in the fourth quarter. Edwards suffered a concussion, though Harbaugh said everything else looked good \u2014 as he had feeling in his arms and legs and was responsive.\n\n\"The situation with my brother Berkley Edwards didn't sit well with myself or anybody else, that was unfortunate and kind of shook the team up,\" said senior back Karan Higdon, who ran for 101 yards and a score. \"(It was) most definitely (a cheap shot). It wasn't called for. It's football, so things happen that shouldn't but still do. Just have to continue to playing.\"\n\nAs for the game, Michigan put up more than 500 yards of total offense Saturday but ultimately found itself stalling out in the red zone far too often.\n\nMoody, who got the start over an ill Quinn Nordin, sparkled. But the offense had six drives of eight plays or more stall out into a field goal kick.\n\nMichigan also played from behind for the first time in more than a month Saturday when running back Stevie Scott made it 7-3 with a first-quarter touchdown run. Michigan ultimately took the lead back after two more Moody field goals and a 41-yard touchdown catch by Nick Eubanks, but the Hoosiers responded on a quick drive that ended with a 7-yard touchdown strike from Peyton Ramsey to Ty Fryfogle to make it 17-15.\n\nMichigan drove all the way down to the 2-yard line in the final minute of the second quarter, but bungled a short-yardage situation to end the half. After rushing for a first down with no timeouts and less than 30 seconds left, the Wolverines attempted to run a play quickly rather than spike the ball. Sean McKeon was tackled near the sideline and the official could not spot the ball before the clock expired, leaving Michigan with zero points.\n\nHarbaugh contended afterward that an Indiana player appeared to kick the ball before the spot, perhaps inadvertently.\n\n\"I asked 'Did he kick the ball?' and the response from the umpire was, 'He didn't mean to.' That doesn't seem like a judgement call. The ball was either kicked by one of their players or not, in my opinion,\" Harbaugh said. \"But that was the response. Had he meant to, maybe (it would've been different).\"\n\nMichigan's defense, which gave up a season-high 385 yards, responded with a quick three-and-out after the break before the Wolverines rattled off a 67-yard drive that was capped by a 2-yard Higdon scoring plunge. The Wolverines wouldn't trail again.\n\nMichigan's habit of not finishing long drives with touchdowns popped up again Saturday, though the Wolverines were able to grind through it, thanks in large part to Moody.\n\n\"In football, not everything's going to go your way. We overcame some adversity,\" Patterson said. \"We had a lot of long drives, didn't finish some. But (Moody) going in there and finishing for us, that was great to see.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of positives to take out of this.\"\n\nThe next game, of course, is the biggest one.\n\nOhio State improved to 10-1 on Saturday with a 52-51 overtime win at Maryland. The Buckeyes have won 13 of the last 14 meetings between these two schools, including the past six. Michigan has not won a football game in Columbus since 2000.\n\nStill, the Wolverines control their own fate with regard to the Big Ten championship and a possible playoff bid.\n\nAnd, right now, they say nothing else matters.\n\n\"It's a different game and we're going to make sure we'll handle our business,\" Higdon said. \"They still have to play us on Saturday. Nothing that happened in the past matters at this point.\""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Michelle R.

Navy won 37-29. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Navy football captain Anthony Gargiulo said teammate Zach Abey never ceases to amaze him.\n\nAbey did not complain after being moved to wide receiver prior to the season, despite leading the team in rushing and touchdowns as a quarterback last season.\n\nAbey took the change in stride and Gargiulo joked he wouldn't be surprised to see him playing center.\n\nWhen coach Ken Niumatalolo needed a spark, he let Abey retake control of the offense as the starting quarterback. The senior came up big in his final home game.\n\nAbey ran for 128 yards with a pair of touchdowns and Navy snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 37-29 victory over Tulsa on Saturday.\n\n\"I thought Zach played a great game,\" Niumatalolo said. \"I'm really proud of him. I thought Zach played tremendous.\"\n\nThe teams entered the game tied for last in the West Division of the American Athletic Conference.\n\nThe Midshipmen (3-8, 2-5 AAC) were able to distance themselves behind Abey, who was making his third straight start at quarterback and was effective running the triple-option attack.\n\n\"We ran the Navy offense,\" Abey said. \"We executed in every way. We played physical. We got after those guys and it showed. Everyone did their job.\"\n\nNavy amassed 389 yards on the ground and sent the Golden Hurricane (2-9, 1-6) to their ninth loss in 10 games.\n\nNavy slotback Malcolm Perry broke a 52-yard scamper early in third quarter that set up a short field goal by Bennett Moehring and increased its lead to 30-16. That run pushed Perry over 1,000 yards rushing for the second straight season.\n\nNavy fullback Mike Martin had a critical fumble that led to a 3-yard touchdown run by Tulsa running back Corey Taylor early in the fourth quarter. Midshipmen defensive end Jarvis Polu blocked the extra point to keep the deficit at eight points.\n\nTrey Walker answered on the ensuing possession when he took a pitch from Abey and ran 33 yards down the near sideline for a TD and a 37-22 lead.\n\nTulsa showed some life on a Taylor's third touchdown of the game with 4:46 remaining. However, Navy picked up a couple of first downs to seal the win.\n\n\"I think Navy's record is similar to ours,\" Tulsa coach Philip Montgomery said. \"They played a tough schedule. They have been in a lot of close games and the ball just has not bounced their way. I thought (Abey) was back to his old form and he made some big plays.\"\n\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Seth Boomer was 19 of 28 for 206 passing yards with an interception for Tulsa.\n\nNavy fullback Nelson Smith had a pair of first-half touchdowns that provided a 13-7 lead early in the second quarter.\n\n\"Playing Navy is tough,\" Tulsa safety Manny Bunch said. \"They have a lot of great athletes. You are not used to seeing that type of offense they run.\"\n\nNavy linebacker Austin Talbert-Loving was penalized for targeting on a kickoff return early in the second quarter and was ejected. Tulsa safety McKinley Whitfield was called for the same infraction with just under 11 minutes left in the game.\n\nTURNOVERS AID NAVY\n\nNavy has forced 20 turnovers in 11 games. Over the last six years, the Midshipmen are 32-6 when they win the turnover battle.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTulsa: The Golden Hurricane have played mostly tough this season, losing five games by nine points or less. Tulsa can continue to build around sophomore running backs Shamari Brooks and Taylor, both of whom have helped carry the offense this year.\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen have one more game to accrue added momentum before the regular-season finale against archrival Army on Dec. 8. Navy will face a stern challenge against the Black Knights, who are 9-2 and have won the past two meetings. A victory would help Navy salvage something from an overall disappointing season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTulsa: Closes out the regular season against SMU on Saturday.\n\nNavy: Travels to Tulane Saturday for the final conference game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Oklahoma State quarterback Taylor Cornelius was nearly flawless against Oklahoma last week, only to misfire on a 2-point conversion pass to Tylan Wallace in a one-point loss.\n\nOn Saturday, the connection worked. Cornelius threw a touchdown pass to Wallace with 42 seconds remaining and Oklahoma State beat No. 7 West Virginia 45-41.\n\nThe low-key Cornelius didn't show how disappointed he was in the way the Oklahoma game ended, but coach Mike Gundy had an idea how his redshirt senior felt.\n\n\"You could never see it, but you would think that inside it just tore him to pieces,\" Gundy said.\n\nIn his final home game, Cornelius passed for 338 yards and five touchdowns and ran for 106 yards and another score to help Oklahoma State (6-5, 3-5 Big 12) become bowl eligible.\n\n\"For him to be able to finish this way is a big deal,\" Gundy said.\n\nDown 31-14 at the half, the Cowboys won despite leading rusher Justice Hill sitting out with a rib injury.\n\n\"Our coaches made tremendous adjustments at halftime,\" Gundy said. \"I couldn't be prouder of them.\"\n\nChuba Hubbard rushed for a career-high 134 yards for Oklahoma State, and Dillon Stoner caught nine passes for a career-best 127 yards.\n\nGrier passed 364 yards and two touchdowns, but his Heisman campaign took a hit with the loss. Kennedy McKoy rushed for a career-high 148 yards for the Mountaineers.\n\nWest Virginia (8-2, 6-2, No. 9 CFP) faces Oklahoma next Friday and can still reach the Big 12 title game with a victory.\n\nGrier's 6-yard touchdown run on fourth down in the fourth quarter gave West Virginia a 41-31 lead, but Cornelius' 9-yard touchdown run and a stop by Oklahoma State's defense put the Cowboys in position to win.\n\nWest Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen felt his team should have been in a better position late.\n\n\"I think we left probably 14 points out there,\" he said. \"When you are in the red zone and can't punch it in \u2014 if you are a great offense, you do that.\"\n\nIt's the first time Oklahoma State has beaten Top 10 teams in back-to-back home games \u2014 the Cowboys knocked off Texas on Oct. 27. In between, the Cowboys lost 35-31 at Baylor and 48-47 at Oklahoma.\n\n\"They have been in a lot of these games, and you can tell they had a little bit better mindset down the stretch than we did,\" Holgorsen said. \"It's disappointing that we had a chance to close them out and we didn't.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWest Virginia: The Mountaineers wasted a major opportunity and now don't have quite as much to play for against Oklahoma.\n\nOklahoma State: Cornelius made up for two interceptions earlier in the game with a strong fourth quarter.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\nOklahoma State offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich, on Cornelius: \"If you can't respect the way that young man's played and how he's bounced back and how he's played against really good defenses \u2014 who's played better than him against the top defenses in this league?\"\n\nSTAT LINES\n\nCornelius has completed 64 of 99 passes for 839 yards and eight touchdowns his past two games.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWest Virginia will likely drop out of the Top 10 after the loss.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWest Virginia has not beaten Oklahoma since it joined the Big 12 in 2012. The Mountaineers host the Sooners on Black Friday night.\n\nOklahoma State plays at TCU on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The Michigan Wolverines looked like they were peeking ahead to playing Ohio State, turning an expected rout into a closely contested game.\n\nKaran Higdon ran for a go-ahead touchdown early in the third quarter and Jake Moody set a school record with six field goals, helping No. 4 Michigan beat Indiana 31-20 Saturday.\n\n\"When you're in playoff mode \u2014 that's our mindset right \u2014 playoff wins are big,\" coach Jim Harbaugh said. \"Wins against Big Ten teams in late November are huge.\"\n\nThe next one would be bigger if Michigan can pull it off.\n\nThe Wolverines (10-1, 8-0 Big Ten, No. 4 CFP) close the regular season against the ninth-ranked Buckeyes, needing a win to reach the Big Ten championship game for the first time. If Michigan can win a road game in the series for the first time since 2000, it will be another victory away from likely earning a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\n\"We understand the tradition and the meaning behind it,\" said quarterback Shea Patterson, who will make his debut in the rivalry on Saturday in the Horseshoe.\n\nThe Hoosiers (5-6, 2-6) were competitive against Michigan as they have been lately, losing in overtime twice in the previous three meetings, but came up short again.\n\n\"Went toe to toe with them and it was a one-possession game in fourth quarter,\" coach Tom Allen said. \"That's really all you can ask for. You just got to find a way to finish these out.\"\n\nIndiana led 17-15 at halftime and finished with more yards (385) than anyone has had against Michigan's top-ranked defense this season. The Hoosiers also forced Michigan's offense to stall in the red zone and settle for field goals.\n\nPatterson was 16 of 28 for 250 yards with one touchdown, a 41-yard throw to Nick Eubanks in the second quarter. He threw his first interception in more than a month and had nine carries for 68 yards.\n\n\"Their quarterback is a difference-maker,\" Allen said.\n\nIndiana's Peyton Ramsey was 16 of 35 for 195 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Ramsey also ran for 51 yards. Stevie Scott had 30 carries for 139 yards scored a touchdown \u2014 extending his single-season, school-record total to nine \u2014 and lost a fumble for the Hoosiers. Scott has 1,033 yards rushing, the most by a true freshman at Indiana.\n\n\"This performance definitely showed to the nation that we can compete with anybody,\" Scott said. \"We've got the talent here. We just have to finish strong.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIndiana: After a strong performance against a team that has been winning big, the Hoosiers should feel better about their chances of beating Purdue to become bowl eligible.\n\n\"I'm proud of our team's fight,\" Allen said.\n\nMichigan: An injury may be a factor against the rival Buckeyes. Michigan defensive end Chase Winovich left the game midway through the third quarter after appearing to hurt his left shoulder. Harbaugh said Winovich's X-rays and CAT scans were negative.\n\nHarbaugh said Berkley Edwards, who primarily plays on special teams, had a concussion. Edwards was put on a backboard and taken off the field on a cart after being hit by Cam Jones, who was ejected for targeting. Harbaugh said Edwards was taken to a hospital as a precaution, adding he was able to talk, respond and move.\n\nREADY, KID?\n\nMoody had only handled kickoffs before finding out just before the game he would be replacing Quinn Nordin, who wasn't feeling well. The freshman made all six of his attempts, converting on field goals from 29 to 33 yards.\n\n\"It was an incredible experience,\" Moody said. \"The guys out there made it really easy for me with the snaps and the hold.\"\n\nRED ZONE WOES\n\nMoody had an opportunity to set a school record because Michigan's offense often stalled in the red zone. The Wolverines scored only one touchdown in eight drives that went inside the Indiana 20, settling for six field goals and having the first half end before being able to stop the clock for another snap.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndiana: Hosts the rival Boilermakers, needing a win to earn a spot in the postseason.\n\n\"We're back to where we were a year ago,\" said Allen, whose team lost 31-24 at Purdue last year to end the season with five wins.\n\nMichigan: Plays at Ohio State, hoping to win for the second time in 15 meetings.\n\nHow quickly did Harbaugh plan to shift his focus to the Buckeyes?\n\n\"Pretty quick,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter at https://twitter.com/larrylage\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Vasha Hunt) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUBURN, Ala. (AP) \u2014 It was Senior Day inside Jordan-Hare Stadium, but it wasn't just the graduating Tigers dominating in Auburn's home finale.\n\nSeth Williams caught five passes for 109 yards and a touchdown, Kam Martin ran for 116 yards and Auburn's defense pitched a shutout in a 53-0 victory over Liberty on Saturday.\n\nAuburn (7-4) held a pass-happy Liberty (4-6) offense in check, recording its first FBS shutout in 10 years (34-0 win over Louisiana Monroe in 2008).\n\n\"That was the goal that coach (Kevin) Steele and the defense had been talking about all week,\" said Auburn coach Gus Malzahn of the shutout. \"They did it. That was impressive.\"\n\nWilliams, a true freshman, recorded his first career 100-yard game, and Martin passed the century mark for the first time this season. The Tigers offense racked up 531 yards of offense, their highest output against an FBS foe this year. It was also the most points scored since beating Arkansas 56-3 in 2016.\n\nAuburn's defense and special teams set the tone early. Jordyn Peters blocked a punt that resulted in a safety and senior linebacker Darrell Williams had a pick-6. Anders Carlson kicked a 53- and 20-yard field goal and the Tigers led 15-0 at end of the first quarter.\n\nCarlson entered the game just 3 of 11 on field goal attempts of over 40 yards.\n\n\"I thought all three (phases) did a solid job tonight,\" Malzahn said. \"(Liberty) played some good football earlier in the year.\"\n\nJarrett Stidham was 12-of-18 passing for 178 yards with two touchdowns, and he ran for another score.\n\nAfter that upstart opening quarter, Stidham ran in from the 1 and threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Sal Cannella that stretched Auburn's lead to 32-0 at the break. Thirty-two points would have been Auburn's third-highest output of the year.\n\nLiberty quarterback Stephen Calvert threw 11 straight incompletions in the second quarter, then hit a 1 of 19 stretch in the third. The junior completed just 9 of 28 passes (32 percent) for 79 yards with two interceptions.\n\nWith a sizeable second-half lead, Auburn was able to rotate in backups and seniors. Malzahn said every senior that was able to play checked in at some point.\n\nStidham added a 45-yard touchdown strike to Seth Williams early in the third quarter.\n\nMalik Willis came in relief of Stidham in the third, completing 2 of 3 passes for 13 yards and rushing for a 16-yard score. Freshman running back Shaun Shivers added a 25-yard touchdown run before the Tigers were held scoreless in the final quarter.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLiberty: The Flames' 134 total yards of offense are their lowest this season by more than 200 yards. As a first-year FBS team, the Flames can become bowl eligible with wins in their final two games.\n\nAuburn: The shutout was Auburn's largest against an FBS team since 1996 (62-0, Fresno State).\n\nINJURIES\n\nLiberty: X-rays on sophomore offensive lineman Damian Bounds right leg came back negative, according to coach Turner Gill. Bounds suffered the leg injury in the third quarter and was down for about 15 minutes before being carted off the field.\n\nAuburn: Starting right guard Mike Horton hobbled to the locker room before halftime and did not return. Freshman Austin Troxell replaced him in the second half. Malzahn did not provide an update on Horton's injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLiberty: The Flames are home on Saturday and play New Mexico State for the second time this season.\n\nAuburn: The Tigers travel to face No. 1 Alabama for the Iron Bowl on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

On a cold, rainy day that turned into night, the 231-pound Taylor certainly packed a punch.\n\nHe matched his career high with 33 carries, averaging 9.7 yards per carry while scoring on runs of 80, 12 and 17 yards when the reeling Badgers needed a boost after their playoff aspirations and Big Ten title hopes had been derailed by three losses in their last five games \u2014 two of those without injured quarterback Alex Hornibrook who also missed Saturday's game.\n\nTaylor jump-started the Badgers' offense with the 80-yard run on the first offensive play of the second half, helped open things up for the passing game with his strong runs and eventually created enough headaches for the Boilermakers to help Wisconsin overcome a 27-13 deficit in the final seven minutes of regulation before reaching the end zone in all three overtimes.\n\nWisconsin (7-4, 5-3) has won 13 straight in the series and needed to win this game and next week's regular-season finale to improve their bowl prospects.\n\n\"Our guys played as hard as they could. They gave us great effort,\" Purdue coach Jeff Brohm said, acknowledging his team needed more depth to stand up to Taylor. \"This isn't going to happen overnight, but if we compete and keep trying to push the envelope every year, hopefully we can improve on that. It will take some time.\"\n\nThe loss ruined what looked like it would be a perfect send-off for three of the most productive Purdue players in school history \u2014 quarterback David Blough and running backs D.J. Knox and Markell Jones.\n\nBlough was 31 of 48 with 386 yards and four touchdown passes in his final home game. Knox rushed for 39 yards and had 49 yards receiving with one TD and Jones bounced off a defender during a 12-yard scoring run that turned a 13-10 deficit into a 17-13 lead.\n\nFreshman Rondale Moore overshadowed all three. He caught nine passes for 114 yards and two TDs, rushed four times for 27 yards and set up another score with a 33-yard kickoff return. His sensational 46-yard catch-and-run for a third-quarter TD gave Purdue a 24-13 lead and he followed that by wiggling through four Badgers' defenders for a 15-yard score to open the first overtime.\n\nTaylor made sure it still wasn't enough.\n\n\"They held them to a field goal,\" Taylor said. \"I decided to give everything in my power to show appreciation to our defense for stopping them.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWisconsin: While this win won't save the Badgers' season, it gives them momentum heading into the regular-season finale and a chance to improve their postseason position.\n\nPurdue: Allowing this game to slip away could prove costly for the Boilermakers, who now face a winner-take-all matchup next week at Indiana. They'll need a win to send Brohm to his fifth straight bowl game as a head coach.\n\nSTAT PACK:\n\nWisconsin: Quarterback Jack Coan was 16 of 24 with 206 yards and two TDs. ... Danny Davis made a spectacular one-handed 5-yard TD grab just inside the sideline to cut the deficit to 23-20 and tied the score with an 18-yard TD grab. He finishes with five catches for 82 yards. ... Wisconsin rushed for 385 yards but had 13 penalties for 171 yards.\n\nPurdue: Blough tied Curtis Painter (12) for the second most 300-yard games in school history in a career. He's also third all-time in pass attempts and TD passes. ... Jones moved into eighth on the school's career rushing list and tied Stan Brown for No. 9 all-time in career TD runs (19). ... Terry Wright caught five passes for 99 yards.\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\nWisconsin: \"He (Taylor) was big-time,\" coach Paul Chryst said. \"It was a heck of an effort.\"\n\nPurdue: \"I thought we had chances to win, we just didn't close the deal,\" Brohm said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWisconsin: Hosts Minnesota next Saturday for the Paul Bunyan Axe.\n\nPurdue: Closes out the regular season with its biennial trip to rival Indiana next weekend.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Chris Petersen thought he'd make it through his pregame speech the night before the final home game for Washington's seniors. Then he looked at quarterback Jake Browning, and Petersen's words trailed off.\n\n\"There's no one that's spent more time in this office since the moment he got here,\" Petersen said. \"It's exactly how it's supposed to be and he's a rare individual in terms of never flinching, always the same, always prepping as hard as he possibly can, completely locked in at all times. It's hard to do for anybody let alone a college kid going through this process. (It's) really special.\"\n\nBrowning provided one more memory for Petersen and his teammates in his final home game, throwing three first-half touchdowns in No. 17 Washington's 42-23 win over Oregon State on Saturday.\n\nBrowning threw two of his three TDs in the first quarter as Washington jumped to a 28-3 lead. Fellow senior Myles Gaskin rushed for 135 yards and the Huskies (8-3, 6-2 Pac-12) used the fast start to make certain next week's Apple Cup against No. 8 Washington State carried all the meaning it possibly could.\n\nThe meeting against the Cougars will be a winner-take-all matchup for the Pac-12 North Division title. The winner of the 111th matchup will play in the conference title game with a Rose Bowl berth at stake.\n\n\"There's a lot on the line,\" Browning said about the Apple Cup. \"But I think more it's a quick turnaround. I think whatever team can adjust to that quick turnaround better, that's an advantage.\n\nThe Huskies dominated Oregon State (2-9, 1-7) early then coasted the final three quarters. After getting a week off, Washington 28-point first quarter tied a school record last accomplished in the 2016 Apple Cup against Washington State. Salvon Ahmed rushed for a pair of short touchdowns and Browning took advantage of his chances. He hit Aaron Fuller on a 17-yard TD after Oregon State fumbled a kickoff, and he later hit tight end Cade Otton on a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nBrowning finished 17 of 23 for 242 yards and a 205.3 passer rating, but was still playing early in the fourth quarter and took some unneeded shots as Washington's protection broke down. He finished his career with 55 touchdown passes at Husky Stadium.\n\n\"I don't really care what people were hoping for this whole season. Every team is undefeated at the beginning of the season. Everybody beats the crap out of each other in the Pac-12,\" Browning said. \"It's who can absorb the blows, and just keep battling, because there's plenty of teams that, like us, had high expectations for their season, and haven't been able to absorb the blows and keep battling.\"\n\nGaskin had 135 yards rushing, but it was a disappointing total after the way he started. Gaskin had 101 yards after just three carries \u2014including a 64-yard burst on the third play of the game to set up Washington's first touchdown. He finished the first half with 107 yards rushing, but his only time finding the end zone came on a 10-yard pass from Browning late in the half. Gaskin added a rushing touchdown in the third quarter on a 6-yard run one play after a punt by Washington hit an Oregon State blocker and was recovered by the Huskies.\n\nGaskin still needs 94 yards rushing to become the first player in Pac-12 history with four 1,000-yard seasons.\n\nOregon State freshman Jermar Jefferson continued his outstanding first season rushing for 115 yards and Jake Luton threw for 190 and a 3-yard touchdown to Isaiah Hodgins. Jordan Choukair hit field goals of 47, 35 and 44 yards, but the Beavers had two key turnovers on special teams.\n\n\"We're going to go into every game feeling like we're going to play better in the first quarter,\" Oregon State coach Jonathan Smith said. \"I do feel like these guys are preparing. And we're running into some good teams too that are well-prepared.\"\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOregon State: If the Beavers are going to be competitive in the Pac-12 North their run defense must improve. Washington became the eighth team this season to rush for at least 200 yards against the Oregon State defense. Every team this season has rushed for at least 100 yards against the Beavers.\n\nWashington: Chris Petersen won't be pleased with special teams mistakes that included an onside kick recovered by Oregon State and a punt that was blocked in the fourth quarter. The Huskies got away with those mistakes against Oregon State, but they won't against better opponents.\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nPreseason all-American left tackle Trey Adams was in uniform for the first time since October 2017. Adams entered on Washington's first possession of the second quarter and played sparingly the rest of the way. Adams torn his ACL midway through last season in a loss to Arizona State and suffered a back injury in the week leading into the season opener against Auburn. He recently announced via social media his intent to return for a fifth season in 2019. He can play in any of Washington's remaining games and not affect his eligibility to return next year.\n\nSMITH'S RETURN\n\nSmith was back on the field where he served as Washington's offensive coordinator the previous four seasons. Washington linebacker Ben Burr-Kirven thought Smith's familiarity helped Oregon State's offense.\n\n\"We knew the fact he was going to have some stuff up his sleeve,\" Burr-Kirven said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOregon State: The Beavers host Oregon in the Civil War next Friday.\n\nWashington: The Huskies face No. 8 Washington State in the Apple Cup next Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Furman won 76-68 in overtime. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nVILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) \u2014 First, it was Loyola. Next came Villanova.\n\nOne by one, Furman is picking off teams from last year's Final Four and proving to be the surprise story of the first month of the college basketball season.\n\nJordan Lyons scored 17 points, Matt Rafferty had 15 points and 17 rebounds, and Furman stunned the defending national champion and eighth-ranked Wildcats in overtime, 76-68 on Saturday.\n\n\"We're just tiny old Furman,\" coach Bob Richey said. \"Most people ask us what state we're in, what city we're in. Now all of a sudden people are starting to figure out who Furman is.\"\n\nIf opponents and fans aren't paying attention to the team from Greenville, South Carolina, they'd better start now.\n\nClay Mounce added 15 points and Noah Gurley and Alex Hunter scored 13 apiece for the surging Paladins, who have started 5-0 for the first time in 30 years.\n\nLyons and Rafferty delivered huge buckets in overtime to key a 7-0 spurt that put the Paladins ahead 69-63 in the final minute, enough cushion for them to hang on for the victory in front of a shocked sellout crowd at the recently renovated Finneran Pavilion.\n\n\"It almost can bring me to tears to think about how proud I am of the resolve, the resiliency and the fight this team has,\" Richey said. \"They play together, they play connected. It's the definition of a team.\"\n\nPhil Booth scored 20 points and Colin Gillespie had 19 for the Wildcats (2-2), who were coming off a 27-point loss to Michigan in a rematch of April's national championship game. It marked the first time Villanova lost back-to-back games since March of 2013.\n\n\"It's not that shocking, to be honest,\" Booth said. \"They're a very good team. We're still a young team trying to find our way.\"\n\nTrailing 58-53 with under four minutes to play in regulation, Joe Cremo hit a 3-pointer, Booth scored and Gillespie made a layup in transition to put Villanova in front, 60-58, in the final minute.\n\nAfter Lyons hit two free throws to tie the game at 60, Booth missed on the other end and Hunter misfired on a long 3-pointer in the final seconds. Cremo was called for a foul while going for the rebound, but Rafferty couldn't connect on the front end of a 1-and-1 with 2.6 seconds left, setting the game up for OT.\n\nRafferty said his teammates picked him up and told him to make up for the missed free throw in overtime \u2014 which he did.\n\n\"This was incredible,\" Rafferty said. \"I've never been a part of something like this.\"\n\nROAR OF THE LYONS\n\nTwo days after pouring in 54 points while matching an NCAA record with 15 3-pointers in a 107-67 win over North Greenville, Lyons had more big buckets, including one that put Furman ahead 48-46 with a little over eight minutes remaining.\n\nRichey was proud of how the junior guard dealt with 'Nova's defense, especially after he was held to five points in the first half.\n\n\"He was mature enough to know he had to play within our team concept,\" Richey said. \"He got going in the second half. I was really proud of him.\"\n\nCHEMISTRY ISSUES\n\nAlthough he put his team on his back at times, scoring five straight points during one stretch to tie the game at 51, Booth shouldered a lot of the blame for the loss.\n\n\"I have to do a better job of showing the team what Villanova basketball is on both ends of the floor,\" said Booth, a senior guard who was a part of the Wildcats' national championship teams in both 2016 and 2018.\n\n\"We're trying to work on a lot of chemistry things as a team,\" he added.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nFurman: It's only November, but the Paladins are looking like a team that will be dangerous in March. In their only other road game of the season, they upset last season's NCAA Tournament darling, Loyola-Chicago, on a last-second dunk.\n\nVillanova: After losing four players from last year's national championship squad to the NBA draft, coach Jay Wright continues to search for his best rotation. On Saturday, freshman Jahvon Quinerly, a five-star recruit, didn't get in the game after playing key minutes in Villanova's first three games. The Wildcats' depth also took a hit Friday when the team announced that redshirt sophomore Dylan Painter will transfer.\n\n\"You always want to get the young guys in,\" Wright said. \"It was close and then we got down the stretch and you try to ride it out with the older guys and hope you can get through the game.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFurman hosts Southern Wesleyan on Wednesday.\n\nVillanova faces Canisius in the Advocare Invitational in Orlando on Thanksgiving.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Nate Stanley passed for 178 yards and three touchdowns while Mekhi Sargent and Toren Young added two rushing touchdowns each as Iowa rolled over Illinois 63-0 on Saturday.\n\nIt tied the largest margin of defeat in Illinois history, matching a 63-0 loss to the University of Chicago in 1906.\n\nThe win ended a three-game skid for the Hawkeyes (7-4, 4-4 Big Ten) and makes a bowl invitation all but certain.\n\nThe loss ended Illinois' bowl hopes.\n\nIowa quarterback Nate Stanley threw an interception on the second play of the game and the Hawkeyes punted on the next series. But the floodgates soon opened: Over the next 18 minutes, Iowa scored five times.\n\n\"A lot of man coverage today, a lot of zone a week ago,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"A lot of that stuff is just how things shake out, but again, we're going to be a better team any time we get our better guys involved.\"\n\nThe Hawkeyes led 35-0 at the half.\n\n\"We didn't play well in any phase,\" said Illinois coach Lovie Smith. \"Starting with coaching, we thought we had the team prepared. We weren't. They outperformed us in every way.\"\n\nStanley was 13 of 21 through the air for three touchdowns and one interception. His touchdown passes went to tight end Noah Fant (who played sparingly last week much to the chagrin of many Iowa fans) and T.J. Hockenson.\n\n\"I don't know if there were any major conversations, but we're a better team, obviously, when our tight ends are involved,\" Ferentz said. \"Noah (Fant) had a good week. The plan worked out well today and it was good to see him involved and helping our team move the ball. It was a really productive day for him.\"\n\nSargent carried 17 times for 121 yards, while Young rushed for 67 yards on 14 carries. Kyle Groeneweg returned a punt for a touchdown following Illinois's first series of the second half.\n\nILLINI WOES\n\nAJ Bush was 12 of 28 for 82 yards and two interceptions for Illinois. Ra'Von Bonner carried the ball 21 times for 111 yards.\n\nIllinois' top rusher. Reggie Corbin, left last week's game with an ankle injury and appeared to re-injure it in the first half. He carried the ball once prior to leaving Saturday's for minus 4 yards.\n\nIllinois (4-7, 2-6) turned the ball over four times, which led to 14 Iowa points.\n\nIowa generated 400 yards of total offense, compared to 231 for Illinois.\n\n\"We're not a good football team right now,\" Smith said. \"There are some scars that will stay with you.\"\n\nIN GOOD COMPANY\n\nThis win gives Kirk Ferentz his 150th career win at Iowa, which makes him the fifth coach in Big Ten history to win 150 games as a member of the Big Ten conference.

(AP Photo/Mark Wallheiser) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida State has its first victory over a ranked team in almost two years \u2014 and a shot at a bowl game.\n\nDeondre Francois threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to Tamorrion Terry with 1:49 left and the Seminoles beat No. 22 Boston College 22-21 on Saturday to keep their bowl hopes alive.\n\nFrancois was 19 of 39 for 322 yards, shaking off two first-half interceptions for his fourth 300-yard game of the season. Cam Akers had 19 carries for 110 yards for the Seminoles (5-6, 3-5 Atlantic Coast Conference).\n\nFlorida State, which snapped a three-game losing streak, got the ball back with 2:45 left and needed to drive 87 yards to score a touchdown. Francois said he felt confident.\n\n\"I smell blood,\" Francois said. \"Really, I was ready to go. I just forgot about the first half. You can't focus on the first half and the mistakes you made. That's what we did as an offense. We continued to be resilient and we drove the ball down the field.\"\n\nBC (7-4, 4-3) led 21-16 and had fourth-and-1 at the Florida State 40 with 2:52 to go. Coach Steve Addazio called timeout and sent his offense on the field but opted to have quarterback Anthony Brown try a hard count and see if he could draw the Seminoles offside. It didn't work, and the Eagles took the delay-of-game penalty before punting 32 yards and pinning Florida State at the 13.\n\n\"It was worth the try,\" Addazio said. \"I felt pretty good about it. With the outcome, your heart is like, 'I should have went for the first down.' But honestly thinking about it that really wasn't the right thing to do. . I know that's the right thing to do. It did not have the right outcome. Obviously you second-guess yourself but really it was the right decision. It just didn't work out right.\"\n\nAddazio's decision not to go for it took some Seminoles by surprise. Linebacker Dontavious Jackson said he realized quickly \"they don't have a play\" and none of the Florida State defensive players flinched.\n\n\"I thought they were going to run a power, play action or QB sneak,\" said Jackson, who had a team-leading 14 tackles. \"I was kind of surprised they did that. But it worked out for the best.\"\n\nIt certainly did for the Seminoles. Three plays later, Francois connected with Terry for the touchdown.\n\nFlorida State secured its first victory in six attempts against Top 25 teams this season and the program's first against a ranked opponent since a win over Michigan in the 2016 Orange Bowl. Florida State has gone to a bowl in each season since 1982 and can extend the streak with a victory over No. 15 Florida next week.\n\n\"Hopefully it's the defining moment that we all knew could happen,\" Florida State coach Willie Taggart said. \"It's good that our guys kept believing and found a way. We needed it in the worst way and we've got one more to go against our archrival.\"\n\nTerry, a redshirt freshman, now has eight touchdown receptions - including long catches of 78, 74, 55 and 35 - this season.\n\n\"Every time I know it's one-on-one, I think it's a touchdown,\" Terry said. \"Nobody can guard me, and I know that for sure.\"\n\nBrown completed 18 of 33 passes for 297 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions for BC hasn't won in Tallahassee since 2008.\n\nDILLON FOR 1,000\n\nA.J. Dillon ran a season-high 37 times for 116 yards and a touchdown for the Eagles, and Dillon has 1,052 rushing yards in nine games this season, missing two due to an ankle injury. Dillon injured the ankle again in the fourth quarter of last week's loss to No. 2 Clemson.\n\n\"I think he gave great effort,\" Addazio said. \"I thought he gutted it out hard.\"\n\nHe had 1,589 rushing yards as a freshman in 2017. Dillon is the first BC rusher to have back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in the 120-year history of the program.\n\nRUN SETS UP PASS\n\nFlorida State came into the game ranked 128th in the nation in rushing but ran for a season-high 156 yards on 36 carries against BC. Taggart said the success on the ground set up the Seminoles' passing game.\n\n\"We've got to continue to run the football,\" Taggart said. \"That helped set up other things for us. And that's pretty much what our offense was based on is play action\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nBC will likely drop out of the top 25 with the loss. The Eagles were looking for their first eight-win season since 2009.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nBoston College: The return of injured stars Dillon and Brown weren't enough to spark the Eagles on offense. BC made 7 of 19 third-down conversions and 3 of 6 fourth-down conversions to put Florida State on the ropes.\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles rallied for a win after dropping three straight games. Florida State had not won in nearly a month, since a 38-17 win over Wake Forest on Oct. 20.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoston College: Host Syracuse next Saturday in the regular-season finale.\n\nFlorida State: Host No. 15 Florida next Saturday in the final regular-season game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Matt Gentry/The Roanoke Times via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) \u2014 One good performance seemed to make a month of bad ones disappear for Miami.\n\nN'Kosi Perry threw for two touchdowns and ran for another, Cam'Ron Davis scored twice and Miami snapped a four-game losing streak with a 38-14 victory against Virginia Tech on Saturday.\n\n\"It was very sweet,\" Davis said. \"We're very excited. All the stuff we went through, it all passed. Now we're on a new journey.\"\n\nDavis scored on a 42-yard run and a 16-yard reception, both in the third quarter with a 51-yard punt return touchdown by Jeff Thomas sandwiched in between as Miami (6-5, 3-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) turned a 17-14 halftime lead into a comfortable victory.\n\n\"It was probably the most difficult thing I've been through as a coach,\" Mark Richt said of the losing streak. \"We stopped the bleeding.\"\n\nEnding the skid came with a bonus \u2014 bowl eligibility.\n\n\"It meant so much to us,\" cornerback Trajan Bandy said. \"We work so hard in practice. We knew coming into this game it was going to be a battle for us. ... We go out and play fast. I think we did a great job tonight.\"\n\nThe Hokies (4-6, 3-4) lost their fourth straight, and fourth straight at home, for the first time since they dropped four in a row at home spanning the 1973 season-finale and first the three of the 1974 season. Virginia Tech will have to beat Virginia on Friday \u2014 something they have done in each of the last 14 meetings \u2014 and then add a game on Dec. 1 and win that, too, to extend to 26 their streak of seasons ending in a bowl game. An announcement about a game to replace one against East Carolina lost to Hurricane Florence could come as early as Sunday.\n\nUniversity officials had no comment Saturday, but the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Saturday that the Hokies have reached a contingency agreement to play Marshall at Lane Stadium, but only if bowl eligibility is available. Marshall also lost a game to the storm.\n\nCleaning up some defensive mistakes, defensive coordinator Bud Foster said, \"We will give ourselves a chance to win, and hopefully we'll get an opportunity to go play one more, and then one more after that.\"\n\nVirginia Tech led early after driving 76 yards in five plays following the opening kickoff with Ryan Willis finding Dalton Keene for a 15-yard touchdown, and they led 14-10 after Tre Turner ran 20 yards untouched early in the second quarter.\n\nThe offense stalled thereafter, and coach Justin Fuente blamed two drives that came up empty in the third quarter.\n\nOn the first, Brian Johnson was wide left on a 46-yard field goal try, and the Hurricanes then drove 71 yards in eight plays to Davis' long touchdown run. On the next, Damon Hazleton fumbled after a catch and Sheldrick Redwine recovered at the Virginia Tech 41. A third drive was hampered by a holding call that created a third-and-16, and \"by then, the game was pretty far out of hand,\" Fuente said.\n\nMiami also took a page from how the Hokies' recent opponents had found success and ran the ball. It produced a 71-yard drive to Perry's 1-yard scoring run 33 seconds before halftime, and another run-heavy 71-yard touchdown drive to Davis' run in the third quarter.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMiami: The Hurricanes hardly tried to run the ball until their final drive of the first half when they gained 35 yards on the ground, giving them 40 for the half. Curious play-calling against a Virginia Tech team that had allowed an average of 392 yards on the ground in its past three games, all losses. In the first drive of the second half, they gained 62 of their 71 yards on the ground helped by Davis' 42-yard run to finish it.\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies year of the injury continues as they got several of their injured defensive players back, but were without wide receivers Eric Kumah and Hezekiah Grimsley. They also remain inept after halftime at home, where the last three opponents had each outscored them 14-0 in the third quarter and Miami had a 21-0 edge.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMiami: The Hurricanes return home to face ACC Coastal Division champion Pittsburgh.\n\nVirginia: The Hokies host state rival Virginia on Friday and will be seeking their 15th consecutive victory in the series.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPASADENA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Joshua Kelley has been watching the UCLA-USC rivalry since he was 8 years old. On Saturday, he cemented his legacy in the Crosstown Showdown's history.\n\nThe junior running back rushed for 289 yards on 40 carries and scored two touchdowns to lead the Bruins to a 34-27 victory over the Trojans at the Rose Bowl.\n\nIt is the third-most rushing yards in a game in UCLA history and the most by a Bruins back against the Trojans. Gaston Green had the previous mark with 224 yards on 39 carries in 1986.\n\n\"It was crazy and finally I was out there and wanted to embrace every single moment of it,\" said Kelley, who transferred from UC Davis. \"It was a crazy experience. I sure enjoyed it and our team did too.\"\n\nKelley's 55-yard touchdown up the left sideline on an outside zone play with 10:39 remaining gave the Bruins a 28-27 lead. JJ Molson then added a pair of field goals to extend the margin for UCLA (3-8, 3-5 Pac-12).\n\nKelley was surprised by the number of carries he had but UCLA coach Chip Kelly did not mind giving his back a heavy workload.\n\n\"I wish he had carried it 100 (times) to be honest with you,\" Kelly said.\n\nUSC (5-6, 4-5) mounted one final drive and got to the UCLA 29 but JT Daniels' fourth-down pass was incomplete with 32 seconds remaining.\n\n\"Coming into the game, we had a lot of respect for Joshua. He's a very physical back and a very good runner,\" Trojans coach Clay Helton said. \"I thought they did a nice job tonight of being able to get the ball outside on the perimeter and bouncing the ball outside.\"\n\nWilton Speight completed 13 of 22 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for a score as UCLA broke a three-game losing streak to its crosstown rival.\n\nDaniels threw for 337 yards and two touchdowns as he completed 20 of 34 passes, but the freshman had a costly fourth-quarter interception that led to Molson's second field goal. USC was held to 80 yards of offense in the second half with most of it coming in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I was trying to throw it away. It got away from me. That's inexcusable,\" said Daniels of the second pick.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr. had 106 yards on seven receptions and Amon-Ra St. Brown added six catches for 98 yards. The Trojans were 4-2 at midseason but have dropped four of their last five.\n\nAfter USC scored on a 46-yard field goal by Michael Brown on its opening possession, UCLA would score touchdowns on its first two. Speight threw a perfect 33-yard pass to Theo Howard that the junior receiver was able to haul in near the back of the end zone while being covered by Iman Marshall.\n\nSpeight then got his first collegiate rushing touchdown on a 4-yard scramble to extend the Bruins' lead to 11. The key play of that drive was a 59-yard gain by Kelley down the left sideline to the USC 9.\n\nThe Trojans would take back momentum with a couple big plays on special teams. A 44-yard touchdown by St. Brown from Daniels drew them within 14-10 late in the first quarter. The TD came right after Erik Krommenhoek got a first down on a direct snap off a fake punt.\n\nUSC's punt team then gave it the lead early in the second quarter when Jake Russell blocked a Stefan Flintoft punt at the UCLA 5 and Devon Williams ran it in.\n\nThe Bruins answered right back with a Kelley 1-yard score but the Trojans would lead 24-21 at halftime after Velus Jones caught a receiver screen, got a pair of blocks from Pittman and went 45 yards.\n\nA Brown 22-yard field goal midway through the third quarter gave USC a six-point lead.\n\nNOT A BIG DRAW\n\nThe USC-UCLA game is usually one of the biggest dates each year on the Los Angeles sporting calendar, but Saturday's contest drew only 57,116. That is the lowest attended crosstown game since 1950, when both teams played at the LA Memorial Coliseum.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUSC: Clay Helton's future as coach could be precarious with the late-season collapse and bowl hopes hanging by a thread.\n\n\"The job is if you win, people are going to pat you on the back, and if you lose, you know they're going to get after you,\" Helton said. \"It rolls off my back, so I'm not worried about it.\"\n\nUCLA: Kelly has his signature win in his first year leading the Bruins, which should give them momentum with the early signing period less than a month away.\n\n\"It was a deserved victory. They didn't kind of slide into it or backdoor into this win,\" Kelly said. \"There's no question in this game that we played hard. We played harder, and that's why we won the football game.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUSC: Closes out the regular season hosting No. 4 Notre Dame.\n\nUCLA: Ends its season on Saturday against Stanford.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Wade Payne) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Missouri quarterback Drew Lock remembers how Tennessee fans roasted him on social media after the Tigers hired Derek Dooley as offensive coordinator.\n\n\"I still had Twitter at that time and I was getting tagged in all of these tweets from Tennessee people, (saying), 'Aww, Drew Lock's got Derek Dooley now. Here he goes down the drain, Blah, blah, blah,'\" Lock said.\n\nLock issued one heck of a response Saturday as Missouri trounced the Volunteers 50-17 in Dooley's return to Tennessee, which fired him as head coach six years ago.\n\nWith Lock throwing two touchdown passes and Larry Rountree rushing for 135 yards, Missouri (7-4, 3-4 SEC) breezed to its third straight victory. This win had to be particularly sweet for Dooley, who went 15-21 as Tennessee's coach from 2010-12.\n\nRather than going down the drain under Dooley, Lock is moving up the Southeastern Conference rankings for career passing yardage.\n\nLock went 21 of 30 for 257 yards Saturday and now has thrown for 11,599 yards in his career to reach second place on the SEC's all-time list. Lock overtook David Greene, who passed for 11,528 yards at Georgia from 2001-04.\n\n\"That feels really good,\" Lock said. \"That is definitely really cool, especially to be able to do it here with Coach Dooley.\"\n\nThe SEC record holder is Aaron Murray, who compiled 13,166 career passing yards for Georgia from 2010-13.\n\nTy Chandler had two touchdown runs for Tennessee (5-6, 2-5), which lost starting quarterback Jarrett Guarantano to an injury after he was sacked twice in the first quarter . Keller Chryst replaced Guarantano early in the second period and went 7 of 19 for 173 yards with two interceptions.\n\n\"Missouri outcoached us, outplayed us today,\" Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said.\n\nPruitt had no postgame update on the status of Guarantano or wide receiver Marquez Callaway, who also was knocked out of the game after catching two passes for 98 yards.\n\nMissouri outgained Tennessee 117-(minus-17) in the first quarter but only had a 6-0 lead to show for it after two drives stalled in the red zone, forcing the Tigers to settle for field goals.\n\nThe momentum briefly changed after Chryst entered the game. Chryst's 41-yard completion to Jauan Jennings on a third-and-6 play set up a 5-yard touchdown run from Ty Chandler that put Tennessee ahead 7-6.\n\nMissouri went back ahead for good with a touchdown on its next drive, beginning a stretch of four straight possessions in which it reached the end zone.\n\nWith Tennessee trailing 19-10, the Vols reached Missouri's 28-yard line in the final minute of the half before DeMarkus Acy picked off a Chryst pass and delivered a 76-yard interception return. That turnover put Missouri at Tennessee's 11 to set up Lock's 3-yard touchdown pass to Johnathon Johnson, which gave the Tigers a 26-10 advantage.\n\n\"We had a chance to put some points on the board and we make a bad throw and they run it (most) of the way back, at least a 10-point swing there,\" Pruitt said.\n\nAfter both teams reached the end zone on their opening possessions of the second half, another Tennessee turnover put the game out of reach.\n\nTennessee's Carlin Fils-aime fumbled on his only carry of the night, and Joshuah Bledsoe picked it up and ran 39 yards for a Missouri touchdown that made it 40-17.\n\n\"I didn't think we'd be in position in the third quarter to milk the clock,\" Missouri coach Barry Odom said, \"but that is the way the game unfolded.\"\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\nMissouri: Don't bet against the Tigers in November. Missouri improved its November record to 9-2 under Odom, who's in his third year on the job. The Tigers won easily Saturday even though an ankle injury limited Damarea Crockett to three carries for 10 yards after he rushed for over 100 yards each of the last two weeks. Missouri has won its last eight November games. Last year, the Tigers won their final six regular-season games before falling to Texas in the Texas Bowl.\n\nTennessee: The Vols still can become bowl eligible by winning at Vanderbilt, which would represent a giant step forward for a program that finished 4-8 and went winless in SEC competition last year.\n\n\"We want to go to a bowl game, we've got to go get it,\" Chandler said. \"It's not going to be handed to us.\"\n\nFAMILIAR SCORE\n\nThis is the second straight year that Missouri has beaten Tennessee 50-17. Tennessee fired Butch Jones as coach the day after last season's Missouri-Tennessee game, which featured Missouri scoring 33 unanswered points to break a 17-all tie.\n\nTARGETING CALLS\n\nMissouri linebacker Tavon Ross got a targeting penalty in the first half. Tennessee linebacker Shanon Reid and Missouri defensive end Nate Anderson drew targeting penalties in the second half, which means the two of them won't be able to play in the first half of their regular-season finales.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMissouri hosts Arkansas on Friday.\n\nTennessee visits Vanderbilt on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Chubb has twice the sacks (8) and a few more hits (11), but he\u2019s seen a significantly higher snap count even before Davenport was sidelined by injury. Landry, billed as the most pro-ready pass rusher by draft enthusiasts on social media, has logged just 2 sacks and 5 other hits. It\u2019s clear why the Saints valued Davenport so highly, and these results from PFF just do a little more to validate the call to trade up for him."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Ga Tech wins fourth straight, beating Virginia 30-27 in OT", "description": "Wesley Wells kicked his fourth field goal of the game in overtime and Georgia Tech won its fourth straight game when Virginia's Brian Delaney missed his attempt to give the Yellow Jackets a 30-27 victory Saturday", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/17/ga-tech-wins-fourth-straight-beating-virginia-30-27-in-ot/38554011/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9582c235f615d7c48921f6e2571e1d3aa8df94c9/c=0-352-1787-1357/local/-/media/2018/11/17/USATODAY/usatsports/048044374f3e41fd9059a1a5eb0e7b14.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T00:15:16Z", "content": "A Georgia Tech cheerleader proposes marriage to another cheerleader during the first half of an NCAA football game between Georgia Tech and Virginia, Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, in Atlanta.

Georgia Tech won 30-27. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Tech relied on an unlikely formula to pull off its fourth straight victory.\n\nA brilliant catch for its only pass completion of the game.\n\nFour field goals from a freshman who wasn't even the No. 1 kicker at the beginning of the season.\n\nWesley Wells booted a 40-yarder in overtime, the ball barely sliding through as it skimmed the right upright , and Virginia's Brian Delaney missed his attempt from 35 yards to give the Yellow Jackets a 30-27 victory Saturday.\n\n\"Sometimes the nerves get to you a little bit,\" Wells said. \"It was a roller-coaster of emotions while the kick was up and the ball hitting the post and going in.\"\n\nWells booted the longest field goal of his career from 48 yards to push Georgia Tech to a 27-24 lead with 1:04 remaining in regulation. The Cavaliers drove for the tying field goal, with Delaney connecting from 31 yards on a do-over with 1 second left after Virginia was flagged for a false start on his first attempt.\n\nNeither team picked up a first down in overtime, so it came down to the kickers.\n\nWells made his attempt \u2014 \"my first game-winner,\" he said, even going back to high school.\n\nDelaney hooked his badly , his head dropping as soon as his right foot connected with the ball.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets (7-4, 5-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) clinched a winning season, quite a comeback from a 1-3 start.\n\nCoach Paul Johnson credited his seniors, who were honored before their final game at Bobby Dodd Stadium.\n\n\"They did a great job of keeping this team together,\" Johnson said.\n\nVirginia (7-4, 4-3) was eliminated from the ACC Coastal Division race before it even took the field. Pittsburgh clinched a spot in the league championship game with its 34-13 victory at Wake Forest.\n\nGeorgia Tech only compounded the Cavaliers' misery.\n\n\"It hurts,\" Virginia receiver Olamide Zaccheaus said. \"This is real tough.\"\n\nBrad Stewart stretched out as far as he could to haul in Georgia Tech's lone completion, a 37-yard pass from TaQuon Marshall on third down to set up Wells' go-ahead kick near the end of regulation. Stewart escaped cornerback Bryce Hall with a double move, leaped for a ball that appeared overthrown, and managed to hang on while crashing to the turf.\n\n\"That was my last catch ever at Bobby Dodd,\" Stewart said. \"How crazy is that?\"\n\nThen Wells won it in overtime \u2014 not bad for a walk-on who only took over the kicking job after two other kickers failed to hold down the job.\n\nVirginia quarterback Bryce Perkins completed 21 of 26 passes for 217 yards, and also led the Cavaliers in rushing with 73 yards despite an injured left ankle that occurred when he was sacked for a safety in the first half. He was helped off the field by two teammates but missed only one series.\n\nMarshall ran for 107 yards while completing 1 of 8 passes.\n\nThat one was enough.\n\nWhile Perkins was out, freshman Brennan Armstrong guided the Cavaliers to a touchdown in only the third career appearance. He threw a short pass near the sideline to Joe Reed, who shook off a defender and raced for a 56-yard touchdown .\n\nWILD SEQUENCE\n\nIn the span of just 11 seconds, Georgia Tech turned an early 7-3 deficit into a 13-7 lead.\n\nWith Virginia backed up on its own 1 after a punt, Perkins took a snap in the end zone and rolled left to throw, only to be grabbed by Georgia Tech's Brant Mitchell and finished off by 325-pound nose tackle Brandon Adams for a safety.\n\nMaking matters worse for the Cavaliers, Juanyeh Thomas returned the free kick 77 yards for a touchdown and Marshall ran for a 2-point conversion.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVirginia: A brutal loss for the Cavaliers, who not only surrendered a safety and a special teams touchdown but also botched a punt return when the ball hit a Cavaliers player in the back while he was trying to get out of the way. The Yellow Jackets recovered the fumble, leading to their only offensive touchdown . \"The story line is special teams' miscues,\" coach Bronco Mendenhall said.\n\nGeorgia Tech: A gutsy performance by a team that seemed headed for a dismal season, but has now put itself in decent position when bowl invitations go out.\n\nDEFENDING THE TRIPLE OPTION\n\nVirginia limited the nation's top rushing team to only a handful of big plays.\n\nGeorgia Tech had 268 yards on 52 carries \u2014 nearly 100 yards below its season average and only the fourth time this season the Jackets have been limited to fewer than 300 yards.\n\nIt was quite a contrast to the last time Virginia faced such an offense. In the 2017 Military Bowl, Navy ran for 452 yards and romped to a 49-7 victory.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams close the regular season against their state rivals.\n\nGeorgia Tech makes the 70-mile trip to Athens next Saturday to take on No. 5 Georgia (10-1). The Yellow Jackets have won in their last two appearances at Sanford Stadium and hope to deliver another stunner against the playoff-contending Bulldogs.\n\nThe Cavaliers will hit the road for the second week in a row, facing Virginia Tech (4-6) on Friday in Blacksburg.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .
