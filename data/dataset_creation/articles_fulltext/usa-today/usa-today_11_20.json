So while some vegetarians eat things such as eggs, cheese and yogurt, vegans do not eat dairy or any animal byproducts, like gelatin.\n\n. Sometimes veganism extends beyond the person's diet and into their lifestyle, with some choosing not to wear leather or silk and even feeding their pets a vegan diet. It just depends on the individual.\n\nRelated: What is oat milk, anyway? Everything you need to know about the trendy milk substitute\n\nWhat the Gallup poll doesn't take into account are those who are part-time vegans or are simply reducing their intake of animal products. Sales of vegan food grew 8.1 percent from 2016 to 2017, totaling $3.1 billion.\n\nA primarily plant-based diet can help those looking to lose weight, but the benefits don't stop there. Studies have shown that a vegan diet can decrease the risk of stroke and heart disease and protect against cancer.\n\nWhether you're looking to go vegan for environmental reasons, health reasons or just because, the journey to a plant-based lifestyle doesn't have to be a daunting one.\n\nThose who have extensive experience with vegan diets and lifestyles agree that the most important thing about trying out veganism is to come to it with an open mind and start off slowly rather than diving in headfirst.\n\nRelated: Vegan holiday cocktail: Spiced-apple margaritas\n\nSo, be a part-time vegan and see if it's for you. You might be surprised at how little you find yourself giving up or missing from your normal diet.\n\nKirsten Ussery, co-owner of Detroit Vegan Soul, says that even though vegan food is never going to taste exactly like meat, you can make it pretty similar by using the right flavors and textures, which is mostly what people are after.\n\nUssery and partner Erika Boyd started Detroit Vegan Soul as a meal delivery service in 2012 because of their own personal journeys and the lack of vegan options in the city. They wanted to break the cycle of disease within their families, but also didn't want to have to give up the cuisine they were raised on \u2013 soul food.\n\n\"People will enjoy good food whether it\u2019s vegan or not,\" Ussery says. \"We believed that given the option, more people would be interested in plant-based food once they experience it and see that the stereotypes they have about it aren\u2019t true.\"\n\nMichael Hornick, the vice president of the Chicago Diner \u2013 meat-free since 1983 \u2013 says that the transition to plant-based foods has to be small.\n\n\"It's getting people to open up and see that they can eat vegetarian and vegan without missing the flavors that they grew up on,\u201d Hornick says.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to present the food in a way that \u2026 isn\u2019t intimidating and is a similar experience to what they might be used to.\"\n\nHornick understands that there's nothing comforting about trying new food, so he tries to make \"something new taste like something familiar.\"\n\nThe restaurant serves comfort foods like country fried steak and corned beef sandwiches \u2013 all vegan. It all comes down to making the right substitutions. By using ingredients like beans, seitan and tofu, Hornick is able to practically replicate any meat favorite as a vegan dish.\n\nRelated: Alicia Silverstone's son 'never' takes medicine: She credits super health to vegan diet\n\n\"Just give it a chance, there are plenty of vegetarian restaurants in every city \u2013 it\u2019s one meal. If you didn't like it, you\u2019re going to have another meal later,\" Hornick says.\n\nCelebrity chef Matthew Kenney, who was named one of Food & Wine magazine's Best New Chefs in 1994, has been vegan for 16 years, agrees that the transition to vegan food is only getting easier.\n\n\"One of the first things that I encourage people to do is substitute dairy with dairy alternatives \u2013 there\u2019s just so many great products on the market already, so it\u2019s an easy transition,\" Kenney says.\n\nHe says he also finds vegan food the most exciting way to eat these days, given the rise in plant-based products and all the unique things chefs are learning to do with plants.\n\n\"Try it, one meal a day, one meal a week, and incorporate plants in a space where you normally wouldn\u2019t,\" says Kenney. \"Listen to your palate, listen to your body.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/20/ready-trade-your-burger-vegan-tofu-sandwich-start-slow/2064927002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "The Associated Press, Jim Mustian, The Associated Press", "title": "Tekashi 6ix9ine: Professor explains the RICO charges against Brooklyn rapper", "description": "The controversial Brooklyn rapper, whose debut album was among the most downloaded on iTunes, is charged with being part of a deadly racketeering gang.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/20/tekashi-6-ix-9-ine-prof-explains-rico-charges-against-brooklyn-rapper/2073127002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/4628dfaa-3d1a-4ad4-bf24-c5e909a4ade3-AFP_AFP_19B6WW.jpg?crop=4711,2650,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:57:49Z", "content": "Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine is in federal custody awaiting a court appearance after being indicted on racketeering and firearms charges.

(Photo: Arik McArthur/FilmMagic)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was deemed a likely danger to the community and denied bail Monday after a prosecutor said there was evidence that he directed or participated in multiple acts of violence as part of a deadly gang.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman concluded an hour-long hearing by citing \"troubling\" corroborating evidence offered by a prosecutor to show that 6ix9ine directed or participated in multiple acts of violence over the last eight months.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Michael Longyear said a backpack stolen during a gunpoint robbery in April was found during a raid at the rapper's Brooklyn residence, along with an automatic pistol.\n\n\"The defendant is quite violent,\" the prosecutor said of the 22-year-old rapper, whose debut album, \"Day69,\" was among the most downloaded records on iTunes.\n\nLongyear said 6ix9ine was captured on surveillance video as he sat in a car and filmed the scene in Times Square when his co-defendants carried out a violent robbery against a rival gang member.\n\nThe prosecutor said he was also part of a video boasting about shots recently fired by a co-defendant in Brooklyn's Barclays Center.\n\nLongyear also said the rapper was a threat to flee because of his worldwide connections, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and the knowledge that a conviction would bring a mandatory minimum sentence of 32 years in prison and as much as life.\n\nPitman ordered 6ix9ine held until a Tuesday bail hearing, saying he was concerned about the danger to the community, particularly because the rapper could direct others to carry out acts of violence.\n\n6ix9ine was among six people charged in a federal grand jury indictment containing racketeering and firearms charges. The indictment alleged that he participated in the July shooting of a bystander in Brooklyn and the gunpoint robbery of one of his gang's rivals last spring.\n\nThe rapper's lawyer, Lance Lazzaro, said 6ix9nine \u2013 whose legal name is Daniel Hernandez \u2013 posed no threat and denies directing or playing any other role in violence.\n\n\"An entertainer who portray's a 'gangster image' to promote his music does not make him a member of a (criminal enterprise),\" Lazzaro said in statement emailed on Wednesday.\n\nLazzaro said his client had fired some of his co-defendants as part of his management and security team last week and was offered protection by federal agents on Saturday after some of them were overheard on wiretaps threatening his life.\n\nAfter the rapper refused protection, he was arrested on Sunday.\n\nThe federal RICO statues (for Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations) date from the late 1960s and were originally inspired by the illegal activities of traditional organized crime groups such as the Mafia.\n\nIn recent years, federal prosecutors have increasingly turned to racketeering statutes to bring charges against other defendants whose alleged crimes fit the parameters of the RICO statutes, said James Cohen, a law professor at Fordham University in New York who has practiced in both state and federal courts.\n\nAll of the crimes Tekashi 6ix9ine and his co-defendants are accused of are also crimes in New York. The advantage of pursuing federal charges instead of state charges, Cohen said, is that federal courts are viewed as more sympathetic to prosecutors.\n\n\"The rules of evidence are not vastly different, but they're different enough in certain ways so that prosecutors get the benefit,\" Cohen said. \"Federal courts are seen as a more sympathetic venue, I think most lawyers will tell you that.\n\n\"The second factor is that sentencing is, generally speaking, harsher in federal court,\" Cohen added. \"So as soon as you get the conviction, you can get more time \u2013 get more bang for your buck.\"\n\n6ix9ine has been one of the most ascendant and controversial names in hip-hop in recent months.\n\nIn addition to \"Day69,\" he is also known for the multiplatinum hit \"Fefe\" with Nicki Minaj, which peaked at No. 3 on the pop charts, and \"Stoopid,\" featuring the incarcerated rapper Bobby Shmurda.\n\nBut 6ix9ine also has had a series of run-ins with law enforcement and has publicly identified himself as a member of a violent New York gang, 9 Trey Bloods, which was mentioned throughout the indictment as a criminal \"enterprise.\"\n\nProsecutors said the gang carried out acts of murder, robbery and narcotics trafficking in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn since at least 2013.\n\nThe indictment said each gang member was required to participate in at least two acts of racketeering conspiracy. Those acts could include murder, robbery, extortion and drug distribution, the court papers said.\n\n6ix9ine recently pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in Brooklyn Criminal Court in connection with a May traffic stop. In a 2015 case in New York, 6ix9ine was sentenced to probation for his involvement in a sexually explicit video of a 13-year-old girl.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/20/tekashi-6-ix-9-ine-prof-explains-rico-charges-against-brooklyn-rapper/2073127002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Better blocking coincides with surge by Cowboys in NFC East", "description": "Improvement in offensive line helps fuel surge to NFC East contention by Cowboys", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/20/better-blocking-coincides-with-surge-by-cowboys-in-nfc-east/38576389/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e8258043163ff8d4f0c605d9d426d7e73dc8dff7/c=0-174-2480-1569/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/be31d33b5ab34e23a33163afae894818.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:53:41Z", "content": "FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 23, 2017, file photo, Dallas Cowboys guard Zack Martin (70) defends against a rush by Los Angeles Chargers defensive tackle Corey Liuget (94) as quarterback Dak Prescott (4) drops back in the pocket during an NFL football game ag\u2026 [+5984 chars]", "fulltext": "FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 23, 2017, file photo, Dallas Cowboys guard Zack Martin (70) defends against a rush by Los Angeles Chargers defensive tackle Corey Liuget (94) as quarterback Dak Prescott (4) drops back in the pocket during an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Chargers in Arlington, Texas.

The quarterback doesn't really care.\n\n\"I don't know what we needed or whatever it was,\" Prescott said Tuesday. \"The mindset and the way that they're playing right now, the confidence they have. The way that they're communicating is just something we're trying to build on.\"\n\nThe Cowboys (5-5) can pull even with Washington (6-4) atop the NFC East by beating their division rival on Thanksgiving. The surge into contention came from the pair of road wins against the past two NFC participants in the Super Bowl: Philadelphia and Atlanta.\n\nThose victories followed an 0-4 start on the road, with communication along the front among the primary problems without Frederick, the center and traffic cop who is out and increasingly unlikely to play this year because of a nerve disorder .\n\nDallas has praised backup center Joe Looney , while Martin has played through a left knee injury sustained in a preseason game and aggravated early in the win over the Eagles. Who knows whether the 2014 All-Pro would be doing that if Frederick were still alongside him.\n\n\"Anytime you lose an All-Pro player at a position, you can't replace a guy like that,\" Martin said. \"But I think guys, through the season, we're getting used to playing next to each other. We're extremely lucky to have a guy like Looney here to be able to step in and play the way he's played.\"\n\nSacks of Prescott that were an issue in the four straight road losses haven't disappeared. He's been dropped 34 times this season, already a career high, with multiple sacks in eight straight games. That's not even including a season-high six in the opener, a 16-8 loss at Carolina.\n\nBut Prescott wasn't sacked in the fourth quarter of the wins over the Eagles and Falcons, when the Cowboys matched tying scores with winning drives that featured a solid mix of star running back Ezekiel Elliott and clutch plays in the passing game. Time to throw for Prescott was crucial in several of those plays.\n\n\"There are still some things we need to clean up in protection, but we're getting better every week and I think guys have bought in,\" Martin said. \"It's been trending in the right direction.\"\n\nIt was trending in the wrong direction the first time the Cowboys played the Redskins . Elliott rushed for 33 yards, the second-lowest total of his career, and the Cowboys lost 20-17 when Brett Maher's potential tying field goal from 52 yards hit the left upright on the final play.\n\nAfter that loss, the Cowboys replaced first-year offensive line coach Paul Alexander with Colombo, the assistant line coach who played tackle for the Cowboys from 2005-10.\n\nAnd now, Elliott is coming off consecutive 100-yard games and needs 91 yards to overtake MVP contender Todd Gurley of the Los Angeles Rams for the NFL rushing lead. Gurley is off this week.\n\n\"The mindset of the way they're going to block, that's credit to Colombo, as much as it is getting back to the stuff we've done in the past that was more Cowboys football instead of trick-ems or whatever it was,\" Prescott said. \"The offensive line is doing a great job moving guys.\"\n\nThe Cowboys signed Su'a-Filo, a 2014 second-round pick by Houston, for depth in the second week of the season. A starter in 31 of 32 games over his final two seasons with the Texans, Su'a-Filo sat until Williams' knee injury was diagnosed after a loss to Tennessee eight weeks later.\n\nWilliams, who was overpowered several times on sacks of Prescott, is on the verge of returning after arthroscopic surgery. There's no indication Su'a-Filo is headed back to the bench after his showing against the Eagles and Falcons.\n\n\"Felt good about what Connor was doing and how he was growing, but Xavier has gone in there and done a good job against two good fronts,\" coach Jason Garrett said. \"He has held physically in the game, has communicated well with the other guys.\"\n\nFive-time Pro Bowl left tackle Tyron Smith left the Atlanta game with what he described as a stinger, replaced by former New England tackle Cameron Fleming, one of Dallas' free agent pickups. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones said Smith should play against the Redskins.\n\n\"I just think we've done a great job as a team overall of playing with all 11 guys,\" Elliott said. \"Everyone doing their job, everybody getting in the right spots and the O-line doing a great job up front.\"\n\nNOTES: Jones said on his radio show Tuesday he expects TE Geoff Swaim to miss three to four weeks after surgery for a broken wrist. ... Rookie WR Michael Gallup remained away from the team after getting the news following the Atlanta game that his brother had died by suicide. There is still a chance Gallup will play against the Redskins. ... C Adam Redmond was added to the injury report Tuesday with a concussion.

Vanderbilt won 36-29 in overtime. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Kyle Shurmur has been chasing down a handful of Vanderbilt passing records held by Jay Cutler all season long.\n\nNow the senior quarterback is poised to do something Cutler never managed. Shoot, no quarterback alive has done what Shurmur can do on Saturday: Beat in-state rival Tennessee three straight times.\n\nWhy, Vanderbilt hasn't won three straight against Tennessee since before the Southeastern Conference was formed. The last time the Commodores won more than back-to-back games in this series was a six-game streak between 1920 and 1926. And Shurmur is a very big reason why the Commodores have a chance at a winning streak not seen in nearly a century.\n\n\"He has experience, has a really good understanding of what they're trying to get done,\" Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt said of Shurmur. \"He makes very few mistakes. He throws the ball where they can catch it and nobody else can. A lot of that comes with playing a lot of ball and he has. He grew up around the game and does a really good job.\"\n\nShurmur, whose father, Pat, is head coach of the NFL's New York Giants, took Vandy's career passing TD mark last weekend with No. 60 in overtime to beat Mississippi 36-29. That topped the 59 TD passes Cutler threw.\n\nNow Shurmur will make his 40th career start needing a victory for a big piece of school history and a second bowl berth in three seasons for the Commodores (5-6, 2-5 SEC).\n\n\"I think Kyle understands what this game is, and he's not making it any different from any game he's played in,\" Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \"It's just his last game in this stadium.\"\n\nShurmur ranks second to Cutler in four other passing categories, and he needs 486 yards against the Vols to take the career passing yards mark (8,697). If he completes 38 passes, he would improve on Cutler's 710 career completions and 51 attempts would top Cutler's record of 1,242.\n\nConsidering the quarterback's past games against Tennessee, those marks aren't out of question.\n\nShurmur threw for a career-high 416 yards in a 45-34 upset of then-No. 24 Tennessee on Nov. 26, 2016, and he threw four TD passes in a 45-24 win in Knoxville last season. Asked Tuesday why Shurmur has been so good against Tennessee, senior center Bruno Reagan said it might just be the offense coming together at the end of the season.\n\n\"But he hopefully better do it again,\" Reagan said.\n\nSitting beside him, Shurmur quipped: \"You, too.\"\n\nShurmur said he doesn't think he plays better simply because the opponent is Tennessee. He agrees with Reagan that he's benefited from getting experience with teammates over the course of a season.\n\n\"It's a new year, and we've got a new challenge ahead,\" Shurmur said.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 225-pound Shurmur is 205 of 334 for 2,477 and 20 touchdowns this season, making him the first quarterback in Vanderbilt history with at least 20 TD passes in two seasons. He started five games as a freshman and has been helped this season by receiver Kalija Lipscomb and tight end Jared Pinkney, and Vandy also has a strong run threat in Ke'Shawn Vaughn.\n\nShurmur, now with a moustache he says took all of November to grow just for the Tennessee game, says he's treating this like any other game.\n\n\"We can sit back, rub elbows and talk about it's our last game or whatever (later), but right now I'm treating it like any other game and it'll be a fun one,\" Shurmur said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Steve Megargee contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(Photo: ESO/Callingham et al.)\n\nAstronomers have found a unique \"pinwheel\" star system in our own galaxy, one that will eventually die in a massive explosion that's never been seen before here in the Milky Way, a new study reports.\n\nScientists believe one of the stars \u2013 about 8,000 light years from Earth \u2013 is the first known candidate in the Milky Way that could produce a dangerous gamma-ray burst, among the most energetic events in the universe, when it explodes and dies.\n\n\u201cThis is the first such system to be discovered in our own galaxy,\u201d said study co-author Joseph Callingham, an astronomer with the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. \u201cWe never expected to find such a system in our own backyard,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe authors named the star system Apep after a serpent deity from ancient Egyptian mythology that's the mortal enemy of sun god Ra. Study co-author Peter Tuthill of the University of Sydney said \"the name seemed fitting as the sinuous dust plume looks like a coiled serpent doing battle with a central star.\u201d\n\nMore: 'Super Earth' discovered in orbit around a nearby star\n\nApep\u2019s stellar winds have created the dust cloud surrounding the system, which consists of a binary star with a fainter companion.\n\nThe star is spinning so fast that it's close to ripping itself apart. Scientists aren't sure when the star system will finally explode as a supernova, possibly in many thousands of years, but when it does, it will be spectacular.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are among the most powerful explosions in the universe. Lasting between a few thousandths of a second and a few hours, they can release as much energy as the sun will emit over its entire lifetime, according to the study.\n\nFortunately, the star does not appear to be aimed at Earth, because a strike by a gamma-ray burst so close by (in cosmic terms) could rip the ozone away from our atmosphere, drastically increasing our exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun.\n\nScientists believe a gamma-ray burst could have caused a huge extinction event on Earth about 450 million years ago, CBC news reported.\n\nThe study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/11/20/binary-star-system-apep-could-explode-spectacular-gamma-ray-blast/2071897002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Analyst: Trump-Saudi decision a 'slap in the face'", "description": "An analyst says President Donald Trump's decision not to bring more penalties against Saudi Arabia over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi is \"a slap in the face of the intelligence community\" (Nov. 20)", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/2018/11/20/analyst-trump-saudi-decision-slap-face/38575885/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5969663127001_5969655237001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:27:10Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Opinion contributor, Sharon Pinkerton, Opinion contributor", "title": "Airlines give flyers unprecedented choice", "description": "Time and again, air travel passengers indicate affordability is their chief consideration, writes Sharon Pinkerton of Airlines for America.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/20/thanksgiving-airlines-give-flyers-unprecedented-choice-editorials-debates/2072386002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/a12da2cc-6732-495b-a646-01cce35f0638-travel.oppose.JPG?crop=1275,717,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:25:54Z", "content": "Airlines for America logo (Photo: Airlines for America) Thanksgiving is a time for celebration and gratitude as millions of Americans gather to break bread and reflect on what were most thankful for.

The U.S. airline industry helps fulfill this cherished tradition by safely connecting friends and family around the world, providing more flight options to more destinations at historic low fares.\n\nAccording to the Transportation Department, inflation-adjusted fares for the second quarter were the lowest of any second quarter ever recorded. Ancillary services included, the average cost of a round-trip flight declined by more than 5 percent year-over-year, to $360 for the first six months of 2018.\n\nTime and again, customers indicate affordability is their chief consideration. Airlines have responded by investing in customized cabin offerings, giving travelers unprecedented choice. Flyers today have access to an airline, a route and amenities they value most at a price point that meets their budget.\n\nOUR VIEW: Thanksgiving travel leaves flyers feeling stuffed\n\nWhen making modernization decisions, as with daily operations, the safety and comfort of all passengers is paramount. Since January alone, airlines have reinvested more than $13billion in new, larger planes, enhanced technology, and improved premium seating and cabin designs that maximize personal space. The Federal Aviation Administration, which approves seat configurations, has affirmed that U.S. carriers meet federal cabin safety standards.\n\nFrom check-in to touchdown, airlines fiercely compete to earn each customer. In-flight crews keep passengers safe while making every accommodation to ensure all have a comfortable and enjoyable flight. It would be counterintuitive to provide anything less than a superior product and service.\n\nBetween last Friday and next Tuesday, U.S. airlines will connect a record 30.6 million passengers to colleagues, friends, family and loved ones. This Thanksgiving, on behalf of the 720,000 men and women who work for our nation\u2019s carriers, we are grateful to be part of the journey.\n\nSharon Pinkerton is a senior vice president at Airlines for America, which represents leading U.S. carriers.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/20/thanksgiving-airlines-give-flyers-unprecedented-choice-editorials-debates/2072386002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jeff Zillgitt, USA TODAY", "title": "Kevin Durant fined for hurling expletives at fan sitting courtside", "description": "The NBA on Tuesday fined Golden State Warriors All-Star Kevin Durant $25,000 for \u201cdirecting inappropriate language toward a fan.\u201d", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/11/20/kevin-durant-fined-hurling-expletives-fan-sitting-courtside/2073358002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/ecb2ec2b-9411-4f25-b6ad-094a70abf896-USATSI_11689502.jpg?crop=5567,3131,x0,y406&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:25:47Z", "content": "Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant exchanges words with a Dallas Mavericks fan during the second quarter at the American Airlines Center.

(Photo: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThere's $9 million at stake in The Match between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\n\nWell, actually there will be more.\n\nAs has been teased by Mickelson himself, side bets will take place during Friday's action at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. (The proceeds from that side action will go to charity.)\n\nIn fact, those side bets have already started.\n\nThe pair participated in a news conference Tuesday ahead of the event. One of the questions was about whether the players have already considered strategy on side bets ahead of time.\n\nMickelson went all in on his answer, propositioning a huge side bet:\n\n\"So I've thought a lot about this and there are spots out on the course that are some great spots for a little challenge and the challenges are coming directly out of our pockets, OK?\" Mickelson said. \"And I feel like the first hole is a great hole for me. And I believe \u2014 in fact I'm willing to risk $100,000 that says I birdie the first hole. So that's how good I feel heading into this match.\"\n\nLefty coming out strong.\n\n(For the record, the first hole at Shadow Creek is a 415-yard par 4.)\n\nHe wasn't done. Mickelson then chirped to Woods about the proposed $100,000 bet: \"You don't have to take it. You don't have to take it at all. But I'm going to throw that out there.\"\n\nHow did Woods respond? This is a 14-time major champion, folks. There was a 0.0 percent chance he would back down.\n\nFrom here, the exchange unfolded:\n\n\"Hold on, hold on, hold on,\" Woods said to Mickelson. \"So you think you can make birdie on the first hole?\"\n\n\"I know I'm going to make birdie on the first hole,\" Mickelson responded.\n\n\"Double it (the bet),\" Woods said.\n\nAnd we're off. But Mickelson, ever the showman, punctuated this back-and-forth with a flourish.\n\nAfter Woods' \"double it\" comment\u2026\n\n\"Did you see how I baited him like that?\" Mickelson said with a smile. \"Yes! ($200,000) says I birdie the first hole.\"\n\nWoods pointed out there's water on the left side of this hole and left tends to be Mickelson's miss. Mickelson then clarified that what Woods was missing was that he would hit a 2-iron off the tee, leaving him a short-iron from the fairway. Lefty further noted he's a fantastic short-iron player.\n\nHence, he feels he \"baited\" Woods into accepting a favorable bet toward Mickelson.\n\n\"Part of it is strategic,\" Mickelson said on side bets, \"because you've got to get them to accept it. So you see how I subtly slipped that in? Yeah I didn't know how I was going to do that, but I think I found the way.\"\n\nAn unfazed Woods later reaffirmed the $200,000 side bet simply by saying, \"Done.\"\n\nWe're three days away and already off to a great start."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "No. 4 Michigan may have edge on D against No. 10 Ohio State", "description": "No. 4 Michigan has the nation's top-ranked defense because NFL-caliber players are at each position group and one of the game's best coordinators is calling the shots", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/20/no-4-michigan-may-have-edge-on-d-against-no-10-ohio-state/38576135/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/84acc19884bc86851643448aa9be1f42fa3bf44d/c=0-272-3000-1960/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/0bd0920819c9451db36e2aa33cdae065.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:19:58Z", "content": "FILE - In this Sept. 1, 2018, file photo, Notre Dame tight end Alize Mack (86) drops a pass as Michigan linebacker Josh Uche (6) defends in the second half of an NCAA football game in South Bend, Ind.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) \u2014 No. 4 Michigan has the nation's top-ranked defense with NFL-caliber players at each position group and one of the game's best coordinators calling the shots.\n\nThe Wolverines, though, have not been tested as much as they will be by No. 10 Ohio State and quarterback Dwayne Haskins on Saturday in the Horseshoe. And they know this edition of The Game will define their season.\n\n\"Everybody is going to remember what you did against Ohio State,\" defensive tackle Carlo Kemp said. \"This game has huge implications. For us to go out there and continue the way we've been playing, that would be a statement.\"\n\nOhio State's defense, meanwhile, has uncharacteristically had a hard time stopping a lot of teams.\n\nThe Buckeyes gave up a total of 100 points in a one-point, overtime win at Maryland and in a lopsided loss a month ago at Purdue. Losing standout Nick Bosa didn't help, but Ohio State has not found any consistent way to shut down teams.\n\n\"I feel like things are just getting overplayed because the games are closer than what they're usually used to,\" Buckeyes defensive tackle Dre'Mont Jones said. \"We don't have the same personnel, like I've said before, so don't expect every game to be perfect. We're 10-1, not 1-10. We're winning good games. We've won against ranked teams. We're going to play up to our competition.\"\n\nOhio State has won six straight in the rivalry, but in three wins against coach Jim Harbaugh has not had to defend a dual-threat quarterback anything like Shea Patterson , who is surrounded by talented skill players and a solid offensive line.\n\nMichigan may be without defensive end Chase Winovich because of a shoulder injury. If the defensive player of the year candidate can't play, the Wolverines have so much depth they may be able to overcome it just as they did when defensive tackle Rashan Gary missed three games last month with a shoulder injury.\n\nAssistant coach Greg Mattison said before the season started eight or nine players would merit playing time on the defensive line, and he wasn't exaggerating. The backups do their part, too: Despite being a reserve in every game, Josh Uche leads Michigan with seven sacks. The deep and talented front occupies offensive linemen, allowing linebackers such as Devin Bush to blitz quarterbacks or sprint sideline to sideline to make tackles.\n\nSpeedy and aggressive defensive backs are put in man-to-man coverage by defensive coordinator Don Brown, a candidate for the Broyles Award as college football's top assistant.\n\nIt all adds up to help Michigan lead the nation in yards allowed per game (234.8) and yards passing (123.2) while ranking fourth in points allowed (13.5).\n\nOhio State's defense took a hit it hasn't recovered from when Bosa needed surgery for a core muscle injury after playing in three games this season. The defensive end decided to withdraw from school to focus on preparing for the NFL draft as a possible No. 1 pick.\n\nThe Buckeyes, who usually have stout defenses under coach Urban Meyer, have often looked lost when opponents have the ball. Players have been out of position at times and when they are in the right spots, mental errors and poor tackling have hurt.\n\n\"Our biggest issue this year is that we've been in the right positions, we just don't make the tackles,\" Jones said.\n\nThe problems were obvious for all to see when Buckeyes missed 20 tackles and allowed Purdue to gain 378 yards in a stunning 49-20 blowout. They're coming off another poor performance, giving up 536 yards and 51 points to the Terrapins, who had freshman running back Anthony McFarland run for 298 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"Obviously it was very alarming to see,\" Meyer said. \"I thought that we started to crack the rock the last few weeks as far as playing good defense, elimination of big plays.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Mitch Stacy contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter at https://twitter.com/larrylage\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

One American Airlines pilot described the lavatory as \u201cthe most miserable experience in the world. ... I can\u2019t turn around in it.\u201d\n\nHardly spacious to begin with, airline lavatories on some newer jets have been cut to 24-26 inches wide, down from about 34 inches, according to news reports. Several of the airlines have used the space to squeeze more seats and passengers into economy class.\n\nAIRLINES FOR AMERICA: We give flyers unprecedented choice\n\nHow tiny are the toilets on the Boeing 737 Max and other newer jets? We asked around, and it's hard to get a straight answer from the airlines:\n\n\u25baUnited would only say its lavatories are \"industry standard.\"\n\n\u25baDelta emphasized its \"large overhead bins\" and \"increased space\" above passengers' heads.\n\n\u25baSouthwest wouldn't talk about dimensions per \"contractual terms\" with the lavatory manufacturer, but the airline said it didn't use the space for more seats.\n\n\u25baAn American spokesman says lavs in its newest planes are 2 inches smaller than in older ones, while CEO Doug Parker said in March that the lavs \"are large enough for people to use them,\" adding that they're \"real estate. We need to figure out the best use of the real estate.\"\n\nThis holiday, a record number of travelers expected to fly from last Friday to next Tuesday \u2014 30.6 million, an increase of about 1.5 million over the same period last year \u2014 will be competing for that shrunken space. Don't expect any relief from empty middle seats or fewer people lining up to use those cramped bathrooms.\n\nShrinking seats and less legroom aren't just a holiday problem. They've been a nuisance for flyers in recent years, as airlines have reduced seat pitch from an average of about 35 inches to 31 inches on the major carriers, and seat width from 18 to 17 inches.\n\nAt the same time, as you've no doubt noticed, Americans have grown larger: About 70 percent are overweight or have obesity, and that's not counting Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nSome passenger advocacy groups, such as Flyers Rights and Travelers United, have been battling to get the Federal Aviation Administration to recognize seat size as a safety problem. In July, the FAA said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that seat width and pitch, combined with larger passengers, slow evacuations.\n\nIf it\u2019s a comfort issue, that\u2019s between airlines and their customers. But safety is the FAA\u2019s business, and Congress finally realized that. In a law enacted last month, it directed the FAA to establish within a year the minimum seat dimensions necessary for passenger safety \u2014 a directive the agency should take seriously.\n\nThanksgiving travel is a big enough hassle without putting the big squeeze on flyers.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

The total of 18,421 structures is more than three times the toll from last fall's Tubbs Fire in Napa and Sonoma.\n\nSatellite imagery and analytics firm DigitalGlobe, a Maxar company, collected images before and after the fire the town of Paradise, which was devastated by the fire in its first few days.\n\nHeavy smoke blankets the forest where the Camp Fire burned on Nov. 11\n\n\n\n(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nThe Camp Fire grew rapidly near midday Nov. 8, consuming 10,000 acres in about 90 minutes \u2013 burning the equivalent of more than one football field every second during that time. It charred more than 70,000 acres in a day's time.\n\nAnd the fire isn't out yet.\n\nThe fire was 80 percent contained on Wednesday morning, Cal Fire said. As a result, almost 5,100 more homes, businesses and other buildings remained threatened. More than 300 fire trucks, 8 helicopters and 3,745 fire personnel continued to battle the blaze on Wednesday.\n\nThe good news and bad news is that rain is forecast for Wednesday through Friday.\n\n\"The rain is definitely going to have a positive effect on fire suppression activity,\" Forest Service spokesman Brian Ramsey said. But the totals, 2-4 inches, could be too much of a good thing \u2013 ash flows, mudslides and flooding could result.\n\nContributing: Damon Arthur, Redding (Calif.)

The PGA Tour said in a statement that the settlement reflects a mutual commitment to move forward \"as we put this matter behind us.\"\n\nIt ends a rough chapter in the tour's 10 years of an anti-doping program.\n\nSingh was approaching his 50th birthday when he said in a Sports Illustrated article at the start of 2013 that he used deer antler spray, which was said to include an insulin-growth factor that was on the tour's list of banned substances.\n\nThe tour sent a sample from Singh to be tested, and it returned small amounts of IGF-1. Under the tour's policy, admission of using a banned substance is a violation even without a test. The tour told him on Feb. 19, 2013, that he would be suspended for three months.\n\nTwo months later, the tour decided to drop its case. During the appeals process, then-Commissioner Tim Finchem said the World Anti-Doping Agency said it no longer considers deer antler spray prohibited except for a positive test result because it contained such a tiny amount of IGF-1.\n\nThe next week, Singh sued the tour, claiming \"public humiliation and ridicule\" during the 12-week investigation. Singh's lawyers said the tour \"rushed to judgment in accusing one of the hardest-working players in golf.\"\n\nSingh, who grew up in Fiji, set a PGA Tour record by winning 22 times after turning 40. He won 34 times on the PGA Tour, including three majors, reached No. 1 in the world and was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe ended the PGA Tour Champions season a week ago by shooting 61 in the final round to win the Charles Schwab Cup Championship. At age 55, Singh still played nine times on the PGA Tour this year, though his best finish was 49th in the Masters.\n\nThe tour said in its statement that it does not believe Singh intended to gain an unfair advantage by using the deer antler spray.\n\n\"Vijay fully supports the PGA Tour's Anti-Doping Program and all efforts to protect the integrity of the game that he loves so much,\" the statement said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Comey, the latest indication the president views the department as a potential weapon to use against political opponents, according to a report.\n\nThe New York Times, citing unnamed sources familiar with Trump\u2019s conversation, said the president told former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn in the spring that he wanted the Justice Department to pursue Clinton and Comey.\n\nMcGahn, according to the report, rebuffed the request, saying it would prompt critics to claim the president was abusing his power.\n\nThe revelation comes weeks after Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom the president frequently criticized for recusing himself from the ongoing probe into Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Trump replaced Sessions with Matthew Whitaker, an interim attorney general and ally who has more readily embraced the president\u2019s views.\n\nMcGahn left the White House in October.\n\nThe report came on what should have been a quiet week heading into the Thanksgiving holiday, when Trump and the Justice Department made a series of high-profile announcements. They released the long-awaited financial-disclosure forms for Whitaker, and the president's attorneys confirmed late Tuesday that Trump had submitted written answers to questions posed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry,\" Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, said in a statement. \"The president responded in writing.\"\n\nThe questions and the answers were pursuant to an agreement between Trump's attorney's and Mueller\u2019s office, which is looking into whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said the president refused to entertain questions about alleged obstruction, or any activities since he became president.\n\n\u201cThe questions and the answers all related to Russia,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe answer is he had no involvement or knowledge of that.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied obstruction, and his lawyers argue his actions, including the firing of Comey, were well within the president\u2019s authority.\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, released the financial disclosure form from Whitaker, the acting attorney general appointed earlier this month to take over on an interim basis after Sessions' ouster. Whitaker revised the filing five times after being named to the post the day after the midterm election.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump continued to seek the prosecutions of Clinton and Comey, an idea he has often raised during his political rallies. But the president continued to discuss the idea privately, including the possible appointment of another second special counsel to look into the two foes, according to the Times report.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe disclosure that McGahn advised Trump against seeking a prosecution of Clinton and Comey is sure to refocus attention on the extensive cooperation McGahn has provided to Mueller in his ongoing investigation. That inquiry includes whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe by firing Comey last spring.\n\nMcGahn\u2019s interviews with Mueller\u2019s team spanned about 30 hours in total, said a person familiar with the former White House counsel\u2019s contact with the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\nThe New York Times first disclosed the extent of McGahn\u2019s cooperation in August.\n\nMcGahn's cooperation with Mueller was extraordinary because it could have been protected in part by executive privilege. Trump waived that privilege, hoping transparency would quicken the pace of Mueller's investigation and thus, put an end to a query that has put a cloud over his presidency.\n\nThe person familiar with McGahn\u2019s communications with Mueller\u2019s team has not elaborated on the contents of his discussions with Mueller\u2019s team, but as counsel to the president McGahn was privy to the most controversial issues involving the White House.\n\nMcGahn reportedly told investigators what he knew about the president's role in the firing of Comey, Trump's repeated criticism of Sessions and his role in the Russia investigation before the president hired outside counsel to deal with the matter, The Times reported in August.\n\nTrump has since confirmed that he instructed McGahn to \"fully cooperate\" with Mueller's team. He also alluded to other members of his staff being interviewed.\n\n\"I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel,\" Trump said in August. \"In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents.

The most recent case was Oct. 31.\n\nThe symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections include severe stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea, and most people recover in five to seven days, the FDA said. Most vulnerable are children younger than 5, people over 65 and people with weakened immune systems. Five percent to 10 percent develop a potentially life-threatening type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\nThe FDA is working with Canadian officials to investigate because of cases reported north of the border, too.\n\nThe strain of E. coli O157:H7 has no genetic link to the one in the spring, but it is similar to the strain found in the fall of 2017. Those incidents of E. coli were tied to leafy greens in the U.S. and romaine lettuce in Canada. Twenty-five cases in 15 states were reported, including one death and two incidents of hemolytic uremic syndrome, the FDA said.\n\nThe spring outbreak, which was traced to the Yuma, Arizona, growing region, resulted in 210 sick people and 96 hospitalizations. Five people died. The last illness onset in that outbreak was Aug. 2.\n\nOn Nov. 1, the FDA released a report about factors that might have led to the outbreak, concluding that \"the water from the irrigation canal where the outbreak strain was found most likely led to contamination of the romaine lettuce consumed during this outbreak.\"\n\nThe water may have been used to irrigate the crops or to dilute chemical sprays put on them. The FDA said it didn't know how the canal got tainted.\n\n\"A large animal feeding operation is nearby but no obvious route for contamination from this facility to the irrigation canal was identified,\" the report said. \"Other explanations are possible although the ... team found no evidence to support them.\"\n\nCLOSE Check your pantry.

So For The Win conducted its annual investigation to see what some drivers really think of each other and how they answered these eight personality questions.\n\nAnswers have been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.\n\n1. Which driver is most likely to start a fight?\n\nJoey Logano: Apparently me lately. I don\u2019t know, you take a guess. The normals.\n\nKevin Harvick: I don\u2019t know, who was the last fight? I think Kyle (Busch) punched Joey, so I guess the most recent would be the most likely.\n\nDenny Hamlin: Harvick, because he has before.\n\nAlex Bowman: Who was the last guy in a fight? Kyle Busch? Probably Kyle Busch.\n\nAric Almirola: A physical or verbal fight? Verbal fight, I would say my teammate Kevin Harvick\u2019s pretty good at that. Actually, I would say Kyle Busch is pretty high on the list there. He\u2019s very opinionated and very grumpy when he doesn\u2019t win.\n\nAnd then an actual physical fight? I don\u2019t know who would instigate one, but I know Ryan Newman would not be one you\u2019d want to start a fight.\n\nKyle Larson: Probably Joey Logano. I feel like he makes a lot of people mad. Or Kyle Busch.\n\nKurt Busch: Kevin Harvick is most likely to start a fight. That\u2019s just his mentality\n\nBrad Keselowski: Have there been any fights this year? I guess none of us then?\n\nJimmie Johnson: There\u2019s really none of us that want to be in a fist fight. We start lots of car fights after an incident. We\u2019ll create more work for our crew guys, and I\u2019m putting myself in that. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m some tough guy by any stretch, but I just don\u2019t see any real fights. There might be a push or a shove, but there\u2019s plenty of car fights.\n\nRyan Blaney: I could see Ryan Newman getting into it, and he\u2019s the one guy I would not want to fight.\n\nClint Bowyer: These guys aren\u2019t gonna fight! First of all, you don\u2019t know what NASCAR\u2019s gonna do to you if you do fight, but they\u2019re gonna make sure they benefit for years to come off you having a temper tantrum and fighting. They\u2019re gonna have you in commercials for the rest of your career.\n\n2. Who\u2019s most likely to get revenge on another driver on the track?\n\nBowman: Probably Kyle Busch. Or Joey Logano.\n\nLarson: I feel like Logano\u2019s the type that if you make him mad, he\u2019s just gonna wreck you.\n\nHamlin: Matt Kenseth\n\nKurt Busch: Martin Truex Jr. is a sneaky one for revenge.\n\nKeselowski: Oooh, I would say probably Matt Kenseth. Just look at the history.\n\nJohnson: I think we\u2019re all capable, I would say. I think Kyle Busch comes to mind. Not necessarily revenge in a bad way, but I think (Larson) used him up in Chicago in Turns 1 and 2, and Kyle got back to him in 3 and 4. So I guess Kyle.\n\nBowyer: All of us.\n\n3. Who\u2019s the best driver to be around if you\u2019re having a bad day?\n\nKeselowski: Probably Clint Bowyer because he\u2019s very light-hearted. He can make anything funny.\n\nJohnson: Bowyer. Even if he\u2019s having a bad day, he still has a humorous way to send his message. He\u2019s just a lot of fun.\n\nBowyer: Probably Kevin (Harvick), as long as he\u2019s having a good day, and that answer has to be that way. If I\u2019m having a bad day, Kevin is definitely the guy that helps because he\u2019ll make fun of me or something and put me in a good mood. But if he\u2019s having a bad day, he\u2019s worse than I am, so that\u2019s not a good combination.\n\nLogano: Jeez, I don\u2019t really look for drivers to pick me up, not really looking to be around any of them. They\u2019ve all got their ulterior motives.\n\nBowman: For me, Jimmie Johnson. He\u2019s super helpful. He\u2019s obviously won a lot, and he\u2019s also gone through a lot of different experiences and circumstances, and typically whatever you\u2019re going through, you can lean on him and learn something.\n\nKurt Busch: It seems like Kyle Larson wants to be your friend out on the track, so I\u2019d like to be around him if I\u2019m having a bad day.\n\nLarson: I spend a lot of time around Ricky Stenhouse Jr., so I would say him. But the funniest guy in the garage is definitely Clint Bowyer so maybe him also.\n\nBlaney: Just your friends, Chase Elliott or Bubba Wallace. We go way back, so if you\u2019re having a bad day just nice to relax and hang out with them.\n\n4. Most likely to have a burner Twitter account?\n\nKurt Busch: I would go with Blaney. I would just assume. He\u2019s in on the youth movement.\n\nKeselowski: Ryan Blaney. I just think Ryan Blaney\u2019s probably got a Twitter burner account, but that\u2019s just a suspicion.\n\nBlaney: Keselowski for some reason comes to mind. I don\u2019t know why.\n\nLarson: Ryan Newman doesn\u2019t ever tweet anything personally \u2014 his PR people do \u2014 but he\u2019s always on Twitter looking at people\u2019s stuff.\n\nHamlin: Brad Keselowski.\n\nBowman: I\u2019m sure Dale Jr. could have a burner account, and it\u2019d be some parody or something. It\u2019d be pretty funny.\n\nJohnson: Carl Edwards and he\u2019s not even in the sport.\n\nAlmirola: I assume it would be one of the young kids. Name any kid you want \u2014 Bubba Wallace.\n\nBowyer: What the (expletive) is that? I think I have a Facebook account, but I have no idea how to get on it. Is that a burner?\n\n5. Most annoying or frustrating driver on the track this year and why?\n\nKurt Busch: Oh that\u2019s easy. That\u2019s my little brother. He\u2019s always annoying.\n\nLarson: Any lapped car. Lappers in general are annoying.\n\nHamlin: I would say your teammates because you\u2019ve gotta race them a little cleaner than the other guys.\n\nBowyer: For me, it\u2019s probably been Chase Elliott, I don\u2019t even know why. He\u2019s just a pain in my ass. But a lot of times when you\u2019re racing around somebody that much, I think our teams, at the end of the day, have competed a lot on the track together, and when you do that, you\u2019re gonna have things happen.\n\nBowman: It\u2019s different every week. Ryan Newman\u2019s still the hardest guy to pass, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to change.\n\nJohnson: I can\u2019t look any further than myself. I\u2019ve been so frustrated in not being able to race where I want to and do the things that I want to in the car, I haven\u2019t really paid attention to anyone else.\n\n6. Who\u2019s most likely to drive a beat-up car in real life?\n\nJohnson: I don\u2019t know why Bowyer comes to mind. His give-a-(expletive) meter is broken.\n\nKurt Busch: I\u2019ve seen some of the cool Volkswagens that Daniel Su\u00e1rez has, so I\u2019m gonna go with him. I\u2019ve seen him in his Volkswagen bus here at the track.\n\nLogano: I know Daniel Su\u00e1rez does. I do as well, but I know Su\u00e1rez has got an old bus that\u2019s not getting anywhere in a hurry.\n\nLarson: Ryan Blaney because he\u2019s weird, and I think he does drive a beat up Bronco.\n\nHamlin: Ryan Newman. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s probably got an old pickup truck at home that he drives.\n\nBowman: I will make fun of William Byron because he bought a Corvette that\u2019s automatic, and that\u2019s just terrible. You\u2019re supposed to buy a manual, and he bought an automatic one. So it\u2019s not beat up, but it is lame. \u2026 That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Maybe because he\u2019s young and from the video game era, he just wants to push a button and go. It\u2019s definitely weird.\n\nBlaney: Logano likes old cars. He has a bunch of old ones. They\u2019re not really beat up, but they\u2019re old.\n\nAlmirola: David Ragan because he\u2019s one of the most frugal (people) I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see what this little guy is going to do with his life! #TeamJL pic.twitter.com/clw4VsereQ \u2014 Joey Logano (@joeylogano) January 16, 2018\n\n7. Which driver is had the most surprising performance this year?\n\nLogano: I guess surprising not in a good way, Jimmie\u2019s season has been a surprise (after he finished without a win). I like Jimmie. I don\u2019t want this to come across in a bad way, but I think he surprised everybody.\n\nBowyer: Probably Jimmie Johnson.\n\nKurt Busch: I think the most surprising performance is actually the lack of performance from Chevrolet. I didn\u2019t think the Camaro would be that far off.\n\nHarvick: I\u2019ve been really surprised that Denny Hamlin has not won a race, when you look at the (Joe) Gibbs organization and how successful he\u2019s been over the years.\n\nBlaney: Harvick and Kyle Busch. It\u2019s not surprising that they won; it\u2019s surprising how many times they\u2019ve won and how dominant they\u2019ve been.\n\nLarson: If I can pick three guys, I think the dominance that Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. have put on throughout the year has been pretty amazing. It\u2019s very rare to see three guys be that much better than the competition, but they spent a lot of the year a lot better than the rest of us.\n\nHamlin: Erik Jones.\n\nKeselowski: Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t say anybody\u2019s surprised me this year. I think it\u2019s the lack of surprises that\u2019s more stood out to me.\n\nAlmirola: I would have to say our team has been one of the team\u2019s that\u2019s caught most people by surprise. I think that the industry thought we would be average or slightly above, and I feel like our team has outperformed most everyone\u2019s expectations.\n\n8. Largest impact on the sport this season?\n\nLogano: I like to think I have some kind of impact. Might be me, probably Kevin (Harvick) if not.\n\nAlmirola: Chase Elliott, probably, now that Dale Jr.\u2019s gone. I think think it\u2019s pretty well assumed that Chase Elliott is becoming more of the face of the sport and becoming one of the most popular drivers. So for him having success and winning a few races is a big deal for this sport.\n\nJohnson: I feel like Chase Elliott is. His performance on the track and winning with a legacy and his likeability, I think he\u2019s the one.\n\nBlaney: Either Bubba (Wallace) or Chase (Elliott). Chase winning a couple times is pretty big for the sport, and then Bubba being there full-time is really big for it too.\n\nLarson: Kyle Busch brings a lot of attention to the sport with his personality. He\u2019s loved and hated by a lot of fans, so I feel like he does a good job of bringing attention to our sport.\n\nHamlin: Kyle Busch. Winning a lot and he\u2019s had some really good finishes, wild finishes with Harvick and Larson.\n\nKurt Busch: I would still go with Dale Jr. in the broadcast booth. He\u2019s been nailing it.\n\nBowman: I think Dale has obviously had a big impact on the sport throughout his career and stepping away from driving full time and going to the tv booth, he\u2019s continuing to have a very large impact on the sport. But Chase Elliott is obviously very popular, his dad was very popular, so I think he\u2019s having a big impact.\n\nKeselowski: I don\u2019t see one person sticking out. I would say the three drivers that have won the most races between Kevin, Kyle and Martin, it\u2019s pretty equal between those three.\n\nBowyer: (Expletive), I don\u2019t know. It\u2019d be a smartass answer, and we\u2019d probably lose our jobs. I don\u2019t know, we all make an impact. We all make a difference."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "The Latest: North Florida hands Southern Miss first loss", "description": "Garrett Sams and Noah Horchler posted double-doubles and North Florida defeated Southern Miss 64-48 in the Cancun Challenge Tuesday, handing the Golden Eagles their first loss of the season", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/20/the-latest-north-florida-hands-southern-miss-first-loss/38575975/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:59:22Z", "content": "CANCUN, Mexico (AP) The Latest on the Cancun Challenge (all times local): 6 p.m. Garrett Sams and Noah Horchler posted double-doubles and North Florida defeated Southern Miss 64-48 in the Cancun Challenge Tuesday, handing the Golden Eagles their first loss of\u2026 [+1919 chars]", "fulltext": "CANCUN, Mexico (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Cancun Challenge (all times local):\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nLamar Stevens equaled his season high with 25 points and Penn State defeated Wright State 77-59 on Tuesday night to advance to the championship game of the Cancun Challenge's Riviera bracket.\n\nThe Nittany Lions (3-1) will play Bradley Wednesday while the Raiders take on SMU for third place.\n\nStevens was 10 of 15 from the floor and has reached 20 points in all four games this season.

The high-scoring engine of the Chicago Blackhawks spent some time with his girlfriend, and watched hockey and Monday Night Football.\n\nIt was a nice soft landing for the start of his 30s. On the ice, he has no interest in slowing down.\n\nThe once youthful core of three Stanley Cup titles took another hit when Kane turned 30 on Monday, a development that seemed much further away when he burst onto the scene with his only NHL team way back in 2007. But Kane himself seems to be wearing the number just fine.\n\n\"I mean you think about turning 30 and then it's like, OK, you know, whatever, it's just a number,\" he said after practice on Tuesday, \"and then all of the sudden, it's like you're 30 now. It's a little bit different. But you know it is what it is and try to just keep plugging along here.\"\n\nAfter two years of declining numbers, Kane is doing a lot better than plugging along. He leads Chicago with 12 goals and 13 assists heading into Wednesday night's game at Washington. He also is averaging a career-high 21:40 of ice time.\n\nWhile Kane is still going strong, Chicago is trying to get back on track after longtime coach Joel Quenneville was fired during an eight-game losing streak. The Blackhawks also missed the playoffs last season for the first time in a decade.\n\nJeremy Colliton, who replaced Quenneville, is just three years older than Kane.\n\n\"He's such a competitor. He wants to win. He wants the team to do well,\" Colliton said. \"He puts a lot of pressure on himself to be the guy to help the team win. That's tough. That's a big load to carry. But he competes. He wants to make a difference every night and when you're coaching a team, you got a guy with that amount of skill with that mentality, it's pretty fun.\"\n\nAfter Quenneville was fired Nov. 6, Kane openly wondered if the situation might have been different if he wasn't battling an illness during the coach's last road trip with the team.\n\nWhile time has made Kane a better player in several ways, it also has taken a toll.\n\n\"I think I was a little bit more carefree when I was younger,\" Kane said. \"I wouldn't get as frustrated, so that's probably one thing I would take with me. But as far as my game, I'm pretty happy with where I'm at. Just keep improving. Still think I got a little bit more to go on the ice this season.\"\n\nKane's family visited this past weekend, and he had two assists in Sunday's 3-1 victory over Minnesota. He said his three sisters put together a video of friends, family and former and current teammates wishing him a happy birthday.\n\nHe played 19 1/2 minutes against the Wild after clearing 24 minutes in Friday night's shootout loss to the Los Angeles Kings. When it comes to his ice time, even as he begins his 30s, Kane wants as much as he can get.\n\n\"I feel great,\" he said. \"Obviously love playing, love being out there. Any ice time for me is definitely welcomed. I feel the more I get out there, the more I get into the game, the more I can help the team out.\"\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Sabres won 5-4 in overtime. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Mike Sullivan's regular film sessions with the Pittsburgh Penguins don't lack for clues on why one of the NHL's marquee franchises is in the midst of its bumpiest stretch in more than a decade.\n\nThe defense can morph into a disjointed mess under sustained pressure, particularly right in front of the net. The crisp breakouts that used to trigger odd-man rushes featuring some of the league's most skilled players moving at warp speed have largely vanished and been replaced by something significantly sloppier.\n\nOh, and the NHL at large has caught up to the frenetic tempo Sullivan introduced when he took over nearly three years ago, a hiring that \u2014 combined with a roster makeover authored by general manager Jim Rutherford \u2014 helped power the Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cups. In that way, Pittsburgh's current struggles are a byproduct of its not-so-distant glory.\n\n\"For the most part it's a copycat league and teams tend to try to emulate the teams that have success,\" Sullivan said Tuesday. \"When you look at our team over the last handful of seasons, we've had pretty good success with a certain style of play.\"\n\nA style Sullivan has no plans to abandon even with Pittsburgh mired in a 1-7-2 funk that has dropped his club into a tie for the fewest points in the wide-open Eastern Conference a quarter of the way through the season.\n\n\"You look at the core of our players, (Sidney) Crosby, (Evgeni) Malkin, (Phil) Kessel, (Kris) Letang, all those guys can skate,\" Sullivan said. \"They can still skate.\"\n\nThe thing now is, so can everyone else.\n\nThe proof came to life over the last 30 minutes against Buffalo on Monday night, when the Sabres reeled off the final four goals, including Jake Eichel's game-winner 45 seconds into overtime at the end of a sequence that began with a Malkin giveaway in the offensive zone.\n\nIt was the kind of miscue Pittsburgh used to pounce on with ruthless efficiency. Now it's the Penguins who are making the crucial mistakes, ones that are ending up in the back of their own net with alarming regularity.\n\n\"I think we've been doing some really good things the last handful of games but we've been shooting ourselves in the foot a little bit with a few plays,\" forward Bryan Rust said. \"We've got to be a little bit more mindful of that and just dig down a little bit deeper and the bounces will eventually go our way.\"\n\nThere is a fair amount of \"puck luck\" that's abandoned Pittsburgh at the moment. The Penguins were up two goals late in the second period against Buffalo when Pittsburgh defenseman Jack Johnson locked up Sabres forward Conor Sheary in front of the net. No matter. Casey Nelson's shot from the point deflected off Johnson's skate and by goaltender Casey DeSmith.\n\nWatching from afar while sitting out a third straight game nursing an upper body injury, Crosby could only scratch his head.\n\n\"I think the thing for us that's probably been a little more difficult is, it's not necessarily the same thing,\" said the two-time MVP, who hopes to play on Wednesday when Pittsburgh hosts Dallas. \"We've found different ways to lose games and you know, we've probably corrected one thing and something else has been a factor in another game we lost.\"\n\nOne thread, however, has been a constant: defense. The Penguins \u2014 particularly early in the season during the Crosby era \u2014 have occasionally been slow to tighten things up because they are so talented offensively that the finer points of playing responsibly in their own end can be lost.\n\nIn past years, Pittsburgh has been able to outscore opponents even on nights it didn't particularly play well. That's not happening at the moment. The loss to Buffalo marked the eighth time in 19 games the Penguins have allowed at least five goals, something they did 13 times all of last season.\n\nWhile Sullivan is quick to point to the number of quality chances Pittsburgh created against Buffalo, he's well aware his team was far too generous in front of DeSmith. Pittsburgh dominated the first period but only had a 1-1 tie to show for it after forward Dominik Simon lost his footing while attempting to help clear a puck. Buffalo kept it in the zone and a cross-ice pass led to a one-timer that Tage Thompson buried to even the game.\n\n\"We've got to do a better job defending and making sure we stay on the right side of the puck and the right side of people in the critical areas of the rink,\" Sullivan said. \"That's an area we can all improve as a team.\"\n\nPittsburgh hasn't missed the playoffs since Crosby's rookie year in 2005-06 and Crosby stressed it is far too early to panic.\n\n\"It's tight but we just have to make sure we eliminate our mistakes and give ourselves the best chance and I thought for the most part (against Buffalo) we were pretty in control of that game,\" Crosby said. \"I think if we keep trending that way, we'll learn from that one and get a lot more wins.\"\n\nThree quarters of the season remains. Though the Penguins have been \"meh\" at best, the rest Metropolitan Division hasn't exactly been lights out. Only eight points separate the Penguins from first-place Columbus. One good consistent stretch of hockey and things can change very quickly.\n\n\"You can't control the ones you've let slip away,\" Crosby said. \"Ten games from now, you don't know where you're going to be.\"\n\n___\n\nFull AP NHL coverage: http://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They added right-handed pitcher Edinson Volquez and outfielder Scott Heineman from Triple-A Nashville, along with right-hander Wei-Chieh Huang and lefty Taylor Hearn from Double-A Frisco.\n\nTexas also acquired infielder Jack Reinheimer from the Chicago Cubs on a waiver claim, while right-handers Eddie Butler and Ronald Herrera were assigned outright to Triple-A Nashville.\n\nThe 35-year-old Mathis spent the last two years with Arizona and hit .200 this season with one homer and 20 RBIs in 69 games. He threw out 18 of 53 runners attempting to steal this year, and his 17 defensive runs saved were five more than any other catcher.\n\nMathis is a .198 hitter in 13 seasons with the Los Angeles Angels (2005-11), Toronto (2012), Miami (2013-16) and Arizona (2017-18).\n\nTexas earlier this month declined its 2019 option for Robinson Chirinos, the primary starting catcher last season who threw out only six of 59 attempted base stealers. Chirinos had a $4.5 million option for next season with a $100,000 buyout.\n\nVolquez rejoined the Rangers last spring on a two-year deal and had been at the team's facility in Arizona rehabbing from Tommy John surgery in August 2017. He made his big league debut in 2005 with the Rangers, who traded him before the 2008 season to Cincinnati in the deal that brought future AL MVP Josh Hamilton to Texas.\n\nHe is 93-87 with a 4.42 ERA in 276 games with the Rangers (2005-07), Cincinnati (2008-11), San Diego (2012-13), Los Angeles Dodgers (2013), Pittsburgh (2014), Kansas City (2015-16), and Miami (2017).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A prospect can be a dominant college player and not have a skillset that transfers to the NBA game \u2014 it happens all the time. But this was never supposed to apply to Markelle Fultz.\n\nOn Tuesday, we learned that Fultz would see a shoulder specialist at the direction of his attorney. The second-year pro is averaging 8 points per game but shooting dreadful percentages from beyond three feet.\n\nAnyone who watched the embattled Sixers guard play in Washington saw a player capable of making an immediate impact at the NBA level. Yet, since being taken with the No. 1 overall pick in 2017, everything that could have gone wrong for Fultz did. It\u2019s gotten to the point where Fultz can\u2019t shoot a free throw without a variation of broken mechanics.\n\nThe Sixers thought they were getting this player. All of us did.\n\nIt has been a regression that few saw coming, particularly NBA draft experts who widely praised Philadelphia\u2019s selection of Fultz with the first pick \u2014 us included. Let\u2019s circle back to 2017 and revisit what experts had to say about the guard from Washington.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t really much doubt whom the 76ers were trading up for when they swapped picks with and gave a future first-rounder to the Boston Celtics. Fultz is a particularly great fit for Philadelphia because he can play off the ball more than many point guards, which will allow elite-passing forward Ben Simmons to run the offense and Joel Embiid to have many options in pick-and-rolls. Fultz is the most likely future star in this class, and he was the right choice at No. 1. Grade: A\n\n\u200bGRADE: A It\u2019s too early to jump to sweeping, dynastic conclusions, but the Sixers finally found the deal they wanted and got their guy. Fultz was the top prospect in the draft in the eyes of many (SI included), and should pair effectively with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid going forward. We\u2019ll see which draft assets the Sixers wind up losing in the long run, but it felt like the right time for Philly to strike. The Sixers will be one of the league\u2019s most intriguing teams to follow next season, with Fultz at the heart of an all-time extended rebuild. Whatever happens next, it\u2019s a win for today. \u2013 Jeremy Woo\n\nFultz is a franchise lead guard, future All-Star, and a player any organization can build around. He\u2019s best utilized on the ball with shooting around him, as he\u2019s a tremendous pick and roll player (30.4% of his offense, 93rd percentile) who can score at all three levels and facilitate with creativity. He\u2019s no slouch off the ball either, as he\u2019s a capable, yet improving, spot shooter and excellent playing off of closeouts. Fultz also has the size and length to defend twos, and even some threes in smaller lineups. All in all, he\u2019s a versatile, plug and play lead guard with star potential who is easy to build around or fit into a current roster.\n\nFultz is as elite as they come in terms of guard prospects. Given the complete lack of holes in his offensive game, it\u2019s difficult to see a circumstance where he busts out of the league. Heck, in this evaluator\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s difficult to see a circumstance where he\u2019s not a top-20 offensive player in the NBA, which is an incredibly high bar to clear.\n\nNot only was No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz the top player on our Big Board, but he was the best fit for the Sixers. His ability to play on and off the ball, the deep range on his jumper, and the size to guard multiple positions make him a terrific fit next to Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. The goal of \u201cthe process\u201d was to get the kind of young talent Philadelphia has now \u2014 a big three that can eventually compete for an NBA title. The Sixers have that potential now. Whatever the cost, it was worth it.\n\nCBS Sports questioned Fultz\u2019s impact at the college level, but still gave Philadelphia an A for the pick.\n\nScouting Report: The only thing that gives pause about Fultz is where he chose to go to school, and how that team did. Washington only won nine games. Yes, he was surrounded by a bunch of spare parts. But are you sure you want to spend the top pick in a stacked draft on a guy who only won nine games in his sole college season? Reid Forgrave\u2019s Grade: A The Process is complete. 76ers (potentially) now have most fearsome young trio in league.\n\nFultz was selected over a top 5 that included Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum, Josh Jackson and De\u2019Aaron Fox. But at the time, there was virtually no negative reaction to the Sixers\u2019 choice of Fultz."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Helicopter rescues people, dogs from wildfire", "description": "Newly released video shows the dramatic moment firefighters rescued three people and two dogs as thick smoke and flames fast approached in Southern California.

(Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House released the following statement by President Donald Trump in connection with Saudi Arabia and the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Here is the full statement from the White House:\n\n\u201cAmerica First!\n\nThe world is a very dangerous place!\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\n\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\n\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2013 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\n\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\n\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Stephanie Parker isn't quite sure how her family of six would have managed the last two months without the help of Michael Jordan and the American Red Cross following Hurricane Florence.\n\nSo when Parker met Jordan on Tuesday she couldn't hold back giving the owner of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets a big hug and a thank you.\n\n\"It means he hasn't forgotten,\" Parker told The Associated Press about Jordan's visit to Wilmington, North Carolina. \"It means we are important.\"\n\nJordan returned to his hometown wearing North Carolina Tar Heels blue and met with some hurricane victims, many of whom have benefited from his $2 million donation in September. Jordan gave $1 million each to the Red Cross and the Foundation for the Carolinas Hurricane Florence Response Fund.\n\n\"I can give money all day long, but at some point you want them to understand you're human,\" Jordan told AP.\n\nJordan handed out Thanksgiving dinners at a home improvement store and gave away Jordan Brand shoes at a Boys & Girls Club Tuesday where he once played as a child.\n\nParker has lived the nightmare that's become all too familiar for hurricane victims around the country.\n\nShe, her husband, and their four children ages 3 to 8 heeded the warnings to evacuate the area. They took refuge in a Red Cross shelter, but when they returned, their apartment was flooded with two feet of water and their minivan crushed by a fallen tree. They spent nearly two months in shelters until recently being placed in a hotel while they await permanent housing.\n\n\"It's been stressful,\" she said, taking a long, deep breath. \"At first it was really, really hard to realize that you lost everything. But people like Michael Jordan donating to the Red Cross and donating to people who have gone through what we've gone through is an incredible blessing. We are so very, very thankful.\"\n\nJordan broke into a wide smile when asked about his meeting with Parker.\n\n\"You really want to trust that money goes to the right people,\" Jordan said. \"And when you see it goes to the right people, it makes me feel good that I did the right thing.\"\n\nJordan said he'll continue to monitor the hurricane recovery efforts and would consider partnering with others to continue to help improve living conditions.\n\nAmerican Red Cross executive director James Jarvis, who is based out of Wilmington, said that the organization set aside a $50 million budget to help people affected by Hurricane Florence.\n\nJarvis said at the height of the storm the Red Cross sheltered more than 20,000 people in 172 locations. They provided 1.3 million meals and snacks. They've also distributed money to more than 6,500 families, doling out more than $3.8 million to help families get on the road to recovery.\n\n\"I wanted to be an igniter to the process,\" Jordan said of his initial donation. \"But it's going to take a long time before things get back to normal. Whatever way I can contribute I will.\"\n\nHe also hopes that Charlotte hosting the All-Star game in February will provide an impetus for more financial aid to the region.\n\n\"I am pretty sure that the league will have some support systems that will reach out to this community,\" Jordan said. \"And we are going to do a lot in Charlotte, too. But the overall game is about helping other people, so I can see it reaching all the way down to this area.\"\n\nNatalie English, the president and CEO of the Wilmington Chamber of Commerce, said it's still too early to estimate the financial damage to the area.\n\nBut she said Jordan's donations resonated in the community.\n\n\"I think it means a lot to people here that Michael remembers his home and that he cares about where he was for his formative years and he is giving back to help restore the community,\" English said.\n\nThis is not a one-time deal for Jordan.\n\nFred Lynch coached Jordan when he was 15-year-old freshman playing on the junior high school basketball team at Laney High School in Wilmington. He sustained minor damage to his nearby home, but said several neighbors only a block away suffered total destruction as a result of flooding and wind damage to Hurricane Florence.\n\nLynch said Jordan has visited Wilmington periodically since leaving to play college basketball at North Carolina and embarking on an NBA career that included six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, five league MVP honors and 14 All-Star game appearances.\n\nThe 55-year-old Jordan still has an aunt, cousins and friends here and his nephew who attends college at UNC Wilmington. Jordan was most recently here in April at his high school filming a Gatorade commercial.\n\nLynch said he wasn't surprised when Jordan stepped up to help the people of Wilmington and the surrounding areas \u2014 donating money and his time.\n\n\"From the time I coached him as a ninth grade, he was always looking out for people,\" Lynch said. \"He's always trying to do the right thing and always trying to better himself and his community. That's pretty much what he's been about his entire career.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And a new one will likely take its place\n\nIn 1994, this 10,825-square-foot mansion in Naples was built on land that once welcomed presidents and famous dignitaries. It featured six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, selling earlier this year for $48.8 million. Now, what was the priciest home in southwest Florida is gone, part of a complete demolition estimated to cost $150,000. So what's expected to take its place? \"It\u2019s an exclusive property, and the home that\u2019s going there matches up with it,\" said Mike Austin, owner of the company in charge of tearing it down.\n\nEating your kid's placenta: So hot right now\n\nParents of yesteryear kept their baby's hair and their kid's first lost tooth.

Solis, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump spoke up for a Republican senator Tuesday facing a runoff election and fierce criticism after making a joke about a \"public hanging.\"\n\nTrump said he plans to hold at least two campaign events, possibly even a third, to support Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith in her runoff against Democrat Mike Espy.\n\n\"Cindy Hyde-Smith is a spectacular woman. She's a great senator,\" the president said as he embarked on a trip to Florida for the holidays. \"She came in and she's done a fantastic job in a short period of time.\"\n\nTrump was asked about the controversy surrounding Hyde-Smith. She has been criticized for both her recent comments that she'd be glad to attend a \"public hanging\" for a friend and a video that appeared to show Hyde-Smith supporting voter suppression.\n\n\"She made a statement, which I know that she feels really bad about it, and was just sort of said in jest,\" Trump said. \"She's a tremendous woman and it's a shame that she has to go through this.\"\n\nMore: President Trump to campaign for Cindy Hyde-Smith in Mississippi runoff\n\nMore: President Trump considering another Mississippi trip for Cindy Hyde-Smith\n\nThe president is scheduled to stump for Hyde-Smith in Tupelo and Biloxi on Nov. 26, one day before the runoff will be held.\n\n\"I think she's going to do very well,\" Trump said. \"I've gotten to know her well. She's a person that loves the people of Mississippi. She loves the people of this country. She's gonna be a great senator.\"\n\nTrump has conducted more than 40 such rallies over the course of this election year. Despite his stepped-up pace in October and November, the Republicans lost control of the House after the midterms, though they kept their majority in the Senate.\n\nHyde-Smith has been pushing back against fallout from a comment she made at a campaign stop in Tupelo earlier this month. While praising a longtime friend, she said, \"I would fight a circular saw for him. If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\n\"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row\"- Sen.

Her opponent, Espy, is African-American.\n\nDemocrats have also accused Hyde-Smith of supporting voter suppression, citing a video in which she can be heard saying that \"maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult\" for some people to vote, and \"so I think that's a great idea.\"\n\nIn a statement, Hyde-Smith spokeswoman Melissa Scallan said, \"Obviously Sen. Hyde-Smith was making a joke and clearly the video was selectively edited.\"\n\nThe Hyde-Smith campaign later tweeted: \"It's ok to still have a sense of humor in America isn't it?\"\n\nDerrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, blasted Hyde-Smith for her \u201cpublic hanging\u2019\u2019 comment, calling it consistent with the current toxic political environment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this playbook before of fear-mongering and using racial hatred as the medium to communicate,\u2019\u2019 said Johnson, a Mississippi native.\n\nHe said those comments and others will likely generate energy among African-Americans to vote.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be operating our election cycle based on the lowest common denominator using race or religion to scare people to the polls,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nJamal Watkins, NAACP vice president of civic engagement, said there\u2019s been a demographic shift and an increase in black voter turnout in the South, including in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cA few cycles ago there would never be a (Democrat in the) runoff in Mississippi according to the data and analytics, but that has changed,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that the NAACP will continue working with other national groups on get out the vote efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re now within reach of actually determining who the winner is of these key races.\u201d\n\nContributing: Deborah Berry, David Jackson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/20/president-trump-defends-mississippi-senator-cindy-hyde-smith-after-hanging-comment/2071868002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Georgia Tech takes 4-game winning streak to No. 5 Georgia", "description": "Georgia Tech's confidence soaring following 4-game winning streak _ just in time for rivalry game against No. 5 Georgia", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/20/georgia-tech-takes-4-game-winning-streak-to-no-5-georgia/38575767/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1165d7ca0768ac682261a8bf2f563251a64e0215/c=0-489-4376-2951/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/c54bc9e1022345d9b408948f2805cfe5.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:35:18Z", "content": "FILE - In this Friday, Oct. 5, 2018 file photo, Georgia Tech quarterback TaQuon Marshall (16) runs from the pursuit of Louisville linebacker Dorian Etheridge (17) during the first half of an NCAA college football game in Louisville, Ky.

But the streak that is the hot topic this week is Georgia Tech\u2019s two straight wins in Athens _ a 30-24 overtime win in 2014 and a 28-27 thriller in 2016.(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Following an ugly loss to Clemson on Sept. 22, Georgia Tech was 1-3 with three straight losses and appeared bound for a second straight losing season.\n\n\"The sky was falling after that game,\" coach Paul Johnson recalled on Tuesday.\n\nSomehow, Georgia Tech's season never hit bottom.\n\nSince the 49-21 loss to No. 2 Clemson , the Yellow Jackets (7-4) have enjoyed a dramatic turnaround, winning six of seven. They will take a four-game winning streak into Saturday's game at No. 5 Georgia.\n\nRunning back Clinton Lynch said the winning streak has the Yellow Jackets \"playing with pretty good confidence\" at a good time.\n\n\"You always need that confidence to go up to Athens and get the W,\" Lynch said.\n\nIf Georgia Tech could pull off its third straight win in Athens, a season already revived would become special.\n\n\"I just think guys are always pumped to play up there,\" said running back Qua Searcy, who had the game-winning touchdown run with 30 second remaining in the Yellow Jackets' 28-27 win at Georgia in 2016. \"It's a great atmosphere. There's no better feeling than winning in Athens, which we've experienced twice. I just feel like the guys are always excited to win in Athens.\"\n\nJohnson said his players ignored doomsday predictions and kept their focus following the 1-3 start.\n\n\"There's a lot of noise,\" he said. \"Everybody has got an answer. Everybody knows what's wrong. Everybody knows that you're not going to win any more games.\"\n\nJohnson said there was panic outside the program because the loss to Clemson revealed the Yellow Jackets could not compete with the Atlantic Coast Conference's top team .\n\nHe said critics concluded \"we'd fallen below Clemson.\"\n\n\"Hello? Everybody they play has,\" Johnson said. \"I noticed this week, for what it's worth, South Carolina is a 26-point underdog going to Clemson. ... They're probably one of the two best teams in the country.\"\n\nGeorgia Tech finished 5-3 in the ACC, behind only Pittsburgh in the Coastal Division. After the Clemson game, Georgia Tech's only other loss was against Duke.\n\n\"I think toward the last half of the year these kids have done a really good job of just trying to focus on what they can control,\" Johnson said.\n\nGeorgia Tech's recovery has come with senior quarterback TaQuon Marshall's improved health. An undisclosed injury forced Marshall to miss a 49-28 win at Virginia Tech on Oct. 25. Marshall reclaimed the starting job from Tobias Oliver and ran for 107 yards in last week's 30-27 overtime win over Virginia .\n\nAs always, ball security is crucial in Johnson's spread-option offense. Marshall has been accurate with his option pitches and has made good decisions on when to keep the ball.\n\n\"He's taken care of the ball,\" Johnson said, rapping his knuckles on the table in front of him for good luck.\n\nMarshall is the only quarterback in Georgia Tech history to run for at least 100 yards in 10 career games. He leads the Yellow Jackets with 857 yards rushing and is second with 11 touchdown runs.\n\nGeorgia shut down Marshall and the option attack last season, holding the Yellow Jackets to 188 yards rushing in a 38-7 win. Marshall noted this year's Bulldogs defense lost some of its top players, including first-round draft pick Roquan Smith, to the NFL.\n\n\"I don't think they're as good as they were last year defensively,\" Marshall said Monday. \"I think they had a lot of guys that went to the next level that contributed a lot last year. I mean, I still think they have a pretty good defense but I don't think they're as stacked on defense as they were last year.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Adam \"Pacman\" Jones' short stint in Denver is over.\n\nThe Broncos waived the 14-year veteran Tuesday after he'd appeared in seven games, posting nine tackles and one interception and three pass breakups.\n\nJones posted a thank you note on Instagram, saying, \"Well Denver, it was good. Thanks for the opportunity!!! On to the next !!!\"\n\nAt 35, Jones might have a hard time finding another team in need of a cornerback/kick returner.\n\nHe signed with Denver in August. Coach Vance Joseph, who once served as an assistant in Cincinnati, vouched for Jones, who spent eight seasons with the Bengals.\n\nJones was the Broncos' leading punt returner with 10, albeit for a 2.5-yard average, and he returned four kickoffs for a 21.3-yard average.\n\nCutting Jones would seem to indicate that the Broncos expect Bradley Roby, who's in concussion protocol, to play Sunday when the Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2-1) visit Denver (4-6).\n\nThe other cornerbacks are starter Chris Harris Jr., Tramaine Brock and rookie Isaac Yiadom.\n\nThe Broncos on Tuesday also signed free agent Cyrus Kouandjio (KWAN-jo), a tackle who played three games in Denver last season, including the finale at right tackle, and was cut this summer.\n\nA fifth-year pro with 28 games of NFL experience (he was with the Bills from 2014-16), Kouandjio replaces guard Max Garcia, who tore his left ACL last week at practice.\n\nThe Broncos placed Garcia on injured reserve Tuesday. He's the third starting O-lineman lost for the season to injury, joining guard Ronald Leary (Achilles) and center Matt Paradis (broken right leg).\n\nWith the rash of injuries, the Broncos had to start two tackles (Billy Turner and Elijah Wilkinson) at guard and guard Connor McGovern at center.\n\nThe makeshift O-line wasn't whistled for any penalties and didn't allow any sacks in Denver's 23-22 win in Los Angeles that snapped the Chargers' six-game winning streak.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was impossible not to notice. There were flags. So many flags that it was distracting. Flags on plays that deserved flags. Flags on play that didn\u2019t deserve flags. Let there be all the flags, all the time. The funny thing is, the NFL actually used an All-Star officiating crew for the game. This game was so important to the NFL that it went against normal regular season protocol to make sure it was officiated well. Well, it was officiated. We can say that.\n\nThere was a ton of offense. There were also a ton of flags. At the center of these flag controversies were two personal fouls. One was called on the Chiefs in the beginning of the game when a defensive back broke up a pass intended for Robert Woods at the goal line. The player lowered his shoulder and may have grazed Woods with his helmet. It was helmet to helmet. It wasn\u2019t an overly violent hit. Woods stayed in the game and scored on a crossing pattern on the same drive. The penalty was a joke. It shouldn\u2019t have been called.\n\nThere was a worse penalty, however. Late in the game a Rams defensive back was flagged for lowering his head to make a hit. What really happened was the Chiefs receiver braced for impact and lowered his head. That led to the Rams defender\u2019s helmet to helmet contact. The Chiefs player actually initiated it. The Rams were flagged 15-yards at a crucial point in the game. The call was a bad call. The Rams player couldn\u2019t have done anything to avoid the contact.\n\nThere were some ticky-tack holding and pass interference calls as well. Simply put, there were too many flags. They were noticeable. They led to choppiness at different points in the game and that\u2019s what the NFL should be trying to avoid in such a fluid offensive shootout. It\u2019s like the league wanted more scoring \u2014 they did \u2014 and decided pick plays were fine, but anything close to contact in the defensive backfield would be called.\n\nThe NFL tried to do something and that\u2019s why the league opened itself up to being criticized. If they didn\u2019t do anything, no one would have specifically been looking at the officiating crew. Once everyone knew they were putting an All-Star crew in place, it made everyone notice. It\u2019s a question of whether the decision was worth the risk. Do nothing and have a typical crew and people may have complained, but they also may have a not noticed. Putting an All-Star crew in place gave the league a chance to be lauded for their great decision, but it also made people pay close attention and allowed for intense criticism if it didn\u2019t work out. It lowered the floor. We all noticed. It was kind of obvious."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Native people finally heard in Plymouth's 400th", "description": "The seaside town where the Pilgrims came ashore in 1620 is making sure Native Americans aren't an afterthought in its 400th anniversary commemoration.

The illnesses started in October and have hospitalized at least 13 people, including one with a kind of kidney failure, the CDC said. No deaths have been reported, and no recalls have been issued.\n\nThe food safety alert comes just two days before Thanksgiving.\n\nU.S. consumers should avoid all types of romaine lettuce and also salad mixes if they are unsure whether it includes romaine, according to the CDC. The agency also told Americans to clean refrigerators where romaine had been stored.\n\n\"Consumers who have any type of romaine lettuce in their home should not eat it and should throw it away, even if some of it was eaten and no one has gotten sick,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\nNo common source of the contaminated lettuce has been identified, the CDC said, but federal health officials have begun investigating.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the strain of E. coli had \"same DNA fingerprint\" as an outbreak tied to leafy greens in the United States and romaine in Canada late last year. The outbreak killed one person and infected 25 in 15 states.\n\nHowever, the outbreak is not related to an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from earlier this year \u2013 which killed five people and sickened 210 in 36 states \u2013 the CDC said.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t the first romaine outbreak we have seen in the recent past, and we will continue to take steps to identify the root causes of these events and take action to prevent future outbreaks,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.\n\nAdditionally, 18 people in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec have also been sickened by the same E. coli strain.\n\nTen cases have been reported in California, the state with the highest number of sick people. Seven were identified in Michigan. Other states with reported cases are Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\n\"Ill people reported eating different types of romaine lettuce in several restaurants and at home,\" health officials said. Most people got sick an average of three to four days after eating the contaminated lettuce, the agency added.\n\nSymptoms include \"severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting,\" among others, but most people who have fallen ill get better within a week, according to the CDC.\n\nUp to 10 percent of patients can develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, though, the CDC said. The \"potentially life-threatening complication\" can lead to kidney failure.\n\nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nMore: About 100,000 pounds of ground beef for possible E. coli contamination\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/20/romaine-lettuce-cdc-warns-e-coli-outbreak-ahead-thanksgiving/2070654002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Syracuse signs 4 players for next season", "description": "Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim has announced four players have signed national letters of intent to play for the Orange next season", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/20/syracuse-signs-4-players-for-next-season/38575707/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:24:11Z", "content": "SYRACUSE, N.Y.

So For The Win conducted its annual investigation to see what some drivers really think of each other and how they answered these eight personality questions.\n\nAnswers have been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.\n\n1. Which driver is most likely to start a fight?\n\nJoey Logano: Apparently me lately. I don\u2019t know, you take a guess. The normals.\n\nKevin Harvick: I don\u2019t know, who was the last fight? I think Kyle (Busch) punched Joey, so I guess the most recent would be the most likely.\n\nDenny Hamlin: Harvick, because he has before.\n\nAlex Bowman: Who was the last guy in a fight? Kyle Busch? Probably Kyle Busch.\n\nAric Almirola: A physical or verbal fight? Verbal fight, I would say my teammate Kevin Harvick\u2019s pretty good at that. Actually, I would say Kyle Busch is pretty high on the list there. He\u2019s very opinionated and very grumpy when he doesn\u2019t win.\n\nAnd then an actual physical fight? I don\u2019t know who would instigate one, but I know Ryan Newman would not be one you\u2019d want to start a fight.\n\nKyle Larson: Probably Joey Logano. I feel like he makes a lot of people mad. Or Kyle Busch.\n\nKurt Busch: Kevin Harvick is most likely to start a fight. That\u2019s just his mentality\n\nBrad Keselowski: Have there been any fights this year? I guess none of us then?\n\nJimmie Johnson: There\u2019s really none of us that want to be in a fist fight. We start lots of car fights after an incident. We\u2019ll create more work for our crew guys, and I\u2019m putting myself in that. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m some tough guy by any stretch, but I just don\u2019t see any real fights.

First of all, you don\u2019t know what NASCAR\u2019s gonna do to you if you do fight, but they\u2019re gonna make sure they benefit for years to come off you having a temper tantrum and fighting. They\u2019re gonna have you in commercials for the rest of your career.\n\n2. Who\u2019s most likely to get revenge on another driver on the track?\n\nBowman: Probably Kyle Busch. Or Joey Logano.\n\nLarson: I feel like Logano\u2019s the type that if you make him mad, he\u2019s just gonna wreck you.\n\nHamlin: Matt Kenseth\n\nKurt Busch: Martin Truex Jr. is a sneaky one for revenge.\n\nKeselowski: Oooh, I would say probably Matt Kenseth. Just look at the history.\n\nJohnson: I think we\u2019re all capable, I would say. I think Kyle Busch comes to mind. Not necessarily revenge in a bad way, but I think (Larson) used him up in Chicago in Turns 1 and 2, and Kyle got back to him in 3 and 4. So I guess Kyle.\n\nBowyer: All of us.\n\n3. Who\u2019s the best driver to be around if you\u2019re having a bad day?\n\nKeselowski: Probably Clint Bowyer because he\u2019s very light-hearted. He can make anything funny.\n\nJohnson: Bowyer. Even if he\u2019s having a bad day, he still has a humorous way to send his message. He\u2019s just a lot of fun.\n\nBowyer: Probably Kevin (Harvick), as long as he\u2019s having a good day, and that answer has to be that way. If I\u2019m having a bad day, Kevin is definitely the guy that helps because he\u2019ll make fun of me or something and put me in a good mood. But if he\u2019s having a bad day, he\u2019s worse than I am, so that\u2019s not a good combination.\n\nLogano: Jeez, I don\u2019t really look for drivers to pick me up, not really looking to be around any of them. They\u2019ve all got their ulterior motives.\n\nBowman: For me, Jimmie Johnson. He\u2019s super helpful. He\u2019s obviously won a lot, and he\u2019s also gone through a lot of different experiences and circumstances, and typically whatever you\u2019re going through, you can lean on him and learn something.\n\nKurt Busch: It seems like Kyle Larson wants to be your friend out on the track, so I\u2019d like to be around him if I\u2019m having a bad day.\n\nLarson: I spend a lot of time around Ricky Stenhouse Jr., so I would say him. But the funniest guy in the garage is definitely Clint Bowyer so maybe him also.\n\nBlaney: Just your friends, Chase Elliott or Bubba Wallace. We go way back, so if you\u2019re having a bad day just nice to relax and hang out with them.\n\n4. Most likely to have a burner Twitter account?\n\nKurt Busch: I would go with Blaney. I would just assume. He\u2019s in on the youth movement.\n\nKeselowski: Ryan Blaney. I just think Ryan Blaney\u2019s probably got a Twitter burner account, but that\u2019s just a suspicion.\n\nBlaney: Keselowski for some reason comes to mind. I don\u2019t know why.\n\nLarson: Ryan Newman doesn\u2019t ever tweet anything personally \u2014 his PR people do \u2014 but he\u2019s always on Twitter looking at people\u2019s stuff.\n\nHamlin: Brad Keselowski.\n\nBowman: I\u2019m sure Dale Jr. could have a burner account, and it\u2019d be some parody or something. It\u2019d be pretty funny.\n\nJohnson: Carl Edwards and he\u2019s not even in the sport.\n\nAlmirola: I assume it would be one of the young kids. Name any kid you want \u2014 Bubba Wallace.\n\nBowyer: What the (expletive) is that? I think I have a Facebook account, but I have no idea how to get on it. Is that a burner?\n\n5. Most annoying or frustrating driver on the track this year and why?\n\nKurt Busch: Oh that\u2019s easy. That\u2019s my little brother. He\u2019s always annoying.\n\nLarson: Any lapped car. Lappers in general are annoying.\n\nHamlin: I would say your teammates because you\u2019ve gotta race them a little cleaner than the other guys.\n\nBowyer: For me, it\u2019s probably been Chase Elliott, I don\u2019t even know why. He\u2019s just a pain in my ass. But a lot of times when you\u2019re racing around somebody that much, I think our teams, at the end of the day, have competed a lot on the track together, and when you do that, you\u2019re gonna have things happen.\n\nBowman: It\u2019s different every week. Ryan Newman\u2019s still the hardest guy to pass, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to change.\n\nJohnson: I can\u2019t look any further than myself. I\u2019ve been so frustrated in not being able to race where I want to and do the things that I want to in the car, I haven\u2019t really paid attention to anyone else.\n\n6. Who\u2019s most likely to drive a beat-up car in real life?\n\nJohnson: I don\u2019t know why Bowyer comes to mind. His give-a-(expletive) meter is broken.\n\nKurt Busch: I\u2019ve seen some of the cool Volkswagens that Daniel Su\u00e1rez has, so I\u2019m gonna go with him. I\u2019ve seen him in his Volkswagen bus here at the track.\n\nLogano: I know Daniel Su\u00e1rez does. I do as well, but I know Su\u00e1rez has got an old bus that\u2019s not getting anywhere in a hurry.\n\nLarson: Ryan Blaney because he\u2019s weird, and I think he does drive a beat up Bronco.\n\nHamlin: Ryan Newman. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s probably got an old pickup truck at home that he drives.\n\nBowman: I will make fun of William Byron because he bought a Corvette that\u2019s automatic, and that\u2019s just terrible. You\u2019re supposed to buy a manual, and he bought an automatic one. So it\u2019s not beat up, but it is lame. \u2026 That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Maybe because he\u2019s young and from the video game era, he just wants to push a button and go. It\u2019s definitely weird.\n\nBlaney: Logano likes old cars. He has a bunch of old ones. They\u2019re not really beat up, but they\u2019re old.\n\nAlmirola: David Ragan because he\u2019s one of the most frugal (people) I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see what this little guy is going to do with his life! #TeamJL pic.twitter.com/clw4VsereQ \u2014 Joey Logano (@joeylogano) January 16, 2018\n\n7. Which driver is had the most surprising performance this year?\n\nLogano: I guess surprising not in a good way, Jimmie\u2019s season has been a surprise (after he finished without a win). I like Jimmie. I don\u2019t want this to come across in a bad way, but I think he surprised everybody.\n\nBowyer: Probably Jimmie Johnson.\n\nKurt Busch: I think the most surprising performance is actually the lack of performance from Chevrolet. I didn\u2019t think the Camaro would be that far off.\n\nHarvick: I\u2019ve been really surprised that Denny Hamlin has not won a race, when you look at the (Joe) Gibbs organization and how successful he\u2019s been over the years.\n\nBlaney: Harvick and Kyle Busch. It\u2019s not surprising that they won; it\u2019s surprising how many times they\u2019ve won and how dominant they\u2019ve been.\n\nLarson: If I can pick three guys, I think the dominance that Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. have put on throughout the year has been pretty amazing. It\u2019s very rare to see three guys be that much better than the competition, but they spent a lot of the year a lot better than the rest of us.\n\nHamlin: Erik Jones.\n\nKeselowski: Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t say anybody\u2019s surprised me this year. I think it\u2019s the lack of surprises that\u2019s more stood out to me.\n\nAlmirola: I would have to say our team has been one of the team\u2019s that\u2019s caught most people by surprise. I think that the industry thought we would be average or slightly above, and I feel like our team has outperformed most everyone\u2019s expectations.\n\n8. Largest impact on the sport this season?\n\nLogano: I like to think I have some kind of impact. Might be me, probably Kevin (Harvick) if not.\n\nAlmirola: Chase Elliott, probably, now that Dale Jr.\u2019s gone. I think think it\u2019s pretty well assumed that Chase Elliott is becoming more of the face of the sport and becoming one of the most popular drivers. So for him having success and winning a few races is a big deal for this sport.\n\nJohnson: I feel like Chase Elliott is. His performance on the track and winning with a legacy and his likeability, I think he\u2019s the one.\n\nBlaney: Either Bubba (Wallace) or Chase (Elliott). Chase winning a couple times is pretty big for the sport, and then Bubba being there full-time is really big for it too.\n\nLarson: Kyle Busch brings a lot of attention to the sport with his personality. He\u2019s loved and hated by a lot of fans, so I feel like he does a good job of bringing attention to our sport.\n\nHamlin: Kyle Busch. Winning a lot and he\u2019s had some really good finishes, wild finishes with Harvick and Larson.\n\nKurt Busch: I would still go with Dale Jr. in the broadcast booth. He\u2019s been nailing it.\n\nBowman: I think Dale has obviously had a big impact on the sport throughout his career and stepping away from driving full time and going to the tv booth, he\u2019s continuing to have a very large impact on the sport. But Chase Elliott is obviously very popular, his dad was very popular, so I think he\u2019s having a big impact.\n\nKeselowski: I don\u2019t see one person sticking out. I would say the three drivers that have won the most races between Kevin, Kyle and Martin, it\u2019s pretty equal between those three.\n\nBowyer: (Expletive), I don\u2019t know. It\u2019d be a smartass answer, and we\u2019d probably lose our jobs. I don\u2019t know, we all make an impact.

The most recent case was Oct. 31.\n\nThe symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections include severe stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea, and most people recover in five to seven days, the FDA said. Most vulnerable are children younger than 5, people over 65 and people with weakened immune systems. Five percent to 10 percent develop a potentially life-threatening type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\nThe FDA is working with Canadian officials to investigate because of cases reported north of the border, too.\n\nThe strain of E. coli O157:H7 has no genetic link to the one in the spring, but it is similar to the strain found in the fall of 2017. Those incidents of E. coli were tied to leafy greens in the U.S. and romaine lettuce in Canada. Twenty-five cases in 15 states were reported, including one death and two incidents of hemolytic uremic syndrome, the FDA said.\n\nThe spring outbreak, which was traced to the Yuma, Arizona, growing region, resulted in 210 sick people and 96 hospitalizations. Five people died. The last illness onset in that outbreak was Aug. 2.\n\nOn Nov. 1, the FDA released a report about factors that might have led to the outbreak, concluding that \"the water from the irrigation canal where the outbreak strain was found most likely led to contamination of the romaine lettuce consumed during this outbreak.\"\n\nThe water may have been used to irrigate the crops or to dilute chemical sprays put on them. The FDA said it didn't know how the canal got tainted.\n\n\"A large animal feeding operation is nearby but no obvious route for contamination from this facility to the irrigation canal was identified,\" the report said. \"Other explanations are possible although the ... team found no evidence to support them.\"\n\nCLOSE Check your pantry.

The $904,000 came from the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, where he worked as executive director from October 2014 to September 2017.\n\nThe disclosure form covered his income of $502,000 in 2017 and $402,000 in 2016, according to the group's tax forms. He also earned $252,000 from the group in 2015, according to the tax form.\n\nWhitaker also earned $103,400 from his self-named law and consulting firm, according to the disclosure form. He listed $15,000 in consulting fees from CNN, $1,750 in consulting fees from American Trust Bank, where he served as an advisor; and $1,875 in legal fees from World Patent Marketing.\n\nTrump named Whitaker acting attorney general after firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Nov. 7 \u2013 a day after the midterm election. Whitaker revised the filing five times after being named to the post.\n\nAustin Evers, executive director for the advocacy group American Oversight, which called for the release of the document, said Congress should investigate the changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s striking that Matt Whitaker revised his disclosure form five times in the weeks after he was appointed as acting Attorney General,\" Evers said in a statement. \"Congress should demand every version of this form to find out exactly what financial details Whitaker added or removed from his disclosures before releasing them to the public.\u201d\n\nWhitaker previously served as chief of staff at Justice, and watchdog groups said his annual financial disclosure should have been made public in February.\n\nHe had been a private lawyer in Iowa before coming to Washington. Among the clients he represented from September 2016 to August 2017 was Mujo Becirovic, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute at least 50 kilograms of marijuana and conspiracy to distribute at least 500 grams of a mixture containing cocaine. Becirovic, 26, sentenced to 73 months in prison. He was one of 20 defendants in the Des Moines-area case.\n\nBefore becoming chief of staff, Whitaker worked as director of the nonprofit Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, whose web site said it provides accountability, ethics and transparency \u201cby hanging a lantern over public officials who put their own interests over the interests of the public good.\u201d\n\nWhitaker was paid $502,000 in 2017 for work from Jan. 1 to Sept. 14, which is equivalent to an annual salary of $715,000, according to the group\u2019s tax form. The annual figure represented a 77 percent increase from the $402,000 he was paid in 2016, according to the group\u2019s tax form.\n\nThe group received a $1 million contribution in 2017 from a single donor whose identity is not publicly disclosed on its tax return, and who the organization declined to identify in response to questions from USA Today.\n\nThe organization\u2019s March 2014 application for tax-exempt status told the Internal Revenue Service the purpose was \u201cto conduct research and provide informational studies on free market concepts in relation to environmental regulations and policy.\u201d The original name, Free Market America Educational Foundation, changed in October 2014 to Working for Rights to Express & Communication before its current name.\n\nNotre Dame Law School Professor Lloyd Mayer, who specializes in nonprofit law, said the organization\u2019s changes to its name and purpose just months after applying for tax-exempt status in 2014 are \u201ca yellow flag, but not an obvious red flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for groups to change their name, change their leadership, change even their purposes over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is unusual is the speed at which it happened.\u201d\n\nAmerican Oversight had sent a letter to the Office of Government Ethics late last week asking why the agency had not yet made Whitaker's form public.\n\n\"The secrecy is particularly unusual and disturbing,\" said Melanie Sloan, a senior adviser for the group. \"It suggests that there might be a problem.\"\n\nEthics advocates such as Walter Shaub, former head of Office of Government Ethics, had long urged release of the financial disclosure report.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 days since we requested Whitaker\u2019s financial disclosure report.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Olivier Giroud scored from the penalty spot for France as the world champion beat Uruguay 1-0 in a friendly match on Tuesday to conclude an exceptional year with a rather mundane display.\n\nThe French bounced back from a 2-0 loss at the Netherlands that cost them a spot in the UEFA Nations League finals but failed to impress in front of their home crowd ahead of a four-month pause before the next international break in March.\n\nThe win was also marred by teenage forward Kylian Mbappe having to leave the game with a shoulder injury.\n\nCoach Didier Deschamps, who led France to a second World Cup title this summer in Russia, had made changes at the back following the loss in Rotterdam, with Adil Rami starting at the heart of the defense alongside the returning Mamadou Sakho, who played his first international in more than two years.\n\nFerland Mendy won his first cap at left-back and midfielder Tanguy Ndombele started in place of Steven Nzonzi, who disappointed against the Dutch and was sent to the bench.\n\nThe French played aggressively in midfield from the start and dominated throughout against an uninspired Uruguay team that defended deep and left a lot of space for the hosts to exploit. Uruguay strikers Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez were shut down by the French defenders but the world champions rarely threatened.\n\n\"We needed this, we finished the year on a good note after what we went through this summer,\" Giroud said. \"We are a bit disappointed we did not qualify for the final four, but we wanted to show a good reaction and we did it.\"\n\nMbappe was at the heart of most of France's chances before his injury. He missed a good chance 15 minutes in when he collected a pass from Antoine Griezmann and broke into the box but completely fluffed his shot.\n\nHe hurt his shoulder on the half-hour mark after he failed to convert another one-one-one with Uruguay keeper Martin Campana, who dived at his feet to block the ball. Mbappe fell over after making contact with Campana and landed awkwardly on his right shoulder, forcing Deschamps to substitute him for Florian Thauvin.\n\nFrance continued to push after the interval and was awarded a penalty in the 52nd minute after Martin Caceres was penalized for a handball in the box. Giroud converted his 33rd international goal with a low shot to the right of Campana.\n\nUruguay substitute Jonathan Rodriguez had a good chance to level with seven minutes left when Cavani picked him out unmarked in the box but he mishit his volley.\n\n\"It was not perfect, but we played far better than in our previous match,\" Deschamps said. \"It was important to finish on a positive note.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It finished with 14 points from six matches, five points in front of second-place Azerbaijan.\n\nPlaying in the playoffs could give Kosovo a shortcut to Euro 2020 as it is unlikely to qualify directly from its group. It ended last in its European qualifying group for the 2018 World Cup with only one point from 10 matches.\n\nMaking it to Euro 2020 would be a huge sporting success for the country, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. The competition will be played in cities across Europe, including in some countries which still don't recognize Kosovo's independence.\n\nIn the top-tier League A, Final Four host Portugal ended the group stage with a 1-1 home draw against relegated Poland, while Sweden gained promotion from League B by defeating visiting Russia 2-0. Scotland moved up from League C by coming from behind to defeat Israel at home, as did Serbia after a 4-1 win over relegated Lithuania.\n\nAll group winners in the four leagues are guaranteed a place in the playoffs for Euro 2020.\n\nEngland, Switzerland and the Netherlands will join Portugal in the Final Four in June.\n\nIn friendlies on Tuesday, France defeated Uruguay 1-0 in Paris while Italy beat the United States by the same score in Belgium.\n\nUNBEATEN PORTUGAL\n\nAndre Silva gave Portugal the lead in the first half but Arkadiusz Milik equalized for Poland by converting a 66th-minute penalty.\n\nThe European champions played a man down after conceding the equalizer as Danilo was sent off for the foul that prompted the penalty.\n\nPortugal, which played all of its matches without Cristiano Ronaldo, had already secured its Final Four berth with a draw at Italy last week.\n\n\"We are candidates to win the tournament for sure, but maybe not favorites,\" Portugal goalkeeper Beto said. \"We'll have the luxury of having our fans with us.\"\n\nSWEDEN PROMOTED\n\nRussia missed a chance to gain promotion to League A despite entering the match against Sweden with a three-point lead in its group.\n\nThe hosts earned the comfortable win with a goal by Victor Lindelof in the first half and another by Marcus Berg in the second.\n\n\"It's great that we were able to showcase how we can play here at home,\" Sweden coach Janne Andersson said. \"I am immensely pleased with what we have achieved in this competition.\"\n\nSCOTLAND RALLIES\n\nScotland needed a win at home and got it despite conceding early in the match against Israel in Glasgow, rallying with three unanswered goals by forward James Forrest before the visitors pulled closer again.\n\n\"A great night,\" Forrest said. \"Going one goal behind after 10 minutes really took a lot out of the boys and we showed a lot of character.\"\n\nBEST AND WORST\n\nThe draw against Poland kept Portugal from finishing the group stage with the best campaign in League A. It finished with eight points in Group 3, one point fewer than Switzerland and Belgium in Group 2, which was won by the Swiss thanks to their come-from-behind victory over the Belgians on Sunday.\n\nNo other nation earned more than seven points in the four groups.\n\nIceland was the worst team in the top-tiered league after losing four matches in the group that also had Switzerland and Belgium, while Poland and Germany finished with two points each in their groups. Iceland, Poland, Germany and Croatia were demoted to League B. Ukraine, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Denmark will join Sweden in League A.\n\nThe final positions in the overall Nations League ranking determines the teams' seeding in the qualifying draw for Euro 2020.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The air was heavy, heaving with hatred.\n\nAnd when LeBron James skipped onto the Quicken Loans Arena floor on Dec. 2, 2010, with his Miami teammates, scorned Cleveland fans aimed their fury at one of their own, the kid from Akron who was shaken by the experience.\n\nJames was profanely taunted, booed and mocked. It was vile. It was personal.\n\nEight years later, he'll feel loved.\n\nJames returns to Cleveland on Wednesday night for the first time since leaving as a free agent last summer and signing with the Los Angeles Lakers. He's coming back to a city still grappling with losing him again and wondering what might have been had the world's best all-around player stayed.\n\nBut unlike his previous comeback, the 33-year-old is coming home to be saluted for what he did during 11 years with the Cavaliers.\n\nHe revived a franchise, lifted an entire region and brought a championship.\n\n\"It's going to be fun,\" said Cavs forward Kyle Korver, who spent two seasons with James. \"LeBron had an incredible run in Cleveland. He touched Cleveland. He touched Akron. Us as individuals, we were all fortunate to get some time with him. I think hopefully he feels that. I think it's going to be positive overall, and it should be.\"\n\nEarly in the game, the Cavs will show a video tribute of the franchise's career leader in virtually every statistical category.\n\nThe images will capture his stirring run in Cleveland \u2014 the buzzer-beating shots, the iconic chase-down block on Golden State's Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, James' teary reaction to winning an NBA title and the parade celebrating the city's first sports championship in 52 years.\n\nThere will also be reminders of his immense impact off the court, including the opening of his I Promise School in Akron, an elementary school for at-risk kids.\n\nBut he's keeping his perspective on this Thanksgiving week homecoming.\n\n\"I don't try to put too much into it,\" he said Sunday night in Miami after scoring 51 in a win over the Heat. \"I will see some familiar faces. I'll think about some of the good. I'll think about some of the bad. I'll think about some of the great times that I had with the franchise, obviously. And then once the tip-ball gets going, it'll be time to go to work.\n\n\"It'll be good to see some of my family that's going to come to the game, see some of my friends as well, and get the thing going.\"\n\nOn that cold December night in 2010, James wasn't sure what to expect months after his \"taking my talents to South Beach\" announcement had incensed Cleveland fans, driving some to burn his jersey.\n\nMore frightening was the reception James received in his first game back.\n\nSecurity was beefed up to unprecedented levels, but nothing could shield James from the vicious words. There were chants of \"Ak-ron hates you\" and \"Scott-ie Pipp-en\" and fans held up signs calling him a traitor, liar, sellout and worse while a national TV audience watched an ugly divorce played out in real time.\n\nCavaliers owner Dan Gilbert had fueled the disdain in a letter written to Cleveland fans on the night James announced he was joining Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami.\n\nBut while the negativity crashed down upon him, James, as is usually the case, soared. He performed his pregame chalk-toss ritual and then dropped 38 points on the Cavs in Miami's 118-90 rout that galvanized the Heat and teased two future titles.\n\nJames passed on a chance to apologize for his leaving afterward, and there seemed to be no chance for reconciliation with Cleveland or its fans.\n\nThat, of course, changed four years later when he forgave Gilbert, came home and carried the Cavs to the title he had promised to deliver.\n\nIn 2010, he came back a villain. Now, he's a champion \u2014 Cleveland's own.\n\nJames said he isn't sure what kind of reaction he'll receive, but he's confident it won't be anything like before.\n\nHe's changed. The city is different, thanks in part to him. His second stint with the Cavs may have ended earlier than anyone in Cleveland wanted, but anger has been replaced by appreciation.\n\n\"I think whatever happens, happens,\" he said. \"But I will be in uniform, I will be there and I will be trying to get a victory. That's what's most important.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Tim Reynolds in Miami and Noah Trister in Detroit contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But it has been the Tigers who\u2019ve had the upper hand _ and in a dominant way _ over the past four seasons.(AP Photo/Sean Rayford, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUBURN, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Things haven't gone the way Auburn hoped this season.\n\nAfter going from the top 10 to unranked, the Tigers have a chance to appease restless fans: Play the spoiler and upset their biggest rival, No. 1 Alabama.\n\n\"Win this game and a lot of people kind of forget all the negative stuff that happened this year,\" Auburn wide receiver Ryan Davis said Tuesday.\n\nDitto for South Carolina against No. 2 Clemson. Not to mention Georgia Tech versus No. 5 Georgia .\n\nThe Crimson Tide, Bulldogs and the Tigers in Clemson are all trying to keep their College Football Playoff hopes intact, while their in-state rivals would love to change those holiday plans.\n\n\"That's something you can keep in the back of your mind, just knowing you can spoil a lot of things they have going on,\" Georgia Tech senior quarterback TaQuon Marshall said.\n\nAll three playoff contenders are playing at home and are heavy favorites.\n\nOddsmakers give Georgia Tech the best shot, installing the Yellow Jackets as 17-point underdogs. Auburn (24-1/2 points) and South Carolina (26-1/2) are even bigger longshots.\n\nA look at these three rivalry games and what they could mean to the underdogs:\n\nGEORGIA TECH (7-4) at GEORGIA\n\nThe Yellow Jackets can spoil Georgia's hopes to play in its second straight CFP. Georgia (10-1, No. 5 CFP) also needs to beat Alabama in next week's Southeastern Conference championship game in Atlanta to move into the four-team playoff.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets have won four straight, including last week's 30-27 overtime victory over Virginia. But the streak that is the hot topic this week is Georgia Tech's two straight wins in Athens \u2014 a 30-24 overtime win in 2014 and a 28-27 thriller in 2016.\n\nThe Bulldogs were dominant in last year's 38-7 win at Georgia Tech, but the Yellow Jackets are hoping to add to their recent success in Athens, especially when they can spoil Georgia's national championship dream.\n\n\"Yeah, that would be a huge deal,\" said left guard Parker Braun. \"You never want to tear another team down, but if we beat them it's better for us, you know what I'm saying. I think we have an opportunity to do that.\"\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA (6-4) at CLEMSON\n\nJust a few years ago, the Gamecocks had the unquestioned upper-hand on the rivalry and in recruiting in the Palmetto State.\n\nSouth Carolina won five straight games over Clemson (11-0, No. 2 CFP) from 2009-13 featuring such standouts and NFL draft picks as defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, cornerback Stephon Gilmore and wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. But it has been the Tigers who've had the upper hand \u2014 and in a dominant way \u2014 over the past four seasons.\n\nThe Tigers have won three Atlantic Coast Conference titles, played in three College Football Playoffs and won the national championship in 2016 while the Gamecocks program fell apart. South Carolina has gradually built things back under third-year coach Will Muschamp, although their first trip to Clemson in 2016 was a 56-7 drubbing that stuck with players ever since.\n\nLinebacker T.J. Brunson, the Gamecocks leading tackler, thinks Muschamp has started infusing more talent into the program.\n\nBrunson said South Carolina players understand the opportunity they have to end the losing streak, derail Clemson's perfect season and spoil what looks like another national title run for the Tigers.\n\n\"For me, it's always been a regular game every week and you try not to get overly emotional about it,\" Brunson said. \"But this is a big game for us ... we can shake up the world.\"\n\nAUBURN (7-4) at ALABAMA\n\nThe Tigers know all too well that even an Iron Bowl upset might not keep the Tide (11-0, No. 1 CFP) from a national title shot. The Tigers won 26-14 last season to earn a spot in the SEC championship game but Alabama still went on to not only make the playoffs but win another national title.\n\nThis Auburn team is a bigger underdog after a season in which the Tigers fell from a No. 8 ranking to out of the Top 25.\n\nQuarterback Jarrett Stidham insists that unpredictable things can happen in rivalry games.\n\n\"I think every year, regardless of what the circumstances are for either team, anything can happen in this game,\" Stidham said. \"Rivalry games, for whatever reason, are just like that. Ohio State-Michigan is kind of another one where anything can happen.\n\n\"Everybody here, we're just very excited for the opportunity. I mean, we get to play the No. 1 team in the country, on the road, everybody against you. It's going to be a lot of fun.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Charles Odum in Atlanta and Pete Iacobelli in Columbia, South Carolina contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

NBA free agents Eric Moreland, Jarnell Stokes and Tyler Zeller were also chosen for the roster.\n\nThe U.S. is 7-1 so far in qualifying and has road games coming at Argentina (7-1) on Nov. 29 and Uruguay (5-3) on Dec. 2.\n\nJeff Van Gundy is coaching the Americans in qualifying. If the U.S. qualifies for China, the national team coached by Gregg Popovich and loaded with NBA all-stars would play in that event.\n\nThere are scenarios where the U.S. could clinch a spot for next year's World Cup in China during this two-game window. Otherwise, the Americans' fate could be decided by outcomes of games in Greensboro, North Carolina next February against Panama (Feb. 22) and Argentina (Feb. 25).\n\nAnd the U.S.-Argentina game next week could be huge.\n\nThe U.S. and Argentina are tied atop Group E with 7-1 records and will play with outright control of first place in the group standings up for grabs. Uruguay and Puerto Rico will meet that same day, each entering with 5-3 records, meaning the loser there will be three games behind the U.S.-Argentina winner with three games left in qualifying.\n\nThe top three teams in the group standings are guaranteed spots in the World Cup.\n\nQualifying started late last year, and it's been broken up into a series of two-game windows. FIBA changed the qualifying rules for this tournament, and because most of the games have overlapped with the NBA season the Americans had no choice but to ask G League players to earn the country's spot in the World Cup \u2014 even though a chance to play in China won't be the reward for any of those players.\n\nThis is the fifth of those qualifying windows, and Van Gundy is getting basically a fifth different roster. He's used 37 players already in the qualifying games, and nine of the 12 players he's taking to South America on this trip has yet to appear in any of the eight previous qualifier contests.\n\nHearn has appeared in five of the eight games, averaging 12.2 points.

March For Our Lives released a statement: \u201cWe are truly humbled and grateful for this award, but know that our work will not stop until we end the appalling and preventable epidemic of gun violence in the United States.\u201d\n\nThey have made some inroads. The organization said more than 25 states have passed laws consistent with their cause.\n\nAnd its fund-raising attempts got a major boost Monday when the TOMS shoe company pledged $5 million to the campaign to end gun violence and launched a drive through its website to send postcards to Congress calling for universal background checks.\n\nBut Parkland survivor Ryan Deitsch said the group understands new legislation will accomplish only so much. He said tackling the gun culture represents a major part of the equation in reducing violence.\n\n\u201cWe have a culture that we have to fight, which is very much a culture centered around guns and making them as normalized as possible in society \u2013 and that is not just in America but around the world,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat is something that we have to combat. That is something we have been combating slowly.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/20/parkland-students-receive-international-peace-award-desmond-tutu/2069911002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, David Jackson, USA TODAY", "title": "Donald Trump claims Ivanka Trump's private emails are different than Hillary Clinton's", "description": "Congressional Democrats say Ivanka Trump's private emails should be investigated to see if she is mixing public business with private interests.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/20/donald-trump-ivanka-trumps-emails-different-than-hillary-clintons/2067275002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/1fdf2b13-fe2b-4eea-bc6c-7323c9662b1c-AFP_AFP_1AZ93R.JPG?crop=5567,3117,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:30:24Z", "content": "It was discovered that Ivanka Trump used a private email to send messages to government officials in 2017.

(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nComing off perhaps the greatest game in fantasy football history, a cold reality is just now hitting anyone who has been relying on Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Rams players all season: those two offensive juggernauts aren't playing in Week 12.\n\nWith many leagues' trade deadlines already passed, the waiver wire may be a fantasy owner's only option.\n\nRecommended bids based on a free agent acquisition budget (FAAB) of $100 for the season.\n\nBEST BETS\n\nRB Gus Edwards, Baltimore Ravens ($25+). The previously unknown rookie had hardly been used all season before he rumbled for 115 yards, a touchdown and a two-point conversion. That should earn him plenty of touches going forward. If you've got a blank space in your lineup where Todd Gurley or Kareem Hunt should be, Edwards has emerged at the perfect time.\n\nRB Josh Adams, Philadelphia Eagles ($22). The Eagles backfield has been a mess for most of the season, but Adams was the lone bright spot on Sunday. He ran for 53 yards and the team's only touchdown, seemingly moving ahead of Wendell Smallwood and Corey Clement on the depth chart.\n\nQB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens ($20). Filling in for the injured Joe Flacco, the former Heisman Trophy winner called his own number an astounding 27 times (for 117 yards). It looks like he'll get another start at home vs. Oakland. Those rushing numbers add up quickly -- and he could easily be an upper-tier fantasy quarterback if he can reach the end zone. Fantasy owners, especially those with Patrick Mahomes or Jared Goff out this week, should consider Jackson a viable starter.\n\nWR Curtis Samuel, Carolina Panthers ($14). Another week, another touchdown for Samuel. With three receiving and two rushing scores, he's been one of the league's more efficient wide receivers since making his season debut after the Panthers' Week 4 bye. (Apparently, I'm not the only one to notice.) Devin Funchess' ineffectiveness has given Samuel and D.J. Moore more opportunities lately.\n\nCurtis Samuel has scored 5 touchdowns on only 112 snaps through Week 11. (2 rushing, 3 receiving). Some players don't even have that on 112 targets. #Panthers#FreeSamuel \u2014 Jeff Haseley (@JeffHaseley) November 19, 2018\n\nREPLACEMENTS\n\nRB Theo Riddick, Detroit Lions ($10). Starter Kerryon Johnson sprained his knee in the second half on Sunday -- and with the Lions playing in their traditional Thanksgiving Day game, there's precious little recovery time. That will leave the bulk of the work against the Chicago Bears to bulldozer LeGarrette Blount and Riddick. With the Lions likely to be playing catch-up, Riddick seems more valuable -- especially in PPR leagues.\n\nQB Jameis Winston, Tampa Bay Buccaneers ($8). Another option to fill in for Mahomes or Goff, Winston has the starting job once again for the team that's thrown for more passing yards than any other. The issue for Bucs quarterbacks has been finishing the game.\n\nWR Dontrelle Inman, Indianapolis Colts ($6). Quarterback Andrew Luck has thrown for at least three touchdowns in seven consecutive games -- and in Week 11, Inman was one of the recipients. The midseason addition also played the second-most snaps among Colts wideouts so his arrow is pointing upward.\n\nTE Antonio Gates, Los Angeles Chargers ($5). Among tight ends who play this week, Gates had the second-most fantasy points in Week 11. The ageless one caught five passes for 80 yards and a touchdown. He's well worth a one-week flyer.\n\nTE Cameron Brate, Tampa Bay Buccaneers ($5). O.J. Howard injured his ankle on Sunday and is considered questionable. Brate has shown good chemistry with Winston in the past and is an excellent hedge for concerned Howard owners.\n\nSPECULATIVE PICKUPS\n\nQB Colt McCoy, Washington Redskins. With Alex Smith out for the season with a broken leg, McCoy gives the Redskins a capable backup who isn't afraid to put the ball in the air. Until he came in for Smith and went 6-for-12 with a TD, McCoy hadn't completed an NFL pass since 2015.\n\nWR Bruce Ellington, Detroit Lions. In a situation similar to the one at running back with Kerryon Johnson, Ellington could see some significant action if starting wideout Marvin Jones isn't able to play. Fortunately, the Lions play the first game on Thursday so fantasy owners will have plenty of time to react to who's active or inactive.\n\nPossibly still available from last week's list: WR Zay Jones, RB Giovani Bernard, WR Josh Reynolds, WR Brandon Marshall, RB Malcolm Brown (handcuff), RB Spencer Ware (handcuff)\n\nFollow Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Improved defense plays crucial role in Colts' winning streak", "description": "Improved defense plays crucial role in Colts' winning streak", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/20/improved-defense-plays-crucial-role-in-colts-winning-streak/38574785/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46b060fda7f2d190f77321e667917ca734a4f4a6/c=0-380-3618-2415/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/f74ba5bb720848f9b365d7ba4c23ebfb.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:25:35Z", "content": "Tennessee Titans' Dion Lewis (33) is talked by Indianapolis Colts' George Odum (30) during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Indianapolis.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Indianapolis Colts made a firm commitment to Matt Eberflus in January.\n\nThey stuck to it after the man who initially hired Eberflus to be Indy's defensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels, reneged on a deal to become the next coach and they lived up to their promise after eventually hiring Frank Reich in February.\n\nIt's worked out well for the Colts.\n\n\"He's a consistent guy, he's got a consistent message every day and he believes in the system,\" middle linebacker Anthony Walker said Tuesday. \"That's what you want as a player, a guy who believes in the system.\"\n\nThe system looks awfully familiar to longtime Colts' fans.\n\nEberflus reinstalled the Tampa 2 defense, the zone concept popularized by Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy. General manager Chris Ballard saw it work in Chicago under Lovie Smith, one of Dungy's former pupils, and Reich worked with it on Dungy's staff when he first started coaching in 2006. Indy capped that season by winning the Super Bowl.\n\nThe low-key personalities and focused approaches also proved a perfect match.\n\nBut the real investment came in free agency and the draft.\n\nWhile Colts fans waited impatiently for Ballard to make a splashy move, he mostly avoided the high-priced free agents and instead went with less-familiar names who could excel in Eberflus' system.\n\nThe results have been remarkable.\n\nLinebacker Darius Leonard, a second-round pick, has a league-high 104 tackles and Walker has 67 tackles, nearly four times as many as he had in 2017.\n\nDefensive end Kemoko Turay has shown flashes of being a disruptive pass rusher and Tyquan Lewis showed promise in his first two games after missing the first eight with an injured toe. Both were second-round draft picks in April.\n\n\"We're getting to the ball, causing turnovers,\" Leonard said. \"We don't do a lot, there's not a lot of thinking so it's very easy for me to go out and play.\"\n\nNot just for the young guys, either.\n\nJabaal Sheard moved from outside linebacker to defensive end and already has matched his sacks total (5\u00bd) from last season. Veteran defensive linemen Margus Hunt has gone from rotation player to starter and has had a career-best season.\n\nSafeties Clayton Geathers and Malik Hooker have been rounding into form after missing most of last season and part of this season with injuries, and outsiders have noticed a difference.\n\n\"They hustle. They have great team effort. They have very good team speed. They stunt the front and they are all very good hitters,\" Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden said recently. \"They seem to really like each other. They seem to have a really good, I think, overall down to down competitive nature about them.\"\n\nThe individual numbers only tell part of the story.\n\nAfter finishing 30th in the league in yards allowed per game in 2016 and 2017 and 26th or worse in four of Chuck Pagano's six seasons as head coach, Indy has jumped to No. 20 this season. Through 10 games, they have 26 sacks and are on pace for their highest total since 2013.\n\nThe Colts have allowed 17.5 points to their past four opponents and only four teams have more takeaways than Indy (19).\n\nNot surprisingly, the Colts (5-5) have won all four, moving back into the playoff picture largely because of a defensive resurgence few expected in Eberflus' first season.\n\n\"I think you have to go through this process. Sometimes you take a couple steps forward and one step back or three or four steps forward and one or two back,\" Eberflus said. \"But it's really about the guys buying into it.\"\n\nIt could be just the start.\n\nThe young Colts are still getting acclimated to Eberflus and his scheme, are still learning how to play consistently well and still must demonstrate they can withstand the late-season rigors to make a playoff run.\n\nBut for the first time in a long time, the Colts' defense no longer looks like the weak link. Instead, Eberflus has demonstrated just how promising the future could be.\n\n\"I think guys are buying into the style slowly but it's not consistent yet,\" Eberflus said. \"Today in the film room we pointed out all the loafs and all the missed assignments, so we can definitely get better week to week and now it's about being consistent week to week.\"\n\nNotes: With the likelihood of starting center Ryan Kelly out with an injured left knee, the Colts signed center Josh Andrews off the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad. ... Indy also put cornerback D.J. Killings on injured reserve and waived cornerback Arthur Maulet.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The golfers will face off in a match play event on Friday. (Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe winner between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson might be the least relevant aspect of their Friday night match in Las Vegas.\n\nFar more compelling was the outcome of a 72-hole exhibition played over two courses for an obscene amount of money \u2014 Harry Vardon received nearly seven times more than what he had won from his one-shot victory over Willie Park Jr. in the 1898 British Open.\n\nThat next summer, Vardon and Park played an exhibition billed by the British press as the greatest golf competition ever. Vardon won 100 British pounds with his 2-up advantage at North Berwick before 10,000 spectators, and another 100 pounds for completing the 11-and-10 rout at his home course of Ganton.\n\nSo Woods vs. Mickelson is nothing new, except the public is not allowed at Shadow Creek.\n\nWhat's unique about this exhibition, with $9 million supposedly going to the winner, is the delivery. This is golf's first venture into pay-per-view, and organizers were smart to keep the price at $19.99, which is about 25 percent of what a compelling heavyweight fight would command.\n\nHow many people care enough to sign up on Black Friday?\n\n\"Um, no,\" Rory McIlroy said when he was asked last week in Dubai if he would pay to watch. \"I contemplated it. I was having lunch with Phil at one of the FedEx Cup events and I said, 'I might watch it.' He took $25 out of his pocket and said, 'No, here's $25, I'll pay for it for you.' Thank you.\"\n\nMcIlroy says it might have been worth it 15 years ago, but that now it has \"missed the mark a little bit.\"\n\nWoods and Mickelson remain the two biggest names in golf even in this tidal wave of youth, but their one-sided rivalry \u2014 Woods was the only rival Mickelson had, not the other way around \u2014 has been dormant for five years. This feels old, and the relentless promotion at times has made it feel contrived.\n\nIs it a bad idea? Not at all.\n\nThere is no downside to Woods and Mickelson squaring off in a pay-per-view event on a beautiful golf course at Shadow Creek that everyone seems to know but hardly anyone has seen. But when the biggest upside is that there's no downside, selling it becomes an uphill battle.\n\nThere will be plenty of talking, and Mickelson is rarely without words. There will be side action. That's part of what makes this different from the \"Showdown at Sherwood,\" a Monday night exhibition between Woods and David Duval in 1999 when they were in their prime and battling for No. 1 in the world.\n\nThe question is whether it has a future.\n\nThat's about the only thing that piques the interest of Alastair Johnston, vice chairman of IMG who knows a little about these golf exhibitions.\n\nJohnston was deeply involved with the Skins Game when it began in 1983 until it had run its course in 2008. In the midst of that run were the Monday night matches that featured Woods against Duval, Sergio Garcia and then a team format that ended \u2014 thankfully \u2014 when it had Woods, Mickelson, John Daly and Retief Goosen.\n\n\"It's very tough for me to criticize it, but it's very tough to praise it,\" Johnston said.\n\nThat covers a lot of territory for a lot of golf fans. Those who live to criticize will be reaching for low-hanging fruit. Those who want to watch Woods and Mickelson go head-to-head will have no trouble finding entertainment.\n\n\"I'll be interested, from a professional standpoint, in how many viewers it gets, how many pay,\" Johnston said. \"How many people actually care to spend money on that, and does it lead to other opportunities and different delivery systems? Golf hasn't been tested like that. That's what intrigues me.\"\n\nThe PGA Tour has approved only one of these matches, even as there is talk of a franchise.\n\nHistory suggests this won't have much staying power. The Skins Game was ideal for Thanksgiving weekend, and there was plenty of star power among Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Lee Trevino, Tom Watson, Fred Couples and others.\n\nGolf has that now with a strong core of young major champions, and perhaps that's in the future.\n\nBut more episodes of Woods and Mickelson will get old, and history suggests that Woods and any collection of players might not be enough. In the old Monday night exhibitions, Woods went from a 7.6 national rating with Sergio Garcia to a 3.0 in the last of the team events.\n\nSo the only outcome on Black Friday is how many care, even when it involves the one player everyone loves to watch.\n\nJohnston recalls not so fondly the time he put together a unique concept in 1997, the year Woods set 20 records at the Masters and won by 12. He was to play against Michael Jordan, Ken Griffey Jr. and Kevin Costner. For every hole Woods won, they could choose which club to take out of his bag. They had walk-up music. It was taped to be shown on Christmas Day. It was called \"Tiger & Friends.\"\n\nBut then Jordan and Costner had to pull out, replaced by NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and actor Chris O'Donnell. And then it rained.\n\nThe forecast is for sunshine and mild weather in Las Vegas on Friday.\n\nThat's a start.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Fultz lost his starting spot in the rotation when the Sixers traded for Jimmy Butler.\n\nHe seemed to lose his backup point spot when coach Brett Brown gave TJ McConnell the bulk of the minutes in a win over Phoenix on Monday.\n\n\"This news about his shoulder, it did catch me off guard,\" coach Brett Brown said. \"If it's that real, and he needs to go see a further sort of consultation, then we support him.\"\n\nSixers general manager Elton Brand said Fultz's agent Raymond Brothers told him the guard wouldn't practice or play until the results of Monday's examination. Brand said he was told Monday was the earliest Fultz could see a specialist.\n\nBrand said he was unaware if anything was wrong with Fultz's shoulder. Fultz had said this month he wasn't bothered by the shoulder.\n\n\"There's nothing that we saw medically that didn't allow him to play,\" Brand said. \"He played last night. He played two nights ago. Ever since Jimmy Butler came and he wasn't starting, I felt he played pretty well. I was proud of the way he bounced back from a lot of things.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old Fultz is averaging 8.2 points, 3.1 assists, 3.7 rebounds and shooting 42 percent from the field.\n\n\"We just want the best for him,\" Brand said.\n\nThe Sixers are 9-0 at home and in fourth place overall in the Eastern Conference.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Amis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Talk about a mismatch.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints have been unstoppable. The Atlanta Falcons have struggled to stop anyone. It all adds up to a Thanksgiving night game that could get out of hand quickly.\n\n\"Where do you start?\" moaned Marquand Manuel, the Falcon's defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Saints (9-1) are leading the NFL in scoring and really piled it on the last two weeks, dropping 51 points on Cincinnati and 48 on defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia in a pair of blowout wins.\n\nMost amazingly, New Orleans has scored on 24 of its last 29 possessions, not counting kneel-downs at the end of the game.\n\nEighteen of those possessions have resulted in touchdowns.\n\nNext up is Atlanta (4-6), a team that has lost two straight and ranks near the bottom of the league in every major defensive category. The Falcons have been ravaged by injuries, losing both safeties for the season and top linebacker Deion Jones for the last nine games. Jones has returned to the active roster but it's not known if he'll be able to go Thursday.\n\n\"It's a challenge,\" Marquand said. \"The guys just have to be up to it for four quarters and understand that they're going to make some plays. They're hot right now.\"\n\nWhile Drew Brees is having another huge year at age 39, New Orleans' running game might be the real key to its offensive success.\n\nThe Saints rank sixth in the league with an average of 131.4 yards per game, and they've been especially tough to defend since Mark Ingram returned after serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on banned substances.\n\n\"Complementary football,\" Ingram said. \"Great teams play complementary football.\"\n\nIngram has rushed for 388 yards since his return, combining with Alvin Kamara to provide a dynamic 1-2 punch. Kamara has run for 617 yards and 11 TDs, to go along with 56 receptions and four scores.\n\n\"The combination of both he and Alvin together has been pretty good for us,\" coach Sean Payton said. \"It is much more difficult if you are limited to just one of those players.\"\n\nMarquand said Atlanta's focus will be on trying to turn the Saints one-dimensional.\n\n\"It's where you start every week: the ability to stop the run game,\" he said. \"Ingram has come back and given them a nice balance. That allows Drew to be who he is.\"\n\nIndeed, Brees is still the one who makes it all click.\n\nLast week, with newly signed receiver Brandon Marshall on the inactive list and the Eagles shading their coverage toward top receiver Michael Thomas, Brees threw touchdown passes to second-year pro Austin Carr and rookie Tre'Quan Smith.\n\nSmith finished with 10 catches for a career-high 157 yards, giving the Falcons another player to worry about, though he hasn't been practicing during the short week because of a foot issue.\n\nThomas is certainly a handful, having already eclipsed 1,000 yards receiving with six games still to go.\n\n\"Drew's going to shred you up, man,\" Ingram said. \"When we're running the ball well, it just opens it up more for him. Even if not, he's still going to do his thing. When he's throwing it and slicing and dialing up plays like that and playing pitch and catch like that, they have to respect it.\"\n\nWhen these longtime division rivals met in Week 3, New Orleans pulled out a 43-37 victory in overtime . Most memorably, Brees forced the extra period with a 7-yard touchdown run in the closing minutes of regulation, spinning away from both Brian Poole and Robert Alford to reach the end zone. The Saints then won the coin toss and held the ball for more than 7 minutes in OT, capped by Brees' 1-yard TD plunge that ended the game.\n\nThe thrilling contest set a course for both teams.\n\nThe Falcons lost their next two games, as well, and never really recovered. The Saints haven't lost since.\n\n\"The last time we played them, the tackling was not up to par,\" Marquand said. \"But we are a better defense than the last time we faced them. We've got to make sure we stop them in the red zone, because they're going to make their plays. We've got to make them earn everything they get.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(Photo: AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 One of the nation\u2019s largest student loan servicing companies may have driven tens of thousands of borrowers struggling with their debts into higher-cost repayment plans.\n\nThat\u2019s the finding of a Department of Education audit of practices at Navient Corp., the nation\u2019s third-largest student loan servicing company.\n\nThe conclusions of the 2017 audit, which until now have been kept from the public and were obtained by The Associated Press, appear to support federal and state lawsuits that accuse Navient of boosting its profits by steering some borrowers into the high-cost plans without discussing options that would have been less costly in the long run.\n\nMore: Navient lawsuit: What student loan borrowers need to know\n\nThe education department has not shared the audit\u2019s findings with the plaintiffs in the lawsuits. In fact, even while knowing of its conclusions, the department repeatedly argued that state and other federal authorities do not have jurisdiction over Navient\u2019s business practices.\n\n\u201cThe existence of this audit makes the Department of Education\u2019s position all the more disturbing,\u201d said Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense Network, who worked for the Department of Education under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe AP received a copy of the audit and other documents from the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who has been a vocal critic of Navient and has publicly supported the lawsuits against the company as well as questioning the policies of the Department of Education, currently run by President Trump\u2019s Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. Warren is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2020.\n\nNavient disputed the audit\u2019s conclusions in its response to the Department of Education and has denied the allegations in the lawsuits. One point the company makes in its defense is that its contract with the education department doesn\u2019t require its customer service representatives to mention all options available to the borrower.\n\nHowever, the five states suing Navient \u2014 Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, California and Mississippi \u2014 say the behavior breaks their laws regarding consumer protection. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says in its own lawsuit the practices are unfair, deceptive and abusive and break federal consumer protection laws.\n\nCLOSE Navient, formerly a part of Sallie Mae, services about $300 billion in student loans \u2014 or about 12 million borrowers. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nOf the five states that filed lawsuits against Navient, only Illinois and Pennsylvania were even aware of the audit, and they said they did not receive their copies from the Department of Education. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau declined to comment on whether it had a copy of the report.\n\nThe Department of Education said withholding the report was intentional, repeating the argument it has made in court and in public that only it has jurisdiction over student loan servicing issues, through its Federal Student Aid division, or FSA, which oversees student loans.\n\n\u201cFSA performed the review as part of its own contract oversight, not for the benefit of other agencies,\u201d said Liz Hill, a Department of Education spokeswoman.\n\nWhen student borrowers run into difficulties making payments, they can be offered forbearance, which allows them to delay payments for a set period of time. But under a forbearance plan, in most instances, the loan continues to accumulate interest and becomes a more expensive option in the long run.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleges in its lawsuit against Navient that between 2010 and 2015 Navient\u2019s behavior added nearly $4 billion in interest to student borrowers\u2019 loans through the overuse of forbearance. It is a figure that Navient disputes.\n\nMore: Navient seeks to dismiss student loan case, says consumer watchdog overreached\n\nA 2017 study by the Government Accountability Office estimates that a typical borrower of a $30,000 student loan who places their loan into forbearance for three years \u2014 the maximum allowed for economic-hardship forbearance \u2014 would pay an additional $6,742 in interest on that loan.\n\n\u201cThis finding is both tragic and infuriating, and the findings appear to validate the allegations that Navient boosted its profits by unfairly steering student borrowers into forbearance when that was often the worst financial option for them,\u201d Warren said in a letter to Navient last week.\n\nAs part of their inquiry, DoE auditors listened in on about 2,400 randomly selected calls to borrowers from 2014 to 2017 out of a batch of 219,000. On nearly one out of 10 of the calls examined, the Navient representative did not mention other options, including one type of plan that estimates the size of a monthly payment the borrower can afford based on their income. Auditors wrote that many customer service representatives failed to ask questions to determine if such a plan, known as an income-driven repayment plan, might be more beneficial to the borrower.\n\nThere is no public record of how many struggling borrowers serviced by Navient may have been impacted by these practices. In its most recent annual report, Navient says it services 6 million student loan borrowers, of which 12.7 percent are more than 30 days past due. That would be roughly 762,000 customers who are struggling in some fashion to pay their student loans.\n\nIf one out of every 10 of those customers were pushed into forbearance instead of an income-driven repayment plan, as the department\u2019s audit found, that would be 76,200 of Navient\u2019s borrowers.\n\nThe DoE report contains recommendations for how Navient could fix its practices but makes no mention of firm requirements or sanctions.\n\nThe education department\u2019s Federal Student Aid division decided to do a review of Navient\u2019s forbearance practices after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed its lawsuit against the company in January 2017, department spokeswoman Hill said, to see if there were any compliance issues.\n\nShe said DoE officials came to the conclusion that Navient was not improperly steering borrowers. \u201cNothing in the report indicates forbearances were applied inappropriately \u2014 the observations noted focused on suggested improvements regarding how to best counsel\u201d a small minority of borrowers, she said.\n\nIn response to questions over the 2017 audit, Navient pointed to the fact that nine out of every 10 borrowers on the calls were offered all their options and that this audit is just one piece of a broader story.\n\n\u201cThis (audit), when viewed as a whole, as well as dozens of other audits and reviews, show that Navient overwhelmingly performs in accordance with program rules while consistently helping borrowers choose the right options for their circumstances,\u201d said Paul Hartwick, a company spokesman.\n\nNavient, which split off from Sallie Mae, is a publicly traded company. In calls and presentations with investors, Navient has said a company priority is to lower its operational costs.\n\nAs a student loan servicing company, Navient has one primary operating cost: its employees, including the hundreds of customer-service agents who man Navient\u2019s telephones every day. The fewer customer-service agents Navient employs, the more money Navient puts in its pocket. Doing calls to determine whether a borrower should be in an income-driven repayment plan takes longer, student loan industry experts say.\n\nIn fact, that is exactly what Navient said in its response to the Department of Education\u2019s audit.\n\n\u201cWe (are not) aware of any requirement that borrowers receive all of their repayment options ... on each and every call,\u201d the company said, adding that if the Department of Education chose to require all servicers to discuss income-driven repayment plans with all borrowers, the Department of Education needs to redo its contract with Navient.\n\nSeth Frotman, who was the highest-ranking government official in charge of student loans until he quit in August in protest over how the Trump-controlled Department of Education and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were handling the issue of student loans, said Navient\u2019s response was outrageous.\n\n\u201cIn short, Navient, when confronted with evidence of its bad practices, is telling the government, \u2018Pay us more money or take a hike.\u2019 And It looks like the Department of Education took a hike,\u201d Frotman said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/20/student-loans-navient-lawsuit-department-education-audit/2071008002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Ryan W.

The agency also told Americans to clean refrigerators where romaine had been stored.\n\n\"Consumers who have any type of romaine lettuce in their home should not eat it and should throw it away, even if some of it was eaten and no one has gotten sick,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\nNo common source of the contaminated lettuce has been identified, the CDC said, but federal health officials have begun investigating.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the strain of E. coli had \"same DNA fingerprint\" as an outbreak tied to leafy greens in the United States and romaine in Canada late last year. The outbreak killed one person and infected 25 in 15 states.\n\nHowever, the outbreak is not related to an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from earlier this year \u2013 which killed five people and sickened 210 in 36 states \u2013 the CDC said.\n\n\"This isn\u2019t the first romaine outbreak we have seen in the recent past, and we will continue to take steps to identify the root causes of these events and take action to prevent future outbreaks,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.\n\nAdditionally, 18 people in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec have also been sickened by the same E. coli strain.\n\nTen cases have been reported in California, the state with the highest number of sick people. Seven were identified in Michigan. Other states with reported cases are Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\n\"Ill people reported eating different types of romaine lettuce in several restaurants and at home,\" health officials said. Most people got sick an average of three to four days after eating the contaminated lettuce, the agency added.\n\nSymptoms include \"severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting,\" among others, but most people who have fallen ill get better within a week, according to the CDC.\n\nUp to 10 percent of patients can develop hemolytic uremic syndrome, though, the CDC said.

He's smart. He knows where he wants to go with the football. He's extremely accurate. He knows who his playmakers are. He's got a good feel for the game.\"\n\nThe offense struggled at times earlier this season to score and move the ball. West Virginia is averaging 47 points over its last four games. Against Texas, Grier threaded a 33-yard TD pass to Gary Jennings in the back of the end zone with 16 seconds left, then Grier ran in the clinching two-point conversion in the 42-41 win .\n\nThe Mountaineers are coming off a 45-41 loss at Oklahoma State on Saturday, a setback that's been quickly forgotten with so much at stake this week.\n\nA huge fan favorite, Grier said he typically doesn't get worked up before or during a game. Friday night could be a challenge emotionally.\n\nNot only is the title-game berth at stake, it's the last time at Mountaineer Field for Grier and 16 other seniors, including wide receiver David Sills. Grier and Sills have combined for 31 TD passes since the start of the 2017 season, the most in the Bowl Subdivision over that span.\n\n\"Definitely this place is home,\" Grier said. \"I've given my life to this place and tried to represent the state and the program the best I can. I graduated from here. I've lived here. My daughter was born here. There's a lot of things that mean a lot to me about this place.\n\n\"I wish it wasn't my last one, but it is and you've got to move on. I hope I go out on top. I will represent this place for the rest of my life.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I\u2019ll back Tiger.\n\nNick: Had this match taken place a few weeks after the end of the season, Woods might have squashed Phil 9 and 8. Tiger could be rusty following the layoff, but there\u2019s still no way I\u2019d bet on him to lose.\n\nSteven: For the sake of variety, I\u2019m going to take Phil. I\u2019m just getting the sense that this matters way more to him than it does Tiger, who has probably been chilling at Orlando Magic games while Lefty works on his short game in preparation. You\u2019re also getting the better odds.\n\nWhen will the match be closed out by the winner?\n\nHole No. 13 or earlier\n\n(+5000) Hole No. 14\n\n(+2500) Hole No. 15\n\n(+1000) Hole No. 16\n\n(+500) Hole No. 17\n\n(+300) Hole No. 18\n\n(-150) Playoff\n\n(+250)\n\nCharles: Hole 16 seems about right and offers great value \u2014 Mickelson will keep up with Woods until Tiger puts on a show starting with the back nine as he pulls away.\n\nNick: It feels like there could be a gentleman\u2019s agreement to stretch this out as long as possible to justify the PPV cost. I\u2019ll go with No. 17.\n\nSteven: Gonna borrow Nick\u2019s tin foil hat and agree that this one gets stretched out as long as possible. I\u2019ll take 17 at +300 odds.\n\nWill either player drive the green on Hole No. 11? Yes (+275) or No (-350)\n\nCharles: No way. Mickelson is 291st on the PGA Tour in driving accuracy and Woods is 129th. Even on a 303-yard par-4, I\u2019m not buying it.\n\nNick: Nope. There\u2019s a huge bunker guarding the front of the green, and not much surface to work with when you\u2019re trying to stop the ball with a longer club. More than likely they\u2019ll be firing to the collection area off to the left.\n\nSteven: Not a chance. I doubt either will seriously try unless they have some ground to make up.\n\nWill Phil Mickelson record an official three-putt? Yes (+700) or No (-2000)\n\nCharles: Why is \u201cNo\u201d so favored? It\u2019s because the assumption is the two will concede a hole instead of finishing it completely, but here\u2019s why I might throw a few bucks on \u201cYes\u201d: With all the side-betting going on, the two might try to make things interesting by wagering on makeable putts.\n\nNick: Phil averaged .44 three-putts per round in 2018, but I would imagine the hole would be conceded before he takes a third stroke on the green. Going with \u201cno.\u201d\n\nSteven: So basically, you\u2019d need both players to three-putt on the same hole to hit this one. And, maybe I\u2019m down on their short games more than I should be, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it happened. With odds that long, it\u2019s worth a short.\n\nWill Tiger Woods record an official three-putt? Yes (+800) or No (-2500)\n\nCharles: See above. I think it\u2019s less likely Woods three-putts but +800 is a really juicy set of odds.\n\nNick: Statistically, Woods is actually more likely to three-putt than Phil (he carded .46 per round this past season). Still a safe \u201cno.\u201d\n\nSteven: What I said for the last one. One of these dudes is three-putting. Mark my words.\n\nHow many hole concessions will be made? Over 2.5 (-115) or Under 2.5 (-115)\n\nCharles: I know what I just said about Woods and Mickelson three-putting, but I\u2019ll take the over anyway. Whatever the final hole is, that\u2019ll be one concession. You have to figure there will be two more over 16 to 18 holes.\n\nNick: Easy over.\n\nSteven: The only reason I\u2019d back the under is that these two are so competitive. But this is golf. Concessions will be made.\n\nHow many side bets will be made by Tiger and Phil? Over 12.5 (-115) or Under 12.5 (-115)\n\nCharles: I\u2019m so tempted to take the over here, but doesn\u2019t 13 bets over what might be 16 holes seem like a lot? I\u2019ll stick with the under but not with confidence.\n\nNick: Both Tiger and Phil have been playing up the side-betting so much in their PR hits ahead of The Match that I almost expect them to have a bet per hole. Going with the over. Se\n\nSteven: I mean, as a viewer I\u2019m hoping for the over, but 12.5 is BIG number. I\u2019ll take the under and just hope I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAmount of largest side bet: Over $50,000 (-115) or under $50,000 (-115)\n\nCharles: Over and then some.\n\nNick: Charles Barkley might drop a 50k bet on the pregame show. Over.\n\nSteven: Way over.\n\nColor of Phil Mickelson\u2019s shirt? (via Oddsshark)\n\nWhite +150 Black +250 Blue +400 Any other color +400\n\nCharles: I\u2019ll go with black, simply because Mickelson just tweeted this photo of a new Mizzen and Main shirt he\u2019s promoting.\n\nWhile prepping for #CapitalOnesTheMatch, I noticed that I look relatively fit\u2014which we all know isn\u2019t the case.\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude09 It must be my new polo from @MizzenAndMain.

(AP Photo/Holly Hart) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz caused a stir last week when he intimated that star tight end Noah Fant's lack of snaps in a loss to Northwestern was due in part because T.J. Hockenson had passed Fant on the depth chart.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (7-4, 4-4 Big Ten) corrected course last week at Illinois: Fant was predictably fantastic, scoring the game's first touchdown in a 63-0 rout.\n\nIt has nonetheless become clear that Hockenson, a redshirt sophomore, just might be the best player on Iowa's roster. He has caught 41 passes for 663 yards and six TDs, and on Monday was named one of three finalists for the Mackey Award, given to the nation's top tight end.\n\n\"He's got a good skill set ... but more importantly, he has a good work ethic and he's been patient,\" Ferentz said. \"In our camp, we've felt like he was a pretty good player for quite some time now.\"\n\nHockenson put up enormous numbers at tiny Chariton (Iowa) High, with 85 grabs for 1,219 yards and 17 touchdowns as a senior. But when he and Fant came to Iowa in the same recruiting class, Fant that was expected to be the star and Hockenson was seen as a potential complementary piece. Hockenson redshirted in 2016 while Fant played right away.\n\nBut as Hockenson sat two years ago, former Iowa star and current San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle took him under his wing. And once Hockenson got a chance to play, it was evident that the Hawkeyes had found something special.\n\nHockenson started along with Fant from the opener in 2017 and had 24 receptions for 320 yards and three TDs. With teams often focused on Fant this fall, Hockenson has blossomed into Iowa's top option. And Fant \u2014 who has 38 catches for 507 yards and seven TDs \u2014 has at times benefited from the attention paid to Hockenson.\n\n\"Most teams are going to try and double somebody, and that leaves everyone else single covered. It ends up being a good situation for the whole offense,\" Fant said. \"When we take advantage of that, we're able to move the ball.\"\n\nHockenson, who is averaging 16.1 yards a catch despite playing inside, says he and Kittle still talk regularly. The relationship has paid off for Hockenson, who at 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds has a nearly identical frame as Kittle.\n\n\"He usually has his opinions on what I can do. He's a good mentor,\" Hockenson said. \"George was a big influence on me ... he was a good person to look up to. He does a lot of things right.\"\n\nIowa closes the regular season on Friday when it hosts Nebraska (4-7, 3-5). There is a chance that Fant, whose 19 career TDs rank third all-time among Big Ten tight ends, might join Kittle in the NFL as soon as next season. And maybe Hockenson, too.\n\nHockenson said that leaving early for the NFL is \"definitely an option,\" adding that he won't have an answer until he gets a chance to talk with Ferentz and offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz after the season.\n\n\"During the season you take it day by day. But at end of the season you're looking back to see what you did and what you can do in the future,\" Hockenson said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

We're discussing plot points integral to the \"Fantastic Beasts\" sequel, so beware if you haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" lives on through the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise. But what initially seemed like a blessing for fans has turned into an unforgivable curse.\n\nAs the prequel series continues to move forward as its own story with \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" (in theaters now), it becomes increasingly difficult to recognize the best parts of the franchise anymore. \"Fantastic Beasts\" may share the same world and intensity as its predecessor, but none of the heart.\n\nAt one point, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and Co. return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which should have been the saving grace for a series that's starting to forget what made it great. But instead, it felt empty; fans may recognize the location, but stories are about people, and a location is nothing without those people.\n\nThis franchise's new lot of main characters, led by Redmayne's Scamander and backed up by Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and sisters Queenie and Tina Goldstein (Alison Sudol and Katherine Waterston), are interesting enough and make for some solid comedic moments, but they give us no real reason to care. They bounce through a conglomerate of plot lines and action sequences, but we never get a full sense of who these core four really are. They don't reflect any inherent truth viewers might see reflected in themselves, like Ron Weasley's struggle with never feeling good enough or Hermione Granger's affinity for a world that often treats her as lesser.\n\nInstead, the stars of \"Fantastic Beasts\" seem to be checking boxes for character \"types\" that make a good story: the goofy guy; the ditz; the strong and independent woman; the quiet, thoughtful one. Ultimately, this spinoff tells viewers to care about these new characters simply because they're \"Potter\"-adjacent, not because they have a new story to convey.\n\nFor hard-core \"Potter\" fans, going to each movie was like coming home. It was a chance to reunite with the characters they had grown up with and come to care about.\n\nThe further the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise continues, the more it feels like returning to high school long after graduation: It should feel the same, but there's nothing there for you anymore.\n\nGoing to watch a \"Harry Potter\" film felt to fans like going home. After all, they'd grown up with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint).

Rowling and director David Yates (who directed the final four \"Potter\" films) throw in. These ideas play as halfhearted attempts to surprise fans who know everything about the \"Potter\" universe, but they really just undermine the existing canon.\n\nReview: Darker, bolder 'Fantastic Beasts' sequel goes all in on Johnny Depp, 'Potter' magic\n\nMore: How 'Harry Potter' inspired 'Dumbledore's Army,' a generation of young activists\n\nA fan confesses: Why I still adore 'Harry Potter' after all these years\n\nLord Voldemort's pet snake? Turns out she was actually a human woman. Dumbledore's family? Surprise! He had a long-lost brother.\n\nEven stranger, if this story was so comfortable with upturning what already exists, why continue only lightly alluding to Dumbledore's sexuality after Rowling announced years ago that the Hogwarts headmaster was gay and in love with Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), who takes the front seat in this movie?\n\nDark wizard Gellert Grendelwald (Johnny Depp) gathers followers for his sinister ideology. (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK)\n\nThe closest \"Crimes of Grindelwald\" comes to acknowledging any romantic feelings comes when Dumbledore sees a younger Grindelwald in the Mirror of Erised, a magical contraption from the very first \"Potter\" book that shows those who gaze into it their greatest wish. The two share a fleeting glance before moving on.\n\nThe world of \"Harry Potter\" has been reborn again and again since the original book series wrapped up 11 years ago. Movies and a theme park and an interactive website and a play have given fans a chance to keep the magic going. But the franchise may have met its match with \"Fantastic Beasts,\" which has begun to undermine the core of why fans fell in love in the first place.\n\nIf the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise was made to satisfy \"Harry Potter\" fans' intense nostalgia for a childhood favorite (and, you know, to make a whole load of money), it sorely missed its mark. Instead, it has alienated its target audience by forgetting that the characters, not the concept, were at the franchise's emotional core.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/20/fantastic-beasts-destroys-what-fans-loved-harry-potter/1810998002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Neymar picks up apparent groin injury during Brazil friendly", "description": "Striker Neymar has left Brazil's friendly against Cameroon after picking up an injury in his right groin", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/20/neymar-picks-up-apparent-groin-injury-during-brazil-friendly/38574449/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/909a7a305f8c09175fff3064657ca5a2883aa164/c=0-152-2000-1277/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/266f2f81ae3f460aa826b3c8c61bfff3.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:39:19Z", "content": "Brazil's manager Tite changes out Brazil's Neymar during the International friendly soccer match between Brazil and Cameroon at MK Stadium in Milton Keynes, England, Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2018.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\n\n\nBlack Friday 2018 is almost here, and the deals have already begun. At Reviewed, our shopping and TV experts are tracking prices all month long to bring you the best Black Friday deals. Though there are a couple notable doorbusters on cheap TVs, the great news is the best Black Friday TV deals we've found are all live right now. Here are the ones you should check out:\n\nThe Best Black Friday 2018 TV deals available now:\n\n1. LG C8 OLED 4K TV\u2014$1,696.99 on Amazon (Save $500): This is the best TV of the year. It usually goes for $2,200, but has been dropping little by little since September, and right now it's at its lowest price we've seen at major retailers (and it's available with Prime shipping). The 65-inch is $300 off right now too, marking its lowest Amazon price of the season.\n\n2. TCL 43-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018)\u2014$279.99 on Amazon (Save $50): This TCL 4K TV is a bit cheaper than the nicer S5 model, which is on sale for $320 (down from $350). The main reason this one's $40 less? Unlike the S5, the S4 doesn't have Dolby Vision and the Roku remote doesn't have a headphone jack for wireless audio, but you can't beat the picture quality for the price.\n\n3. Samsung NU8000 55-In. 8-Series Smart 4K TV\u2014$747.99 on Amazon (Save $150): We were impressed by this TV in our tests, but our main hangup was the high starting price. This deal sorts that out, netting you a very good all-around name-brand TV for an affordable price. You can also get a 65-inch model on sale for $997.99 ($300 off), making it one of the cheaper 65-inch 2018 TVs in this class.\n\n4. TCL 55-In. Roku 4K Smart TV (2017)\u2014$349.99 on Amazon (Save $30): With 4K and Roku's streaming platform built in, you really can't find a better deal on an entry-level big screen TV. At this low sale price, we love this 4K TV, especially for secondary viewing areas like bedrooms, kitchens, or playrooms. It usually costs $380, and originally retailed for $450, so it's a great buy on one of last year's best budget TVs.\n\n5. TCL 65-in. Roku 4K Smart TV (2018 6 Series)\u2014$899.99 at Best Buy (Save $70): This is the Best Buy exclusive version of one of our favorite TVs this year, offering awesome picture quality, the Roku smart platform, and pristine HDR in a 65-inch package. The non-Best Buy version goes for $999 regularly, so you're basically saving $100 off the competition here.\n\n6. Samsung 50-in. 6-Series 4K TV (2018)\u2014$327.99 (Save $272): It's not often you can get a 50-inch 4K Samsung TV for under $350, but here we are. This is one of the lower-end 4K TVs Samsung offers, but if you prefer Samsung over budget-conscious brands like Vizio and TCL, this is a great deal.\n\n\n\n7. Sony 65-in. X850F 4K LED TV (2018)\u2014$998 (Save $400): Sony still makes some of the best TVs you can buy, but they're typically priced above what we can regularly recommend. This 65-inch Sony is Amazon's Choice for a high performance TV and this $400 price cut is the cheapest it's been all year and one of the best big-screen deals we've found ahead of Black Friday. The 75-inch version has also seen a $500 price cut (to $1,798), if you want something even bigger.\n\n\n\nHere are some other TV and home theater deals worth checking out, though not nearly as good as the ones above. Most of these are also live now, but some (especially the Roku Ultra, our favorite streaming box) won't go live until Black Friday:\n\n\n\nOther deals that are live now:\n\nBlack Friday deals that are not yet live:\n\n\n\nOver the next week and on Black Friday proper there are a few other deals that may be worth checking out, but most of the Black Friday ads from stores like Wal-mart and Best Buy are out and we feel our top deals here are just better buys. As usual, most of the TVs with the biggest \"discounts\" are not the name-brand, high-quality sets that we would typically recommend. It's really easy to overpay for a TV on Black Friday\u2014even if you think you're scoring a deal\u2014so be sure to follow our coverage in case anything changes.\n\nWe'll update this post as soon as we find any more deals worth highlighting throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it's pretty clear: if you want a deal on a TV this year, we think you're better off just buying one of the above now.\n\nReviewed.com has you covered through the shopping madness, researching endlessly to find you the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.

(AP) \u2014 C'yontai Lewis' losing streak to Florida State feels even longer than it actually is.\n\nNot only has the Florida tight end lost all four games to the Seminoles during his college career, but the fifth-year senior was part of another setback in 2013. Lewis was on his official visit to Florida that year and witnessed the program's worst defeat (37-7) to rival FSU since 1988.\n\nSo Lewis is essentially 0-5 against the 'Noles.\n\n\"It's the biggest game of the year,\" he said. \"I've just got to get a win against them. ... I've just got to get that win, get the streak going. After we beat them this year, it's never going to end.\"\n\nFlorida's five-game losing streak is its longest in series history. The Gators need to end the slide Saturday in Tallahassee to remain in contention for a New Year's Six bowl \u2014 a potential trip to the Peach Bowl or Fiesta Bowl.\n\n\"We got a great feeling about this game,\" linebacker David Reese said. \"We just want to get that feeling out our mouth, the losing feeling, the record, all that. You know we hear it, but it's in the background. But we do hear it and we want to change that.\"\n\nThe Gators (8-3, No. 13 CFP) have been outscored 157-63 during the streak, losing by an average score of 31-13.\n\nFirst-year Florida coach Dan Mullen playfully noted that he won all four meetings against FSU during his time as offensive coordinator (2005-09). Florida actually won six straight back then, but the 'Noles has dominated since by winning seven of eight.\n\n\"It's huge,\" Mullen said. \"Every year it's huge. You get in these games you're talking about, right, you're talking in-state rivalries, you're talking a lot of neighbors against neighbors. You go to the grocery store you want to have bragging rights over your neighbors for the year. To get that win, it gives all of the Gator Nation the bragging rights over all of State's fans.\"\n\nThere's more than bragging rights at stake, too.\n\nFlorida likely would lock up a spot in a New Year's Six bowl with a win, capping an impressive turnaround after last season's 4-7 debacle. They also have a chance to end the nation's bowl streak. Florida State (5-6) has made 36 straight.\n\n\"That'd be great,\" Mullen said, smiling. \"I'd love to do it. That's what rivalry games are all about, right?\"\n\nThe Seminoles haven't missed a bowl since 1981 \u2014 early in coach Bobby Bowden's tenure.\n\n\"It's very important,\" first-year FSU coach Willie Taggart said. \"We're a prideful university. We pride ourselves on winning and you think about the streak, that's winning. We have been winning every year. So it's very important that we go out and give our fans, our alumni, our former players and coaches that have been here and our current players and coaches everything we can to see that we get this victory and keep it going.\n\n\"That's important to us and we know what is at stake and we got to go take care of business.\"\n\nFlorida opened as a four-point favorite \u2014 the first time since 2009 the Seminoles have been underdogs against the Gators.\n\nSince that one, Florida has lost to FSU at home, on the road, on senior day and with postseason positioning on the line. It's been so one-sided of late that Mullen doesn't have any players on his roster who have experienced a victory against the Seminoles.\n\n\"In rivalry games, those are things that you don't like,\" he said. \"If you're on the winning side of it, it's great to be on a long winning streak in rivalry games. If you're on the losing side, it doesn't feel good for you or your fans. So we have to try to start a new streak.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Rob Schumacher, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nTiger Woods and Phil Mickelson playing golf isn\u2019t a novel concept. Here's what is: Paying to watch them on TV.\n\nThe two most accomplished golfers of the past 25 years will face off in a match play event Friday at the exclusive Shadow Creek Golf Course in North Las Vegas. But in order to watch the winner-take-all $9 million exhibition, you'll have to shell out $20 in the first-ever pay-per-view event for golf.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment,\u201d Stephen Espinoza, president of sports and event programming at Showtime Networks, told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cEverybody in the pay-per-view industry is going be watching Tiger and Phil to see what happens on a few different fronts.\u201d\n\nThe top pay-per-views in history have been dominated by boxing, with UFC and WWE also being major draws. Traditional stick and ball \u2013 or, in this case, club and ball \u2013 sports aren\u2019t among the top 50 pay-per-view events in history as broadcast outlets have shelled out billions to keep them locked into their traditional spheres.\n\nWhat sets this one apart is price and timing.\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao in 2015 cost $89.99 for standard definition and $99.99 for HD and was the biggest pay-per-event event in history with 4.6 million buys, the same price as the No. 2 event (Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor in 2017). Those two bouts \u2013 along with the vast majority of top pay-per-view events \u2013 have taken place on a Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for this event,\u201d Nicholas Masafumi Watanabe, a sport and entertainment management professor at of University of South Carolina who has studied the pay-per-view industry for years, told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cOn a Friday afternoon, the day after Thanksgiving, we are going to see who\u2019s willing to pay $20 to watch Tiger vs. Phil. I think if this happened in 2010, people would be really throwing in their money to watch it.\u201d\n\nOther lower price points for one-off events aren't unprecedented. In August, about 800,000 paid $10 each to watch YouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul box on YouTube. Watanabe said it'd take nearly that many buys for \"The Match\" to break even.\n\n\u201cThe non-traditional pricing could lure in people sitting at home bored and looking for something to do,\" Espinoza said. \"It\u2019s an accessible price point that may pull in some people who say, 'It\u2019s 20 bucks. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\u2019 If it\u2019s successful, we could see other creative pricing and some more non-traditional events on pay-per-view.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition can be purchased and viewed through Turner Sports\u2019 B/R Live apps on various streaming platforms such as Apple TV, Roku and Google Chromecast and via its website. It will also be offered through many cable and satellite providers.\n\n\u201cIt also creates opportunities to drive engagement in new ways, such as the innovative gaming elements and unprecedented levels of access with the participants,\" Turner Sports said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. \"Ultimately, we\u2019ll learn a lot from this event and determine a number of best practices for the future.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cgaming elements\u201d include side bets between the golfers during the competition.\n\nIt has been speculated on for years that pro sports leagues and premiere sporting events such as the NFL and its Super Bowl will eventually end up in a pay-per-view model. However, billion-dollar deals with broadcasters such as ESPN, Fox, NBC and ABC have kept those games on free and cable TV.\n\n\u201cI would never say it\u2019s never going to happen because there\u2019s always the possibility the economics and demand changes,\u201d Watanabe said. \u201cThere\u2019s crossover viewership that the networks bank on. You don\u2019t have that with pay-per-view. The networks use the Super Bowl, for example, to promote a new show. They may take a loss broadcasting the NFL under their current deals, but they see that crossover viewership as vital.\"\n\nThose traditional broadcast outlets have seen declines in viewership as more people drop cable and turn to streaming. However, pay-per-view has remained strong, which Espinoza attributes to investment in digital platforms.\n\nThere\u2019s one type of streaming pay-per-view distributors don't don't like: illegal streams on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter's Periscope, Twitch and YouTube during major events.\n\n\"It's going to be very tough (to police) with that many users and that many people uploading content,\" Pete Cossack, VP of cybersecurity services at the tech security firm Irdeto, told USA TODAY Sports. \"As the technology improves and you start using machine learning and AI, (stopping piracy) will get better and better.\""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jorge L.

March For Our Lives released a statement: \u201cWe are truly humbled and grateful for this award, but know that our work will not stop until we end the appalling and preventable epidemic of gun violence in the United States.\u201d\n\nThey have made some inroads.

Try temperatures in the low 20s with wind chills in single digits or teens, according to AccuWeather. This will be a level of cold that's more typical of mid-January, weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue said. Records that have stood for 140 years could be shattered, he said.\n\nThe cold will be \"dangerous\" all across the Northeast and New England on Thursday, the Weather Underground warned.\n\nThough it was decades before the first parade was held, the coldest Thanksgiving Day on record in New York City was in 1871, \"with a low of 15 and a high of 22,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Jesse Ferrell said.\n\nThe coldest temperature for Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City was 21 degrees, set most recently in 1972.\n\nFor the millions expected to line the parade route, dressing in full winter attire \u2013 with hats, gloves, scarves and numerous layers \u2013 will be necessary, AccuWeather said.

The Justice Department has approved the deal contingent on Disney divesting the regional sports networks.\n\nAmazon and several other companies including Sinclair Broadcast Group, Tegna and private equity firms KKR and The Blackstone Group, are among those bidding for the stations, CNBC reported Tuesday, citing persons familiar with the situation.

HE NEEDS TO PLAY FROM THE POCKE\u2026 [+4068 chars]", "fulltext": "Lamar Jackson is going to be fine.\n\nHe ran the ball an NFL record 27 times in a 24-21 win over the Bengals on Sunday and everybody freaked out.\n\nHE\u2019S NEVER GOING TO SURVIVE PLAYING LIKE THAT.\n\nRUNNING QUARTERBACKS ALWAYS GET HURT.\n\nHE NEEDS TO PLAY FROM THE POCKET.\n\nWe heard all the classics on Sunday night.\n\nWell, let me attempt to be the voice of reason: Calm down. Jackson isn\u2019t going to be running the ball over 20 times a game going forward. That wasn\u2019t even the plan for the Bengals game. The Ravens wisely made the read option a significant part of their offensive game plan; and, for whatever reason, the Bengals were content to chase the running back and let Jackson take off with the ball.\n\nEven when the Bengals stayed at home and gave Jackson a look that should have led to a handoff, the rookie would pull the ball \u2014 and he has the kind of speed that allows him to get away with \u201cbad\u201d reads.\n\nThat inflated Jackson\u2019s carries to a record level, which might be cause for concern; but, for the most part, Jackson did a good job of avoiding big hits.\n\nThe first-round pick was unsurprisingly electric when he used his legs, but it was his work in the pocket that was most encouraging. Jackson will need a year or two before developing into even a league-average pocket passer, but there were signs that he is capable of getting to that level eventually.\n\nOne of the biggest knocks against Jackson in the pre-draft process was his anxiousness to get out of the pocket. And while we certainly saw some of that against the Bengals, there were multiple instances where Jackson showed that willingness to read the defense from the pocket.\n\nEven on the plays he didn\u2019t make, Jackson did due diligence in the pocket. On this play ends up a sack, he climbs the pocket to buy time all while keeping his eyes downfield. His eyes eventually get to his check down, but the defender is lurking and Jackson makes a smart decision to not make the throw.\n\nWe\u2019re not looking at Drew Brees here, but these are plays he was supposedly unable/unwilling to make in college. That he\u2019s making them in his first NFL start is proof that talk was nothing more than pre-draft noise and coded language.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing plays where Jackson looks completely at home in the pocket, which, the Ravens hope, he\u2019ll eventually make consistently\u2026\n\nThe rookie still has plenty to work on before he finds that consistency, however. Jackson needs to completely overhaul his lower body mechanics. His feet and eyes are completely out of sync which leads to awkward, sidearm throws.\n\nDespite the bad plays, and there were a number of them, Jackson\u2019s first NFL start has to be considered a success. The Ravens weren\u2019t expecting a masterful performance from the pocket and they crafted a smart gameplan to play to his strengths and not force him to do things he\u2019s not comfortable doing at this point. In terms of the mental aspects of the game, Jackson passed his first test.\n\n\u201cI thought he played spectacular. I thought he played winning football. It\u2019s tough being a quarterback in this league. It\u2019s tough against a defense like that \u2013 they put everything on the line and played all out,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said of Jackson\u2019s performance after the game. \u201cFor a first-time-out rookie in an environment like that \u2026 All those operation things, I think, speak to his intelligence, his studiousness, and just his ability to run the show. And that\u2019s everything. The playmaking \u2013 that comes from God. He made use of that, too. Very proud of that.\u201d\n\nJackson deserves all of that praise, but we should also be applauding the Ravens for tailoring the plan to their quarterbacks, not criticizing them for doing so.\n\nWhile running Jackson 27 times a game won\u2019t be a sustainable model, Baltimore should not alter their approach too much in response to the backlash. If the coaching staff is able to convince Jackson that he doesn\u2019t have to be the hero every play, employing a similar game plan until he\u2019s ready to become a more consistent pocket passer would be the best course of action."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Scientists may have figured out what dogs dream about", "description": "It appears dogs can dream, but what about the rest of the animal kingdom?

(AP) \u2014 Ryan Tannehill was among the first players on the field Tuesday, tossing short passes to an assistant equipment manager before practice even began, trying to make up for lost time and lost games.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins plan to start Tannehill for the first time in seven weeks Sunday at Indianapolis . Coach Adam Gase said Tannehill has progressed enough in his recovery from a throwing shoulder injury to rejoin the lineup, and said the quality of his passes appears to be 100 percent.\n\n\"You don't look at him and go, 'Is he trying to feel his way?'\" Gase said. \"I don't see that. I see a guy who's confident in where he's at, and is doing a good job of turning the ball loose and putting it where it needs to be.\"\n\nTannehill said his shoulder still hurts when he throws, but the stabbing pain he felt earlier is gone.\n\n\"I'm not completely pain-free, but it's at a tolerable rate and it's something I can deal with, and it doesn't affect any throws I make,\" he said. \"I'm ready to put this behind me and move forward and start winning games.\"\n\nTannehill's return provides a welcome lift. Replacement Brock Osweiler went 2-3 as the starter, and the offense has gone nine quarters without a touchdown.\n\nThe Dolphins (5-5) have lost five of their past seven games, but because of a logjam of .500 teams in the AFC, they're in contention for only their third playoff berth in the past 17 seasons. That means Tannehill has a shot to play in the postseason for the first time in his seven-year career.\n\nTannehill will start this week for only the sixth time in Miami's past 31 games. A knee injury wiped out his 2017 season, and this year he hurt the capsule in his shoulder in Week 5.\n\nProgress in rehabilitation was so unsteady at first that the Dolphins shut down Tannehill for a time. Gase acknowledged the possibility of another setback.\n\n\"Like I told Brock, 'You've just always got to stay ready,'\" Gase said.\n\nBut Tannehill said he made significant strides during last week's bye, and said doctors have told him he doesn't risk further injury to the shoulder by returning. He threw in practice Tuesday for the first time since mid-October, and is now unleashing passes of more than 50 yards while making more than 100 throws per session.\n\nHe comes back to an offense missing his most dynamic options. Since he was sidelined, Albert Wilson and Jakeem Grant have suffered season-ending injuries.\n\n\"We still have a lot of good skill players we can get the ball to,\" Tannehill said. \"It's just going to be different guys than it was.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And creativity is at the very core of a brand new holiday ad from the company.\n\nIt takes the form of an inspirational animated sub-3-minute film released just ahead of Thanksgiving, and backed by a lovely original track from soulful 16-year old singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, titled \u201ccome out and play.\u201d\n\nBillie Eilish let her hair fly as she danced onstage Saturday.

Full update: Thanksgiving flights: Busy get-away day now in full swing\n\nORIGINAL POST: Flyers have packed their bags. Airports are full. And everyone\u2019s cast a wary eye to the weather forecast.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s been a smooth go for most as travelers enter the home stretch for the busy Thanksgiving travel period.\n\nNationwide, only about 75 flights have been canceled and about 375 delayed, flight-tracking service FlightAware counted as of 1 p.m. ET Tuesday. Both numbers are miniscule when compared to the USA\u2019s cumulative schedule of flights, which reaches 30,000 a day during peak periods.\n\n\n\nThe one relative exception to Tuesday's calm came in Seattle, where about two dozen flights were canceled and others delayed amid foggy conditions there.\n\nIn the Northeast, snow was falling in parts of New York state and New England, though that was more likely to impact travelers driving to the airports than flights themselves.\n\nElsewhere in the region, poor visibility had created off-and-on backups at the Newark Liberty and Boston airports. Few cancellations were reported at either, though more than 5 percent of the day\u2019s flights at Boston were running at least 15 minutes late, according to FlightAware.\n\nVisibility also was creating problems in the West.\n\nBeyond Seattle, San Francisco flights faced sporadic delays because of low visibility, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. FlightAware estimated about 5 percent of SFO flights were behind schedule.\n\nLooking ahead, no major storms were forecast through the end of the week, bolstering hopes that the relatively trouble-free flight schedules would hold through the holiday.\n\nFavorable weather was expected across most of the USA on Wednesday, one of the busiest travel days of the Thanksgiving period.\n\nA storm moving into the West Coast could create problems at some airports there. Of particular concern was San Francisco, where rain and cloudy weather was forecast for much of the day.\n\nThanksgiving, which is one of the lightest travel days of the year, also was not likely to have major weather-related disruptions to air travel. Still, fliers traveling on the holiday should keep an eye on Northeast airports, where gusty winds could affect flights.\n\nBased on current forecasts, Friday also should feature mostly calm weather. Friday also is historically light on passenger counts.\n\nThat leaves passengers to see what the weekend forecast will bring, especially for Sunday, which is the single-busiest day for air travel during the Thanksgiving window.\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos\n\nThe departure information from the website of Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport showed mostly on-time flights on Nov. 20, 2018.

(Photo: David Zalubowski, AP)\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce in Colfax, Washington, recently decided to stage an event that would pay special tribute to Gardner Minshew, the mustachioed Washington State quarterback.\n\nThe celebration even carried his name \u2013 \u201cGardner Minshew Days,\u201d a two-day festivity scheduled for this week on Main Street, 16 miles from campus in Pullman.\n\nBut the name is a problem, according to NCAA rules. It\u2019s also another example of how the NCAA and its members control the controversial system of \u201camateurism\u201d in college sports.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to celebrate him and the Cougs,\u201d said Valoree Gregory, the chamber\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe chamber planned to have local businesses give away fake mustaches before Friday\u2019s big game against Washington, joining a local craze that\u2019s seen hundreds of Cougar fans wearing fake mustaches in honor of Minshew, the nation\u2019s leading passer.\n\nIt all seemed innocent enough, at least until the chamber received a cease-and-desist notice from the NCAA rules compliance staff at WSU.\n\nMore: College football bowl projections: Playoff field stays in tact as Texas, Penn State rise\n\nMore: Heisman Watch: Kyler Murray makes major move to close in on Tua Tagovailoa\n\n\u201cIn accordance with NCAA Bylaw 12.5.2.2, Washington State University requests you cease the production and display of advertisements, and the possible distribution of any products using Gardner Minshew's name and likeness,\u201d WSU\u2019s letter to the chamber said on Nov. 7.\n\nSo the event changed its name to \u201cMustache Madness\u201d and removed his photo. It still will go on as planned and still references Minshew on its website, just not by name.\n\n\u201cWe are honoring our favorite WSU quarterback by giving out FREE mustaches\u201d on Wednesday and Friday, the website said.\n\nColfax (population 2,900) still hopes it adds to the fun surrounding Friday's Apple Cup in Pullman. Minshew, a graduate transfer from East Carolina, has led the eighth-ranked Cougars (9-1) to one of their best seasons ever, making his mustache so popular that Washington State has tried to capitalize on it, too.\n\nLast week, WSU revved up its Heisman Trophy campaign for Minshew by mailing media members fake mustaches with instructions to \u201cvote for Minshew!\u201d\n\nWashington State's Gardner Minshew Heisman promotion. (Photo: Brent Schrotenboer, USA TODAY)\n\nJust don\u2019t expect to see that campaign slogan in Colfax this week. The campaign posters instead will feature generic mustaches without a name.\n\nThe reason is \u201camateurism,\u201d the NCAA economic system that\u2019s been under attack in the courts and by critics as NCAA schools and coaches keep getting richer while player compensation is strictly restricted. In this case, the system prohibits not only players from profiting off their names and likenesses but also Minshew from having a say even when a local town wants to give free mustaches and honor him by name.\n\nSimilarly, a Cougars gear store in Pullman, Crimson & Gray, has sold fake mustaches for $2 each but has no photo or mention of Minshew, thereby complying with NCAA rules. The sales bin instead has marketed the mustaches with a photo of the comedic character Uncle Rico from the movie \"Napoleon Dynamite.\" Fans jokingly have compared Minshew\u2019s mustache to Uncle Rico\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe figured Uncle Rico would be a good representation,\u201d store manager Craig Laprath said. His store sold out of mustaches last week before ordering more.\n\nIn the Colfax case, Minshew and WSU broke no rules and weren\u2019t involved in planning the event. The rules compliance staff for WSU also didn\u2019t mean to spoil any fun, but the rule in this case required the player or the school to \u201ctake steps to stop such an activity in order to retain his or her eligibility for intercollegiate athletics.\u201d\n\nThe letter met that requirement. Asked for comment, the NCAA referred USA TODAY to WSU.\n\n\u201cAs long as Gardner didn\u2019t have knowledge, which he didn\u2019t, and we do our due diligence, which we have, we are covered,\u201d WSU athletics spokesman Bill Stevens said.\n\nIf not for NCAA rules, the chamber could have gotten permission from Minshew, who has embraced the mustache movement at large. This rule just doesn\u2019t give him a choice. It helps prevent outside commercial enterprises from exploiting or making money off the names and likenesses of athletes while the athletes themselves are not allowed to do the same.\n\nAt the same time, the rule helps NCAA members keep control of their assets and uphold the system of amateurism, whose rules generally cap the compensation of athletes at no more than the cost of attending college.\n\nBy contrast, NCAA schools and conferences are allowed to makes as much as they can in television revenue, ticket sales and shoe and apparel deals, all of which rely on showcasing players such as Minshew. Their football coaches also benefit from those rising revenues and a free market, with at least 44 earning $3 million or more this year. That list includes Cougars coach Mike Leach, who wore his own Minshew mustache during an interview on ESPN Nov. 10.\n\nNot that Minshew is complaining. He appreciates the love.\n\n\u201cI had no clue that was going to be part of it,\u201d he told USA TODAY earlier this month when asked about his celebrity status. \u201cThat is just kind of a testament to how these fans are up here. They love some good football.\u201d\n\nThe fun will continue in Colfax.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have huge mustache posters in our businesses on Main Street,\u201d Gregory said in an e-mail. \u201cAll of our businesses will be wearing mustaches and white headbands. \u2026 Our police cars will even have mustaches on them. Hopefully people don't see those in their rear view mirrors!!\u201d\n\nFollow sports reporter Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer.

(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Patrick Mahomes departed the Coliseum on Monday night knowing he left something on the field when he fell short in the shootout of the year.\n\nTwo late interceptions. Two strip-sack fumbles. A pick-six. Can\u2019t get any of them back now.\n\nYet now it\u2019s a matter of the young Kansas City quarterback taking away hard-knock lessons from the Coliseum that could make a big difference in January, amid the win-or-go-home stakes of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as when we played New England,\u201d Mahomes said after the 54-51 track meet left the Chiefs as the first team in NFL history to lose a game despite scoring 50 or more points.\n\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s just, you can\u2019t make mistakes against great teams and when you play these games, you know these are the games you\u2019re going to play hopefully in the playoffs. You want to make sure that you limit your mistakes and that still at the same time, be aggressive and still score points.\u201d\n\nMore: 20 best NFL regular-season games in last 40 years: Where does Chiefs vs. Rams rank?\n\nMore: NFL power rankings: Rams, Chiefs switch spots after Monday night classic\n\nMore: NFL playoff picture after Week 11: Rams' win over Chiefs shapes both AFC, NFC fields\n\nMahomes passed for six touchdowns, but you might say that he actually accounted for eight, as Rams linebacker Samson Ebukam turned two of the quarterback's five turnovers into instant points \u2013 an 11-yard fumble return score and a 25-yard interception return.\n\nSomeone asked which mistake stung the worst. Mahomes didn\u2019t hesitate. The first interception, on a weak pass to his right, never gave tight end Demetrius Harris a chance.\n\n\u201cThe guy was open and I feel like I was a little early, so I babied it instead of just ripping it like I\u2019ve been doing the whole game,\u201d Mahomes said.\n\nLesson learned. Sure enough, he \u201cripped it\u201d on the other two picks in the final two minutes, but wound up with similar lost opportunities. For as much Mahomes can wow you with his cannon arm and precision touch, his inexperience and lapses in taking care of the football bit him hard on Monday night.\n\nBut at least when Mahomes and the Chiefs (9-2) get to January, they\u2019ll have a better sense of the intensity and environment of a playoff atmosphere. That\u2019s what the game resembled in some regards \u2013 playoff football.\n\nThen again, some crucial mistakes that happened on Monday night will send you home in the postseason.\n\nIt\u2019s striking that after Marcus Peters picked off Mahomes for what was seemingly a game-sealing interception with 1:18 remaining, the Rams ran just 28 seconds off the clock before punting and giving Kansas City yet another chance to rally for a win.\n\nNo, Rams coach Sean McVay never gave the ball to star running back Todd Gurley on that series. But with the Chiefs still holding all three of their timeouts, they needed to move the chains. A first-down penalty and second-down incompletion were more damaging during that the drive than the decision not to hand it to Gurley. Still, it may provide a what-if lesson for salting away a win.\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid, meanwhile, hardly threw Mahomes under the bus for the last-minute picks. On the first one, pressure from Ebukam forced an errant throw. On the final interception, Reid acknowledged that his quarterback was just trying to make something happen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made enough of them where I have full trust in him,\u201d Reid said.\n\nYet Reid\u2019s play-calling can be questioned, too, particularly on the penultimate drive. Trailing by three, the Chiefs could have stood to work down the field with shorter throws, rather than winging it deep \u2013 even though that\u2019s part of Mahomes' magic.\n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve called better throws down the stretch,\u201d Reid said.\n\nCould\u2019ve. Would\u2019ve. Should\u2019ve.\n\nReid should know better than anyone, given his stature as one of the NFL\u2019s winningest active coaches \u2013 and repeated playoff failures that haven\u2019t measured up to his regular-season success.\n\nAt least the standard is set. Barring a collapse over the next six weeks, the Chiefs are bound for the playoffs.

Both teams played so hard,\" Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \"That was a heck of a win for us. To play this level of game at this time of the year is amazing for us.\"\n\nDuke (5-0) came into the game as the tournament favorite and looked like it would run Auburn out of the gym after racing past San Diego State in the opener.\n\nThe Tigers (4-1) clawed back to pull the Blue Devils within reach, yet could never get a firm grip.\n\nDuke answered every Auburn challenge, earning a chance to play No. 3 Gonzaga for the chance at an unprecedented sixth Maui Invitational title.\n\nMarques Bolden, an upperclassmen leader among all the talented freshmen, keyed the defensive, blocking seven shots while scoring seven points and grabbing nine rebounds.\n\nZion Williamson provided the wow factor with acrobatic moves to the basket, finishing with 13 points and nine rebounds.\n\nJared Harper nearly kept the Tigers in it singlehandedly with deep 3-pointers in the second half. He had 22 points and Bryce Brown 16 for Auburn.\n\n\"We're very disappointed that we weren't able to take advantage of the opportunity,\" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. \"Our great strength is our balance and I think when we continue to become a little bit more balanced in many ways we'll continue to become a better team.\"\n\nThe Blue Devils came to Maui yet to be tested, leaving fans wondering what they'll do next through the first four ooh-and-ahh-inducing routs.\n\nThe Blue Devils express kept rolling at the Lahaina Civic Center.\n\nDuke stymied Auburn defensively early, limiting the Tigers to 4-of-20 shooting while jumping out to a 20-8 lead.\n\nBut Tigers would not lay down that easy. Boosted by a large contingent of rowdy supporters, they held Duke without a field goal for five minutes, got out in transition and whittle what seemed like an insurmountable lead to six just before halftime.\n\nDuke tried to run away with it by scoring the second half's first eight points, Auburn clawed its way back, trimming what was once a 17-point deficit to 61-56.\n\nBut every time the Tigers tried to get close, the Blue Devils had an answer with an alley-oop dunk or a Bolden block.\n\n___\n\nNO 3. GONZAGA 91, ARIZONA 74.\n\nThe clock ticking down on a rousing win, Gonzaga's fans started a chant of \"We want Duke!\"\n\nThe Zags will get a chance after an overwhelming second half against Arizona.\n\nDisjointed in the first half, Gonzaga was at its free-flowing best in the second, blowing past the Wildcats 91-74 to set up another marquee Maui Invitational game.\n\n\"We didn't see anyone's head going down, anyone bicker,\" Gonzaga point guard Josh Perkins said. \"There was positivity and we knew things would go our way in the second half and it did.\"\n\nGonzaga (5-0) seemed to miss do-everything forward Killian Tillie (ankle) early, laboring through a start-and-start, foul-filled first half.\n\nOnce the Zags got rolling, they turned Lahaina Civic Center into The Kennel West with a 15-2 run to surge into the lead.\n\nArizona (4-1) fought back, but it didn't last.\n\nGonzaga went on another run to stretch the lead, the crowd roaring the Zags into Wednesday's title game against five-time Maui champion and top-ranked Duke.\n\n\"We got tested and pushed to the brink, and didn't break,\" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. \"That's a great sign for us moving forward.\"\n\nThe Wildcats played through the cacophony of whistles in the first half to lead by eight, but spent most of the second on their heels to drop into the third-place game against No. 8 Auburn.\n\nJustin Coleman had 28 points to lead Arizona, which had three assists on 21 field goals.\n\n\"For 20 minutes, I thought we played with a lot of effort, played a great first half,\" Arizona coach Sean Miller said. \"Obviously, we were overwhelmed in the second half.\"\n\n___\n\nIOWA STATE 84, ILLINOIS 68\n\nTalen Horton-Tucker had 26 points and 14 rebounds, Michael Jacobson added 23 points and Iowa State ran away from Illinois in the second half for an 84-68 victory to reach the fifth-place game.\n\nDown to eight scholarship players due to injuries and suspensions, Iowa State (4-1) bounced back from an opening loss to No. 3 Gonzaga with a strong game at both ends.\n\nTrent Frazier had 15 points to lead Illinois (1-3), which will face Xavier in the seventh-place game.\n\n___\n\nSAN DIEGO STATE 79, XAVIER 74\n\nJalen McDaniels scored 25 points, Devin Watson added 21 and San Diego State rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat Xavier 79-74 at the Maui Invitational.\n\nSan Diego State (3-1) was blown out by top-ranked Duke in its Maui opener and fell behind by 19 early against Xavier (2-3). The Aztecs put together two big runs to go up nine, but Xavier rallied within 64-63 with three minutes left. The Aztecs pushed the lead back to six and hit 10 of 12 free throws in the final 47 seconds to complete their third-largest comeback since 1996-97.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 All the carries were starting to get to Wisconsin's' Jonathan Taylor.\n\nBy his own admission, he wasn't at full speed late in a marathon game against Purdue, though it sure didn't look like it in triple overtime.\n\nAdd last week's performance in a thrilling win over Purdue to the highlight reel for the Badgers' star sophomore. Three scores and a career-best 321 yards, including the game-winning dash to the end zone on his 33rd and final carry.\n\n\"Really just kind of your muscles \u2014 you really can't run full speed, things like that,\" Taylor said Tuesday in describing his fatigue late in the 47-44 victory over the Boilermakers. \"You can still give it everything you have, but it's not really the top, top of what your peak performance is.\"\n\nLook out Minnesota. Taylor is rested and ready to go again for the regular-season finale on Saturday against the Gophers in the annual rivalry game for Paul Bunyan's Axe.\n\n\"I think what he's doing is truly special,\" coach Paul Chryst said.\n\nThe nation's leading rusher averages 169.9 yards per game, 31.6 yards better than second-place Darrell Henderson of Memphis. With 3,846 career yards going into Saturday, Taylor has smashed former Wisconsin star Ron Dayne's major college record for career rushing yards though a sophomore season (3,566).\n\nAnd Taylor still has two more games left this year.\n\nNo wonder he's a finalist again for the Doak Walker Award, given to the nation's best running back.\n\nTaylor said his patience has improved from his freshman season, so he knows to wait for the right holes to develop. Once the hole opens, the 5-foot-11, 221-pound Taylor can motor into the open field. He's developed another gear, offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph said.\n\n\"He knows when he puts his foot in the ground, he doesn't think anyone is going to stop him from going where he wants to go,\" Rudolph said. \"That's pretty cool to talk about that type of growth.\"\n\nTaylor is amassing all these yards in spite of an up-and-down year for the Badgers' passing attack.\n\nBackup Jack Coan might start against Minnesota with Alex Hornibrook listed as questionable again while in the concussion protocol. Coan showed some improvement last week against Purdue, though perhaps not quite enough to prevent the Minnesota defense from focusing on slowing Taylor.\n\nIt happens every week, and yet Taylor still manages to be productive.\n\n\"You'd hate to saddle him with 'you've got to produce these numbers,'\" Chryst said. \"But it all depends on what's happening, how your defense playing, who you're playing against, what you're doing offensively.\n\n\"And yet, he's managed to continue to impact (the game) in such a big way,\" he added. \"He's had some tough looks, and he's been consistent.\"\n\nSomehow, Taylor manages to look stronger later in the game. It's partly because of Wisconsin's grinding running attack, with a big, physical offensive line that can wear down opponents. Even in a triple overtime, when everyone is tired.\n\n\"You have to be mentally tough to fight through things like that,\" Taylor said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 No matter how Maryland fares in the regular season finale against No. 15 Penn State, it won't change the pride that interim coach Matt Canada feels about how his players have performed under extremely difficult circumstances.\n\nThe death of teammate Jordan McNair, two external investigations involving the football program and the dismissal of head coach DJ Durkin combined to make this a season an emotional roller coaster for the Terrapins.\n\n\"I'm certainly proud of everything our players have done, from how they've stuck together, how they've grieved together, how they've leaned on each other,\" Canada said Tuesday. \"As a staff, we're very, very proud of that.\"\n\nThe Terrapins (5-6, 3-5 Big Ten) aren't done yet. After trying for three straight weeks to become bowl eligible with their sixth win of the season, Maryland has one last chance to get it right Saturday against the Nittany Lions (8-3, 5-3).\n\n\"I'm proud regardless, but we need to win,\" Canada said.\n\nMcNair collapsed on the practice field in May and died of heatstroke in June. In August, the school launched investigations into McNair's treatment at scene and the culture of the football program, and also placed Durkin on administrative leave.\n\nWith Canada serving as interim coach and offensive coordinator, the Terrapins opened with an upset of then-No. 23 Texas were 5-3 on Oct. 27 after a 63-24 rout of Illinois.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Durkin was reinstated by University System of Maryland board of regents. The next day, he was fired by University president Wallace Loh.\n\nSince then, Maryland has been in futile pursuit of its sixth win of the season.\n\nThe skid began with a 24-3 loss at home to Michigan State. Then, after rallying from a 31-15 deficit at Indiana, Maryland lost 34-32 on a late field goal. That wasn't nearly as heartbreaking as last week's 52-51 overtime defeat against then-No. 9 Ohio State, when Canada boldly called for a 2-point conversion try in overtime that failed on the final play of the game.\n\nNow, Maryland must knock off Penn State to become bowl bound and make this season an unequivocal success.\n\n\"The last time we addressed it was going into Indiana, when the next win would be six,\" Canada said. \"Our players know what six wins means. They certainly laid it out there the last two weeks and had two very emotional, tough losses. They know where they're at. They know how important this game is.\"\n\nPlaying brilliantly in defeat against Ohio State might have been a moral victory, but those don't count toward bowl eligibility.\n\n\"The players weren't satisfied with being close. They wanted to win the game,\" Canada said. \"So there's nothing to take from it other than we didn't win the football game.\"\n\nBarring a victory at Penn State, this will be Canada's final game as interim coach. He could end up being Maryland's new head coach or retain his post as offensive coordinator \u2014 or neither.\n\nHe's not going to think about that, not with one big regular-season game left on the schedule.\n\n\"The last two weeks I wish we'd have won. I wish the kids would have had that success,\" Canada said. \"Obviously Saturday, my only focus will be to win the game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So yes, I do lay it at their feet.\"\n\nZinke didn't specify which environmental groups he held responsible, saying their identities can be discerned by noticing the name of the plaintiffs in those lawsuits.\n\nHis comments elicited a strong rebuke from environmental advocates, including Athan Manuel, lands protection director for the Sierra Club.\n\n\"Perhaps it\u2019s the numerous investigations, the potential criminal charges eating at him, or the fact that he still doesn\u2019t even know what department the forest service is under, but Ryan Zinke would best be served by focusing on the people rather than making disgusting and dangerous accusations,\" Manuel said in a statement.\n\nLast week, Zinke visited the Northern California site of the Camp Fire, which has killed at least 79 people. Days after the fire began burning, President Donald Trump tweeted a threat to withhold federal payments to California, accusing the state of \"poor\" forest management.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, a frequent critic of Trump and Zinke, has muted his criticism of the administration. Brown has instead focused on points of agreement and said he was encouraged by Trump's more recent pledge to provide funds to the state.\n\nThe National Fire Interagency Center estimated the cost to fight the Camp Fire alone at $82.2 million \u2013 and rising.\n\nMore: Rain forecast will offer relief \u2013 and bring more problems\n\nMore: 'How do you grieve for a whole town?'

USA TODAY\n\nAlmost 700 people remain unaccounted for, although authorities say many survivors don't even know they are on the list.

The silver lining: The fire was 70 percent contained.\n\nBut while heavy rains forecast for the next few days are expected to help tamp down the flames, authorities fear ash flows and mudslides could make movement in the area treacherous. It could also wash away the charred remains of the fire's victims even as searchers pick through the debris.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning for the area.\n\n\"Firefighters continue to strengthen and improve containment lines while also holding direct fire lines,\" Cal Fire said. \"Search and Rescue crews continue to assist the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office in the search and recovery operations for missing victims.\"\n\nContributing: Jim Schultz and Damon Arthur, Redding Record Searchlight\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/20/camp-fire-zinke-blames-radical-environmentalists-raging-fires/2067497002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Surging No. 7 Washington State eyes Pac-12 North title", "description": "No. 7 Washington State has posted the best record in the Pac-12 Conference and now has a chance to make program history", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/20/surging-no-7-washington-state-eyes-pac-12-north-title/38574125/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0cf7ff39e32dcaf8952d604f530dabdb70789026/c=0-362-4848-3089/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/95591a71a4664fada9a6c49719c39355.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:39:35Z", "content": "Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew looks to pass the ball against Colorado in the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Boulder, Colo.

Washington State won 31-7. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPULLMAN, Wash. (AP) \u2014 A year that began in tragedy for Washington State is wrapping up with the Cougars on the brink of unparalleled success.\n\nPlayers began spring workouts with heavy hearts after the January suicide of quarterback Tyler Hilinski. The offseason departure of six assistant coaches and head coach Mike Leach's flirtation with the Tennessee job then contributed to the outside perception that little should be expected of the Cougars this year. They were picked to finish fifth in the Pac-12 North.\n\n\"Everyone was projecting us to go 3-9,\" freshman running back Max Borghi said.\n\nThe picture today is so much different. Washington State (10-1, 7-1 Pac-12) will play No. 16 Washington (8-3, 6-2) on Friday in the Apple Cup. A victory would give the seventh-ranked Cougars their first Pac-12 North title and set a program record for wins in a season. It would also keep alive talk of Washington State's longshot bid for the College Football Playoff, however unlikely that may be.\n\nLeach said the team's secret weapon may be how much everyone is enjoying themselves.\n\n\"In the locker room, everybody's really having a good time,\" Leach said. \"This is a very tight team. I think that's helped us to play well.\"\n\nHaving perhaps the best time is quarterback Gardner Minshew, the graduate transfer from East Carolina who became a star in his first and only season for the Cougars. Minshew has captured the imagination of fans with stellar play, as well as his facial hair. Minshew is nicknamed the Mississippi Mustache and it has become a thing among Cougars fans to post a selfie while sporting a fake mustache.\n\nAfter one recent game, Minshew sneaked up behind Leach as the coach was conducting a television interview and slapped a fake mustache on his upper lip.\n\n\"I was the victim of a cruel joke,\" Leach said later.\n\nMinshew has become one of the faces of college football this season, mobbed by fans, pursued by reporters, pushed as a Heisman Trophy candidate.\n\nAll the success comes from working as a team, he said.\n\n\"Man, this team has just come together so well,\" Minshew said. \"We believe that we are going to win every game. I think that belief goes a long, long way.\"\n\nLeach also is having a ball in his seventh season at Washington State. He's often relaxed when meeting the media, happy to answer offbeat questions.\n\nAsked who would win a mythical fight among all 12 conference coaches, he opined Utah's Kyle Whittingham and Arizona State's Herm Edwards because: \"They work out.\"\n\nAsked what bands he would like to see at a Woodstock-style festival in Pullman, he said The Doors, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Jimmy Buffett, then added 10 more.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nOf course, what's really fun is winning.\n\nThe Cougars won their first three games then stumbled at Southern California, losing a close game when they missed a tying field goal in the closing two minutes. They have since won seven straight.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Leach is confident of victory each week.\n\n\"On Sunday, I'm not sure we can beat Pullman Junior High,\" Leach said recently. \"On Thursday, I think we can beat an all-star team and the Eagles and the Patriots, you know.\"\n\n\"This is not a business for rational people,\" Leach said.\n\nIt's been a long road to get to this point. In January, the team was mourning the suicide of Hilinski, who was expected to start at quarterback in place of the graduated Luke Falk.\n\nPlayers still hold his memory close.\n\n\"I know Tyler was with us every single game,\" running back James Williams said. \"He is going to continue to be with us.\"\n\nLeach said Hilinski's death was hard on everyone. \"We went through a lot of adversity, obviously, with Tyler's passing, which everybody misses him,\" Leach said.\n\nWith Hilinski gone, Leach knew he needed an experienced quarterback to run his offense.\n\nThat led him to Minshew, a part-time starter at East Carolina who was planning to ride the bench at Alabama this season in preparation for the start of a coaching career. Leach called and asked if Minshew would prefer to lead the nation in passing.\n\nMinshew said yes and showed up on campus in May.\n\nHe now leads the nation in passing yards with 4,325, and has thrown for 36 touchdowns against just seven interceptions.\n\nAs a result, the Cougars have launched a Heisman campaign for Minshew, sending voters a fake mustache.\n\nLeach thinks Minshew should get strong consideration.\n\n\"What it used to be was who has got the biggest impact on their specific team,\" Leach said. \"I would love to hear the guy that, you know, outshines Gardner with regard to that.\"\n\nWashington State at this point is the Pac-12's only chance to make the four-team playoff field. But even if the Cougars beat Washington and win the conference championship game, they might very well fall short. Not that it would make the season any less remarkable for Washington State.\n\n\"Watching how we came together in camp,\" Minshew said. \"I had no doubts we could do something special.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nAmazon is reportedly among several bidders seeking to land the YES Network, which broadcasts New York Yankee games, and another 21 regional sports networks on the selling block.\n\nSuch an acquisition would expand the video holdings of Amazon, which already has about 88.7 million Prime Video viewers in the U.S., behind only YouTube (192 million) and Netflix (147.5 million), according to research firm eMarketer.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. got the 22 networks among the Twenty-First Century Fox assets it acquired in July for $71.3 billion. The Justice Department has approved the deal contingent on Disney divesting the regional sports networks.\n\nAmazon and several other companies including Sinclair Broadcast Group, Tegna and private equity firms KKR and The Blackstone Group, are among those bidding for the stations, CNBC reported Tuesday, citing persons familiar with the situation. The Yankees are also bidding for the YES Network, which may be sold separately, according to CNBC, which did not learn the amount of the bids.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on CNBC's report.\n\nMore: YouTube quietly adds 100 ad-supported movies for free viewing\n\nMore: How much have younger viewers bailed on traditional TV? New stats are alarming\n\nThe Justice Department expressed concerns about lost competition should Disney, which owns ESPN and several other networks such as the SEC Network, also have those additional sports networks. The networks are spread across the U.S. including Fox Sports West/Prime Ticket (UCLA, USC, Los Angeles Chargers, Los Angeles Clippers) and Fox Sports Ohio/SportsTime Ohio (Cleveland Cavaliers, Cincinnati Reds, Ohio State University).\n\nThis wouldn't be Amazon's first sports move. It is in its second season of streaming Thursday Night Football games on Amazon Prime Video, which costs $119 annually for streaming video and audio, as well as free two-day shipping and other perks. The games are also streamed on Twitch, the video game-centric streaming service Amazon acquired for $1 billion four years ago.\n\nAdding more live sports could bring newcomers to Amazon Prime and create a new revenue stream for Amazon. \"The content clearly has value beyond just adding it for free as part of a Prime subscription, and theoretically, cable TV systems have renewal rights, so I presume Amazon intends to add (regional sports) streaming as a free feature as part of Prime and will retain existing retransmission fees from (other pay-TV providers),\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n\nFox, which is refocusing on news and sports after its asset sale to Disney, could also offer a bid for the stations during the second round of bidding, expected before the end of the year, CNBC reported.\n\nIn addition to the regional sports networks, Disney acquired Fox's television and film studios, cable channels such as FX and National Geographic, and other assets including Fox's 30 percent share of streaming service Hulu.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/20/amazon-reportedly-among-bidders-yes-network-other-sports-networks/2068398002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Jenrry Mejia released by Mets after 3 drug suspensions", "description": "Pitcher Jenrry Mejia released by New York Mets after serving 3 drug suspensions", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/11/20/jenrry-mejia-released-by-mets-after-3-drug-suspensions/38573797/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7304fc48aa0b5f9e15de1f5830cd940646478460/c=0-182-3500-2151/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/7dfea9f8b67a44818ba261963d3e6384.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:37:27Z", "content": "FILE - In this March 11, 2016, file photo, Jenrry Mejia addresses a news conference at the office of his attorney in the Queens borough of New York.

At the time, he maintained, \"I can honestly say I have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system.\"\n\nMejia returned on July 12, appeared in seven games for New York, then was banned for 162 games on July 28 after a positive test for Stanozolol and Boldenone. The third suspension was for a positive test for Boldenone, an anabolic steroid generally used by veterinarians on horses.\n\nMejia is 9-14 with a 3.68 ERA in 18 starts and 95 relief appearances. In addition to random drug tests, he is subject annually to six additional urine tests and three additional blood tests.\n\nHe has four years, 140 days of major league service and would have been eligible for salary arbitration. The Mets could have tried to cut his salary to $1,383,200 had he remained on the roster.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

William McRaven's assertion that the president's attacks on the news media constitute \"the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\" The president dismissed McRaven's concerns on the grounds that he was a \"Hillary fan\" and an \"Obama backer,\" referring to his 2016 opponent and his White House predecessor.\n\n\"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace mentioned that the former Navy SEAL led the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. Trump went into a discussion about how the al-Qaida leader should have been found much sooner.\n\n\"Wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\" Trump said.\n\nHis remarks prompted swift condemnation and refutation from across the American military and intelligence communities.\n\nMcRaven repeats: Trump's media attacks 'greatest threat to our democracy'\n\n\"The mission to get bin Laden was bipartisan. We all wanted to get him as soon as we could,\" Robert O'Neil, the Navy SEAL who is believed to have fired the shot that killed bin Laden, said in a tweet Monday.\n\nO'Neil said McRaven has been \"born to lead\" the mission that killed bin Laden. \"I'll follow him anywhere,\" he said.\n\nThe mission to get bin Laden was bipartisan. We all wanted to get him as soon as we could. \u2014 Robert J. O'Neill (@mchooyah) November 19, 2018\n\n\"This is disgusting!\" tweeted Frances Townsend, who worked as a counterterrorism adviser for President George W. Bush.

This is disgusting! @POTUS@realDonaldTrump suggests venerated Navy SEAL commander should have found bin Laden faster https://t.co/hZf4pR6ONZ \u2014 Frances Townsend (@FranTownsend) November 19, 2018\n\nLeon Panetta, who was CIA director when bin Laden was killed in the 2011 operation and later served as secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, said Trump owed an apology to McRaven \"and all of the special operation forces and intelligence professionals who planned and executed one of the most important counter-terrorism missions in our nation's history.\"\n\nPanetta explained in a statement that the CIA led the search that eventually found bin Laden at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. McRaven was not involved until Obama ordered him to plan the mission to take down bin Laden, who was dead within 100 days.\n\nPanetta called Trump's criticism \"patently ridiculous\" and said it \"demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of how our military and intelligence agencies operate and undermines the president\u2019s own standing as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nSimilarly, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Trump's comment is \"really a slam at the intelligence community\" and \"reflects, I think, his complete ignorance\" about what was involved in hunting down bin Laden.\n\n\"It took patience and perseverance over a period of years from the intelligence community. Principally, the Central Intelligence Agency,\" Clapper said on CNN. He said Trump's remarks were \"more of an indictment against the intelligence committee, though he may not have realized it, rather than Bill McRaven.\"\n\nMcRaven denied Trump's allegations of political bias in a statement to CNN on Sunday but did not address Trump's criticism of the U.S. military and intelligence communities' efforts to track down the terrorist mastermind.\n\n\"I did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else,\" McRaven said. \"I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for. I admire all presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the Nation together in challenging times.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if Adm.

William McRaven was reportedly on Hillary Clinton's short list for Vice President in 2016,\" the RNC said in a tweet from its official account. \"He's been critical of @realDonaldTrump \u2013 even dating back to the 2016 campaign.\"\n\n\"He's hardly a non-political figure,\" the tweet said.\n\nWorth noting after recent comments: Retired Adm.

And in 2012, he once introduced then-Secretary of State Clinton at an event as \"without a doubt one of the finest public servants ever to serve this great nation.\"\n\nBut he never endorsed any candidate in the 2016 election.\n\nThe RNC was correct that he has been a sharp critic of Trump. He first said the president's attacks on the press were a threat to democracy in February 2017. The former U.S. Special Operations commander also slammed the president in a scathing letter published in The Washington Post in August for revoking former CIA director John Brennan's security clearance.\n\nBut Post columnist Karen Tumulty pointed out in a reply to the RNC tweet that it was also \"worth noting\" that McRaven was \"on Trump\u2019s short list for national security adviser.\"\n\nWorth noting: retired Adm.

John McCain a war hero because he \"got captured.\"\n\nThe president recently was criticized for not attending a ceremony at a cemetery to honor fallen World War I soldiers during a trip to Paris and for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day last week.\n\nIn his interview with Wallace, Trump said \"in retrospect I should have\" gone to Arlington, but he explained he was \"extremely busy on calls for the country.\"\n\n\"We did a lot of calling,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has yet to visit American troops in combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, although he told Fox News such a visit is \"being planned.\" He did not give specifics for \"security reasons.\"\n\nIn a report Monday, The Washington Post cited an unnamed former senior White House official who said Trump has \"never been interested in going\" to visit troops in a combat zone. \"He\u2019s afraid of those situations. He\u2019s afraid people want to kill him,\" the official said.\n\nAnd the president's deployment of 5,000 troops to the southern border has been derided as a political stunt meant to energize the Republican base ahead of the 2018 midterm election more than protect the nation from a caravan of Central American migrants fleeing their home countries.\n\nThe least noble among us, @realDonaldTrump, announces our 5000 troops serving as political props on our southern border will be home for Christmas.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nA glimpse at the statistics gives the impression that Mississippi's offense has been a dominant force this season.\n\nA deeper look shows that's not necessarily the case.\n\nIt's true that Ole Miss is averaging nearly 37 points and 540 yards per game this season, which both rank among the best in the Southeastern Conference. But those numbers take a dive in conference games: The Rebels are scoring just 24.7 points per game against seven league foes.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the Ole Miss offense bogs down once it gets into the red zone. The Rebels have scored just 13 touchdowns in 33 trips inside the 20-yard line in SEC play, settling for a league-high 15 field goals.\n\n\"We've got a lot of confidence in our offense and moving the football,\" Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said. \"But when we get in the red zone, we've got to make plays.\"\n\nThe inability to score touchdowns instead of field goals is a huge reason why Ole Miss is in the midst of a four-game losing streak. The Rebels have been competitive in all those games, including last weekend's 36-29 loss in overtime to Vanderbilt .\n\nThe loss to the Commodores was a perfect microcosm of the red-zone issues. Ole Miss scored just one touchdown in seven trips inside Vanderbilt's 20-yard line, settling for five field goals. The Rebels gained 578 yards of total offense \u2014 including a career-high 457 yards passing from Jordan Ta'amu \u2014 and somehow scored less than 30 points in a game that included overtime.\n\nOle Miss (5-6, 1-6 SEC) has one more chance to fix the red zone issues when it hosts No. 22 Mississippi State (7-4, 3-4) on Thursday in the Egg Bowl. It will be the last game of the Rebels' season no matter what happens: The program is ineligible for postseason play for a second straight season because of NCAA sanctions.\n\nLuke has remained optimistic about the offense, even while acknowledging the Rebels aren't capitalizing on having some of the league's best playmakers, including Ta'amu and receiver A.J. Brown.\n\nTa'amu is throwing for an SEC-best 348 yards per game. Brown has an SEC-best 1,259 yards receiving.\n\n\"The good news is you're getting down there a bunch with opportunities to score and this game we've got to go finish the fourth quarter,\" Luke said. \"There's no better time to do that than the Egg Bowl.\"\n\nOle Miss will be trying to score more touchdowns against a Mississippi State defense that's been among the best in the SEC and the country. The Bulldogs are giving up just 12.8 points per game and have allowed only 12 touchdowns all season, which is the fewest in the league by a wide margin.\n\nEven so, Mississippi State's first-year coach Joe Moorhead is worried about the Rebels' ability to make big plays.\n\n\"They have thrown for 300 yards in nine of eleven games and certainly watching the Vanderbilt game, they are able to throw it around pretty good,\" Moorhead said. \"The scheme lends to that, the play calling and the talent level they have helps.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Two years later, the Gamecocks believe the gap with their highly ranked rival is closing.\n\nIn 2016, overmatched South Carolina did about everything wrong and left Death Valley on the bad end of a 56-7 beatdown, one of the most lopsided losses in Palmetto State rivalry history .\n\n\"It was embarrassing,\" linebacker T.J. Brunson said Tuesday.\n\nSouth Carolina (6-4) gets a shot for redemption at No. 2 Clemson (11-0), hoping two years of building have gotten them closer to one of the country's most dominant programs.\n\nThe Gamecocks have lost four in a row to their rival . Another loss would mark the most defeats in a row to Clemson since the Gamecocks lost seven consecutive games from 1934 to 1940.\n\nBut South Carolina's offense, which sits sixth in the Southeastern Conference in offense (429 yards per game) and points (32.8), is clicking better the past month than it has all season. The Gamecocks have averaged almost 43 points in its past three games and feel primed to go against a Clemson defense that leads the Football Bowl Subdivision in fewest points allowed per game at 12.1.\n\n\"I think it's always important to start fast and try and get points on the board, no matter who you're playing,\" South Carolina tailback A.J. Turner said.\n\nThat wasn't the case at Clemson two years ago.\n\nThe Tigers led 21-0 after the first quarter and never slowed down. They finished with their largest margin of victory in the rivalry since winning 51-0 in 1900.\n\n\"We're in a really good mindset right now and we're really locked in,\" Bentley said.\n\nClemson was a veteran squad that had won the Atlantic Coast Conference title and played in the College Football Playoff the year before. The Tigers were led by some of the country's best players in quarterback Deshaun Watson and receiver Mike Williams.\n\nSouth Carolina was in its first year with coach Will Muschamp with new faces, like freshman quarterback Bentley, still finding their footing.\n\n\"Everyone knows what happened,\" Bentley said. \"We didn't play well.\"\n\nMuschamp angrily said afterward that he'd never again coach a team where some players \"flat out quit.\" And the coach believes his Gamecocks will be more competitive this time.\n\n\"We're much better now than we were then,\" Muschamp said.\n\nBentley will face a defensive front likely to see all four starters drafted high by NFL teams next spring. Tiger defensive ends Clelin Ferrell and Austin Bryant and tackles Christian Wilkins and Dexter Lawrence have combined for 18 sacks and 38.5 tackles behind the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"We're in a really good mindset right now and we're really locked in,\" Bentley said.\n\nBentley understands he'll have to block out those reputations, along with the noise for close to 82,000 at Memorial Stadium, and perform with poise and composure.\n\n\"It's an awesome atmosphere and it's going to be fun to play,\" Bentley said.\n\nClemson has plenty at stake in this one. They'll try and go 12-0 for just the third time in school history, following the 1981 national championship team and the 2015 Tigers that reached the CFP title game at 14-0 before falling to Alabama.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney isn't concerned with dominating the Gamecocks. \"I'll just be happy that we won the game,\" he said. \"I'm all about what's in front of us and what's after that.\"\n\nSouth Carolina players understand their legacy could change dramatically with a stunning upset on Saturday.\n\n\"You're going to be forever remember at this university,\" Gamecocks receiver Bryan Edwards says, \"for how many times you beat Clemson.\"\n\nSouth Carolina would like to add a very big one to the tally this week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The president's daughter routinely conducted government business from her personal email in violation of federal rules, according to The Washington Post. All the while chants of \"lock her up\" still reverberate at President Donald Trump's rallies, even after he made Hillary Clinton's email use a central issue of his 2016 campaign. Just last week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would further investigate the FBI's handling of Clinton's emails if he chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee next year.\n\nTrump \u2014 whose official title is adviser to the president \u2014 joins a list of several White House officials who used personal email to discuss government business, including her husband, Jared Kushner, and the president's former chief of staff, Reince Priebus.\n\nTrump's emails number in the hundreds. She used a personal email even after pledging to comply with all ethics rules. According to a former senior government official, \"she was the worst offender in the White House.\"\n\nThere are several lessons from this latest scandal already. More will follow.\n\nTalker: Trump had busy weekend. After all, someone has to keep people in place\n\nTransparency must be paired with oversight to hold power accountable. Although Trump shut down her fashion brand this summer, there are still questions about conflicts of interest. Earlier this month, China granted the presidential adviser approval for more than a dozen new trademarks, from clothing items to voting machines. Did she use her email to mix government with making a profit?\n\nFreedom of information laws must be strengthened. Open records requests and subsequent litigation by a nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, triggered the news about Ivanka Trump. The public has a right to know how government makes decisions and whether it is upholding the public interest. Pending legislation would require all federal agencies to put completed Freedom of Information Act requests online. Agency offices that process FOIA requests should be better resourced (including in technology and staffing) to fulfill requests in a timely manner.\n\nCybersecurity must be a paramount concern. According to The Post, Ivanka Trump's emails were \"prescreened by the Trump Organization for security problems\" and then stored by Microsoft. This exposes vulnerabilities that should be investigated, especially because the president has refused to divest from the Trump Organization.\n\nAmericans can agree that public officials should follow the same high ethical standards rather than play by their own set of rules. Transparency and oversight are important to ensure that government is responsive to the people who elect it. They lead to accountability, better policies and a stronger democracy.\n\nStephen Spaulding, an attorney, is chief of strategy at Common Cause.

The use of a personal email has proved to be a very bad thing for Ivanka Trump, given that her dad is the first one to complain about anyone doing this.\n\nHow does President Donald Trump's use of his iPhone and Ivanka's use a personal email get a free pass when Hillary Clinton didn't?\n\n\u2014 Bryan Gooden\n\nUnlike Clinton, lovely Ivanka is likely not privy to high-level, national security matters and classified information only a secretary of State would get. There's a big difference between Ivanka and Hillary.\n\n\u2014 Kabul Bulan\n\nI think Republicans are about to gain a whole new appreciation for former FBI Director James Comey's point that \"intent\" was a necessary \u2014 and missing \u2014 element of the charges being considered against Clinton's usage of a private email server.\n\n\u2014 Robert Earle\n\nHow many top secret documents did Ivanka email? Does she have her own private server at home? If she checks those boxes, history shows she can't be prosecuted.\n\n\u2014 Mike Herman\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nPeter Mirijanian, spokesman for Ivanka Trump's lawyer, statement: \"To address misinformation being peddled about Ivanka Trump\u2019s personal email, she did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"\n\nTimothy L. O'Brien, Bloomberg: \"Even with such close scrutiny, Trump has managed to steer clear of any meaningful entanglements in her brief White House career. With a possible email scandal brewing, however, that may be about change \u2014 especially if incoming Democrats in the House of Representatives decide it\u2019s time to exercise their oversight responsibilities in the new year and remind the first daughter about the importance of rules.\"\n\nRick Santorum, CNN: \"To sort of ignore the obvious differences is, I think, a little hypocritical. Hillary Clinton went out and established her own (email) server, in full knowledge that what she was doing was wrong, number one. Number two, this was a political person who had political aspirations who was doing things in her own interest as a political figure, as opposed to Ivanka, who is not a political figure, she is the daughter of the president. She was not the secretary of State, dealing with a variety of very sensitive and classified information. ...

Rams outside linebacker Samson Ebukam (not shown) recovered the fumble and scored a touchdown on the play. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Big 12 conference has come to the NFL.\n\nWithout a doubt, the Monday-night scoring extravaganza between the Rams and Chiefs was entertaining. It had more spectacular plays and head-spinning twists than a game of Madden or a matchup of teams from college football's defense-challenged conference.\n\nAs for it being a pro football classic, no way.\n\nAnd for those yearning to see a rematch in the Super Bowl, don't count on it \u2014 unless each team finds a consistent defense.\n\nYeah, we know, there were several big defensive plays that produced points in Los Angeles' 54-51 victory, the highest-scoring Monday night contest ever and the only time two teams have each exceeded 50 points in the same game. Aaron Donald might have cemented a second straight NFL Defensive Player of the Year award with his strip-sacks of Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThere were three picks, though two came when Mahomes was in desperation mode. There were four lost fumbles as each defensive line made its present felt \u2014 for a few seconds.\n\nThe box score looks as long as one of Andy Reid's play sheets.\n\nWhat America saw was Madden 19 at its most frenetic. And that's exactly what much of the current sporting public covets. Give them receivers running free like deer in a meadow ; light shows of points on the scoreboard; announcers fawning over the action while ignoring the quality of performance; and offensive records galore.\n\nThis was a home run derby with major league sluggers in a Little League park. It was a hockey shootout with NHL skaters facing amateur goalies. A dunk contest on 9-foot rims.\n\nFantastic fun? For sure.\n\nBut it can also be seen as an indictment of how the NFL \u2014 helped along by college football's evolution \u2014 has headed toward flag football.\n\nHow did we get to a point where the third-highest scoring game in NFL history, chock full of flying flags (21 accepted penalties for 195 yards), terrible coverage and some overzealous coaching is labeled a masterpiece?\n\n\"A couple of things are contributing,\" says Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy, now an analyst for NBC. \"The skills of the players on offense and the way the coaches are designing things is one. And the practice schedule that has been reduced really favors the offense now.\n\n\"You can't do as much work in the offseason and at training camp, and that hurts the defenses. Quarterbacks take their groups and they can get together and throw and work on their timing for two or three weeks. Defenses can't do that, so they are behind the eight ball from the outset.\"\n\nAnd the rules and officials have evolved to favor receivers and quarterbacks.\n\nIt comes to fruition weekly. Consider that the NFL has had the most points scored (7,791), most touchdowns (895) and most touchdown passes (570) through 11 weeks in its history. The 54-51 frenzy is the punctuation mark.\n\nAt least so far.\n\nDungy and his NBC studio partner, former safety Rodney Harrison, bemoan the lack of fundamentals on defense. We saw as many examples of that on Monday night as we did tight spirals from Mahomes and Rams quarterback Jared Goff.\n\n\"A lot of coaches in general go over scheme so much and designing things and how you play your responsibility and all the things offensive teams can do,\" Dungy says. \"We have lost sight of the basics, you see the poor fundamentals.\"\n\nAdds Harrison, one of the best tacklers and cover guys at his position:\n\n\"One thing I have learned weekly and has become a lot more prevalent because of all the emphasis on the changing of the rules is that they don't teach a lot of technique in college anymore. It's all about a scheme and all these different formations and you try to trick people and do all this misdirection. Coaches spend so much time on plays they forget about teaching technique.\n\n\"Cornerback don't have technique, they panic when they are down the field. The ball is in the air, they don't look back, can't make a play.\"\n\nIt was something we saw plenty of Monday night. Of course, receivers such as Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods can make any defenders look bad. But when skill players are uncovered so often, it makes you wonder if the offense is on a power play.\n\n\"As old school guys, we appreciate and we respect defense,\" Harrison adds. \"I said something (Sunday) night: If I was a general manager, I would never hire a defensive-minded coach as a head coach. The league is about scoring points and developing young quarterbacks; see Andy Reid and the Chiefs, Sean McVay and the Rams, Matt Nagy and the Bears. You have these coordinators that have a very creative mind for offense. But look at their defenses, they don't have great defenses.\n\n\"The league has really changed.\"\n\n54-51 bears witness to that. With more likely to come.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Just bring a water bottle, and ask the flight attendants to refill it\u2014they are always more than happy to.\n\nThis is where our favorite water bottle, the Hydro Flask, comes in. It comes in multiple shapes and sizes, and keeps cold drinks cold for 24 hours and hot drinks hot for 12 hours\u2014it's a great gift for the fitness-lover in your life, too.\n\n3. A portable charger because without your smartphone, you\u2019re basically stranded\n\nPortable charger (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThe lower the phone battery level, the higher the anxiety. But luckily for you, we\u2019ve tested several portable chargers and found that the RavPower Turbo Series 20100mAh is the best battery pack for your money.\n\nThe RavPower battery pack won our Editors\u2019 Choice award for its high charging capacity at a low price\u2014it can charge a smartphone several times over before needing a juice refill of its own.

And while you\u2019re at it... a long phone charger\n\nCharging cord (Photo: Amazon)\n\nAfter testing the best lightning cables on the market our team found that the best charging cord you can buy is the 6-foot AmazonBasics Nylon Braided lightning cable\u2014which is incredible because it only costs $13. The braided cable is sturdy, and will keep the cord from developing the \u201cdeadly double chins\u201d that most Apple chargers get because of their rubber casing. This cord is perfect for travelers because it is long, built to last, and charges your phone without any hiccups.\n\nGet the 6-foot AmazonBasics lightning cable on Amazon for $13\n\n5. A pair of comfy compression socks to prevent bloated cankles\n\nCompression socks (Photo: Amazon)\n\nI usually wear fuzzy socks on a quick flight for comfort, but for long days of travel where my butt is planted to a seat most of the day, I wear compression socks. Wearing compression socks on a flight is a great idea to increase circulation and reduce the risk of swelling.\n\nYeah, I know: Compression socks aren\u2019t necessarily the most beautiful things in the world, but they\u2019re important and can easily be tucked under a pair of long pants (seriously, who wears shorts on an airplane anyway?! That\u2019s gross). Just think of them as an inexpensive way to fight cankles.\n\nGet compression socks on Amazon starting at $8\n\n6. A Nintendo switch to distract you (or your kids) from a crappy flight\n\nBest gifts for kids of 2018: Nintendo Switch (Photo: Daily Express)\n\nEveryone in our office is obsessed with the Nintendo Switch. I don\u2019t currently own one yet, but the Switch is on my list because of its small size and incredible gaming capacity. It's also a fantastic gift for kids, since it can distract them during turbulence and flight delays.\n\nOne of our editors recently traveled with her Nintendo Switch, saying, \u201cIt saved me. We flew Spirit, which, if you've ever used that airline, you know how lackluster the experience can be. But, my boyfriend and I pulled out our Switch and played Mario Kart to pass the time together. Once I got tired of winning, he was able to dive into Zelda while I read.\u201d Oh, and by the way, Chrissy Teigen loves her Switch too.\n\nGet the Nintendo Switch on Amazon for $300\n\n7. Candies that help ease motion sickness\n\nSickness relief (Photo: Amazon)\n\nI have a pretty pathetic excuse for an equilibrium, which means traveling by air, sea, and sometimes even land can make me dizzy and sick to my stomach. I usually take over-the-counter medication when flying, but sometimes I need a second line of defense\u2014and that\u2019s why I turn to motion sickness candies.\n\nI also tuck a pair of Sea-Bands into my pocket to wear on a flight or bumpy bus ride. They may not work for everybody, but I swear they are what saved me on a rough bus tour through the hilly roads of Ireland. Others begged for a pit stop due to nausea, but I actually felt fine for once! Wear them on the pressure points around your wrists for relief.\n\nMore: The 25 best gifts for travelers of 2018\n\n8. The best Kindle E-reader to catch up on your favorite books\n\nKindle (Photo: Amazon)\n\nWhen traveling, you need to save space, so why would you pack three bulky books when you could pack 1,000 in a thin gadget? Our favorite Kindle is the new Paperwhite as your best travel companion. Whether the lights are on or off, you\u2019ll still be able to read with ease. With its 300 pixels-per-inch touchscreen display, adjustable backlight, and excellent battery life, it has the best bang for your buck.

A package of facial cleansing wipes to use on everything\n\nMicellar water (Photo: Instagram)\n\nUse them on your face, use them on your hands, use them on your phone, use them EVERYWHERE. These micellar cleansing wipes from Simple are my favorite, because they are gentle on my ridiculously sensitive skin while still getting the job done.\n\nGet a 2-pack of Simple wipes on Amazon for $10\n\n10. A reliable face and hand cream that\u2019s as thick as oatmeal\n\nBest beauty gifts 2018 (Photo: Dermstore)\n\nPressurized cabins make for heinously dry skin, which is why I always bring a travel sized bottle of my favorite, thick lotion. I sometimes even bring a lotion that has essential oils in it, so I can score a bit of aromatherapy while crammed in a stale cabin.\n\nI have dry skin to begin with (darn you, eczema!), so I always turn to First Aid Beauty skin products. You can buy their products on Dermstore, but for the holiday season, FAB is offering a ton of great beauty gifts.\n\nGet First Aid Beauty FAB Beautique set at Dermstore for $48\n\n11. A neck pillow because getting good rest is worth looking goofy\n\nNeck pillow (Photo: Amazon)\n\nOkay...I know. Neck pillows take up so much space and look ridiculous. But what if you could use a top-rated neck pillow that looks more like a scarf and takes up less room in your luggage? Allegedly, this scarf neck pillow can convert anyone into a bonafide plane sleeper. Getting good rest is worth looking like a goofball, but with this neck wrap, you no longer will.\n\nAround the holidays, we suggested the Ostrich pillow as a gag gift for those who love to travel which I wouldn\u2019t say is a necessity, but certainly a hilarious (and actually functional!) choice of travel pillow for those who are always looking to bury their head in the sand.\n\n12. Travel sized hand sanitizer because everything is gross\n\nPurell Hand Sanitizer (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHonestly, I practically bathe in this stuff when traveling. What can I say?!

These tiny cocktail kits were all over the place this holiday season\u2014and they are just about the classiest things I\u2019ve ever seen. Personally, I am having a tough time deciding between the Moscow mule and the Champagne kit. Maybe I\u2019ll just get both.\n\nGet The Cocktail Box Co. Old Fashioned Kit on Amazon for $24\n\n14. A useful weekender bag to skirt checked-bag fees\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Timbuk2 and Sole Society overnighters (Photo: Sole Society/Timbuk2)\n\nNothing is more frustrating than getting smacked with surprise carry-on fees at the airport, but a weekender bag which is the perfect size for a short trip and fits under small plane seats. The best under-seat luggage you can buy is this Timbuk2 bag with tons of zippered compartments and enough room for a laptop, snacks, and iPad, plus a 22-liter interior main compartment for clothing and toiletries.\n\nThis Sole Society bag is trendy, reasonably priced, and made with vegan leather. The best part? Both of these bags fit the dimensions for a personal item.\n\n15. Tile Trackers for peace of mind\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Tile tracker (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThere's nothing worse than the sinking feeling of losing your wallet, purse, or phone\u2014especially an already-hectic travel days, or in a bustling airport as you're about to board your flight. That's why we love the Tile, a small tracking device that you can attach to your most important\u2014or most often forgotten\u2014personal items (think: keys, wallet, purse, luggage, laptop bike, etc.)\n\nYou can use an app on your phone to track your Tiles\u2014but you can also use the Tile to track your phone if (read: when) you lose it. One main user gripe has been that its battery life gives out after a year\u2014but luckily, Tile just released replaceable batteries for these little life savers.\n\nGet four Tile trackers on Amazon for $60\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/20/15-things-you-need-survive-holiday-travel/2067081002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Blues have no timeline for hiring coach after Yeo's exit", "description": "Blues to cast wide net in coaching search, but it's Craig Berube's job for now", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/11/20/blues-have-no-timeline-for-hiring-coach-after-yeos-exit/38573509/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f607a2003244c5c672559a471f4c132663f02c5/c=0-172-4896-2926/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/a4b4e78af9314cd6aabbce9291c788c3.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:02:31Z", "content": "Craig Berube, left, speaks during a news conference along side St. Louis Blues general manager Doug Armstrong after Berube was named interim head coach of the NHL hockey team Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2018, in St. Louis.

LOUIS (AP) \u2014 The Blues will be casting a wide net in their coaching search.\n\nGeneral manager Doug Armstrong fired Mike Yeo after Monday's 2-0 loss to the Los Angeles Kings. Craig Berube is the interim coach while Armstrong assembles a list of candidates for the permanent job.\n\n\"There's going to be experienced head coaches on that list,\" he said at a news conference Tuesday. \"There's going to be European head coaches on that list. College head coaches on that list. Junior head coaches. We're not going to minimize or limit the scope that we're going to look at.\"\n\nArmstrong also did not rule out former St. Louis coach Joel Quenneville, who was fired recently by Chicago. He added that's unlikely a permanent coach will be hired this season.\n\n\"It's possible. I'm not sure it's probable,\" Armstrong said. \"It's not something that we're going to give updates on. This hockey team's job is to win games and it's my job to support this team.\"\n\nTo that end, Hall of Famer Larry Robinson will assist Berube for three weeks to a month because of the inexperienced assistants. The 67-year-old Robinson won a Stanley Cup while coaching the New Jersey Devils.\n\n\"I think having Larry come in to give Craig someone to talk to who's been there, done that is good for him,\" Armstrong said.\n\nArmstrong fired Yeo about two hours after the team's third shutout loss in four games. It was their fourth loss in five games. The scoreless streak is more than seven periods.\n\nAt 7-9-3, the Blues are last in the Central Division. Their 17 points rank next to last in the NHL, ahead of only Los Angeles.\n\n\"The talk I had with him last night was that we had to make a change,\" Armstrong said. \"I plan to get back to Mike later and thank him and reassure him that he's paying for the sins of myself and the entire organization. It's very unfortunate.\"\n\nThe Blues fell one point short of making the playoffs last season and entered this season with hopes of a deep playoff run. They acquired center Ryan O'Reilly in a trade from Buffalo. Armstrong also signed forwards Tyler Bozak, Patrick Maroon and David Perron.\n\n\"Ultimately, it comes back to our record,\" Armstrong said. \"When he came in, he was able to jell the team and we went on a nice run. We won a playoff round. We had a good feeling about ourselves. That carried over to the next 25 games of the season. Then we hit a rut in December and quite honestly we haven't gotten out of it.\"\n\nBerube, a 52-year-old former player, joined the Blues in June 2017. He coached the team's then-AHL affiliate \u2014 the Chicago Wolves \u2014 to a 44-19-13 record and a division title during the 2016-17 season.\n\nBerube is a midseason replacement for the second time, having succeeded Peter Laviolette with the Flyers three games into the 2013-14 season. In two seasons there, he had a 75-58-28 regular-season record. The Flyers made the playoffs during the 2013-14 season but lost in the first round.\n\n\"Mike's a good friend of mine,\" Berube said. \"I loved working with him and coaching with him. We've got to move forward and get better. That's the plan. We've definitely got to instill some confidence back in this hockey team. It's a good hockey team. We've got good players.\"\n\nWhile offering no definite plans, Berube has some ideas on how to get the team playing better.\n\n\"I don't think it's anything massive. I think it's tweaks here and there,\" Berube said. \"We're going to demand ... and that starts in practice. I'm demanding but I'm fair.\"\n\nYeo joined the Blues after five seasons with Minnesota. The Wild made the playoffs in three of Yeo's four full seasons. He was fired 55 games into 2015-16.\n\nHe was to have replaced Ken Hitchcock following the 2016-17 season, but Armstrong fired Hitchcock. On Tuesday, Hitchcock was appointed coach the Edmonton Oilers after the firing of Todd McLellan, the fourth NHL coaching dismissal this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Dale Gerhard, The Press of Atlantic City, via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Nancy Pelosi wants to be speaker of the House again, and she has five days left to make her case.\n\nAlthough Pelosi said she\u2019s confident she will win her bid, she\u2019s had to shore up support \u2013 even among Democratic groups that have long backed her.\n\nIn recent weeks, she spoke to a room of Hispanic lawmakers, hosted a dinner for new Democratic members and joined African-American lawmakers addressing a conference of black activists.\n\nPelosi, who made history as the first female speaker of the House, faces an open rebellion from a bloc of 16 Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter calling for a change in the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of the party\u2019s leadership. At least one Democrat \u2013 Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 mulled a challenge for the top spot.\n\nLate Tuesday, Fudge announced her support for Pelosi within minutes of the Democratic leader releasing a statement that Fudge would chair a subcommittee focused on elections and voting issues. Voting rights has been one of Fudge's signature issues.\n\nPelosi's fight for the gavel comes on the heels of Democrats picking up at least 37 seats to take control of the House after eight years under Republican rule, and that number could tick up as the remaining undecided races are called. Many of those wins came from more diverse suburban districts that had once supported President Donald Trump.\n\nPelosi courted the mostly liberal members of the Congressional Black Caucus and a group of 48 centrists called the Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\nShe met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Blue Dog Coalition, the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nMore: Group of House Democrats pledges to oppose Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as House Speaker\n\nMore: On her first day of orientation on Capitol Hill, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez protests in Pelosi's office\n\n\"This is the moment to leverage the agenda,\" said Wendy Smooth, associate professor of Women\u2019s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at the Ohio State University. \u201cShe will get a strong message from her caucuses about the ways they would like the agenda shaped. It depends on what she\u2019s promising in these meetings.\"\n\nSmooth said committee assignments and leadership roles are on the table.\n\nThe caucuses, some with varying missions, have lengthy wish lists from more action on climate control to protecting voting rights to immigration changes and changing rules to speed up bipartisan legislation.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, said the meeting was productive and was followed up Monday in a call with Pelosi staffers to discuss the group\u2019s \u201cBreak the Gridlock\u201d package, which aims to encourage bipartisan cooperation. Nine Democrats from the caucus signed a letter calling for Pelosi\u2019s support.\n\nPelosi sent a statement last week backing the package in principle, but Gottheimer said the language wasn't specific enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty clear \u2026 we\u2019re only going to back someone who is going to break the gridlock,\u201d Gottheimer said.\n\nPelosi, who served as speaker from 2007 to 2011, is likely to win the first round of voting Wednesday in the Democratic caucus\u2019 closed-door secret election. She needs only a majority to win the nomination. To become speaker, she will need a majority of the full House \u2013 218 votes \u2013 and has little room to lose a significant bloc of Democrats.\n\nPelosi pledged to make voting rights \u2013 one of the \"unifying issues\" for the Democrats, according to Smooth \u2013 a priority and one of the first measures the House will vote on next session.\n\nIn a nod to one of the most diverse Congresses ever, Pelosi touted a proposal to expand a diversity initiative in the chamber and is discussing a possible panel on climate change.\n\nSupporters point to Pelosi\u2019s legislative experience and ability to corral Democrats on issues and note her big role in the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Many Democrats campaigned on the issue in the midterms.\n\nSome experts said it might not sit well if Pelosi isn't in the top post, especially after a record number of women were elected to the House, many of them Democrats.\n\n\u201cAs all women leaders know, it is never the last fight,\" Smooth said. \"Pelosi is a skilled politician and a skilled woman in politics, so she knows this is only the fight until the next one.\u201d\n\nJack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, said the letter signed by the 16 Democrats \u201ccomplicates things. If all 16 signers hold together and vote against her in the official vote, she\u2019s got a problem.\u201d\n\nPitney said the next speaker must be ready to take on Trump and wrestle with the Republican-controlled Senate led by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cTrump is going to press very hard,\" Pitney said. \u201cMcConnell is a very formidable opponent, and for somebody without any experience, it\u2019s like a touch football player suiting up against the NFL.\"\n\nJeff Van Drew, a newly elected Democrat from New Jersey, said he promised during the campaign he wouldn\u2019t back Pelosi.\n\n\"Not that I have any personal dislike for her or she didn't do a good job in her time,'' said Van Drew, who was among the Democrats who signed the letter. \"But sometimes it's good to have a fresh new face and to have change and go forward with some new ideas.\"\n\nVirginia's Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger, one of the record number of women who will serve in the next Congress, said \"under no circumstances\" would she vote for Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIt is something that came up frequently on the campaign trail, particularly for our middle-of-the-road voters,\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cI think she is an incredibly strong person, I think that she\u2019s done incredibly good things. But also my background is CIA. You never held a job at CIA longer than three years.\u201d\n\nDrew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said she \"remains confident in her support among members and members-elect.\u201d\n\nHe noted that 94 percent of the caucus declined to sign the letter.\n\nSeveral longtime members pledged support, saying Pelosi paid her dues and played a key role in helping Democrats regain control of the House.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s not worried,\u2019\u2019 said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is in line to chair the Finance Committee. \u201cNancy Pelosi said we were going to win. And when people doubted her, she said we\u2019re going to win, and guess what? She was right. Nancy Pelosi said she\u2019s going to be the speaker. I believe Nancy Pelosi is right.\u201d\n\nRep. John Lewis of Georgia, who said he and Pelosi came to Congress around the same time, said many newer members haven\u2019t worked with her and don\u2019t know her as well.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a good leader, and I\u2019m supporting her,\u201d said Lewis, a civil rights icon. \u201cI think we need her leadership, her energy, her strength now more than ever before, and I don\u2019t have any doubt that she would be re-elected as speaker.\u201d\n\nFrom left, Rep.

(Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\nOther Democratic groups are lining up to lobby for issues they want party leaders to support.\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus has made immigration a priority after what Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro called two years of \"unrelenting attacks against the Latino community.\"\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus has put voting rights and criminal justice changes at the top of its agenda.\n\nBeyond meeting with Democratic groups, Pelosi met with Fudge as the Ohioan weighed a run for speaker. Some Democrats publicly backed Fudge.\n\n\u201cCongress needs a new leader. Period,\" Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Marcia Fudge, my first (and arguably best) mentor in Congress will run for the next speaker of the House. I have full faith in her ability to lead our new Congress to its fullest potential.\u201d\n\nSmooth said last week it would have been \u201cextraordinary to see two women vying for the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, Herb Jackson, Cat Hofacker\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker/2065224002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "The perfect holiday gifts for coffee lovers", "description": "If you have a friend or relative you love despite their coffee addiction, show them how much you care this holiday season by giving them one of these gifts any caffeine freak would love to have!

(Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered a full-throated defense of Saudi Arabia and cast doubt on a U.S. intelligence assessment that the kingdom\u2019s crown prince knew about the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\" Trump said in an unusual, eight-paragraph statement laced with exclamation points that opened by declaring, \"The world is a very dangerous place!\"\n\nTrump's statement seemed aimed at ending the debate over how his administration has handled Khashoggi's killing \u2013 and at pre-empting lawmakers in Congress from passing any legislation that would mete out tougher punishment for Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region,\" Trump said.\n\nAs he left Tuesday afternoon for Florida, Trump said abandoning Saudi Arabia \"would be a terrible mistake\u201d and touted the regime's promise to purchase billions of dollars in U.S.-made weapons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d he said. Experts, such as Jonathan Caverley with the Naval War College, said Trump exaggerated possible arms sales deals to the regime.\n\nCritics said Trump\u2019s statement lets the Saudi government off the hook for the brutal killing of an American resident and sends an ominous signal to other dictatorships around the world that they have carte blanche to commit human rights abuses. They slammed the president for questioning the CIA's reported conclusion that Salman ordered Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s habit of siding with murderous foreign dictators over American intelligence professionals is a stain on our democracy that undermines the American ideal,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cCongress must now stand up with bipartisan resolve to condemn the brutal slaying of Jamal Khashoggi and pass legislation to respond to this and other Saudi crimes.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Trump's statement sounded like it was written by \"a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/MQ4JsoQtqk \u2014 Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 20, 2018\n\nCorker and New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the committee, responded by forcing the administration to determine whether the crown prince was responsible for Khashoggi's murder. The senators used a provision in the Magnitsky Act to trigger that assessment.\n\nTrump hinted at the CIA's assessment of Salman's role in Khashoggi's murder, but he highlighted the royal family's denials and its portrayal of Khashoggi as a dangerous Islamist \u2013 a characterization the journalist's family flatly denied.\n\n\"Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an 'enemy of the state' and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that,\" Trump said. \"King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump's decision and said it was in America's national security interests. Pompeo noted that the United States imposed sanctions last week on 17 Saudi individuals in connection with Khashoggi's killing, and he said the country needs Saudi Arabia's support in its campaign to isolate Iran.\n\n\"It\u2019s a mean, nasty world out there,\" Pompeo said when asked about the crown prince, who has come under fire for rounding up dissidents inside the kingdom and conducting a bloody war in Yemen. \"It is the president\u2019s obligation to ensure that we adopt policies that further America\u2019s national security.\"\n\nThe Senate could vote as early as next week on legislation that would force the Trump administration to withdraw all U.S. military support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. It's not clear whether such a measure could pass, but lawmakers are considering a range of other proposals in response to Khashoggi's killing.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Congress should stop U.S. arms sales and other foreign aid to Saudi Arabia and place sanctions on the crown prince.\n\n\"Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and columnist for a U.S. newspaper, was killed by agents of the Saudi government in a Saudi Consulate,\" she said. \"This was a premeditated murder, plain and simple.\"\n\nIn his statement, Trump accused lawmakers who pushed for tougher action of being politically motivated.\n\n\"I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction,\" Trump said, adding that he would consider \"whatever ideas are presented to me\" but only if they protect U.S. security. \"Very simply it is called America First!\"\n\nKhashoggi, a critic of the Saudi regime who fled his home country last year to live in the USA, was killed Oct. 2 inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. He had gone into the diplomatic facility to get documents he needed for his upcoming marriage to a Turkish woman.\n\nTurkish officials said they have evidence that Khashoggi was brutally murdered and dismembered inside the consulate by Saudi operatives. Saudi officials repeatedly denied that Crown Prince Salman had any involvement in Khashoggi's death.\n\nThey have offered shifting accounts of Khashoggi\u2019s fate \u2013 first claiming he left the consulate unharmed, then eventually conceding he was murdered there. Khashoggi\u2019s remains have not been found.\n\nTurkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, told American reporters on Tuesday that his government had not yet determined who ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nOnce a determination has been made, \"Turkey will not hide it ... We will tell,\u201d said Cavusoglu, who was in Washington to meet with Pompeo.\n\nCavusoglu said he spoke with Pompeo about requesting an international investigation but Trump\u2019s secretary of state suggested waiting until both Turkey and Saudi Arabia had completed their separate probes.\n\nCavusoglu said he was not bothered by Trump\u2019s decision not to listen to an audio recording of Khashoggi\u2019s murder \u2013 which the Turkish government shared with U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cIt is very disgusting,\u201d he said of the tape, which he confirmed he had heard. He said one of the Saudi operatives, a forensic expert, appeared to be \u201cenjoying cutting people in pieces.\u201d\n\nContributing: David Jackson\n\nMore: 'Traitor, you will be brought to account!': Parts of Khashoggi tape revealed\n\nMore: President Donald Trump has many ways to penalize Saudi Arabia for Jamal Khashoggi murder\n\nMore: CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/trump-says-u-s-stand-saudis-despite-khashoggi-murder/2065589002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Reviewed.com", "title": "Black Friday 2018: the best robot vacuums deals on Eufy, Shark, iRobot, and more", "description": "Black Friday deals on the most popular robot vacuums", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/20/black-friday-2018-deals-best-robot-vacuums-irobot-eufy-and-more/2064817002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.kens5.com/assets/GANNETT/images/f7ab4aaa-813d-42c8-8226-af825d70c80b/f7ab4aaa-813d-42c8-8226-af825d70c80b_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:59:06Z", "content": "\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

The Cavs announced Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2018, that Smith \u201cwill no longer be with team as the organization works with JR and his representation regarding his future.\u201d (AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 J.R. Smith's bumpy-but-never-boring stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers is over.\n\nThe team said Tuesday that the disgruntled forward, who had requested to be traded earlier this season, \"will no longer be with team as the organization works with JR and his representation regarding his future.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers will try to trade Smith. He will make $14.7 million this season, and $3.8 million of his $15.6 million salary for next season is guaranteed.\n\nFor now, the 33-year-old Smith is without a team and that seems to suit him just fine. He has been dismayed with his reduced role as the Cavaliers rebuild in their first season since LeBron James left for the second time as a free agent.\n\nSmith's unhappiness had created another distraction in a stormy season for Cleveland, which is a league-worst 2-13 and has been blown out numerous times.\n\nThe Cavaliers fired coach Tyronn Lue last month following a 0-6 start, and the team has been riddled with injuries, the most prominent to All-Star forward Kevin Love, who remains out indefinitely following foot surgery.\n\nSmith's departure comes a day before James makes his return to Cleveland for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nSmith came to the Cavaliers in a trade from the New York Knicks in 2015. While his play has been inconsistent, he was a major contributor on Cleveland's 2016 championship team. He made two 3-pointers early in the second half of Game 7 as the Cavaliers rallied to win and become the first team in league history to overcome a 3-1 series deficit.\n\nWith Smith gone, the Cavaliers have just three players \u2014 Love, Tristan Thompson and Channing Frye \u2014 left from their title team.\n\nBefore the Cavs won the championship, Smith already had become a favorite with Cleveland fans. He seemed to endear himself further to many by remaining shirtless during the team's victory parade through the city's streets.\n\nHowever, Smith's support eroded some during last year's Finals when he lost track of the score in Game 1 and dribbled out the final seconds of regulation, depriving the Cavaliers a chance to steal a win. Cleveland wound up losing in overtime and got swept by the Warriors.\n\nSmith is averaging a career-low 6.7 points this season. He has averaged 10.3 points in 255 games with Cleveland over the past five seasons.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Hurtigruten)\n\nA cruise line based in Norway just announced it soon would power some of its ships with dead fish. And, no, it wasn't joking.\n\nTromso, Norway-based Hurtigruten on Monday said it would become the first cruise operator in the world to power vessels using liquified biogas (LBG), a fossil-free, renewable fuel produced from dead fish and other organic waste.\n\nBilled as an eco-friendly fuel, biogas already is used as fuel in small parts of the transport sector including buses, the company noted. The line's homeland of Norway and Northern Europe, which have large fishery and forestry sectors, produce a steady volume of the organic waste required to make the fuel, it added.\n\nHurtigruten said it planned to run at least six vessels using a combination of biogas, large battery packs and liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 2021. The company currently operates 17 ships with more on order.\n\n\"While competitors are running on cheap, polluting heavy fuel oil, our ships will literally be powered by nature,\" Hurtigruten CEO Daniel Skjeldam said in a statement accompanying the announcement. \"Biogas is the greenest fuel in shipping, and (its use in cruise ships) will be a huge advantage for the environment. We would love other cruise companies to follow.\"\n\nRELATED: Cruising to adventure in the land of ice and polar bears\n\nTouting itself as the greenest of cruise lines, Hurtigruten also recently became the first cruise operator to ban single-use plastics on its vessels. It's planning to replace traditional diesel propulsion systems on several ships with power systems that use battery packs and gas engines.\n\nSkjeldam has said the company's long-term goal is to operate all of its vessels emissions-free.\n\nThe biogas announcement comes as Hurtigruten prepares to unveil the world\u2019s first battery-hybrid powered cruise ship, the Roald Amundsen. Named after the Norwegian explorer who was the first person to reach the South Pole, the vessel is being custom-built for sustainable operations in Antarctica and other pristine polar regions.\n\nHurtigruten has two more battery-hybrid powered cruise ships on order for delivery in 2020 and 2021.\n\nHurtigruten is known for \"expedition-style\" cruises in the Arctic and Antarctica as well as regular sailings up and down the Norwegian coast. It draws customers from around the world including North America.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/11/20/cruise-ship-operator-hurtigruten-says-dead-fish-power-vessels/2064554002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Stocks continue to tank, lead by tech and oil", "description": "Stocks continue their slide Tuesday putting the market back into the red for the year, as weak results from retailers, mounting losses for big technology companies, and falling oil prices compound the market's losses from the day before.

Full update: Thanksgiving flights: Busy get-away day now in full swing\n\nORIGINAL POST: Flyers have packed their bags. Airports are full. And everyone\u2019s cast a wary eye to the weather forecast.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s been a smooth go for most as travelers enter the home stretch for the busy Thanksgiving travel period.\n\nNationwide, only about 75 flights have been canceled and about 375 delayed, flight-tracking service FlightAware counted as of 1 p.m. ET Tuesday. Both numbers are miniscule when compared to the USA\u2019s cumulative schedule of flights, which reaches 30,000 a day during peak periods.\n\n\n\nThe one relative exception to Tuesday's calm came in Seattle, where about two dozen flights were canceled and others delayed amid foggy conditions there.\n\nIn the Northeast, snow was falling in parts of New York state and New England, though that was more likely to impact travelers driving to the airports than flights themselves.\n\nElsewhere in the region, poor visibility had created off-and-on backups at the Newark Liberty and Boston airports. Few cancellations were reported at either, though more than 5 percent of the day\u2019s flights at Boston were running at least 15 minutes late, according to FlightAware.\n\nVisibility also was creating problems in the West.\n\nBeyond Seattle, San Francisco flights faced sporadic delays because of low visibility, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. FlightAware estimated about 5 percent of SFO flights were behind schedule.\n\nLooking ahead, no major storms were forecast through the end of the week, bolstering hopes that the relatively trouble-free flight schedules would hold through the holiday.\n\nFavorable weather was expected across most of the USA on Wednesday, one of the busiest travel days of the Thanksgiving period.\n\nA storm moving into the West Coast could create problems at some airports there. Of particular concern was San Francisco, where rain and cloudy weather was forecast for much of the day.\n\nThanksgiving, which is one of the lightest travel days of the year, also was not likely to have major weather-related disruptions to air travel. Still, fliers traveling on the holiday should keep an eye on Northeast airports, where gusty winds could affect flights.\n\nBased on current forecasts, Friday also should feature mostly calm weather. Friday also is historically light on passenger counts.\n\nThat leaves passengers to see what the weekend forecast will bring, especially for Sunday, which is the single-busiest day for air travel during the Thanksgiving window.\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos\n\nThe departure information from the website of Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport showed mostly on-time flights on Nov. 20, 2018.

(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhen Ken Hitchcock said he was retiring as he left the Dallas Stars, everyone knew better.\n\nIt was always assumed that if Hitchcock, 66, were presented with the right opportunity, he would be back behind the bench.\n\nCould there be a better opportunity than coaching a Connor McDavid-led Oilers team?\n\nThis is a perfect fit. The Oilers are ranked 25th in the NHL with a 3.30 goals-against average through Monday and Hitchcock has made his reputation as a taskmaster who knows how to force his team to play better defensively.\n\nWhat we know about Hitchcock is that his teams are always difficult to play against. It\u2019s hard work to get to the net against a Hitchcock team. If you want to play for Hitchcock, you must commit defensively.\n\nThis is an Oilers franchise that has missed the playoffs 11 out of past 12 seasons. Hitchcock\u2019s style isn\u2019t right for every team, but his approach is a logical solution for an Oilers team that hasn\u2019t made the most of having McDavid as its offensive catalyst.\n\nThe Oilers haven\u2019t taken advantage of McDavid\u2019s presence. General manager Peter Chiarelli hasn\u2019t been able to fix the team\u2019s defensive shortcomings with personnel moves.\n\nThe hope would be that Hitchcock can do it with a fresh defensive emphasis and a commitment to relentlessness.\n\nYou can\u2019t make an offense more dynamic. You can\u2019t coach players to have better hands. You can\u2019t magically transform a 12-goal scorer into a 35-goal scorer.\n\nBut you can make a team better defensively in a short period of time. We\u2019ve seen Hitchcock do that before.\n\nMORE NHL:\n\nHitchcock also counts heavily on veteran players, and Chiarelli is probably hoping that Hitchcock\u2019s arrival might re-ignite Milan Lucic, who has one goal and five points in 20 games. His plus-minus is -8.\n\nFans were ready to move on from coach Todd McLellan. While it wasn\u2019t solely his fault, the timing is right for a coaching change. The Oilers' building efforts have grown stale. Boldness is required.\n\nHitchcock was born in Edmonton. This should be a popular choice with fans.\n\nHitchcock can\u2019t solve all of the team\u2019s problems. The Oilers are also short on scoring depth. McDavid is third in the NHL in scoring (28 points in 20 games), but there are only five forwards with six or more goals on the roster. There\u2019s almost no offensive production out of the third and fourth lines. The Oilers are averaging 2.85 goals per game in a season when scoring is up slightly.\n\nChiarelli will have to address that. If he doesn\u2019t, he will be the next firing in Edmonton."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Reviewed, Patricia Camerota, Reviewed", "title": "15 things you need to survive holiday travel", "description": "You're going to need a lot more than a cocktail kit.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/20/15-things-you-need-survive-holiday-travel/2067081002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/6766f18a-a618-418b-9c36-d35369175bd1-15-things-you-need-holiday-travel.jpg?crop=1286,723,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:29:55Z", "content": "15 things you need to survive holiday travel (Photo: Hydroflask / Nintendo) Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nWhether you\u2019re traveling by car, bus, or plane, 5 or more hours en route anywhere can be a real pain in the... everywhere. Sure, it\u2019s not the destination but the journey that matters\u2014but the famed poet who said that never traveled on a low-cost airline from California to Massachusetts.\n\nChances are you struggle to find a comfy position to sit in, let alone sleep in, while traveling. But after my last trip to Europe\u2014when I endured a 9-hour flight without actually feeling the need to jump out\u2014I learned that packing the following things are essential for both comfort and entertainment. Having 15 items in your carry-on may seem like a lot, but trust me, you can make them fit. You\u2019ll thank me later.\n\n1. A trusty pair of headphones or earbuds to drown out all the annoying sounds\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Bose noise-cancelling headphones (Photo: Bose)\n\nTypically, everyone on the plane is loud, and bus drivers have poor taste in music. That's why I suggest packing a pair of both headphones and earbuds because after about four hours of use, either become uncomfortable. The JLab Fit 2.0 earbuds are under $25 and won our Best of Year award, but if you are looking to splurge a bit, check out the best earbuds you can buy.\n\nIf you are looking for a souped-up pair of over-ear headphones equipped with the market's best audio and noise-cancellation technology, then check out the Bose QuietComfort headphones ($329). They're the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy, and though they come at a hefty price, it's worth it for their comfort and quality. Traveling with a little one?

A reusable water bottle because there\u2019s nothing worse than dehydration\n\nWater Bottles (Photo: Reviewed.com)\n\nIt is so easy get dehydrated while traveling, especially on a flight, and dehydration makes jet lag much, much worse. Don\u2019t make my mistake and find yourself stuck in the middle seat during the 'nighttime' of a 7-hour flight, trying to ration that one tiny cup of complimentary water. Just bring a water bottle, and ask the flight attendants to refill it\u2014they are always more than happy to.\n\nThis is where our favorite water bottle, the Hydro Flask, comes in. It comes in multiple shapes and sizes, and keeps cold drinks cold for 24 hours and hot drinks hot for 12 hours\u2014it's a great gift for the fitness-lover in your life, too.\n\n3. A portable charger because without your smartphone, you\u2019re basically stranded\n\nPortable charger (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThe lower the phone battery level, the higher the anxiety. But luckily for you, we\u2019ve tested several portable chargers and found that the RavPower Turbo Series 20100mAh is the best battery pack for your money.\n\nThe RavPower battery pack won our Editors\u2019 Choice award for its high charging capacity at a low price\u2014it can charge a smartphone several times over before needing a juice refill of its own. The pack is a bit larger, but still slim enough to slide into a backpack or purse without taking up too much space.

A pair of comfy compression socks to prevent bloated cankles\n\nCompression socks (Photo: Amazon)\n\nI usually wear fuzzy socks on a quick flight for comfort, but for long days of travel where my butt is planted to a seat most of the day, I wear compression socks. Wearing compression socks on a flight is a great idea to increase circulation and reduce the risk of swelling.\n\nYeah, I know: Compression socks aren\u2019t necessarily the most beautiful things in the world, but they\u2019re important and can easily be tucked under a pair of long pants (seriously, who wears shorts on an airplane anyway?! That\u2019s gross). Just think of them as an inexpensive way to fight cankles.\n\nGet compression socks on Amazon starting at $8\n\n6. A Nintendo switch to distract you (or your kids) from a crappy flight\n\nBest gifts for kids of 2018: Nintendo Switch (Photo: Daily Express)\n\nEveryone in our office is obsessed with the Nintendo Switch. I don\u2019t currently own one yet, but the Switch is on my list because of its small size and incredible gaming capacity. It's also a fantastic gift for kids, since it can distract them during turbulence and flight delays.\n\nOne of our editors recently traveled with her Nintendo Switch, saying, \u201cIt saved me. We flew Spirit, which, if you've ever used that airline, you know how lackluster the experience can be. But, my boyfriend and I pulled out our Switch and played Mario Kart to pass the time together. Once I got tired of winning, he was able to dive into Zelda while I read.\u201d Oh, and by the way, Chrissy Teigen loves her Switch too.\n\nGet the Nintendo Switch on Amazon for $300\n\n7. Candies that help ease motion sickness\n\nSickness relief (Photo: Amazon)\n\nI have a pretty pathetic excuse for an equilibrium, which means traveling by air, sea, and sometimes even land can make me dizzy and sick to my stomach. I usually take over-the-counter medication when flying, but sometimes I need a second line of defense\u2014and that\u2019s why I turn to motion sickness candies.\n\nI also tuck a pair of Sea-Bands into my pocket to wear on a flight or bumpy bus ride. They may not work for everybody, but I swear they are what saved me on a rough bus tour through the hilly roads of Ireland. Others begged for a pit stop due to nausea, but I actually felt fine for once! Wear them on the pressure points around your wrists for relief.\n\nMore: The 25 best gifts for travelers of 2018\n\n8.

I sometimes even bring a lotion that has essential oils in it, so I can score a bit of aromatherapy while crammed in a stale cabin.\n\nI have dry skin to begin with (darn you, eczema!), so I always turn to First Aid Beauty skin products. You can buy their products on Dermstore, but for the holiday season, FAB is offering a ton of great beauty gifts.\n\nGet First Aid Beauty FAB Beautique set at Dermstore for $48\n\n11. A neck pillow because getting good rest is worth looking goofy\n\nNeck pillow (Photo: Amazon)\n\nOkay...I know. Neck pillows take up so much space and look ridiculous. But what if you could use a top-rated neck pillow that looks more like a scarf and takes up less room in your luggage? Allegedly, this scarf neck pillow can convert anyone into a bonafide plane sleeper. Getting good rest is worth looking like a goofball, but with this neck wrap, you no longer will.\n\nAround the holidays, we suggested the Ostrich pillow as a gag gift for those who love to travel which I wouldn\u2019t say is a necessity, but certainly a hilarious (and actually functional!) choice of travel pillow for those who are always looking to bury their head in the sand.\n\n12. Travel sized hand sanitizer because everything is gross\n\nPurell Hand Sanitizer (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHonestly, I practically bathe in this stuff when traveling. What can I say?!

A carry-on cocktail kit so you can toast to you and your stressful travels\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Pocket-sized cocktail kit (Photo: Amazon)\n\nWhen traveling gets stressful, take the edge off. These tiny cocktail kits were all over the place this holiday season\u2014and they are just about the classiest things I\u2019ve ever seen. Personally, I am having a tough time deciding between the Moscow mule and the Champagne kit. Maybe I\u2019ll just get both.\n\nGet The Cocktail Box Co. Old Fashioned Kit on Amazon for $24\n\n14. A useful weekender bag to skirt checked-bag fees\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Timbuk2 and Sole Society overnighters (Photo: Sole Society/Timbuk2)\n\nNothing is more frustrating than getting smacked with surprise carry-on fees at the airport, but a weekender bag which is the perfect size for a short trip and fits under small plane seats. The best under-seat luggage you can buy is this Timbuk2 bag with tons of zippered compartments and enough room for a laptop, snacks, and iPad, plus a 22-liter interior main compartment for clothing and toiletries.\n\nThis Sole Society bag is trendy, reasonably priced, and made with vegan leather. The best part? Both of these bags fit the dimensions for a personal item.\n\n15. Tile Trackers for peace of mind\n\nThe best gifts for travelers: Tile tracker (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThere's nothing worse than the sinking feeling of losing your wallet, purse, or phone\u2014especially an already-hectic travel days, or in a bustling airport as you're about to board your flight. That's why we love the Tile, a small tracking device that you can attach to your most important\u2014or most often forgotten\u2014personal items (think: keys, wallet, purse, luggage, laptop bike, etc.)\n\nYou can use an app on your phone to track your Tiles\u2014but you can also use the Tile to track your phone if (read: when) you lose it. One main user gripe has been that its battery life gives out after a year\u2014but luckily, Tile just released replaceable batteries for these little life savers.\n\nGet four Tile trackers on Amazon for $60\n\nPrices are accurate at the time of publication, but may change over time.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/20/15-things-you-need-survive-holiday-travel/2067081002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Daum breaks South Dakota State's career scoring record", "description": "Mike Daum had 41 points, 10 rebounds and four assists, and set South Dakota State's career scoring record as the Jackrabbits beat UTSA 99-79 in the second round of the Gulf Coast Showcase", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/20/daum-breaks-south-dakota-states-career-scoring-record/38573295/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:29:27Z", "content": "ESTERO, Fla.

(AP) \u2014 Mike Daum had 41 points, 10 rebounds and four assists, and set South Dakota State's career scoring record as the Jackrabbits beat UTSA 99-79 on Tuesday in the second round of the Gulf Coast Showcase.\n\nThe two-time Summit League player of the year entered with 2,347 career points, needing 16 to tie Nate Wolters' mark of 2,363. Daum hit two first-half free throws to tie Wolters and sank a fade-away jumper from the free-throw line to set the mark. He also moved into third on the Summit League's scoring chart, trailing leader Caleb Green of Oral Roberts (2003-07) with 2,504 points.\n\nDaum was 14 of 25 from the floor, including 5 of 12 from 3-point range, and made all eight of his free throws. It was his third career 40-point game.\n\n\"We're really happy for Mike,\" SDSU coach T.J. Otzelberger said. \"Especially with him being a fifth-year senior and taking a great amount of pride in being a Jackrabbit. He's got a lot of respect for Wolters, a guy he looks up to. This says a lot about Mike with his accomplishments, but really you can't say enough positive things about who he is and the type of character he has.\"\n\nDaum needed just 110 games to break the record. He also moved into the top 100 on the NCAA's scoring chart.\n\nSixth-year senior Skyler Flatten made 10 of 11 shots, finishing with a career-high 28 points and six 3-pointers for SDSU (4-2). David Jenkins chipped in with 10 points.\n\nKeaton Wallace scored 21 points for UTSA (0-5). Nick Allen added 12 points, Atem Bior 11 and Jhivvan Jackson 10.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Dale Gerhard, The Press of Atlantic City, via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Nancy Pelosi wants to be speaker of the House again, and she has five days left to make her case.\n\nAlthough Pelosi said she\u2019s confident she will win her bid, she\u2019s had to shore up support \u2013 even among Democratic groups that have long backed her.\n\nIn recent weeks, she spoke to a room of Hispanic lawmakers, hosted a dinner for new Democratic members and joined African-American lawmakers addressing a conference of black activists.\n\nPelosi, who made history as the first female speaker of the House, faces an open rebellion from a bloc of 16 Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter calling for a change in the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of the party\u2019s leadership. At least one Democrat \u2013 Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 mulled a challenge for the top spot.\n\nLate Tuesday, Fudge announced her support for Pelosi within minutes of the Democratic leader releasing a statement that Fudge would chair a subcommittee focused on elections and voting issues. Voting rights has been one of Fudge's signature issues.\n\nPelosi's fight for the gavel comes on the heels of Democrats picking up at least 37 seats to take control of the House after eight years under Republican rule, and that number could tick up as the remaining undecided races are called. Many of those wins came from more diverse suburban districts that had once supported President Donald Trump.\n\nPelosi courted the mostly liberal members of the Congressional Black Caucus and a group of 48 centrists called the Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\nShe met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Blue Dog Coalition, the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nMore: Group of House Democrats pledges to oppose Nancy Pelosi's bid to return as House Speaker\n\nMore: On her first day of orientation on Capitol Hill, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez protests in Pelosi's office\n\n\"This is the moment to leverage the agenda,\" said Wendy Smooth, associate professor of Women\u2019s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at the Ohio State University. \u201cShe will get a strong message from her caucuses about the ways they would like the agenda shaped. It depends on what she\u2019s promising in these meetings.\"\n\nSmooth said committee assignments and leadership roles are on the table.\n\nThe caucuses, some with varying missions, have lengthy wish lists from more action on climate control to protecting voting rights to immigration changes and changing rules to speed up bipartisan legislation.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, said the meeting was productive and was followed up Monday in a call with Pelosi staffers to discuss the group\u2019s \u201cBreak the Gridlock\u201d package, which aims to encourage bipartisan cooperation. Nine Democrats from the caucus signed a letter calling for Pelosi\u2019s support.\n\nPelosi sent a statement last week backing the package in principle, but Gottheimer said the language wasn't specific enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty clear \u2026 we\u2019re only going to back someone who is going to break the gridlock,\u201d Gottheimer said.\n\nPelosi, who served as speaker from 2007 to 2011, is likely to win the first round of voting Wednesday in the Democratic caucus\u2019 closed-door secret election. She needs only a majority to win the nomination. To become speaker, she will need a majority of the full House \u2013 218 votes \u2013 and has little room to lose a significant bloc of Democrats.\n\nPelosi pledged to make voting rights \u2013 one of the \"unifying issues\" for the Democrats, according to Smooth \u2013 a priority and one of the first measures the House will vote on next session.\n\nIn a nod to one of the most diverse Congresses ever, Pelosi touted a proposal to expand a diversity initiative in the chamber and is discussing a possible panel on climate change.\n\nSupporters point to Pelosi\u2019s legislative experience and ability to corral Democrats on issues and note her big role in the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Many Democrats campaigned on the issue in the midterms.\n\nSome experts said it might not sit well if Pelosi isn't in the top post, especially after a record number of women were elected to the House, many of them Democrats.\n\n\u201cAs all women leaders know, it is never the last fight,\" Smooth said. \"Pelosi is a skilled politician and a skilled woman in politics, so she knows this is only the fight until the next one.\u201d\n\nJack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, said the letter signed by the 16 Democrats \u201ccomplicates things. If all 16 signers hold together and vote against her in the official vote, she\u2019s got a problem.\u201d\n\nPitney said the next speaker must be ready to take on Trump and wrestle with the Republican-controlled Senate led by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cTrump is going to press very hard,\" Pitney said. \u201cMcConnell is a very formidable opponent, and for somebody without any experience, it\u2019s like a touch football player suiting up against the NFL.\"\n\nJeff Van Drew, a newly elected Democrat from New Jersey, said he promised during the campaign he wouldn\u2019t back Pelosi.\n\n\"Not that I have any personal dislike for her or she didn't do a good job in her time,'' said Van Drew, who was among the Democrats who signed the letter. \"But sometimes it's good to have a fresh new face and to have change and go forward with some new ideas.\"\n\nVirginia's Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger, one of the record number of women who will serve in the next Congress, said \"under no circumstances\" would she vote for Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIt is something that came up frequently on the campaign trail, particularly for our middle-of-the-road voters,\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cI think she is an incredibly strong person, I think that she\u2019s done incredibly good things. But also my background is CIA. You never held a job at CIA longer than three years.\u201d\n\nDrew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said she \"remains confident in her support among members and members-elect.\u201d\n\nHe noted that 94 percent of the caucus declined to sign the letter.\n\nSeveral longtime members pledged support, saying Pelosi paid her dues and played a key role in helping Democrats regain control of the House.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s not worried,\u2019\u2019 said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is in line to chair the Finance Committee. \u201cNancy Pelosi said we were going to win. And when people doubted her, she said we\u2019re going to win, and guess what? She was right. Nancy Pelosi said she\u2019s going to be the speaker. I believe Nancy Pelosi is right.\u201d\n\nRep. John Lewis of Georgia, who said he and Pelosi came to Congress around the same time, said many newer members haven\u2019t worked with her and don\u2019t know her as well.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a good leader, and I\u2019m supporting her,\u201d said Lewis, a civil rights icon. \u201cI think we need her leadership, her energy, her strength now more than ever before, and I don\u2019t have any doubt that she would be re-elected as speaker.\u201d\n\nFrom left, Rep.

Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. in Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\nOther Democratic groups are lining up to lobby for issues they want party leaders to support.\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus has made immigration a priority after what Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro called two years of \"unrelenting attacks against the Latino community.\"\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus has put voting rights and criminal justice changes at the top of its agenda.\n\nBeyond meeting with Democratic groups, Pelosi met with Fudge as the Ohioan weighed a run for speaker. Some Democrats publicly backed Fudge.\n\n\u201cCongress needs a new leader. Period,\" Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Marcia Fudge, my first (and arguably best) mentor in Congress will run for the next speaker of the House. I have full faith in her ability to lead our new Congress to its fullest potential.\u201d\n\nSmooth said last week it would have been \u201cextraordinary to see two women vying for the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, Herb Jackson, Cat Hofacker\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker/2065224002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "ShowBiz Minute: Scorsese, Rolling Stones, Snoop Dogg", "description": "Martin Scorsese feted at MoMA by friends De Niro, DiCaprio, Hill; The Rolling Stones plan 13 US live dates next year; At Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony, Snoop Dogg thanks himself for success.

(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nRarely does pre-game hype of an NFL game we're all excited about fail to actually do the contest in question requisite justice.\n\nBut it happened Monday \u2014 and, with help from ESPN's Louis Riddick, I had already done my part to feed the buzz. (Thanks again, Lou, your analysis proved quite sagacious.)\n\nBut, yes, Chiefs-Rams is worthy of being deemed an instant classic and one we won't soon forget \u2014 meaning, now, it's time to go back to the hype playbook and put this game in some kind of historical context 12 hours after the fact.\n\nI wondered where it might rank among the NFL's greatest regular-season games, a harder list to construct than you might think when the league's best-known postseason classics are not in play. (And given I'm not that old, let's limit this exercise to the past 40 years, or as long as the league has used the 16-game regular season.)\n\nEnjoy. Debate. Pontificate. Reminisce. Here's my list of 20:\n\n20. Oct. 23, 2011 \u2014 Broncos 18, Dolphins 15: It had a great finish. Sorta. In the game that launched his often magical yet frequently annoying 2011 campaign, Tim Tebow was basically awful for the first 57 minutes of his first start that year as Miami built a 15-0 lead. Then he threw two TD passes and ran in a two-point conversion in the final three minutes of regulation before Denver won in overtime. Hello, months of Tebowmania and planking.\n\n19. Dec. 21, 2003 \u2014 Jaguars 20, Saints 19: With New Orleans clinging to playoff hopes in Week 16, Jerome Pathon appeared to score the game-tying touchdown on the final play \u2014 known as the \"River City Relay\" since it happened in Jacksonville \u2014 which covered 75 yards and three laterals in a Cal kind of phenomenon. Then Saints K John Carney missed the PAT.\n\n18. Oct. 17, 1983 \u2014 Packers 48, Redskins 47: The highest-scoring \"Monday Night Football\" affair prior to Chiefs-Rams. The teams combined for 31 fourth-quarter points before Hall of Famer Jan Stenerud's 20-yard field goal gave Green Bay the win.\n\n17. Nov. 22, 2009 \u2014 Lions 38, Browns 37: Back when you thought Matthew Stafford (422 yards, 5 TDs for Detroit) and Brady Quinn (304 yards, 4 TDs for Cleveland) might be the leading edge of a new era of quarterbacking greatness. But they provided this very memorable affair, amplified because Stafford was mic'd up as NFL Films captured his agony after suffering a left shoulder injury on the final drive. He came right back to throw the winning touchdown pass on the final play, even as the shoulder popped out of its socket.\n\n16. Oct. 6, 2003 \u2014 Colts 38, Buccaneers 35: Tony Dungy's new team overcame his former one \u2014 Jon Gruden's Bucs were defending champs by then \u2014 as Peyton Manning led Indy back from a 28-7 fourth-quarter deficit to win in overtime.\n\n15. Oct. 6, 2013 \u2014 Broncos 51, Cowboys 48: Ten years to the day after he shocked the Bucs, Manning hung 414 yards and four TDs on Dallas and even scored himself on a rare bootleg. Tony Romo was arguably better (506 yards, 5 TDs) but mostly vilified for the interception he threw on his last pass, the one that set up Denver's game-winning field goal as time ran out.\n\n14. Sept. 10, 1978 \u2014 Raiders 21, Chargers 20: The \"Holy Roller.\" Oakland won as the clock hit 0:00, Dave Casper recovering QB Ken Stabler's deliberate forward fumble in the end zone. The NFL implemented a rule after the season preventing any future occurrences.\n\n13. Nov. 1, 2015 \u2014 Saints 52, Giants 49: New Orleans native Eli Manning passed for 350 yards and a career-high six TD passes. Drew Brees saw that and raised Manning 505 yards and a career-high seven TDs. Kai Forbath kicked the game's only field goal at the gun.\n\n12. Nov. 6, 2000 \u2014 Packers 26, Vikings 20: Antonio Freeman's game-winning, 43-yard TD catch from Brett Favre in OT was made possible as he collected the ball inches from the ground in a near-prone position after Minnesota CB Cris Dishman gave up on the play after nearly intercepting a pass he thought he'd at least batted away.\n\n11. Dec. 16, 1979 \u2014 Cowboys 35, Redskins 34: In his final regular-season appearance, Roger Staubach passed for 336 yards and three TDs, including the game winner to Tony Hill with 39 seconds left. In the days when this rivalry was great, Dallas won the NFC East while knocking Washington out of the playoff race.\n\n10. Dec. 2, 1985 \u2014 Dolphins 38, Bears 24: Monday nighters are a theme ... helps to grab that national audience. Dan Marino passed for 270 yards and three TDs in this one, shredding Chicago's famed \"46 defense\" while handing the Bears, who entered the game 12-0, their only loss of the season while preserving the legend of coach Don Shula's undefeated 1972 team.\n\n9. Sept. 4, 1994 \u2014 Dolphins 39, Patriots 35: After missing most of the '93 season with a torn Achilles, Marino made a triumphant return. He and Drew Bledsoe slugged their way to a combined 894 yards and nine TDs through the air, the final one Marino's 35-yard game winner to Irving Fryar in the fourth quarter.\n\n8. Jan. 2, 1994 \u2014 Cowboys 16, Giants 13: With the NFC East crown and a first-round bye on the line in the regular-season finale, Emmitt Smith rushed 32 times for 168 yards and caught 10 passes for 61 more and a touchdown ... grimacing all the while with a separated shoulder. Smith probably won the 1993 MVP award that day. He'd win Super Bowl MVP honors a few weeks later.\n\n7. Dec. 19, 2010 \u2014 Eagles 38, Giants 31: The second edition of \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\" feels like a more worthy entry than its fluky predecessor. Michael Vick (242 yards and 3 TDs passing, 130 yards and 1 TD rushing) brought Philly back from a 31-10 fourth-quarter hole as his team scored the final 28 points. Of course, DeSean Jackson's 65-yard return of Matt Dodge's ill-advised punt on the final play sealed it. Tom Coughlin is still fuming.\n\n6. Dec. 3, 2015 \u2014 Packers 27, Lions 23: Another prime-time affair, this one on a Thursday, when Aaron Rodgers established himself as the master of the Hail Mary by launching a parabolic 61-yard TD to Richard Rodgers (no relation) as time expired.\n\n5. Oct. 23, 2000 \u2014 Jets 40, Dolphins 37: \"MNF\" had some good games in 2000. In a finish known as the \"Monday Night Miracle,\" Miami entered the final period leading 30-7. New York then outscored the Fins 30-7 in the fourth quarter, tying the game 37-37 in the last minute when Vinny Testaverde hit Jumbo Elliott for a 3-yard TD on tackle-eligible play. The Jets kicked the winning field goal in overtime. But not the best entry of this rivalry ... keep reading.\n\n4. Dec. 29, 2007 \u2014 Patriots 38, Giants 35: Tom Brady threw his then single-season record 50th TD pass to Randy Moss, who set a mark that still stands with his 23rd touchdown catch of that season. Heavily favored New England squeaked by to complete its quest for the only 16-0 regular season in league history. Meanwhile, the Giants gained the confidence that allowed them to stun the then 18-0 Pats in Super Bowl XLII five weeks later.\n\n3. Nov. 15, 2009 \u2014 Colts 35, Patriots 34: Arguably the apex of the Brady-Peyton regular-season battles. Both were typically great \u2014 Brady threw for 375 yards and three TDs, Manning for 327 and four \u2014 but this night was defined by Bill Belichick's failed decision to go for it on fourth-and-2 from his own 28-yard line with little more than two minutes to play in a bid to keep Manning from taking another snap. Manning wound up taking four more snaps, the final one resulting in the game-winning TD to Reggie Wayne with 16 seconds left.\n\n2. Nov. 19, 2018 \u2014 Rams 54, Chiefs 51: It had just about everything. Blooming stars \u2014 Jared Goff, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Tyreek Hill, Aaron Donald \u2014 providing epic performances. Four fourth-quarter lead changes. More than 1,000 yards. The first Monday night platform the L.A. Coliseum had enjoyed in decades. And, ultimately, the first team to ever score 50 points and lose. Epic.\n\n1. Sept. 21, 1986 \u2014 Jets 51, Dolphins 45: Admittedly some personal preference here \u2014 as Deion Sanders would say, \"It's my list, not yours\" \u2014 but this was the kind of game that makes a kid fall in love with football. Shula and Marino in his prime vs. Ken O'Brien, whom the Jets hoped would be their Marino \u2014 given they bypassed the real thing to draft O'Brien in 1983. Marino was spectacular, with 448 yards and six TD passes. But O'Brien stood toe to toe, piling up 479 yards and connecting with Wesley Walker for all four of his TDs, including one that tied the game 45-45 in regulation before the 43-yard rainbow for the win back when overtime was of the sudden death variety.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Andrew Joseph", "title": "Markelle Fultz downplayed shoulder issues 2 weeks before his mysterious absence", "description": "Another strange turn.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/markelle-fultz-shoulder-specialist-remarks-lawyer-sixers-shot-form-absence-reaction-video-nba", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ap-jazz-76ers-basketball.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:22:12Z", "content": "The Markelle Fultz saga took yet another strange, unexpected turn on Tuesday with Fultzs agent and attorney, Raymond Brothers, directing Fultz to see a shoulder specialist.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Chase Daniel promises to be ready to step in at quarterback for Mitchell Trubisky on Thursday when the Chicago Bears play the Detroit Lions.\n\nThe Bears' backup might need to clear away some rust.\n\nDaniel hasn't started or played extensively in an NFL game since 2014, and might start for Trubisky because of a right shoulder injury sustained in the fourth quarter of Sunday night's 25-20 Bears victory over the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\"This week is a little bit different just because it's a short week, but I really haven't changed the way I prepare,\" Daniel said. \"I prepare like a starter every week, so for me it's just another game.\"\n\nCoach Matt Nagy is holding out hope Trubisky can play even without practice.\n\n\"I'm saying cautiously optimistic, but I can't make any promises,\" Nagy said. \"I hope he does. But it's a day-to-day thing for us.\"\n\nThe Bears had walkthrough type practices Monday and Tuesday, and on Wednesday have meetings before leaving for Detroit.\n\nNagy wouldn't describe the injury beyond saying Trubisky is \" ... in pain, which is normal.\"\n\nNagy stressed it isn't a long-term injury, or one requiring surgery, but the Bears will be prepared if Daniel plays.\n\n\"I know that Chase, this is one of the reasons why he's here, if we get in a situation like this where we have to make a decision one way or the other,\" Nagy said. \"This is why you have a guy like Chase.\n\n\"You feel very comfortable with him. Chase understands; he's the oldest guy on our team (32), so he's got experience.\"\n\nDaniel hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since 2016. He hasn't thrown more than two passes in a season since 2014 in Kansas City. However, he has extensive knowledge of the offensive system after being in it from 2013-15 with the Chiefs.\n\n\"Nags and I go way back, he was my position coach for three years in Kansas City, obviously, and we stayed close for my time away,\" Daniel said. \"Yeah, we have a great relationship, so when it comes to that we trust each other pretty well. So we know what each other likes, and I think we can just roll.\"\n\nDaniel has a 1-1 record as an NFL starter and has completed 51 of 78 for 480 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception. He also played for the Saints, Chiefs and Eagles.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing that you learn about Chase when you're around him is that in a really good way, he's extremely confident in how he plays because he's so smart,\" Nagy said. \"The game is not fast to him when he plays.\"\n\nDaniel started at the end of the 2013 season on short notice when Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith suffered a lacerated spleen. Daniel completed 21 of 30 for 200 yards and a touchdown in a 27-24 loss to San Diego.\n\n\"I got called by Andy Reid on Thursday night late, so really that week I only got a red-zone practice on Friday and a walk-through on Saturday,\" Daniel said. \"So similar timeline (to this week), yeah.\"\n\nOne of Trubisky's strengths has been his mobility, even if it did land him on the injury report. He leads all NFL quarterbacks in rushing with 363 yards.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mark Helfrich sees no reason for play calling to be altered even if Daniel isn't a scrambler.\n\n\"They're not that significantly different,\" Helfrich said. \"Certainly, you're going to tailor things to one person or another absolutely, but within the same structure.\n\n\"We're not going to change the offense if something happens. You can't do that.\"\n\nTrubisky's best game yardage-wise came against the Lions on Nov. 11; he threw for 355 yards on 23 for 30 with three touchdown passes.\n\nNagy avoided calling the penalized hit by Minnesota's Harrison Smith on Trubisky a dirty play. Trubisky was struck on the left shoulder but landed on his right shoulder while sliding.\n\n\"It wasn't intentional,\" Nagy said. \"Again, it is football. It is an illegal hit. You always want to look at things from both sides and you hope it's not malicious.\"\n\nTrubisky's slide left something to be desired. He seemed to want to lunge more than slide.\n\n\"He's good at it,\" Nagy said. \"Because he's running more often than others, there's different times that he slides and different ways that he slides.\n\n\"I've been around some bad sliders, including Michael Vick, and he'd laugh at it. He couldn't slide to save his life. We used to go out and put the slip and slide out after practice and try to teach him, and he couldn't do it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The finding also challenges the idea that advanced tool-making was introduced into Asia from the West.\n\nOne tool \u2013 dubbed the \u201cSwiss Army knife\" of prehistoric tools \u2013 was especially efficient and durable, indispensable to a hunter-gatherer society in which a broken spear point could mean certain death at the claws or jaws of a predator.\n\nThe tools are known as \"Levallois\" cores, which are named after a Paris suburb where tools made with this method were first discovered. \"To our knowledge, this is the earliest evidence of Levallois technology in east Asia,\" the study said.\n\nMade by chipping flakes off a stone so that the flakes themselves become the tools, Levallois tools are considered to be a \u201cmiddle stage\u201d in the development of stone tool technology, Archaeology magazine reported.\n\nThese tools are the result of a set of very specific steps of chipping a piece of stone to create similar-size tools suitable to be shaped for a variety of purposes, according to Smithsonian magazine.\n\n\"It used to be thought that Levallois cores came to China relatively recently with modern humans,\" said Ben Marwick, an University of Washington anthropologist and one of the study's co-authors, in a statement. \"Our work reveals the complexity and adaptability of people there that is equivalent to elsewhere in the world. It shows the diversity of the human experience.\"\n\nSeveral different species of humans lived on Earth at this time, including modern ones like us, according to the Smithsonian.

The difficulty ratings are based on how long it'll take your kids to discover the elf, not how hard it is for you to put him there (the two are often unrelated).\n\n25 places to hide your Elf on the Shelf\n\n1. Above the stockings\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nOK, duh. I know. This is an easy one. But kids get grumpy when they can't find stuff right away!\n\nMORE: Amazon's Top 25 toys for the 2018 holidays. Get your gift list ready\n\n2. Inside the holiday wreath\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nDepending on how or where your wreath is located, kids may have a hard time finding it.\n\n3. Inside the family photo area\n\nDifficulty level: HARD.\n\nUnless you have a tradition of decorating the photo area with photos, I'm betting your kid rarely frequents the area. Heck, throw a frame around the little guy. #Camouflage\n\n4. Tucked in the toys\n\nDifficulty level: HARD.\n\nSure, the kids play with their toys all the time. But tucking the little elf neatly into a toy box, or buried at the bottom of it? I just don't have faith that kids will be patient enough to dig through.\n\n5. Peeking out of a Rice Krispie cereal box\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nAll the cutting and positioning will require a considerable amount of time and skill, so you better display that cereal-eating elf proudly! This should get a good laugh and low stress because the kids should find it quickly. Maybe snap a pic of the perfection before the kids get to it.\n\n6. Scaling the wall with bows\n\nDifficulty level: HARD.\n\nThe obviousness of this display is what will make it so difficult. What kid would think the family elf would \"hide\" in such an open space?\n\n7. Climbing the tree\n\nDifficulty level: HARD.\n\nMost trees have 5 million and three ornaments, to be exact. Adding an elf to the mix will likely blend in and be nearly invisible.\n\n8. On the coffee table display\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nEspecially if you have a little tray or decorations that draw attention to the area, kids should find this relatively quickly.\n\n9. In the crafts area\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nIf you simply put him in the crafts area, this might be hard. But if you create a little display, like the one below where the elf is shown painting, it will be easier.\n\nMORE: Exclusive first look at Disney's Top 15 Toys of 2018, fun toys for the holidays\n\n10. In the bathroom\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and assume your kids brush their teeth and maybe even shower in the morning. Please say yes. If that's correct, they'll have no problem finding the elf.\n\n11. Hanging from the curtains\n\nDifficulty level: HARD.\n\nYou may have to hint and tell your kids to look upward.\n\n12. Working out on the kitchen counter or table\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nWhat a funny little surprise it will be to see the elf get his arm day on. And let's be honest, elf needs arm day.\n\n13. Ziplining to the tree\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nThis is as obvious as a display can get if you have the elf ziplining across the room to the tree. But this is a lot of work, too. Maybe save this for the grand finale. Or at least wait until you have a bunch of people over so you can show off.\n\n14. Stealing from the piggy bank\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nThis might be hard if you don't readily display the piggy bank, so move it to a spot that's easily accessible. And uh, maybe consider putting a \"just kidding\" note on the elf so the kids don't actually think he's a thief.\n\n15. Near the bathtub for a spa day\n\nDifficulty level: HARD.\n\nUnless you regularly hide the elf in your private bedroom and bathroom, you'll probably want to give your kids a hint on this one.\n\n16. Flying near a major walkway\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nUse some clear string, make a paper plane and let the let the elf soar! Place this somewhere the kids pass by every morning.\n\n17. In the popcorn bowl\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nForgot to place the elf one morning? No worries. Tell the kids the elf went out for a day trip and will return home in the evening. Then at night, pop some popcorn and invite the kids into the kitchen to surprise them with the elf's return.\n\n18. Hanging from the chimney\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nAgain, sometimes the more \"simple\" the spot, the more difficult it is to find the elf.\n\n19. Posing with a photo backdrop\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nGot a cute marquee board? Or even a little whiteboard? Write a cute little message instructing the kids to take an \"elfie!\" What a fun way for the kids to interact with their elf. This could be a fun first one!\n\n20. Hiding in the presents\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nIf you've got lots of presents with intricate patterns of wrapping paper, this might be quite difficult for the little ones to handle. Hints are always helpful.\n\n21. Hiding on \u2014 or eating \u2014 the gingerbread house\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nDid your kids make a gingerbread house? If yes, then the elf definitely wants to start munchin' on it.\n\n22. Putting on a movie\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nSometimes DVD players are stored in entertainment centers, which can make this hiding spot difficult. Try to find some way to draw attention to the area.\n\n23. Hiding in the holiday decor\n\nDifficulty level: MEDIUM.\n\nHow often do your kids check out the decor in the house? That'll help you determine how many, if any, hints you should give them.\n\n24. Coloring\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nGrab the kids' favorite coloring book and pop it open.\n\n25. Playing Twister\n\nDifficulty level: EASY.\n\nLike the cereal box, this requires some work. So display it somewhere the kids will definitely see.\n\nLike All the Moms?

In honor of another installment, we\u2019re celebrating Rocky Week here at For The Win, a look back at the iconic boxing film series that\u2019s made us fans for over four decades.\n\nLet\u2019s continue this celebration of one of the greatest sports movie franchises in the history of film by ranking the men Rocky Balboa faced in the ring.\n\nAnd no, we\u2019re not going to concern ourselves with the bums he was seen beating in montages. We\u2019re just looking at the big fights Rocky had during his legendary, and what must have been very painful, career inside the ropes.\n\n6. Tommy Gunn\n\nGunn and Rocky faced off in \u201cRocky 5\u201d and unlike previous Rocky fights that took place in a ring inside an arena with judges and fans and all that good stuff, this one actually took place outside of a bar. Gunn was the heavyweight champ at the time and really wanted a shot at Rocky, a man who had trained him at the beginning of the movie. So he brought a live TV crew with him to confront Rocky (because of course) at a bar and challenge him to a fight. The fight happened that night, on live TV, and Rocky beat him up in what was the very definition of a street fight. It ended with Rocky being cheered by all the people who watched the fight and with Gunn getting cuffed and arrested by the police, because apparently only the loser of a violent street fight gets arrested. Gunn is No. 6 on this list because you just can\u2019t lose to a more-than-middle-aged Rocky Balboa in a street fight. Can\u2019t happen.\n\nRandom YouTube comment from the video of the fight:\n\n5. Mason \u201cThe Line\u201d Dixon\n\nDixon, who had arguably the worst nickname in fake boxing history, entered this fight with Rocky (in \u201cRocky 6\u201d) as the heavyweight champ with a 33-0 record, 30 of which were knockouts. Rocky, meanwhile, entered with a record of 57-23-1, which is just a ridiculous record, with 54 KOs. If Rocky was more than middle aged in his fight with Tommy Gunn, then he was extremely over the hill in this one. But he was somehow able to go the distance with Dixon, which had to be a dark day for the heavyweight division because the champ should have been able to knock out a really old Rocky in at most \u2013 at most! \u2013 two rounds. Dixon would go on to have his hand raised in victory via a split decision, a victory that should have most definitely felt like a loss for the champ.\n\nRandom YouTube comment from the video of the fight:\n\n4. Ivan Drago\n\nListen, I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 how can Drago be No. 4 on this list!? Let me explain. Drago might be the most overrated fictional athlete of our time. That may be harsh, but it\u2019s true. There\u2019s just no way you can lose to a middle-aged Rocky Balboa on Christmas Day in the capital of your own country. Just. Can\u2019t. Happen. Especially when you\u2019re coming off a fight in which you literally killed a former heavyweight champion. You gotta figure that momentum would only carry over but no, it didn\u2019t and by the end of the fight all his countrymen and women in the arena were chanting for Rocky, not Drago, which must have been really embarrassing for him.\n\nRandom YouTube comment from the video of the fight:\n\n3. Thunderlips\n\nThis was a total mismatch for Rocky, as Thunderlips was a beast of a man, standing at just under 7-feet tall and weighing 390 pounds. Rocky, meanwhile, was listed at 202 pounds for the exhibition against the wrestling star. Thunderlips was an intimidating fighter, too, though some of that intimidation was lost when he proudly said in the ring before the fight: \u201cThe Ultimate Male vs. The Ultimate Meatball!\u201d because that line just stinks on ice. Thunderlips presented a number of different problems for Rocky. First, he didn\u2019t wear boxing gloves. Second, he was wrestler. Third, he didn\u2019t play by the rules. Thunderlips was the only fighter on this list who was able to pick Rocky up and throw him out of the ring, which was really impressive\u2026 and probably really against the rules. Rocky was somehow able to recover from that and, despite his wife\u2019s pleas, go back into the ring where he ended up picking Thunderlips up and returning the favoring by throwing (well, dropping) him out of the ring. It was an incredible turn of events for Rocky, as it looked like at one point that he might not make it out of the fight alive. In the end, the fight was ruled a draw and the two raised $75,000 for charity, which was the most important part of it all.\n\nRandom YouTube comment from the video of the fight:\n\n2. Clubber Lang\n\nClubber Lang gave zero hecks about anything other than beating the snot out of people inside the ring and talking violent smack to anybody that dared get in his way. He was able to beat Rocky in their first fight and needed just two rounds to do so. But Rocky didn\u2019t have his longtime trainer by his side for this fight, as Mickey was busy dying of a heart attack in the locker room. That seemed to weigh on Rocky during the brief fight as he was never mentally in it and ended up paying the price by suffering the worst defeat of his career. Rocky was able to shake off both the loss of his trainer and his loss to Clubber Lang, however, and defeat Lang in just three rounds in their rematch, thanks in large part to having Apollo Creed train him for the fight and be in his corner on the big night.\n\nRandom YouTube comment from the video of the second fight:\n\n1. Apollo Creed\n\nApollo Creed was a legend who died doing what he loved most \u2013 boxing, though looking back at it you gotta assume that he probably wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be killed in the ring by Drago. But that\u2019s all besides the point. Creed was a great champion who could do it all, both inside the ring and outside. He was a true showman who loved the spotlight. He was a 33-year-old undefeated champion when he faced Rocky for the first time and it was expected that the fight wouldn\u2019t last long because Rocky was just some random late fill-in for another fighter who had to pull out due to injury. Creed promised to knock Rocky out in three rounds but things suddenly changed in the first round when Rocky became the first boxer to ever drop Creed to the mat courtesy of a vicious uppercut. Creed knew right then that he was in a battle\u2026 and boy did they ever battle. The fight went the distance, with the champ winning by a controversial split decision. The two would later meet again, with Rocky winning in dramatic fashion after both fighters fell to the mat in a wild 15th and final round of the rematch. Rocky got up, Creed did not and the belt went to Balboa. It was Creed\u2019s first and only loss (not counting that exhibition against Drago, which proved to be a costly defeat) as he retired from fighting shortly there after. He probably should have stayed retired, though hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nRandom YouTube comment from the video of the second fight:"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Deirdre Shesgreen, USA TODAY", "title": "Statement from President Donald J.

(Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House released the following statement by President Donald Trump in connection with Saudi Arabia and the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Here is the full statement from the White House:\n\n\u201cAmerica First!\n\nThe world is a very dangerous place!\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\n\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\n\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2013 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\n\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\n\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2013 so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/president-donald-j-trump-saudi-arabia-khashoggi-statement-white-house-prince-mohammad-bin-salman/2068111002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Patrick Ryan, USA TODAY", "title": "Michael B.

(Photo: ROBERT DEUTSCH/USA TODAY)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Stars, they're just like us. Or at least they try to be.\n\nMichael B. Jordan can no longer walk out the door without getting recognized, with his chiseled physique currently plastered across billboards and bus ads for \"Creed II\" (in theaters Wednesday) and his scene-stealing turn as \"Black Panther\" villain Erik Killmonger still fresh in people's minds.\n\n\"There are certain places I can't go anymore and certain things I can't do,\" Jordan, 31, says sighing. \"I still try to find things that, at least in my head, make me feel regular, like going to the grocery store. Sometimes I want to pick out the apple that I want to eat, rather than the one somebody gives me.\"\n\nSunglasses and baseball caps don't throw fans off his scent, either. \"I wish I could go full beard, hoodie and shades, but then people might think I'm trying to rob the place, and that's not cool,\" he says. \"Or maybe I'm thinking too much.\"\n\nThese are the concerns that occupy his mind as he steps into his place on the Hollywood A-list, having proved himself a bankable leading man in the \"Rocky\" franchise spinoff \"Creed\" in 2015, which went on to earn almost $110 million.\n\nThe sequel picks up not long after the events of the first film, with dogged boxer Adonis Creed (Jordan) a newly crowned world champion and engaged to his musician girlfriend, Bianca (Tessa Thompson). But a rift forms between him and his grizzled mentor, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), when Adonis accepts a challenge to fight hulking Ukrainian boxer Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), whose father Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) killed Adonis' dad Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in 1985's \"Rocky IV.\"\n\nAdonis \"is still very hurt by his father's death, and having the Dragos reintroduced in this brought up a lot of bad history and memories,\" Jordan says. \"The taste of revenge is in his mouth,\" and as a result, \"he's a little immature. He's emotional and gets humbled in a real way. Things he experiences in this movie allow him to reassess what's important to him and what's his 'why' for fighting.\"\n\nCLOSE Adonis Creed, played by Michael B. Jordan, faces off against the son of the Russian fighter who killed his father in \"Creed II.\" USA TODAY\n\nHaving already bulked up for \"Black Panther,\" Jordan says it was easy to fall back into his \"Creed\" workout routine, which involved intense cardio and boxing training and a stricter, leaner diet (save for the occasional Philly cheesesteak on cheat days).\n\nTo play Killmonger, Jordan \"gained mass. He was a weapon,\" says \"Creed II\" director Steven Caple Jr. \"But in this film, he wanted to be at his all-time prime. We wanted it to look as realistic as possible when he\u2019s up against Florian. He (got) cut and shredded to look great on camera \u2013 it\u2019s probably the best shape he\u2019s ever been in.\"\n\nThe emotional stakes are also upped this round, as Adonis wrestles with the very real possibility that his newborn daughter could inherit Bianca's progressive hearing loss.\n\nPreparing for those scenes was \"tough because I don't have any children, so I can only imagine what that would be like; feeling so hopeless to help your child who you\u2019re supposed to be there to protect and you can\u2019t do anything about it,\" Jordan says. But as someone who's \"always thought about fatherhood and having kids, it was cool to play that role for a bit.\"\n\nRocky (Sylvester Stallone, right) reluctantly trains Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) for his showdown in the ring with Viktor Drago. (Photo: BARRY WETCHER/MGM/WARNER BROS. VIA AP)\n\nSmitten fans will be delighted to know that Jordan is still single, despite the internet's best efforts to pair him off with his \"Black Panther\" co-star Lupita Nyong'o.(\"I love her to death,\" he says, but \"people will write their own narratives. I don't have any control over that.\")\n\nThe actors are in the midst of a serious awards push for Marvel's historic superhero juggernaut, which has amassed $1.3 billion worldwide since its release in February and shattered the common Hollywood myth that films with predominantly black casts don't sell tickets overseas.\n\nThe phenomenon around it is \"honestly still so hard to wrap my brain around,\" says Jordan, marveling over the countless memes and kids' Halloween costumes inspired by his character. He credits the success of \"Panther\" in large part to his frequent collaborator Ryan Coogler, who \"allowed people to see and feel things they wouldn't normally\" in a Marvel movie: incorporating a timely message of building bridges instead of barriers and sparking deeper conversations about identity and the African diaspora.\n\nWith Coogler already hard at work on a sequel, \"Panther\" is looking to crash awards season in the meantime: On GoldDerby.com, awards pundits near-unanimously predict the blockbuster will earn a best-picture Oscar nomination, with a handful of others expecting Jordan to land a supporting actor nod as well. If so, his performance would be the first from a superhero film to earn Academy recognition since Heath Ledger's similarly memorable (and Oscar-winning) turn as the Joker in 2008's \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\n\"That would mean a lot, man. I'd be a part of history, and it'd be part of my legacy,\" Jordan says. Growing up in Newark, New Jersey, the son of a caterer and high school guidance counselor, he wasn't the kid who practiced Oscar speeches in his bathroom mirror: \"I never even dreamed about it. I wasn't one of those kids who always knew I wanted to be an actor.\"\n\nIn \"Black Panther,\" sympathetic radical Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) wants to share Wakanda's resources with the world, and in turn, conquer it. (Photo: MARVEL STUDIOS)\n\nAfter working as a child model, he landed the pivotal role of the ill-fated Wallace in HBO's \"The Wire\" at age 14. Years of steady TV work on ABC's \"All My Children\" and NBC's \"Friday Night Lights\" followed, leading to his breakthrough performance in Coogler's \"Fruitvale Station\" in 2013, playing real-life police-shooting victim Oscar Grant.\n\n\"I was still convincing myself that (my big break) was going to happen. I was still faking it, in the sense that, 'I believe it, I got faith,' but there was a lot of doubt there, too,\" Jordan says. \"I stayed the path and continued to work hard knowing that good would come. I just never knew it was going to come this fast and this huge.\"\n\nMichael B. Jordan walks the carpet at the Governors Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. (Photo: STEVE GRANITZ/WIREIMAGE)\n\nHe now hopes to follow a similar career trajectory to his idols Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington. He started a production company, Outlier Society Productions, which produced his upcoming drama \"Just Mercy\" and Netflix series \"Raising Dion,\" and aims to create more opportunities for people of color.\n\nThe charismatic young heartthrob is also taking a page from the Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson book of megastar popularity, recently telling his Instagram followers that he plans to be more \"personal\" and share more of his life with them.\n\n\"I'm a quiet dude. But you\u2019re in this new age where fans want to feel a little bit closer to you,\" Jordan says. \"So instead of people making their own assumptions about me, let\u2019s help them out a bit and give them more of myself, so they don\u2019t have to fill in as many blanks.\"\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/20/michael-b-jordan-oscar-ready-black-panther-creed-2/2007898002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "Consumer groups warn of slime, toy 'dangers'", "description": "Consumer groups like U.S. PIRG (Public Interest Research Group) Education Fund are warning parents of potential threats of some toys on the market ahead of the busy holiday shopping season.

A new book looks at Hughes' controlling relationships with Hollywood women. (Photo: TCM)\n\nBy now, our perception of Hollywood\u2019s \u201cgolden\u201d age, when stars were born in the studio era of the 1920s through the \u201850s, has been thoroughly tarnished by the awakenings of the #MeToo era. The sordid, sexually abusive history of powerful men, their casting couches and exploitation of female talent is being writ large \u2013 if all too belatedly.\n\nNone of it is described more compellingly than in Karina Longworth\u2019s new book, \u201cSeduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes\u2019s Hollywood\u201d (Custom House, 560 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four).\n\nThis is a first-rate work of cultural curation, in which Longworth combs the countless stacks of Hollywood memoirs and biographies, with a focus on the pathological predations of Howard Hughes, Texas millionaire, starmaker and film producer.\n\nFilm critic and creator of the popular Hollywood-themed podcast \u201cYou Must Remember This,\u201d Longworth delivers much more than a warmed-over recounting of the eccentric Hughes saga and the famous women who helped define it.\n\nWritten with forceful style and a passionate regard for the forgotten hopefuls who came to California seeking success in a thoroughly sexist era, the book casts a feminist eye on the dark decadence of early Hollywood \u2013 from silent-era orgies at the Ambassador Hotel to the impunity with which the founding studio heads manipulated starlets.\n\n\"Seduction\" by Karina Longworthy (Photo: Custom House)\n\n\u201cThe female body had always been a key building block of cinema,\u201d Longworth writes, \u201ca raw material fed into the machine of the movies, as integral to the final product as celluloid itself.\u201d Most of the studio czars who manned the machine, such as Louis B. Mayer and Jack Warner, were robust immigrant overachievers.\n\nBut Hughes came to the film world as inheritor of the Hughes Tool Co., its fortune built on an innovative oil drill bit. Hughes had been traumatized in his teens by the early deaths of his parents, but as a nephew of Rupert Hughes, a successful film producer/director, he took to the Hollywood of the 1920s with brash energy and appetites.\n\nAviator, playboy and instinctive promoter, Hughes made his own rules, dallying with and famously influencing the careers of legends such as Katharine Hepburn, Rita Hayworth, Ava Gardner, Lana Turner and Jean Harlow. Then there were Hughes discoveries such as Jane Russell, renowned for the cleavage Hughes fought the censors to reveal.\n\nBut dozens of lesser-known actresses suffered under the thumb of the increasingly paranoid mogul, his private eyes, security men and the informers who helped him control them.\n\nAuthor Karina Longworth. (Photo: Emily Berl)\n\nLongworth paints a vivid picture of Hughes, his marriages, divorces, feuds and the Hollywood establishment he all but ruled for a while, through hit films such as \u201cHell\u2019s Angels\u201d and \u201cThe Outlaw.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s familiar territory for cinema history buffs, but Longworth\u2019s narrative comes to life through the emblematic character of Faith Domergue. A Hollywood hopeful from New Orleans who made only a marginal impact on film history with her acting, Domergue met Hughes when she was 16. The 35-year-old mogul proposed to her within a year, and his controlling temperament defined their relationship. (They never married.)\n\nWith Faith, Longworth concludes, \u201cHughes recreated the dynamic he had experienced as a child with his supercontrolling mother, but in reverse.\u201d Weirdly, amid the courtship, Hughes even told her she was \u201cthe child I should have had.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Domergue\u2019s narrative reveals her to be an astute, undeceived witness to Hughes\u2019 monomania, surviving his clutches to carve out a respectable career in sci-fi and horror films. She, at least, proved an exception to the damaging rule of Hollywood\u2019s patriarchal seducers.\n\nCLOSE Put these new books on your wish list right now.

(Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered a full-throated defense of Saudi Arabia and cast doubt on a U.S. intelligence assessment that the kingdom\u2019s crown prince knew about the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\" Trump said in an unusual, eight-paragraph statement laced with exclamation points that opened by declaring, \"The world is a very dangerous place!\"\n\nTrump's statement seemed aimed at ending the debate over how his administration has handled Khashoggi's killing \u2013 and at pre-empting lawmakers in Congress from passing any legislation that would mete out tougher punishment for Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region,\" Trump said.\n\nAs he left Tuesday afternoon for Florida, Trump said abandoning Saudi Arabia \"would be a terrible mistake\u201d and touted the regime's promise to purchase billions of dollars in U.S.-made weapons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d he said. Experts, such as Jonathan Caverley with the Naval War College, said Trump exaggerated possible arms sales deals to the regime.\n\nCritics said Trump\u2019s statement lets the Saudi government off the hook for the brutal killing of an American resident and sends an ominous signal to other dictatorships around the world that they have carte blanche to commit human rights abuses. They slammed the president for questioning the CIA's reported conclusion that Salman ordered Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s habit of siding with murderous foreign dictators over American intelligence professionals is a stain on our democracy that undermines the American ideal,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cCongress must now stand up with bipartisan resolve to condemn the brutal slaying of Jamal Khashoggi and pass legislation to respond to this and other Saudi crimes.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said Trump's statement sounded like it was written by \"a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/MQ4JsoQtqk \u2014 Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 20, 2018\n\nCorker and New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the committee, responded by forcing the administration to determine whether the crown prince was responsible for Khashoggi's murder. The senators used a provision in the Magnitsky Act to trigger that assessment.\n\nTrump hinted at the CIA's assessment of Salman's role in Khashoggi's murder, but he highlighted the royal family's denials and its portrayal of Khashoggi as a dangerous Islamist \u2013 a characterization the journalist's family flatly denied.\n\n\"Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an 'enemy of the state' and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that,\" Trump said. \"King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump's decision and said it was in America's national security interests. Pompeo noted that the United States imposed sanctions last week on 17 Saudi individuals in connection with Khashoggi's killing, and he said the country needs Saudi Arabia's support in its campaign to isolate Iran.\n\n\"It\u2019s a mean, nasty world out there,\" Pompeo said when asked about the crown prince, who has come under fire for rounding up dissidents inside the kingdom and conducting a bloody war in Yemen. \"It is the president\u2019s obligation to ensure that we adopt policies that further America\u2019s national security.\"\n\nThe Senate could vote as early as next week on legislation that would force the Trump administration to withdraw all U.S. military support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. It's not clear whether such a measure could pass, but lawmakers are considering a range of other proposals in response to Khashoggi's killing.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Congress should stop U.S. arms sales and other foreign aid to Saudi Arabia and place sanctions on the crown prince.\n\n\"Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and columnist for a U.S. newspaper, was killed by agents of the Saudi government in a Saudi Consulate,\" she said. \"This was a premeditated murder, plain and simple.\"\n\nIn his statement, Trump accused lawmakers who pushed for tougher action of being politically motivated.\n\n\"I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction,\" Trump said, adding that he would consider \"whatever ideas are presented to me\" but only if they protect U.S. security. \"Very simply it is called America First!\"\n\nKhashoggi, a critic of the Saudi regime who fled his home country last year to live in the USA, was killed Oct. 2 inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. He had gone into the diplomatic facility to get documents he needed for his upcoming marriage to a Turkish woman.\n\nTurkish officials said they have evidence that Khashoggi was brutally murdered and dismembered inside the consulate by Saudi operatives.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs walked out of Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles late Monday night confident that they could beat the Rams if they should get a rematch in the Super Bowl.\n\nIf only they don't have to beat themselves, too.\n\nFor all the positives the Chiefs did during their 54-51 shootout loss to the Rams \u2014 and there were plenty \u2014 the glaring mistakes overshadowed them. Patrick Mahomes tossed a trio of interceptions, lost a pair of fumbles and was sacked three times. The defense gave up too many big plays. Harrison Butker missed an extra point. And the Chiefs were penalized 13 times for 135 yards.\n\nYet the Chiefs still led the Rams in the fourth quarter in a record-setting, back-and-forth offensive bonanza. They still had a chance to beat one of the NFL's top teams on the road.\n\nSo yes, they walked away with a loss. But also with a lot of confidence.\n\n\"I mean, the fact that we were in this game with three scoring turnovers, we gave them 21 points off turnovers and they're a good team,\" Chiefs wide receiver Chris Conley said.\n\n\"If we can eliminate those penalties, and those turnovers, this game is a different game. If we can score off those drives, it's a different game. It all comes down to being disciplined and executing.\"\n\nThe Chiefs (9-2) had done that most of the season. They only had eight turnovers over their first 10 games, and while penalties have been a constant problem, they had been able to overcome them.\n\nThat all changed under the bright Monday night lights.\n\nLos Angeles linebacker Samson Ebukam returned Mahomes' first fumble for a touchdown in the second quarter. He returned an interception 25 yards for another score in the third. And two interceptions in the final minutes scuttled any chance of setting up Butker for a tying field goal.\n\n\"You go back in a game like this, heck, I wish I would have called some different plays. We can all do better,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.\n\n\"We can learn from this in a lot of different ways. We've got to look at it individually, even though we talk team, and that helps us become a better team when we do that and be real with ourselves.\"\n\nThe Chiefs will have a bit of extra time for that self-assessment. They returned to Kansas City for their bye week, giving them an opportunity to reflect and recover.\n\nThere were plenty of positives to reflect upon in Los Angeles, too.\n\n\u2014 Mahomes threw for 478 yards, the second-most in franchise history, and matched his own club record with six touchdown passes. His quarterback rating just edged that of Rams counterpart Jared Goff, while his TD total set a record for a game on Monday night.\n\n\u2014 Tyreek Hill had a career-high 10 catches for 215 yards and two TDs. It was the second-highest yardage total in Chiefs history, trailing only Stephone Paige's 309 yards against San Diego in 1985.\n\n\u2014 Tight end Travis Kelce also had 10 catches for 127 yards and a score, extending his streak of games with a reception to 74 \u2014 the third-longest in franchise history.\n\n\u2014 Kareem Hunt ran for 70 yards while catching three passes for 41 yards and a score. That made him the first player since Lenny Moore of the Baltimore Colts in 1961 to have seven touchdowns through the air and on the ground in his team's first 11 games.\n\nThere are dozens more statistical superlatives from Monday night's game, and indeed, from the first 11 games of the season.\n\nBut perhaps the most important fact is that Kansas City's two losses have come on the road against powerhouses in the Rams and Patriots, the Chiefs remain on top of the AFC West and have the No. 1 seed in the playoffs still firmly in their sights.\n\nIf the Chiefs want that rematch with the Rams in the Super Bowl, the one they are confident they can win, earning a playoff path through Arrowhead Stadium will be paramount down the stretch.\n\n\"You wanted to go win that game going into the bye week against a good team like that, a playoff team. But at the same time we still control our own destiny,\" Mahomes said.\n\n\"We can go out there and win football games after the bye week. It's kind of like that reset, get your body right and come back with that mentality that we're gonna win and we can still get home-field advantage hopefully.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He may have looked the part, but it quickly became apparent that he wasn\u2019t the answer. Devin Funchess, also a bigger receiver who fit the No. 1 receiver prototype, got the next crack and, while he has been fine, it has become abundantly clear he is little more than a competent second or third option.\n\nBut Carolina may have already found its replacement for Smith. And, no, I\u2019m not talking about 2018 first-round pick D.J. Moore, who is coming off his best day as a pro in the 20-19 loss to the Lions. I\u2019m talking about a player who was on the field for just 16 offensive snaps in Detroit: Second-year receiver Curtis Samuel.\n\nThe 2017 second-round pick out of Ohio State has not seen much of the field in 2018 but has still managed to make a tremendous impact on the Panthers offense. He\u2019s played only 112 snaps all season \u2014 nearly half the number THIRD tight end Chris Manhertz (no, that\u2019s not a made-up name) has played. Smauel has touched the ball only 21 times this season. He has five touchdowns.\n\nFive. On 21 touches.\n\nNearly 25% of the plays Samuel has received the ball have ended up in the end zone. He is the most efficient touchdown-maker in the league. In 2018, 56 players have scored at least five touchdowns. All of them have touched the ball more times than Samuel has. Chargers WR Mike Williams is next on the list with 24 touches; he\u2019s played double the snaps Samuel has. Bears WR Anthony Miller is next with five scores on 29 touches but he\u2019s needed 257 snaps to get them. No other player has scored five times on fewer than 30 touches.\n\nSamuel isn\u2019t scoring easy touchdowns, either. All of his scoring plays in 2018 have been of the spectacular variety, requiring a great catch or run to get into the end zone.\n\nSamuel is more than a big play machine. He is easily the team\u2019s best route-runner, whether he\u2019s lining up in the slot or on the outside\u2026\n\nOutside of Greg Olsen, Samuel has the best hands on the team, and he showed off those hands with a clutch touchdown late in the Lions loss, contorting his body and snatching the ball out the air with his hands.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Samuel is tied with Odell Beckham Jr. for 11th in its \u201cYards per Route Run\u201d metric. And PFF has graded him as the 13th best receiver in the league this season. Here are the names ahead of him on that list:\n\nMichael Thomas\n\nTyreek Hill\n\nDeAndre Hopkins\n\nAdam Thielen\n\nJulio Jones\n\nOdell Beckham Jr.\n\nRobert Woods\n\nA.J. Green\n\nKeenan Allen\n\nDavante Adams\n\nDeSean Jackson\n\nBrandin Cooks\n\nFor whatever reason, Ron Rivera and the Panthers coaching staff have decided Samuel does not deserve more snaps than unspectacular players like Funchess, Jarius Wright and Torrey Smith. And Rivera\u2019s reasoning for Samuel not seeing the field more often has been completely unsatisfying.\n\nRivera says as far as the reasons for CJ Anderson and Curtis Samuel not getting in the game as much \u2013 \"A little to do with scheme, a little with the situation.\" \u2014 The Riot Report (@RRiotReport) October 15, 2018\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s loss, Rivera said Samuel will \u201ccontinue to get opportunities,\u201d but his snap count has actually been trending down over the last few weeks. After playing 27 snaps in Week 8, he\u2019s been on the field for a total of 52 over the last three weeks combined. The better he plays, the fewer snaps he gets, it seems.\n\nJust make Luke Kuechly the head coach already. pic.twitter.com/m8ul7RjK4i \u2014 Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) November 20, 2018\n\nMaybe the coaching staff is having a hard time envisioning a 5-foot-11, 195-pound speedster as a WR1, but look around the league: Antonio Brown, who is smaller than Samuel, is the standard. Tyreek Hill is even smaller and not far behind Brown in the league\u2019s WR hierarchy. You\u2019d think a franchise that employed Steve Smith for over a decade would realize that size doesn\u2019t really matter for receivers; then again, this is the same franchise that continues to play Funchess in the No. 1 role, so who knows.\n\nWith the Panthers\u2019 season now teetering on the edge after two straight losses, maybe Rivera will come to his senses and start playing his best receiver more than 20 snaps a game. It\u2019s become clear that the Panthers defense isn\u2019t very good, and if this team is going to hang with other playoff contenders, it will have to start scoring more points. Playing the NFL\u2019s most efficient touchdown-scorer should help."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Live stream: President Trump pardons the official White House turkey", "description": "President Trump will continue the White House tradition and pardon the Thanksgiving Turkey.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/20/live-stream-president-trump-pardons-turkey/2067273002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/3f3b40dd-d2ba-41df-8212-e1c5ae3d5764-GettyImages-peas_and_carrot.jpg?crop=4749,2677,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:47:20Z", "content": "WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 19: Peas and Carrots, the National Thanksgiving Turkey and its alternate, are shown to members of the media during a press conference held by the National Turkey Federation November 19, 2018 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC.

When Fultz joined the Sixers for training camp in September of 2017, his shooting form looked nothing like it did during his freshman season at Washington where he developed into a high lottery pick. The Sixers selected him with the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nBut through one-plus seasons, Fultz has been slowed by whatever ails his shoulder. He played in just 14 games last season and returned to training camp for his second season with questions about his shot. Recent video of his shot indicates continued issues with his shooting form that includes awkward hitches, pauses and releases.\n\nThe form is the subject of intense scrutiny. Did Fultz try changing his shot? Did the injury cause him to change the shot? Or, for whatever reason, has he lost confidence in his ability to shoot.\n\nThe Sixers early last season sent Fultz to shoulder specialist, who diagnosed him with soreness and scapular muscle imbalance. The team gave him time to heal. Fultz worked on his game and was cleared in early January. But then-Sixers general manager Bryan Colangelo said Fultz\u2019s range was limited to the paint area.\n\nFultz played some in the playoffs and returned to training camp for this season, saying he was back and better.\n\nBut by early November, it was clear something was wrong with Fultz. Trainer Drew Hanlen, who worked with Fultz over the summer, said on Twitter that Fultz was not healthy. He later deleted the tweet.\n\nSixers coach Brett Brown said he\u2019s healthy enough to play, but Fultz\u2019s shot indicated something still isn\u2019t right. So Fultz\u2019s representation is going to try and figure out what it is.\n\nThe Athletic first reported the Fultz news."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "US to play Costa Rica on Feb. 2 at San Jose, California", "description": "The U.S. will play Costa Rica in an exhibition on Feb. 2 at Avaya Stadium in San Jose, California", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/20/us-to-play-costa-rica-on-feb-2-at-san-jose-california/38572597/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:38:38Z", "content": "CHICAGO (AP) The U.S. will play Costa Rica in an exhibition on Feb. 2 at Avaya Stadium in San Jose, California.

Some other key injuries also make this a crucial waiver run with only two weeks left in many fantasy regular-season schedules.\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nGUS EDWARDS, Ravens (0.2 percent owned): The undrafted rookie surprisingly took hold of the lead role in the Baltimore backfield in Week 11, rushing for 115 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, and now he has an apparent opportunity to continue as the No. 1 RB as the Ravens take on the Raiders. It's a fine matchup for Edwards to continue to build on his momentum. John Harbaugh does not seem to trust Alex Collins and there aren't really other competitors for the carries. You have to take the flier on Edwards, but keep in mind the Ravens have not leaned heavily on any one RB this season yet.\n\nJOSH ADAMS, Eagles (28.1): We have recommended this other undrafted rookie previously, and 22.1 percent of fantasy players added him last week, but he remains underowned. Adams has yet to reach double digit carries or 65 rushing yards in a game, but he was on his way to officially seizing the lead RB role last week before the Eagles were blown out by the Saints. He provided Philadelphia's only score on a 28-yard TD run, flashing his upside, and we could see his best production this week in a much friendlier matchup with the Giants.\n\nLEGARRETTE BLOUNT, Lions (9.8): The well-traveled veteran has rushed for only 16 yards in his last four games, as he became a complete afterthought with Kerryon Johnson moving into clear lead back and Fantasy RB1 territory. But Johnson is expected to miss Thursday's game against Chicago with a knee injury and Blount should be the top ball carrier for the Lions. It's not a good matchup against Chicago's elite run defense and Theo Riddick is a better add in PPR leagues if available, but Blount will start for Detroit and may have to be the alternative option if you need a one-week play and cannot acquire Edwards or Adams.\n\nWIDE RECEIVERS\n\nKEKE COUTEE, Texans (14.3): Most rookie receivers are unreliable, but Coutee seems to have a safer floor than others when he has been healthy. He also seems to be a preferred target over recently acquired veteran Demaryius Thomas, who seems to be fading into the twilight of his career. Coutee already has three double figure PPR performances in four relatively healthy appearances this year.\n\nD.J. MOORE, Panthers (32.0): He previously showed some glimpses of his considerable promise before breaking out with seven catches for 157 yards and a TD in Week 11 against Detroit. Like many first year wideouts, Moore is a risky play and can follow up a big game with a quiet one. But he has the most pure talent and potential of any Carolina WR and the opportunity to take the lead role in the Panthers pass-catching corps if he can continue to trend upward.\n\nTRE'QUAN SMITH (13.4): Because he plays in such an explosive offense, Smith could be the top add of the week, especially after registering 10 catches for 157 yards and a TD in the destruction of the Eagles. Smith seems set to be the Saints' top pure deep playmaker for some time to come. There may be a quiet outing here and there, but it's unlikely in Week 12 against Atlanta.\n\nQUARTERBACKS\n\nJAMEIS WINSTON, Buccaneers (9.4): He Is back as the starter again, but just like the guy he replaced, Ryan Fitzpatrick, he has a lot of upside with big risk. Winston threw four TD passes against the Falcons in Week 6 and was intercepted four times by the Bengals in Week 8. The matchup vs. the 49ers this week can inspire confidence, but he's a roller coaster ride vs. any opponent. Taking Winston is advised if you need to replace Patrick Mahomes or Jared Goff and the waiver wire is very thin at QB, If you have a backup with a safer floor, you may want to stick with that.\n\nBAKER MAYFIELD, Browns (37.5): Mayfield is a very good replacement for Mahomes or Goff, and may not melt like Winston when you need him to be stable. Mayfield has thrown nine TD passes in his past four games, with two TD passes in three of them and three vs. Atlanta before last week's bye. He has a friendly matchup vs. Cincinnati this week.\n\nTIGHT ENDS\n\nCAMERON BRATE, Buccaneers (8.9): Brate has faded into the background recently with the ascension of O.J. Howard, but a knee injury has clouded Howard's outlook for Week 12. If Howard is out or limited against the 49ers, Brate could re-emerge as a prime TD threat for Winston, who has favored him often in scoring situations in the past.\n\nCHRIS HERNDON, Jets (6.6): This rookie does not have much upside, but he caught TD passes in three consecutive games from Weeks 6 to 8 and then caught four passes for 62 yards in Week 9. Herndon may not hurt you this week and is obviously a threat to score. The Jets passing game has looked bad lately, but if they can show respectability against New England, Herndon should be involved somehow.\n\n___\n\nFor more in-depth Week 12 analysis and tips, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: WOW Air)\n\nWOW Air, the Icelandic budget carrier known for $100 one-way fares to Europe, is at it again.\n\nWOW\u2019s latest sale is pegged to Black Friday, which the airline has dubbed \u201cPurple Friday\u201d in a nod to the distinctive paint scheme it uses for its jets.\n\nIn the Purple Friday sale, WOW is offering fares as low as $69 one way to Iceland and $99 one way to other cities in Europe.\n\nThe $69 and $99 one-way fares are available from five U.S. cities, including one of WOW\u2019s West Coast destinations: Los Angeles. Also getting WOW\u2019s lowest Purple Friday fares are Boston, Chicago O\u2019Hare, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. Aside from the $69 flights to Iceland, sale fares are available on connecting flights to Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Frankfurt and London Gatwick.\n\nWOW currently flies to its hub near Iceland\u2019s capital Reykjavik from 13 North American airports. From Reykjavik, connections are available to about two dozen European destinations and to New Delhi, India. WOW\u2019s count of North American markets will drop when it stops flying from St. Louis on Jan. 7, but will grow to 14 once new service Orlando (begins Dec. 19) and Vancouver, Canada (June 6), begin.\n\nAs always, however, there is significant fine print to the latest WOW sale.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Airlines roll out Black Friday, Cyber Monday sales\n\nThe deals apply to travel through April 19, though WOW says the fares will apply only to 3,000 seats on \u201cselected flights.\u201d That means the fares may not be offered on some flights while the cheapest fares could sell out quickly on others, depending how many seats are allocated to the sale fares on each plane.\n\nThe Purple Friday fares also only apply to round-trip bookings, and fares on the return portion are higher than on the European-bound leg.\n\nOn a Pittsburgh-London Gatwick itinerary, for example, a passenger can book a $69 outbound fare to Iceland for travel on Friday, Feb. 8. The cheapest return flights to come back within the next week ranged from $109 to $149. Still, at the time of the spot-check, a Pittsburgh passenger could book a Feb. 8-Feb. 13 itinerary for a total of $178.99.\n\nBut flyers also should be aware that as an ultra-low-cost airline, WOW charges extra for nearly everything beyond boarding the plane. Even carry-ons will cost extra. Adding just one carry-on to the itinerary costs $49.99 each way if made at the time of booking (or $59.99 at the airport), raising the total cost to $278.97.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Icelandair to buy budget rival WOW\n\nAdvance seat assignments ($6.99 and up each way), food and water would add to the total cost. Checked bags for U.S.-Iceland flights begin at $59.99 each way.\n\nA similar Tuesday morning spot-check of WOW\u2019s fares for connecting flights from Chicago to London Gatwick also returned low fares, but also some catches. Chief among them: The lowest-advertised fare to London appeared to be available mostly on Sunday and Monday departures, ruling out a quick weekend getaway for most looking to take advantage of the Purple Friday fares.\n\nStill, in one sample search, a departure on Monday, Feb. 25, was available for $99 one way and could be pared with a $219 return fare on either Friday, March 1, or Sunday, March 3. That would make the base fare about $319, not including bags. For connecting flights to Europe, WOW\u2019s bag fees begin at $49.99 one way for carry-ons and $67.99 for checked bags. Even with just one carry-on (paid for at the time of booking), that would boost the round-trip total to $418.97.\n\nDespite the fine print and fees, the deals can represent a good value for those flexible enough to take advantage of the deal.\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2018/11/20/wow-air-sale-fares-drop-below-100-one-way-europe-flights/2065629002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Doyle Rice", "title": "Prehistoric 'Swiss Army knife' discovered in China", "description": "Forget clubs.

Real \u201ccave men\u201d actually used complex tools as far back as 170,000 years ago, a new study says.\n\nIn fact, artifacts recently found at an archaeological site in China show that one type of sophisticated tool technology emerged in East Asia much earlier than previously thought. The finding also challenges the idea that advanced tool-making was introduced into Asia from the West.\n\nOne tool \u2013 dubbed the \u201cSwiss Army knife\" of prehistoric tools \u2013 was especially efficient and durable, indispensable to a hunter-gatherer society in which a broken spear point could mean certain death at the claws or jaws of a predator.\n\nThe tools are known as \"Levallois\" cores, which are named after a Paris suburb where tools made with this method were first discovered. \"To our knowledge, this is the earliest evidence of Levallois technology in east Asia,\" the study said.\n\nMade by chipping flakes off a stone so that the flakes themselves become the tools, Levallois tools are considered to be a \u201cmiddle stage\u201d in the development of stone tool technology, Archaeology magazine reported.\n\nThese tools are the result of a set of very specific steps of chipping a piece of stone to create similar-size tools suitable to be shaped for a variety of purposes, according to Smithsonian magazine.\n\n\"It used to be thought that Levallois cores came to China relatively recently with modern humans,\" said Ben Marwick, an University of Washington anthropologist and one of the study's co-authors, in a statement. \"Our work reveals the complexity and adaptability of people there that is equivalent to elsewhere in the world. It shows the diversity of the human experience.\"\n\nSeveral different species of humans lived on Earth at this time, including modern ones like us, according to the Smithsonian. But scientists haven\u2019t found any human bones from where these tools were discovered, so they don\u2019t know which species of human made these tools.\n\n\"Hopefully our study will lead to new excavations and more detailed studies in this region,\" said study co-author Bo Li of Australia's University of Wollongong in a statement. \"There are many caves in this region that are perfect for the preservation of tools and fossils, but there haven't been many digs.\n\n\"If we can find a human fossil \u2013 or the fossil of a different species \u2013 then we can then understand more about who made these tools and what the origin of the technique is,\" Li said.\n\nThe study was published Monday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/11/20/swiss-army-knife-prehistoric-tools-discovered-china/2066433002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Patriots Wire", "title": "Did Bill Belichick have takeaways from Chiefs vs. Rams?

And that last drive was meaningless (it was insane that Doug Pederson still had Carson Wentz dropping back to pass). So over the Eagles\u2019 first 10 possessions, they had one drive with more than 19 offensive yards. If the Saints defense is going to play like that the rest of the season? Game over.\n\nSporting News\n\n1. Saints (1) The Saints could have scored 50 against the Eagles if they wanted to.

Since losing to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 1, the New Orleans Saints have been on a rampage that would make Godzilla proud. That the Saints have now won nine in a row is impressive. That the last five have all come against teams that had a winning record at the time is even more so\u2014especially given it included a road win in Minnesota and a victory over the previously undefeated Rams. But apparently that was just a lead-up to their masterpiece, a 48-7 beatdown of the defending Super Bowl champions. It marked the single worst loss that any such champion has ever suffered, according to the Fox broadcast team. It\u2019s hard to say what was more frightening: how thoroughly the Saints destroyed the Eagles, or how easy it was to do it. It\u2019s bad enough that the New Orleans offense moves up and down the field at will. But when the defense plays at the level it did in Week 11, this team is all but unbeatable.

Coogler has handed the keys to the franchise to director Steven Caple Jr., and although \u201cCreed 2\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same rousing magic as the last chapter, it offers intriguing parallel plots of fathers and sons trying to find redemption after loss.\n\nBut first, a history lesson for those too young to remember James Brown strutting to \"Living in America\": In \u201cRocky IV,\u201d Soviet super-boxer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) tragically killed former champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in the ring, leading to an epic bout in Mother Russia where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) toppled the much-bigger Drago.\n\nDecades later, Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) spent the first \u201cCreed\u201d movie finding his own legacy under Rocky\u2019s tutelage, though his father Apollo\u2019s shadow still looms large in his life in the follow-up. But the movie doesn\u2019t come flying out of the corner: It\u2019s a slow burn at the beginning as Adonis is on a winning streak, taking the heavyweight championship and getting engaged to his beloved Bianca (Tessa Thompson).\n\nIt\u2019s when Adonis is bombarded with obstacles that \u201cCreed II\u201d really picks up. Ivan\u2019s intimidating son Viktor Drago (real-life pugilist Florian \u201cBig Nasty\u201d Munteanu) publicly challenges Adonis for his title, a matchup that drives a wedge between Adonis and Rocky, who remembers all too well what happened the last time a Creed faced a Drago. And having a baby daughter on the way is another stunning blow to Adonis\u2019 existential crisis: In the first film, he became a fighter, but in this one, he must become a man.\n\nRocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone, left) psychs up Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) in the ring in \"Creed II.\" (Photo: BARRY WETCHER)\n\nShort of a rockin\u2019 Survivor tune, \u201cCreed II\u201d checks all the \u201cRocky\u201d boxes: More than one big match, multiple variations on Ivan Drago's signature \"I must break you,\" underdog chutzpah, predictable plot threads and, most importantly, the orchestral training montage.\n\nIn terms of stand-up-on-your-feet, in-ring action, the new film falls short of Coogler\u2019s \u201cCreed\u201d work \u2013 and that memorable \u201cRocky IV\u201d main event \u2013 but Caple has a knack for showcasing the dichotomy of Adonis\u2019 skilled technique vs. Viktor\u2019s bruising power, where every one of young Drago\u2019s strikes feels like a cannon shot. And the director makes sure the audience feels the specter of Apollo, too, as Adonis is put through the physical wringer in brutal fashion.\n\nRelated: How Michael B. Jordan got even more muscles for 'Creed 2'\n\nMore: Michael B.

Jordan seemingly gets better \u2013 and more muscular \u2013 in every movie, and the \u201cBlack Panther\u201d star unleashes the character\u2019s conflicted soul in important ways.\n\nIvan Drago (Dolph Lundgren, left) and son Viktor (Florian Munteanu) are on a quest for revenge in \"Creed II.\" (Photo: BARRY WETCHER)\n\nAdonis\u2019 name is in the title but, as pointed out in the film by sly boxing promoter Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby), the audience wants \u201ca narrative, something that\u2019ll stick to the ribs,\u201d and that comes in the form of the Dragos.\n\nYour ultimate Thanksgiving movie guide: A slam dunk for every holiday scenario\n\nPreview: 10 movies you must see this holiday season, from 'Fantastic Beasts' to 'Mary Poppins'\n\nThey\u2019re the antagonists, sure, yet their story is arguably the most engrossing.

(AP Photo/Joel Auerbach, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Dwyane Wade is back with the Miami Heat.\n\nWade ended his paternity leave Tuesday night, checking in for the Heat midway through the first quarter of their game against the Brooklyn Nets. He said his wife and their daughter are doing well, which allowed him to feel comfortable resuming his season after a seven-game hiatus.\n\n\"I'm going to obviously miss them,\" Wade said. \"It was tough leaving my little girl and my wife, but I've got to get back to work and I'll see them again soon.\"\n\nWade and his wife Gabrielle Union-Wade welcomed Kaavia James Union Wade into the world on Nov. 7. Wade had been in Los Angeles with them since then, and flew back to Miami on Monday.\n\nHis return is most certainly welcome in Miami. The Heat went 2-5 in his time away, falling to 6-10 this season entering the game against the Nets. They were playing Tuesday without guards Goran Dragic (knee), Tyler Johnson (hamstring) and Dion Waiters (ankle recovery from last season).\n\n\"There's a human element to this business and to the game and it is the most important thing,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"The connection, your spirit, your emotions, everybody getting on the same page, and just seeing Dwyane back here with the guys there was a tangible boost in the energy today in the shootaround.\"\n\nWade is Miami's third-leading scorer this season, entering Tuesday at 14.3 points per game. He was in his best stretch of the season when he got the call that his daughter was coming a few weeks earlier than planned.\n\nHe said he felt the frustration level his team has gone through in the past couple weeks, and he tried to keep in touch via texts and phone calls. Wade kept up conditioning while in Los Angeles, but knows it'll take a little time to get back to the level of a few weeks ago.\n\n\"I was so excited for my daughter to come, but I was like, 'Baby, you know, your dad was playing in a rhythm. You could have waited a little while,'\" Wade said. \"I was just getting my legs under me, but great things happened to make me miss time, and now I'm back.\"\n\nThe baby was born via a surrogate, which is one of the reasons why Wade felt taking a brief paternity leave was necessary.\n\nParents of surrogate-carried babies are told the first few days after the birth are critical to forging deep bonds with their child. Lots of skin-to-skin contact and talking to the baby helps with the bonding.\n\nSo Wade needed time, and the Heat supported the plan.\n\n\"So much of this league is mood of the team and confidence,\" Heat guard Josh Richardson said. \"With him back, we're definitely a lot more confident moving forward.\"\n\nUnion-Wade \u2014 who revealed she had nine miscarriages in her 2017 book \"We're Going to Need More Wine\" \u2014 has taken time off work to bond with the new arrival. She's been filming an upcoming project in Los Angeles, and when she's back on the set, Kaavia James will be close by.\n\n\"She was working right up until we got the call,\" Wade said. \"When she goes back, my daughter will be going back to the set with her. Her trailer is fit for everything, the baby's safety, everything. So our baby will be there with her when she's at work.\"\n\nWade strongly considered retirement during the offseason because of the baby's arrival, not making the decision to return until just before training camp in September. He questioned whether it was fair to his wife and their family to still be playing and traveling while raising a baby.\n\nHe also wondered if he could handle being away from his daughter for long stretches.\n\n\"We went through a lot to get here,\" Wade said. \"My family had to come first right now.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Ken Hitchcock knows the routine well by now as he begins his tenure as new coach of the Edmonton Oilers. For the fourth time in his long coaching career, Hitchcock has been tasked with taking over a struggling team in the middle of the season.\n\nHitchcock was hired Tuesday as coach of his hometown Oilers after the team fired Todd McLellan with the team languishing in sixth place in the Pacific Division.\n\n\"It's not going to change overnight, but we can start taking some steps,\" said Hitchcock, who led St. Louis to a first-place finish in 2011-12 after taking over as coach one month into the season. \"I told the players today I can take them to a place personally that they can't get to themselves, but they've got to buy into that, and it's not going to be comfortable at times.\"\n\nThe Oilers have lost six of seven games, getting outscored 27-11 in those losses, in a rough start to McLellan's fourth season behind the bench. The team missed the playoffs in two of his previous three seasons despite having superstar Connor McDavid on its roster and the Oilers were just 9-10-1 entering their game Tuesday night at San Jose.\n\n\"It's tough to pinpoint what we need, but we're all to blame here,\" McDavid said. \"This obviously isn't on Todd at all. It's on us as players. That's just how the business works sometimes. We got to wake up here.\"\n\nMcLellan is the fourth coach to be fired already this season, following John Stevens in Los Angeles, Joel Quenneville in Chicago and Mike Yeo in St. Louis. The Oilers are ahead of only the Blues and the Kings in the Western Conference standings.\n\n\"Obviously we're in a rough patch here,\" general manager Peter Chiarelli said. \"We're leading into American Thanksgiving. It's a bit of a template for making the playoffs. I felt I was seeing some things that I had seen last year after not seeing them for quite a fair bit this year, and these recurring themes, I wanted to nip them in the bud.\"\n\nThe 66-year-old Hitchcock announced his retirement in April after a 22-year coaching career, which included a Stanley Cup with the Dallas Stars in 1999. He had two stints in Dallas as well as head coaching stops in Philadelphia (2002-2006), Columbus (2006-2010) and St. Louis (2011-2017).\n\nHitchcock is the third-winningest coach in NHL history with an overall record of 823-506-88-119 (.603 winning percentage). He has guided teams to eight division titles and twice to the best record in the NHL and has an 86-82 playoff record.\n\n\"It's definitely going to be tough,\" said forward Kyle Brodziak, who played for Hitchcock in St. Louis. \"It's always an adjustment. Guys will have to get used to different styles. Hitch is a hard coach, He's going to be tough on guys and demand a lot. We have to be ready to produce and face the music for sure.\"\n\nSt. Louis made the playoffs in each of Hitchcock's five full seasons, reaching the Western Conference finals in 2016. The Blues abruptly fired Hitchcock in February 2017, cutting short what was already going to be his last season in St. Louis. He returned to Dallas with the hope of getting the Stars back to the playoffs but a late-season slump kept them out for the second straight year and the eighth time in 10 seasons.\n\nIn April, Hitchcock said he was retiring for good but changed his mind when the chance to coach the Oilers came up.\n\nHe pointed to the chance to coach in his native Edmonton in an organization with many people he has worked with in the past, including with Chiarelli on Team Canada in 2014 as a reason to come back. Hitchcock said he also looks forward to coaching the 21-year-old McDavid, who has won the past two scoring titles.\n\n\"He's an awesome player. But he has an awesome responsibility,\" Hitchcock said. \"It's not just scoring goals and getting points and stuff like that. He sets the competitive tone of the hockey club. I can really help him. I've been through some really good players who learned to adapt and do those things. I can help him along there and get him to understand what his responsibility is because he's carrying too much of the burden and he needs to lighten the load a little bit.\"\n\nThere is plenty of blame to go around for the lackluster start in Edmonton by a top-heavy roster led by McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. Chiarelli traded winger Taylor Hall to New Jersey for defenseman Adam Larsson in June 2016, and then signed forward Milan Lucic to a seven-year, $42 million contract a few days later. Hall won the Hart Trophy as league MVP last season, while Lucic has two goals in his last 66 games.\n\nHitchcock becomes the seventh coach for the Oilers since the team fired Craig McTavish at the end of the 2008-09 season, following Pat Quinn, Tom Renney, Ralph Krueger, Dallas Eakins, Todd Nelson and McLellan.\n\n\"He's always had very good defensive teams,\" Lucic said of Hitchcock. \"We need to come together as a group no matter who the coach is.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFull AP NHL coverage: http://apne.ws/knlt47s\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

What do you think you are doing?\u201d Khashoggi says early in a recording from a unit of the consulate that deals with visas and other routine paperwork.

More than an hour later, another man's voice is heard saying: \u201cIt is spooky to wear the clothes of a man whom we killed 20 minutes ago.\"\n\nThe recordings have been given to intelligence officials in the U.S. and Canada as well as several European nations. Trump said U.S. intelligence officers have listened to them, but he has not.\n\nKhashoggi, 59, had gone to the consulate to obtain paperwork for his upcoming marriage. His subsequent disappearance directed severe scrutiny on the kingdom. Video footage showed Khashoggi entering the consulate but not leaving it.\n\nThe Saudis initially claimed Khashoggi had left the consulate that day, and security footage shows someone wearing his clothes walking away. For weeks Saudi Arabia denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate.\n\nThe Saudis ultimately revised the story, saying Khashoggi died after a fight broke out during his interrogation. The regime said 18 people had been arrested in the incident. A Saudi prosecutor said last week the death penalty would be sought for five suspects.\n\nMore: President Donald Trump has many ways to penalize Saudi Arabia\n\nMore: Trump trying to resolve foreign policy crisis over Khashoggi murder\n\nTurkish authorities say Khashoggi was strangled to death and his body dismembered \u2013 and that the hit squad was sent by the \"highest levels\" of the Saudi government.

The curb-to-gate transformation includes an enhanced dining program that features L.A. brands Trejo\u2019s Tacos (from actor Danny Trejo), Cassell\u2019s Hamburgers and Urth Caffe and Bar.\n\nTom\u2019s Urban Kitchen and Tivoli Brewery, a Colorado-based brew pub/restaurant, opened earlier this month at the Westin Denver International Airport hotel that sits just off the outdoor plaza at Denver International Airport. This is the first restaurant at Denver to have an on-site brewery, and its Jet Indian pale ale will be exclusive to the airport.\n\nThe Denver Central Market also just opened at DEN\u2019s Gate A6. Modeled after the original location in Denver\u2019s RiNo District, the gourmet market and food hall includes hand-crafted pizzas at Vero Italian; artisanal meats, cheeses and sandwiches by Culture Meat & Cheese; rotisserie chicken and fresh salads from SK Provisions; and Sushi Rama.\n\nAnd at United Airlines' Terminal E at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the Rockwell Group and OTG (the \u201corder by tablet\u201d company) is just about done with a terminal-wide retail and dining overhaul.\n\nOf note are four restaurants (with bars) that opened in the past year.\n\nThe menu at Tanglewood Grille (by Gate E23) includes \u201cTexas tavern specialties\u201d such as grilled trout, carne asada, the All Day Burger (topped with a fried egg) and a Texas-sized Beerhall Pretzel that, with an accompanying dip, is a meal (for one or two) on its own.\n\nThe shiny Q stretches from Gate E2 to E9 and sits in a space that once housed a moving walkway. This authentic Texas barbecue inside the airport has on-site smokers operating around the clock and an open-flame grill for prepping barbecue standards such as brisket, ribs, pulled pork, chicken, turkey and sausage.\n\nWith its red lanterns, waving good-luck cats and mahjong-tiled bar, pan-Asian restaurant Yume is hard to miss (but easy to Instagram) by Gate E11. In addition to sushi, sashimi and dumplings, the menu includes rice bowls and ramen.\n\nNewest on the scene is Gavi (Gate E14), an Italian al fresco-style restaurant with a menu that includes creative antipasti, fresh pizza and paninis, super-healthy salads, ancient-grain bowls, and classic Italian entrees such as spaghetti and meatballs, chicken, beef or shrimp spiedini, and shrimp fettuccine. All pasta is made on-site in the open kitchen (entertaining to watch) and for dessert the choice is tiramisu or cannoli.

What do you think you are doing?\u201d Khashoggi says early in a recording from a unit of the consulate that deals with visas and other routine paperwork.

Trump said U.S. intelligence officers have listened to them, but he has not.\n\nKhashoggi, 59, had gone to the consulate to obtain paperwork for his upcoming marriage. His subsequent disappearance directed severe scrutiny on the kingdom.

For weeks Saudi Arabia denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate.\n\nThe Saudis ultimately revised the story, saying Khashoggi died after a fight broke out during his interrogation.

In 2017, American granted additional raises \u2014 8 percent on average for pilots and 5 percent for flight attendants \u2014 that cost close to $1 billion over three years and angered some investors.\n\nCarey also said the union wants American to reduce its practice of shifting on-duty pilots to fill in for others who call in sick, can't legally handle a flight because of crew-rest requirements, or other reasons.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: American adds Dubrovnik, Berlin and Bologna amid international shake-up\n\nRescheduling is a frequent subject of complaints among American's pilots. Carey said it leads to delays or canceled flights. American's operation, he said, \"is not running as well as it should be.\"\n\nThrough August, nearly 24 percent of flights on American and American Eagle have arrived at least 15 minutes late, the worst record among the four largest U.S. airlines, according to government figures. American is on pace for its lowest on-time rating since 2014.\n\nAirline spokesman Matt Miller said the company and the union have worked together \"to improve the lives of our 15,000 pilots over the past several years and we are eager to build on that relationship\" in negotiations.\n\nMiller said the company's scheduling practices comply with federal rules and contracts with pilot and flight attendant unions. He said pilots are only rescheduled when there are disruptions, including bad weather.\n\n\"We understand the impact this can have on our pilots and we always try to balance that impact with the impact to our customers,\" he said.\n\nAmerican's management faces negotiations with pilots and, shortly after that, flight attendants, as its profit is falling due to higher fuel costs. This year through September, Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines Group earned $1.1 billion, down 41 percent from a year ago. The airline's stock has dropped 31 percent since the start of the year.\n\n\"Sentiment on (American) may be as bad as it's been since the shares started trading in 2013. To some, the situation feels hopeless,\" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote recently in a note to clients.\n\nKeay blamed the bearish outlook on thin profit margins, high debt and lack of free cash flow. He also called on American to fix its operation, even if it costs money.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: American completes 'Heritage' plane rollout with TWA, AirCal paint jobs\n\nIN PICTURES:Retro photos from American Airlines' predecessor airlines\n\nIN PICTURES: Scenes from US Airways' last-ever flight\n\nAmerican Airlines' Boeing 777 tails are seen at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Oct. 14, 2016.

He said the Irish will support Burns, who is from Troy, New York, \"as he takes the next step in his academic and playing careers.\" The announcement came hours before a Tuesday night game against Duquesne.\n\nAfter missing his freshman season recovering from March 2015 ankle surgery, Burns has a year of eligibility remaining and could have 1\u00bd seasons if he finds a school that can give him immediate eligibility as a graduate transfer.\n\nEarlier this month, Burns had a career-high 15 points with five rebounds in 17 minutes of action in Notre Dame's 89-62 victory over Chicago State. Brey rewarded Burns with a start in Notre Dame's next game, a 63-60 loss to Radford when he played 12 minutes and had no points and two rebounds. He played just four minutes in a win over William & Mary, finishing with one rebound and one blocked shot.\n\nIn 44 career games, two of them as a starter, Burns averaged nine minutes, 2.2 points, 2.1 rebounds and was 28 of 68 (41.2 percent) from the field.\n\nWith his departure, Notre Dame has 10 scholarship players.

Also getting WOW\u2019s lowest Purple Friday fares are Boston, Chicago O\u2019Hare, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. Aside from the $69 flights to Iceland, sale fares are available on connecting flights to Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Frankfurt and London Gatwick.\n\nWOW currently flies to its hub near Iceland\u2019s capital Reykjavik from 13 North American airports. From Reykjavik, connections are available to about two dozen European destinations and to New Delhi, India. WOW\u2019s count of North American markets will drop when it stops flying from St. Louis on Jan. 7, but will grow to 14 once new service Orlando (begins Dec. 19) and Vancouver, Canada (June 6), begin.\n\nAs always, however, there is significant fine print to the latest WOW sale.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Airlines roll out Black Friday, Cyber Monday sales\n\nThe deals apply to travel through April 19, though WOW says the fares will apply only to 3,000 seats on \u201cselected flights.\u201d That means the fares may not be offered on some flights while the cheapest fares could sell out quickly on others, depending how many seats are allocated to the sale fares on each plane.\n\nThe Purple Friday fares also only apply to round-trip bookings, and fares on the return portion are higher than on the European-bound leg.\n\nOn a Pittsburgh-London Gatwick itinerary, for example, a passenger can book a $69 outbound fare to Iceland for travel on Friday, Feb. 8. The cheapest return flights to come back within the next week ranged from $109 to $149. Still, at the time of the spot-check, a Pittsburgh passenger could book a Feb. 8-Feb. 13 itinerary for a total of $178.99.\n\nBut flyers also should be aware that as an ultra-low-cost airline, WOW charges extra for nearly everything beyond boarding the plane. Even carry-ons will cost extra. Adding just one carry-on to the itinerary costs $49.99 each way if made at the time of booking (or $59.99 at the airport), raising the total cost to $278.97.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Icelandair to buy budget rival WOW\n\nAdvance seat assignments ($6.99 and up each way), food and water would add to the total cost. Checked bags for U.S.-Iceland flights begin at $59.99 each way.\n\nA similar Tuesday morning spot-check of WOW\u2019s fares for connecting flights from Chicago to London Gatwick also returned low fares, but also some catches. Chief among them: The lowest-advertised fare to London appeared to be available mostly on Sunday and Monday departures, ruling out a quick weekend getaway for most looking to take advantage of the Purple Friday fares.\n\nStill, in one sample search, a departure on Monday, Feb. 25, was available for $99 one way and could be pared with a $219 return fare on either Friday, March 1, or Sunday, March 3. That would make the base fare about $319, not including bags. For connecting flights to Europe, WOW\u2019s bag fees begin at $49.99 one way for carry-ons and $67.99 for checked bags. Even with just one carry-on (paid for at the time of booking), that would boost the round-trip total to $418.97.\n\nDespite the fine print and fees, the deals can represent a good value for those flexible enough to take advantage of the deal.\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2018/11/20/wow-air-sale-fares-drop-below-100-one-way-europe-flights/2065629002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jeff Zillgitt, USA TODAY", "title": "As LeBron James returns to Cleveland again, memories of vitriolic 2010 Heat game surface", "description": "'The enemy has left the locker room.'

He wanted to deliver the championship-starved city an NBA title, then left to join friends in sun-splashed Miami.When the schedule was released, Dec. 2 was the date Cavs fans circled.\n\nThey were going to let James have it and everybody knew, including President Obama, who told reporters the day of the game, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be brutal.\u201d\n\nIt was actually much worse than that.\n\n\u201cDuring the intros, it was (as) vile as anything I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d former Cavs general manager David Griffin said.\n\nNearly eight years later, James is scheduled to return to Cleveland again, as he and the Los Angeles Lakers come to town on Wednesday. This summer, he left the Cavs after four consecutive NBA Finals appearances and one NBA championship. Whatever happens, it won\u2019t be as bad as that cold December night in Cleveland.\n\nMiami\u2019s Dwyane Wade, coach Erik Spoelstra and former players Chris Bosh and Jawad Williams; former Cavs front office executive Griffin; fan Jason Herron; reporters Howard Beck, Brian Windhorst, Rachel Nichols and Bill Reiter; and TNT analyst Charles Barkley recall the scene.\n\nPart 1: The backdrop\n\nNo matter how James informed the Cavs he was leaving, it would\u2019ve been met with anger. But ESPN's hour-long show \"The Decision\" \u2013 which then-NBA commissioner David Stern called ill-conceived \u2013 exacerbated emotions. Cavs owner Dan Gilbert\u2019s impulsive screed demonizing James galvanized fans. It was a city, region and fan base against one man, the homegrown talent whom fans believed would lead Cleveland \u2013 a city desperate for success \u2013 to its first NBA title.\n\nHerron, Cavaliers season-ticket holder, James jersey burner: \u201cAbout two, three weeks into the season, we knew we weren\u2019t going to be a very good team. We knew we had to beat LeBron because the way LeBron left us. He was the national villain. Leading up to that game, that\u2019s all everyone in Cleveland talked about.\u201d\n\nGriffin, who was VP of basketball operations in 2010: \u201cThe whole buildup to it was incredible. I got there in September of 2010. \u2019Bron had left in July of 2010, and it felt like you were jumping into a burning building. Everywhere in the city, he was getting murdered \u2013 on sports radio. When people found out I worked for the Cavs, all they wanted to do was murder LeBron.\"\n\nWindhorst, ESPN, native of Akron: \u201cI was hoping for two things. One, that the Cavs would not stoke the fire. ... I was hoping that this wouldn\u2019t become an infamous moment like 10-cent beer night where it became something else Cleveland was known for that wasn\u2019t positive.\u201d\n\nWilliams, former Cavs player who grew up in Cleveland and played in that game: \u201cTo a certain extent, I understood the anger. But the people who were really close to him and knew him, we didn\u2019t have any issues with him leaving. It was a weird situation. ... I know what it\u2019s like to be cut, to be traded, to be released. I understood what it meant to make a decision for yourself and the team not making that decision for you.\u201d\n\nA fan yells at Miami Heat forward LeBron James during his return to Cleveland on Dec. 2, 2010. (Photo: Tony Dejak, AP)\n\nPart 2: The pregame\n\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer asked the team chaplain how fans should respond. Forgiveness, it turns out, was not the answer for fans. Gilbert\u2019s plan to launch an investigation into tampering claims against the Heat was leaked the day before the game.\n\nJames, to reporters in Miami: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun but at the same time, it\u2019s going to be very emotionally draining just to go back. It\u2019s going to be difficult I think. \u2026 it\u2019s going to be tough. But I\u2019m there to win a basketball game. I understand how passionate the fans are about sports. I\u2019m ready for whatever response I\u2019m going to get.\u201d\n\nGriffin: \u201cCleveland is so provincial and everyone there loves it so much in part because they survive it together. He was one of theirs. This was the prodigal son returning but it was also the prodigal son leaving. This was the guy who ripped their heart out of their chest. They were going to let him have it to feel themselves again.\u201d\n\nBosh, Heat forward, to reporters in 2010: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to expect, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be something we\u2019ve never seen before. A lot of people are going to come out and show their support for the Cavaliers \u2013 in their own kind of way.\u201d\n\nHerron: \u201cThe night before, there was a rally downtown, and it was so full of hate. I was one of the hosts. We tore his jersey apart on stage. All the urinals in the bar had LeBron\u2019s face on it. I just remember feeling dirty about it. Yes, we didn\u2019t like LeBron. But then, I was getting scared about what the environment at the game was going to be like. Is someone going to run on the court and take a swing at him? Is someone going to throw something and injure the guy? I remember doing a couple of interviews and saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to boo, but I\u2019m going to do it respectfully. I\u2019m not going to cross the line.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWade, James\u2019 friend and teammate that season: \u201cWe faced a lot of hate that year because of the decision that LeBron made. That night, when you got to Cleveland, you felt it. There was just something in the air.\u201d\n\nFans held signs and led chants and jeers as LeBron James took the court and played his first game in Cleveland as a member of the Miami Heat. (Photo: Gregory Shamus, Getty Images)\n\nPart 3: The crowd\n\nTo prepare, the Cavs, Heat and NBA provided extra security. Fans booed, yelled obscenities and some threw things, including one battery and cups filled with drinks. They held their signs: \"Quitness.\" \"11-8? Looks like you left your talents in South Beach.\" \"Witnessed No Championship.\" \"I Hate LeBron.\" Some fans created a chant card, instructing what and when to chant. \u201cAkron hates you,\u201d \u201cWitnessed Nothing,\u201d \u201cScottie Pippen,\u201d \u201cNo Ring King,\u201d and \u201cTraitor, Traitor.\u201d Four fans were ejected and one was arrested, according to the team.\n\nSpoelstra, Heat coach: \u201cYou could feel the crowd, and I hadn\u2019t even stepped into the bowl yet. I was 100 yards away. ... There was a tangible vitriol that I\u2019ve never felt. You could feel the intensity and anger and pain of the crowd.\u201d\n\nBeck, Bleacher Report, who worked at The New York Times in 2010: \u201c ... In my 21 years of covering the NBA and covering how many hundreds of games, I\u2019ve never seen anything like that night, and I hope I never see anything like that night again.\u201d\n\nGriffin: \u201cWhen he was introduced, it was the most loudest, hateful, vile vitriol I\u2019ve ever heard in any building for any reason. I\u2019ve taken a battery off the head sitting courtside at European games. I\u2019ve been at Greek games where they\u2019ve ripped the seats out of the concrete and thrown them at each other. I was at a Cibona-Partizan game (in Belgrade) where they shot flares across the court. But those were foreign languages I didn\u2019t understand. This was as hateful as anything I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d\n\nBill Reiter, CBS radio host and writer who covered the Heat for Fox Sports in 2010: \"Joe Goodman (Miami Herald Heat beat writer) and I were running to our seats for the start of the game, and we get in the elevator and a security guard holds the door for us. There was all this extra security for LeBron that was run by the authorities there. A walkie-talkie crackles and someone asks, \u2018Where\u2019s LeBron?\u2019 You hear a security guard say, \u2018The enemy has left the locker room. I repeat, code name \u2018The Enemy\u2019 has left the locker room.\u2019 I look at Joe, and it hits me, the people protecting LeBron James have labeled him the enemy. A security guard looks at us and shrugs with one of those looks.\u201d\n\nBarkley, TNT analyst: \u201cEasily the most hostile NBA game I\u2019ve ever been to in 30 years in the NBA. It was intense. It was worse than I thought it was going to be.\"\n\nBeck: \"It was disturbing because there was so much hate and lack of regard for decency in a public space. There are children in attendance. That\u2019s not right.\n\n\"There were chants that invoked LeBron\u2019s parents. I thought the chants involving his parents were way below the belt and over the line.\"\n\nNichols, ESPN: \"When he left, it felt like a rejection to so many people in Ohio and not just a rejection of the Cavs but a rejection of them and this is a part of the country that has felt rejected by other people around the country. To have that happen with the guy who was not only the most popular sports figure in town but a native son, someone who was from there, to have him be the one who left them behind and said 'I\u2019m going for the glamorous coast instead of staying in the heartland.' It really struck a chord that has much more to do with so many more things than LeBron James.\"\n\nJames, postgame on Dec. 2: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal between me and the fans. It\u2019s never personal. They\u2019re frustrated and I understand that. I\u2019m frustrated, too. We never did accomplish here what we wanted to.\u201d\n\nDwyane Wade on the game: 'The one thing that was so amazing about it was the way he performed.' (Photo: Gregory Shamus, Getty Images)\n\nPart 4: The performance\n\nAlready a two-time MVP winner by the start of the 2010-11 season, James scored 38 points, including24 in the third quarter when the Heat opened a 95-65 lead. He also had eight assists and five rebounds in Miami\u2019s 118-90 win. It was spot-on foreshadowing. The Heat was turning its season around after a slow start with James, Wade and Bosh .For the Cavs, it was the second loss in a 37-game stretch that would yield just one victory. It led to Cleveland winning the lottery and drafting Kyrie Irving.\n\nWade: \u201cI just remember taking it upon myself and telling the other guys, \u2018Listen, we have to get off to a good start for him. This is important for him to come back and play well and obviously get a win. But we have to get off to a good start and let him ease into the game.\u2019 ... The one thing that was so amazing about it was the way he performed.\u201d\n\nHerron: \u201cHe tore us to shreds. It was a man amongst boys. He destroyed us.\u201d\n\nGriffin: \u201cI remember sitting with (then-Cavs GM) Chris Grant in our box, and we were talking about, \u2018Gosh, I wish the fans would just shut up. I think they\u2019re pissing him off.\u2019 ... As the game went along, he was so good and so not riled, people started remembering why they loved him in the first place. By the end of the third quarter, there were people cheering his made baskets.\"\n\nWindhorst: \u201cHe basically broke the crowd\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nJames, to TNT after the game: \u201cI know this court, and I\u2019ve made a lot of shots on this court. I just wanted to be aggressive, just try to keep them out of the game. I knew they were going to try and make a run in the third quarter. We are able to get stops and able to get some shots.\u201d\n\nWilliams: \u201cIf you watch at the end of the game, he gives me a hug. ... I got a call from my agent, probably a day or two later. My agent said he just a call from somebody in the Cavs front office \u2013 I won\u2019t say who it is \u2013 but the person said to my agent, \u2018Why did he have to hug LeBron at the end of the game?\u2019 I was like, 'I\u2019ve known him before the NBA. My relationship with him is bigger than basketball.' LeBron came over and gave me words of encouragement and told me to keep going because he knew my situation contract-wise. That was that.\u201d\n\nPart five: The return II\n\nHe came back to the Cavs following four years with Miami and led Cleveland to its sought-after championship in 2016, beating the Golden State Warriors in seven games. Fans may be disappointed he left again, but the same anger won\u2019t be there. He delivered on his goal to win a title for the franchise, city and region. It is a joyous story that may never happen again.\n\nJames in 2013, still with Miami, for another game in Cleveland: \u201cIt can\u2019t get no worse than year one, Dec. 2, 2010. Can\u2019t get no worse than that.\u201d\n\nBeck: \u201cI have to believe that this time they\u2019re welcoming back a guy who brought them their first championship in a half century, that this time they\u2019re welcoming back a hometown hero who redeemed himself and who gave them four years of nothing but joy.\u201d\n\nBarkley: \u201cWhen he goes back, he\u2019ll be a hero.\u201d\n\nReiter: \u201cThere may be some booing, but I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of recognition of the very complicated, and in the end positive, relationship he\u2019s had with that place. It will be just as emotionally complicated this time around as it was the last time.\u201d\n\nHerron: \u201cHe fulfilled his promise, brought us a championship and all is forgiven. There\u2019ll be very few boos, and zero from me.\u201d\n\nNichols: Winning a title and fulfilling that promise has made a huge difference. The work he\u2019s done in the community and with the school in Akron make a huge difference. The climate of the country and the climate of the city are different. The Cleveland Indians are better. The Browns have some hope in Baker Mayfield. Not everything is on him. Also, he did come back.\"\n\nWindhorst: \u201cI\u2019m expecting a standing ovation. I\u2019m expecting a wonderful tribute video where the culmination is him making the blocked shot on Andre Iguodala. It\u2019s complicated to honor him while he\u2019s still in the league. ... With every day that passes, the 2016 championship becomes more impressive as we see how great the Warriors are and we see how difficult it was to keep the Cavs together. It is worth something more than your run-of-the-mill title.\u201d\n\nWilliams: \u201cI think he\u2019ll be embraced. ... I think there\u2019ll be nothing but love when he returns.\u201d\n\nJames, to reporters following Sunday's game against Miami: \"I will see some familiar faces, like I did when I arrived (in Miami). I'll think about some of the good, I'll think about some of the bad, I'll think about some of the great that I had with the franchise, obviously. And then once the tip-ball gets going, it'll be time to go to work. It'll be good to see some of my family that's going to come to the game, see some of my friends as well, and get the thing going. ... Whatever happens happens, but I will be in uniform, I will be there and I will be trying to get a victory. That's what's most important.\"\n\nFollow Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "My First Performance: Olivia Williams", "description": "British actress Olivia Williams\u2019 stage debut is a thing of myth.

They\u2019re playing the one-and-done game \u2013 something that Coach K initially did not embrace. Coach Cal, however, did. Now that [Coach K] is doing it, and he\u2019s the best coach of the modern-day era, you see players like Cam Reddish knocking down shots, playing well on defense. R.J. Barrett, who led the team in scoring.\u201d\n\nCoach K has fielded plenty of teams over the past few decades that could accurately be described as \u201cvillainous\u201d \u2013 from Christian Laettner\u2019s back-to-back national championship team, to J.J. Redick\u2019s 2003-04 team, to the Grayson Allen era. The trio of Zion Williamson, R.J. Barrett and Cam Reddish, however, have done absolutely nothing to draw the ire of anyone.\n\nThe 2018-19 Blue Devils are phenomenally talented, yes, but they\u2019re also a joy to watch. Each of their games has been closer to a 40-minute highlight reel than a typical college basketball game, and while Duke\u2019s dominance may wear thin as the season progresses, for now the Blue Devils are appointment television in a way few college basketball teams have been before.\n\nIt\u2019s misguided to claim that Coach K is only now embracing \u201cone-and-done\u201d players, or that loading up his roster with one-and-dones is the only reason this Duke team is so good. John Calipari may have gotten the jump on one-and-dones at Memphis, and later by welcoming John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Daniel Orton to Kentucky in 2009 \u2013 but Krzyzewski recruited Kyrie Irving in 2010, and followed up with Austin Rivers a year later.\n\nCoach K has recruited 14 one-and-done players since Irving \u2013 but most of those players did not win a national championship, most notably the loaded roster that featured Marvin Bagley and Wendell Carter Jr. a season ago. Duke is the unanimous No. 1 not because they\u2019ve hit a quota of one-and-dones, but because this team appears to be truly special through four games of the season. It\u2019s still early in the season, but the Blue Devils may have a chance to go down as one of the great teams in college basketball history.

All five stocks, which had been leading the market higher during the bull market, are now down more than 20 percent from their highs in the past year, which puts them in bear-market territory. The biggest decliners are Facebook, which has been hounded by data privacy issues, down nearly 40 percent from its recent peak, and Netflix, which is off 37 percent.\n\n\"The sell-off is a continuation of the rotation away from high-flying tech names and ongoing worries about the U.S.-China trade (dispute),\" says Nick Sargen, senior investment advisor for Fort Washington Investment Advisors.\n\nAt the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, which was down almost 600 points at its low, was 552 points lower at 24,466 and trading 1 percent below where it finished in 2017. The S&P 500 finished 1.8 percent lower, pushing it into negative territory for the year. The large-company stock index, considered a proxy for the health of the broader market, briefly dipped 10 percent below its Sept. 20 high, putting it back in so-called \"correction territory.\" It finished the session 9.9 percent below its peak.\n\nThe technology-dominated Nasdaq, which had fallen close to 3 percent earlier and briefly into the red for the year, fell 1.7 percent, extending its losses from its late August high to nearly 15 percent.\n\nAfter Tuesday's plunge, the Dow is 8.8 percent off its recent high.\n\nIn a sign of just how bad the carnage on Wall Street has been in the recent sell-off, more than 45 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 are down more than 20 percent from their highs in the past year, according to Bloomberg data. That means nearly half of the stocks in the broad index are in a bear market.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 is only halfway to a bear market drop of 20 percent, Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, told clients in a report this week that he believes Wall Street is already in a bear market.

Andrew Collins was arrested Sept. 20 after he was spotted standing naked at his hotel window. He says he didn't know he was visible from inside the terminal at Denver International Airport. (Photo: Denver Police Department)\n\nA United Airlines pilot is facing an indecency charge for standing naked in front of his hotel room window on Sept. 20.\n\nCaptain Andrew Collins, who has flown for United for 22 years, says he was unaware that he was giving an eyeful to the people in Denver International Airport's glass-encased main terminal. The police, on the other hand, claim was fully aware of what he was doing.\n\nCollins, who is based in Northern Virginia, insisted in an interview with The Denver Post that he was not aware he could be seen by people in the terminal. The airline is currently reviewing the incident.\n\nUnited Airlines spokeswoman Erin Benson told USA TODAY that Collins has been \u201cremoved from his duties pending an internal review,\" adding, \"We are cooperating with authorities on their investigation.\u201d\n\nCollins, 54, recounted the incident in an interview with the Post published Monday.\n\nHe said he had just woken up after a rough day of being diverted to airports across the country. By the time he went to bed the night before, he had been up for 30 hours.\n\n\u201cI was getting ready for a shower and was talking on the phone,\u201d Collins told the Post. \u201cIt was a beautiful morning and I opened the curtains to my window. I couldn\u2019t see the terminal.\u201d\n\nCollins' attorney, Craig SIlverman, says that standing outside the glass-encased main terminal at DIA is like \"looking at a green wall or a green mirror.\u201d But thanks to the mid-morning sun, people standing inside the terminal can see into rooms at the nearby Westin hotel. (Photo: Denver International Airport)\n\nHe said he was unaware that people inside the terminal could see him for the duration of his 24-minute phone call.\n\nBy the time the call was over, officers from the Denver Police Department were pounding on the door of Collins' room in the Westin Hotel. They handcuffed him and took him to the airport's jail, where he was charged with indecent exposure.\n\nIn a probable cause statement, provide to USA TODAY by the District Attorney's office, Officer Karl J. Coleman found that Collins \"knowingly and willfully\" exposed himself. He also noted that he and two other officers took statements from two United Airlines employees and a passenger who witnessed the incident.\n\n\u201cThe suspect did open the window to his hotel room, which overlooks the hotel plaza, and in full view of the public did stand in his window fully nude, exposing himself and his genitalia to the general public,\u201d the officer wrote.\n\nCollins' attorney, Craig Silverman, told the Post that he went to Collins' room earlier this month and to the main terminal at DIA to see for himself what was visible from each perspective.\n\n\u201cThe concourse windows are tinted green and are opaque and reflective. It\u2019s like looking at a green wall or a green mirror,\" he said in a statement to the newspaper. \u201cFrom inside the concourse, at that time of the morning, unbeknownst to my client, you can see into the Westin rooms, but the distance is such that you cannot see much other than a human form. My client had a reasonable expectation that no one could see into his window.\"\n\nHe added, \u201cThere is zero evidence of any sexual activity demonstrating an intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desire of any person.\u201d\n\nSilverman also told the paper he believes the Denver District Attorney's office will dismiss the case. He did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nKen Lane, the spokesman for the DA's office declined to comment on the case, which is currently pending. He said Collins is due in court on Dec. 5 to enter his plea.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/20/united-pilot-faces-indecency-charge-after-being-seen-naked-hotel-window-terminal/2064574002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Sonja Haller, USA TODAY", "title": "Parents are wearing jewelry made from their baby's umbilical cord stump", "description": "Umbilical cord jewelry is latest parent trend", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/11/20/umbilical-cord-jewelry-latest-parenting-trend/1987750002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/c5500480-51bb-4aa7-a11a-4da4108dce2b/c5500480-51bb-4aa7-a11a-4da4108dce2b_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:23:05Z", "content": "Parents of yesterday kept their baby's hair and the first tooth their kid lost.

Inside the latest parental trend\n\nCLOSE New parents are keeping the umbilical cords and cord stumps from their newborns and turning them into pieces of jewelry. USA TODAY\n\nParents of yesterday kept their baby's hair and the first tooth their kid lost. They cherished them in boxes or taped them inside baby books that were kept in closets or the garage.\n\nToday, some parents are taking that sentimentality to a whole new level.\n\nLike turning their offspring's umbilical cord \u2013 you know, the crusty nugget that falls off a few days after baby comes home \u2013 into a piece of jewelry.\n\nKind of strange? OK. But more celebrities by the day are blending the sleep sac of their newborn into placenta smoothies. So keep that in mind.\n\nMore: There's more than one way moms are eating placenta. Here's why and how they're doing it\n\nFrom crunchy to stunning\n\nWhat's more curious is that these jewelry pieces can be quite stunning. You know, for having been created from what looked like old food found between the couch cushions. Case in point, this piece from Speckled Milk:\n\nDoes the umbilical cord have to be new?\n\nActually, no. Artisans say the age of the umbilical stump doesn't matter. It can be from an infant born a month ago or decades earlier.\n\nSpeckled Milk jewelry maker Nianna Rodriguez created a piece of umbilical jewelry for a mother who had stowed the stump in a baby book for 17 years.\n\n\"It was just as beautiful,\" Rodriguez told All the Moms. \"It's amazing how you shave off the top layer and that's where you get this beautiful amber color that translates wonderfully into jewelry.\"\n\nPick a design, stick the stump in the mail\n\nCrafters like Rodriguez sell their wares online. Mothers interested in a wearable memory choose from one of the artist's designs and follow the packing instructions for the stump and send it off in the mail.\n\nJeweler Ruth Avra of Sarasota, Florida fell into making the organic jewelry by accident. A mom friend asked her to create something using her baby's umbilical cord stump. The jeweler since 2003 had no idea what to make. Then, she placed it beside her son's own stump on a table.\n\n\"It was sort of like a lightening bolt struck,\" said Avra, who owns A La Avra. \"Now I understand what I'm supposed to do.\"\n\nUmbilical cord jewelry necklaces made by jeweler Ruth Avra at A La Avra. (Photo: Ruth Avra, A La Avra)\n\nAvra created her first piece of cord jewelry in 2012.\n\nNow, demand is rising on the time-consuming pieces. At any one time, she can be working on as many as 10 orders, she said. Each one takes about 4-6 weeks to complete, from the time parents send off the stumps to when they get jewelry back.\n\nAvra uses a process called lost wax carving to create a singular piece using the shape of the stump to determine the jewelry's design. She also has begun taking requests for shapes, such as a heart.\n\nShe makes rings, bracelets and cufflinks, but her silver umbilical cord necklace, which sells for $195, is her best seller.\n\nNo client who calls her on the phone or sends her an email is typical, she said.\n\n\"They're actually from all over. A lot are from the U.S. but a lot are international, too, from as far away as Hong Kong and Australia and Europe.\"\n\nAn umbilical cord bracelet designed by Ruth Avra at A La Avra. (Photo: Ruth Avra/A La Avra)\n\n'They are close to my heart'\n\nMarialejandra Beltran from Miami has been Avra's client four times.\n\nBeltran spotted Avra at a booth at a baby-wearing festival and decided to buy a necklace made from her then 9-month-old son's umbilical cord stump. Two years later, she held the necklace in the delivery room with her as she birthed her daughter.\n\n\"I was having a C-section and I was so nervous and it helped me to feel that connection with my son while I was in there,\" she said.\n\nAvra combined both her children's umbilical cords into a single necklace.\n\nFor the third time, she returned to have angel wings etched onto the necklace of the child she miscarried before her son and daughter were born.\n\nShe never takes the necklace off.\n\n\"I have a connection with my children wherever I go. Whatever they are doing, they are close to my heart,\" Beltran said. \"Holding the necklace makes me feel calm. It's something so beautiful, so simple, that's part of the human body.\"\n\nWhen Beltran's sister visited from Venezuela, she connected her to Avra who made a piece of heart-shaped jewelry from her niece's umbilical cord.\n\nRemember those baby teeth?\n\nAvra says she's found there exists a jewelry market for those, too.\n\nAlthough we're not sure how parents explain to young children who thought the tooth fairy whisked their teeth away in the dead of night when mom's wearing one on her finger.\n\n\"This is just sort of a fun way to treasure the bond between parent and child and do something with those things that are special that you just don't know what to do with,\" Avra said, adding, \"It's not for everyone.\"\n\nLike All the Moms?

Sure, it was only a few drops. But we were legit in the splash zone during the competition.\n\nHere's what we saw that the cameras missed.\n\nMore: How Bobby Bones and partner Sharna Burgess pulled off the 'DWTS' Mirrorball Miracle\n\nWas there love between swimsuit model Alexis Ren and pro Alan Bersten?\n\nAlexis Ren and pro Alan Bersten brought love to the dance floor. Just ask them. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nCall us cynical, but we had our eyes peeled on Ren and partner Bersten, who said they're in a relationship while insisting it wasn't about building drama and fan interest.\n\nIt's totally just love, right?\n\nWhen the two were watching from the dance floor as an introduction video showed them talking about the budding relationship, Ren and Bersten giggled and snuggled off camera. Bersten even playfully kissed Ren on the cheek. The giggles increased as Ren could be heard on the video saying, \"we communicate with our hearts.\"\n\nBut there was less chemistry after the couple's second and final dance. Host Erin Andrews interviewed the duo outside the ballroom, pointing out they had finished their last dance. She was clearly prodding the two to give a camera smooch to immortalize the TV moment.\n\nIn the ballroom, pro dancer Sasha Farber laughed as he waved his hands and yelled \"Kiss! Kiss!\" at the pair on the giant screen. But Ren and Bersten misfired and had a facial collision instead, to Farber's visible disappointment.\n\nMilo Manheim freaks out before dancing\n\nWitney Carson and Milo Manheim were all smiles after their dancing. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nDisney Channel star Manheim might seem the coolest guy on the dance floor. But out of view before his Charleston to \"Living in New York City,\" he was bouncing around, making wild faces and sticking his tongue out to prepare. He suddenly dashed off the stage before airtime as pro partner Carson looked perplexed, hands in air (\"I was like, where the heck are you going?\" Carson said later). Turns out Manheim needed a glass of water (\"I was really thirsty\").\n\nHe returned to the stage, apologized to Carson and took deep breaths. Then he nailed the number, earning perfect 10s from the judges.\n\nKeo Motsepe let Evanna Lynch shine solo in her final dance\n\nEvanna Lynch finishes her dance number gloriously. Her partner was proud. (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\n\"Harry Potter\" actress Evanna Lynch had skills, but the self-described introvert struggled to let her true personality show (in stark contrast to champion Bones).\n\nHowever, in the final stunning freestyle number to Bjork's \u201cIt's Oh So Quiet,\u201d Lynch let it all fly in a colorful world that wowed. Judge Bruno Tonioli threw impartial behavior out the window as he stood, smiling and clapping during the intricate number.\n\nIn an unusual move, Lynch was away from her partner Motsepe in the dance's final moments, standing on a platform alone elevating towards the ceiling. Motsepe let her shine solo. Out of camera range, he was so overcome with Lynch's performance that he unleashed an arms-wide, unrestrained roar of approval.\n\nBobby Bones after his perfect score on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nBobby Bones almost died after his perfect score\n\n\"DWTS\" champion Bones proudly flew his freak flag, even off camera. After handing judges his shoe to autograph after his first dance, Bones then limped one-shoed off stage, high-fived former champ Emmitt Smith in the front row and proudly pumped his shoe in the air as he walked off. Following a perfect score in the freestyle dance, Bones and Burgess were so shocked they fell to the floor. They lay there into the commercial break until a stagehand moved them, warning that a giant prop was rolling toward their heads.\n\n\"That would have been a quite the way to go,\" Bones said afterward. \"After perfect 10s. Rest In Peace, Sharna and Bobby.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/20/dancing-stars-shocking-finale-what-you-didnt-see-tv/2064253002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "'Creed II' actor on quitting MIT and engineering career", "description": "Actor Dolph Lundgren says he recently realized why he gave up a career in engineering to take up acting and talks about the chance to flesh out his \"Rocky IV\" role in new movie, \"Creed II.\" (Nov. 20)", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/movies/2018/11/20/creed-ii-actor-quitting-mit-and-engineering-career/38570475/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dbe9562af8a767ceb6d2f1093937871de97e2e57/c=0-1087-2525-2514&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636783093134287327-GTY-1067719358.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:19:43Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "The murky secrets of clean beauty, explained", "description": "Despite the growing popularity of \u201cclean\u201d beauty products, industry veterans say terms like \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d are unregulated and often meaningless.

Andrew Collins was arrested Sept. 20 after he was spotted standing naked at his hotel window. He says he didn't know he was visible from inside the terminal at Denver International Airport. (Photo: Denver Police Department)\n\nA United Airlines pilot is facing an indecency charge for standing naked in front of his hotel room window on Sept. 20.\n\nCaptain Andrew Collins, who has flown for United for 22 years, says he was unaware that he was giving an eyeful to the people in Denver International Airport's glass-encased main terminal. The police, on the other hand, claim was fully aware of what he was doing.\n\nCollins, who is based in Northern Virginia, insisted in an interview with The Denver Post that he was not aware he could be seen by people in the terminal. The airline is currently reviewing the incident.\n\nUnited Airlines spokeswoman Erin Benson told USA TODAY that Collins has been \u201cremoved from his duties pending an internal review,\" adding, \"We are cooperating with authorities on their investigation.\u201d\n\nCollins, 54, recounted the incident in an interview with the Post published Monday.\n\nHe said he had just woken up after a rough day of being diverted to airports across the country. By the time he went to bed the night before, he had been up for 30 hours.\n\n\u201cI was getting ready for a shower and was talking on the phone,\u201d Collins told the Post. \u201cIt was a beautiful morning and I opened the curtains to my window. I couldn\u2019t see the terminal.\u201d\n\nCollins' attorney, Craig SIlverman, says that standing outside the glass-encased main terminal at DIA is like \"looking at a green wall or a green mirror.\u201d But thanks to the mid-morning sun, people standing inside the terminal can see into rooms at the nearby Westin hotel. (Photo: Denver International Airport)\n\nHe said he was unaware that people inside the terminal could see him for the duration of his 24-minute phone call.\n\nBy the time the call was over, officers from the Denver Police Department were pounding on the door of Collins' room in the Westin Hotel. They handcuffed him and took him to the airport's jail, where he was charged with indecent exposure.\n\nIn a probable cause statement, provide to USA TODAY by the District Attorney's office, Officer Karl J. Coleman found that Collins \"knowingly and willfully\" exposed himself. He also noted that he and two other officers took statements from two United Airlines employees and a passenger who witnessed the incident.\n\n\u201cThe suspect did open the window to his hotel room, which overlooks the hotel plaza, and in full view of the public did stand in his window fully nude, exposing himself and his genitalia to the general public,\u201d the officer wrote.\n\nCollins' attorney, Craig Silverman, told the Post that he went to Collins' room earlier this month and to the main terminal at DIA to see for himself what was visible from each perspective.\n\n\u201cThe concourse windows are tinted green and are opaque and reflective. It\u2019s like looking at a green wall or a green mirror,\" he said in a statement to the newspaper. \u201cFrom inside the concourse, at that time of the morning, unbeknownst to my client, you can see into the Westin rooms, but the distance is such that you cannot see much other than a human form. My client had a reasonable expectation that no one could see into his window.\"\n\nHe added, \u201cThere is zero evidence of any sexual activity demonstrating an intent to arouse or to satisfy the sexual desire of any person.\u201d\n\nSilverman also told the paper he believes the Denver District Attorney's office will dismiss the case. He did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nKen Lane, the spokesman for the DA's office declined to comment on the case, which is currently pending. He said Collins is due in court on Dec. 5 to enter his plea.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/20/united-pilot-faces-indecency-charge-after-being-seen-naked-hotel-window-terminal/2064574002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Ivanka Trump used private email to message government officials", "description": "It was discovered that Ivanka Trump used a private email to send messages to government officials in 2017.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/2018/11/20/ivanka-trump-used-private-email-message-government-officials/2065546002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/7f249b7e-9c4d-4912-bfb7-ddebf21e91d0-VPC_IVANKA_TRUMP_EMAILS_THUMB.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:42:30Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "2 arrested in death of Louisiana boxer Brandon Broussard", "description": "Two men have been arrested in the shooting death of a Louisiana boxer earlier this year", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2018/11/20/2-arrested-in-death-of-louisiana-boxer-brandon-broussard/38571805/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:37:53Z", "content": "LAFAYETTE, La.

Where will he play next? (Photo: USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBryce Harper, a National League MVP at 23, is a free agent at 26, peddling his services in an industry that\u2019s grown to nearly $11 billion in annual revenues. His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league franchise.\n\nIncluding the Colorado Rockies.\n\nHarper, who has 184 career home runs and a lifetime .900 OPS, rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract offer from the Washington Nationals in September, and is a good bet to set a new standard for the most lucrative contract in North American sports history.\n\nIt may take weeks for that process to play out. In the meantime, USA TODAY Sports will examine why every team could use Harper\u2019s services \u2013 some more than others, certainly some better-equipped to procure them.\n\nA case for Harper and the Rockies joining forces:\n\nOn the field\n\nAt a time of great innovation in baseball, with progressive means to record 27 outs and most efficiently score runs, here\u2019s yet another counterintuitive approach to winning:\n\nBludgeon the hell out of your opponents.\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly good look in Colorado, where the air is thin, the ball flies and even in a post-humidor era, you can never have enough runs. Yes, Coors Field still played as the friendliest run-scoring joint in the National League in 2018 (soon-extinct Globe Life Park in Texas was slightly better). Only Cincinnati\u2019s Great American Ballpark rated a better home run haven, though Coors\u2019 conditions are often favorable to lefty power hitters.\n\nSo imagine, for the next five to eight to 10 years, the Rockies rolling out Harper, Charlie Blackmon, David Dahl and Ryan McMahon from the left side.\n\nImagine, for the next three seasons, right-handed slugging shortstop Trevor Story slotting between two of the above.\n\nAnd imagine, perhaps for 2019 only, Nolan Arenado bunched in with that group, too.\n\nSure, signing Harper \u2013 with Blackmon already under contract for up to five more years and at least $95 million \u2013 might preclude the Rockies from re-signing Arenado. At the same time, there\u2019s no guarantee they can re-up their generational third baseman, anyway, and with Story, McMahon and Brendan Rodgers all under team control for three to seven seasons, the infield will be OK beyond next season.\n\nIn the meantime, they can take their most meaningful crack at a World Series championship ever in 2019.\n\nForget the magic of 2007\u2019s Rocktober. In Kyle Freeland, 25, and German Marquez, 23, the Rockies have a 1-2 pitching duo capable of flourishing at Coors Field, with a solid quartet behind them to chew up the remaining innings. And they\u2019d be backed by a lineup featuring two potential Hall of Famers entering their age-26 and age-28 seasons.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything baked into the Rockies\u2019 DNA, it is this: Throwing big money at pitching rarely works, be it Darryl Kile in 1998 ($24 million, a 5.84 ERA over three seasons), Mike Hampton in 2001 ($117 million, a 5.75 ERA over two seasons) or the $106 million expended last off-season on relievers Wade Davis, Bryan Shaw and Jake McGee (who combined for a 5.41 ERA).\n\nRemember the first time they lavished big money on a Hall of Fame-caliber hitter?\n\nLarry Walker\u2019s 10 years in Denver were a revelation, featuring four All-Star appearances, one MVP award, 258 homers and a 1.044 OPS that began when he signed a four-year, $22.5 million deal as a 28-year-old in 1995. Scoff if you must that this came at pre-humidor Coors Field during the offensive environment of the so-called steroids era, but Walker\u2019s park-adjusted OPS-plus in that span was 147, peaking at an absurd 178 in his MVP season of 1997.\n\nNow imagine a 26-year-old Harper stepping into that arena. We\u2019re guessing he\u2019s thought about it once or twice.\n\nOff the field\n\nHe\u2019d be away from both coasts, in a media market that ranks outside the top 15. So Harper would have to settle for owning an entire time zone.\n\nIndeed, a move to Colorado wouldn\u2019t be terrible for his brand: The games start earlier than those on the West Coast, ensuring his exploits would get some exposure before much of the nation nods off. Rockies fans roll deep when the product is even halfway decent, and their second consecutive playoff berth resulted in 3 million fans at Coors Field, for the first time since 2001.\n\nDenver is less than a two-hour flight from his hometown of Las Vegas and, should this be of import to he and his wife, in an area of the country with a significant Mormon population.\n\nWhy they could pull it off\n\nWith a franchise value of $1.1 billion and annual revenue estimated at $266 million, according to Forbes, the Rockies have the wherewithal to pay Harper. Those numbers should both rise based on the enhanced attendance figures from 2018 and the Rockies\u2019 winning the right to develop and lease land directly south of the ballpark.\n\nWhile baseball economics are far from a zero-sum game, it would indeed be challenging for the Rockies to secure long-term deals for Harper and Arenado in consecutive off-seasons. That could lessen the upside of Harper\u2019s addition should it eventually sever fans\u2019 connections with Arenado, who has finished fifth, fourth and third in MVP voting the past three seasons. However, Arenado will turn 29 \u2013 three years older than Harper \u2013 as he begins what would be the first year of a long-term deal.\n\nFor now, Blackmon remains the lone significant commitment beyond 2021. Signing Harper \u2013 for say, 12 years and $420 million \u2013 would require some creative financing in the early years, but shouldn\u2019t be injurious in the long run.\n\nWill it happen?\n\nPossibly. The Rockies should recognize that their window to win may never be better, given their offensive core and that rarest of sights in Denver \u2013 young, capable starting pitching. With the status of one franchise player in doubt, locking down another in the near term would ensure them enduring relevance \u2013 along with a powerful shot to win it all now."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Cassidy Olsen, USA TODAY", "title": "Black Friday 2018: The best Costco deals on Google Home, laptops, Bose headphones and more", "description": "Costco is going all-in for Black Friday, with some of the best deals happening Thanksgiving Day", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/20/black-friday-2018-best-costco-deals-laptops-bose-headphones-and-more/38543025/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/95146cc578b9f721c9daae46c986c17e7aeb882f/c=3-0-1596-900/local/-/media/2018/11/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636779801444491891-Costco-BlackFriday.png?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:27:11Z", "content": "The best Costco Black Friday deals of 2018 (Photo: Microsoft) Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

Beltre has decided to retire after 21 seasons and 3,166 hits in the majors leagues. Beltre announced his decision in a statement released by the Rangers on Tuesday morning, Nov. 20, 2018. (AP Photo/Mike Stone, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Adrian Beltre had a sometimes-imposing stare and plenty of quirky habits. He also had a genuine love for the game, and a lot of fun in a Hall of Fame-caliber career.\n\nAfter 21 big league seasons in which Beltre hit 477 home runs and became the first player from the Dominican Republic to have 3,000 hits, the slick-fielding third baseman for the Texas Rangers retired Tuesday at age 39.\n\n\"After careful consideration and many sleepless nights, I have made the decision to retire from what I've been doing my whole life, which is playing baseball, the game I love,\" Beltre said in a statement. \"I have thought about it a lot and although I appreciate all the opportunities and everything that baseball has given me, it's time to call it a career.\"\n\nBeltre, who will be eligible for the Hall of Fame ballot in five years, was a .286 hitter with 1,707 RBIs in 2,933 career games. His 3,166 hits rank 16th on the career list, with his homers total 30th and RBIs 24th. He played 2,759 games at third base \u2014 only Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson had more.\n\n\"As much fun as people see us having at the ballpark all of the time, and playing around, I haven't met somebody that was more detailed about the game than him,\" Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus said. \"He's going to be missed for sure. It's going to be different.\"\n\nThe four-time All-Star and five-time Gold Glove winner was 19 when he made his big league debut with the Dodgers in 1998. Beltre played with Los Angeles until 2004, the Seattle Mariners from 2005-09 and the Boston Red Sox in 2010. He joined the Rangers on a $96 million, six-year free-agent deal in 2011, and appeared in his only World Series in his first season with Texas.\n\n\"The thing for me that stood out that I was unaware of ... was how much he fun he had,\" Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. \"He's obviously got an intense demeanor and it probably takes a little while for everybody to kind of get comfortable with him because he's an intimidating guy, just because he's so regimented and serious.\"\n\nBeltre often checked his own swing to umpires and hated being touched on the head, which teammates often exploited. There were the shuffling feet and swiveling legs in the batter's box on inside pitches or those in the dirt.\n\nThere were those times when Beltre and Andrus would be only a few feet apart on the left side of the infield, both with their gloves in the air, one mimicking the other catching a popup. There was a pitching change at Seattle in 2013 when Beltre threw his glove at a fleeing Andrus after being popped on the head with a glove by the shortstop.\n\nIn his statement, Beltre thanked former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda, then the team's interim general manager, for \"believing in this young kid from the Dominican Republic when others thought I was too young to be called up\" to the majors. Beltre was only 15 when he first signed with the Dodgers as an amateur free agent in July 1994.\n\nBeltre hit a Texas-high .273 with 15 homers and 65 RBIs in 119 games this season, when he went on the disabled list twice because of a strained left hamstring. He was limited in 2017 to 94 games, his fewest since 77 as a rookie, because of calf and hamstring issues.\n\nHe got his 3,000th career hit on July 30, 2017, the 31st major leaguer to reach that milestone.\n\n\"To all my fans in the Dominican Republic, the United States and Latin America, my sincerest THANK YOU for your continuous support throughout my career,\" Beltre wrote. \"While I will forever cherish the memories from my time playing the greatest game on earth, I am excited to become a fulltime husband and father, and I am ready to take on the next chapter of my life.\"\n\nMichael Young, now a special assistant to the general manager, was the Rangers third baseman before Beltre joined the team. Young then became a utility infielder and designated hitter and is still the career leader for games played and hits by a Rangers player.\n\n\"I knew he was good defensively, I didn't know he was this good. I knew he could hit, I didn't know he could hit like that. I knew he was tough, I didn't know he was that tough,\" Young said Tuesday. \"I could just pretty much go on, all of the things I knew about him, he was just better in pretty much in every possible way I could have imagined.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Right now, Clemson, Alabama and Notre Dame have their grasp on the first three playoff spots with Michigan occupying the fourth \u2014 which has been the case for weeks.\n\nHowever, it all comes down to whatever happens Saturday in the Week 13 games. If the top four teams win out \u2014 including those playing in conference championship games \u2014 they\u2019re in the playoff, and there won\u2019t be much room for debate on that. But even though these teams have repeatedly dominated opponents throughout the season, wild upsets are part of what makes this sport great.\n\nGoing into Week 13, here are the top eight teams with the best chances to make the playoff, advance to the championship game and win it all, according to ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor algorithm.\n\n1. Clemson (11-0)\n\nPlayoff: 96 percent\n\nChampionship game: 66 percent\n\nWin championship: 39 percent\n\n2. Notre Dame (11-0)\n\nPlayoff: 91 percent\n\nChampionship game: 28 percent\n\nWin championship: 10 percent\n\n3. Alabama (11-0)\n\nPlayoff: 80 percent\n\nChampionship game: 54 percent\n\nWin championship: 31 percent\n\n4. Michigan (10-1)\n\nPlayoff: 42 percent\n\nChampionship game: 16 percent\n\nWin championship: 7 percent\n\n5. Georgia (10-1)\n\nPlayoff: 39 percent\n\nChampionship game: 20 percent\n\nWin championship: 9 percent\n\n6. Ohio State (10-1)\n\nPlayoff: 26 percent\n\nChampionship game: 8 percent\n\nWin championship: 3 percent\n\n7. Oklahoma (10-1)\n\nPlayoff: 21 percent\n\nChampionship game: 7 percent\n\nWin championship: 3 percent\n\n8. Washington State (10-1)\n\nPlayoff: 3 percent\n\nChampionship game: Less than 1 percent\n\nWin championship: Less than 1 percent\n\nCompared with the last several weeks, Alabama dropped to the No. 3 spot among the teams with best playoff chances, and Notre Dame got a boost to No. 2. While Nick Saban\u2019s team remains undefeated going into the regular season finale in the Iron Bowl against Auburn, it was more than a 50-point favorite over The Citadel last week but struggled in the beginning. Yes, Alabama eventually found its rhythm on its way to a 50-17 win, but the score was tied at 10 at halftime in the matchup between the No. 1 team in the country (in the rankings) and what\u2019s now a 4-6 FCS team.\n\nLast week, Alabama\u2019s playoff chances were at 86 percent, so it didn\u2019t drop enough to cause anyone to worry. An 80 percent chance to make the playoff is still phenomenal, and even if it loses to either Auburn this weekend or Georgia in the SEC championship game in two weeks, it still seems like Alabama is getting in.\n\nWhile the Crimson Tide dropped a tad, Notre Dame\u2019s likelihood of making the playoff got a big boost in the Playoff Predictor. The Fighting Irish rocked Syracuse on Saturday, 36-3, and if they beat USC this week, they\u2019re in the playoff. They don\u2019t have a conference title to fight over, but a 12-0 team with wins over four ranked teams looks pretty good. Their chances are up from 77 percent to make the playoff, 21 percent to get to the national championship game and six percent to win it.\n\nClemson still has the best chance at the playoff after knocking off Duke last weekend, and it shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble against South Carolina on Saturday. The Tigers\u2019 playoff chances have been inching toward 100 percent over the last few weeks, and while an upset would surely affect that number, this squad might be the only other in the top four that could drop a game at this point and still make the playoff.\n\nBut Michigan is definitely not in that boat. The Wolverines\u2019 playoff chances dropped slightly after it struggled a little to put away Indiana this week. Those numbers are down a tad from a 45 percent chance to make the playoff and a 17 percent chance to advance to the title game. If the Wolverines lose to Ohio State on Saturday, they\u2019re out of the playoff conversation because they already have a loss on their schedule (to Notre Dame) and won\u2019t play for the Big Ten championship. But should they beat the Buckeyes, Northwestern \u2014 which did actually almost beat the Wolverines earlier this year \u2014 is the only thing standing between Michigan and the playoff. Win out and it\u2019s probably in.\n\nGeorgia could mess things up for a few different teams though. Assuming the Bulldogs beat Georgia Tech on Saturday, they will enter the SEC title game against Bama with one loss (to LSU) on their resume. If they can find a way to take down the Crimson Tide, a one-loss SEC champ that beat the No. 1 team in the country might get the playoff edge over a one-loss Big Ten or Big 12 winner.\n\nEven though Ohio State only beat Maryland by a single point in overtime, it swapped places on the Playoff Predictor list with Oklahoma after the Sooners gave up 40 points to Kansas. The Buckeyes\u2019 playoff chances are up from 22 percent last week, as is their likelihood of advancing to the national championship game (up from just six percent) and winning it all (up from two percent.) However, if Ohio State doesn\u2019t beat Michigan, none of this matters.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about those Sooners though. While still beating Kansas, 55-40, their defense didn\u2019t stop much and certainly wouldn\u2019t hold up against another playoff team. Their playoff chance is down a little from 25 percent last week, along with their chance to make the title game (nine percent last week). But even if Oklahoma beats West Virginia this weekend and is eventually a one-loss Big 12 champion, it would still need Northwestern to win the Big Ten \u2014 or maybe a Notre Dame loss \u2014 to steal a playoff spot.\n\nWashington State would need a little bit of everything to get in at this point. Aside from winning the Pac-12, the Cougars would need a Northwestern to win the Big Ten, West Virginia or Texas to win the Big 12 and Alabama as the SEC winner. A Notre Dame loss would help too.\n\nESPN Analytics\u2019 algorithm is based on a team\u2019s strength of record, losses, conference championships, independent status (because of Notre Dame) and the Football Power Index (FPI) \u2014 which gauges how well teams are playing based on expectations, or, basically how good each team is. It also considers how the selection committee has acted in the last four years when faced with similar predicaments.\n\nRead more about ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor from the preseason and after Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, Week 8, Week 9, Week 10 and Week 11 on FTW."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Satellite imagery shows drastic before and after Camp Fire", "description": "Satellite images show how the Camp Fire destroyed nearly 12,000 homes in Paradise, California.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/20/satellite-imagery-shows-drastic-before-and-after-camp-fire/2065121002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/9fb35f6c-226a-4edf-a56a-424b6020fbfa-VPCSOC_BEFORE_AFTER_CAMP_FIRE_PARADISE_digitalglobe.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:25:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Sonja Haller, USA TODAY", "title": "Parents are wearing jewelry made from their baby's umbilical cord stump", "description": "\"I have a connection with my children wherever I go...they are close to my heart,\" said a mom with a necklace made from her child's umbilical cord.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/11/20/umbilical-cord-jewelry-latest-parenting-trend/1987750002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/13/USAT/63b1a5d2-9e08-4c4e-a200-287148d87f4a-umbilical_cord_jewelry.jpg?crop=999,570,x0,y259&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:24:23Z", "content": "Moms are turning their child's umbilical cord stump into jewelry pieces like these.

(Photo: Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAdrian Beltre's baseball career began as a teenager, a skinny third baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers who made his debut in the summer of Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire.\n\nTwo decades later, Beltre's major league career has ended - with a final stop coming, in Cooperstown.\n\nBeltre, 39, announced his retirement Tuesday morning, concluding a 21-year career in which he amassed 477 home runs and 3,166 hits, establishing himself as the greatest third baseman of his era.\n\nHe's the lone third baseman in major league history with at least 3,000 hits and 400 home runs.\n\nIn an announcement through the Texas Rangers, his team for the final eight years of his career, Beltre said his decision came after \"careful consideration and many sleepless nights.\"\n\nHis retirement leaves Rangers teammate Bartolo Colon, 45, as the last remaining player who began his career in the 1990s.\n\nBeltre left an impact on all four franchises for which he played, producing the second-greatest home run season in Dodgers history with 48 in 2004, capping a seven-season run there in which he hit 147 home runs. He struggled offensively during five seasons in Seattle, but emerged as a two-time Gold Glove winner.\n\nHe spent just one season - 2010 - in Boston, but it was a year that charted a new course in his career: Beltre hit an American League-best 49 doubles, boosted his OPS to .919, made his first All-Star team and hit the free agent market a third time, entering his age 32 season.\n\nBeltre's decision - Los Angeles Angels or Texas Rangers? - would alter the fate of the AL West for years to come.\n\nHe opted for Texas, signing a five-year, $80 million deal, and neither club nor player were ever the same.\n\nFor the next six seasons, he'd finish in the top 15 in MVP voting, and the Rangers flourished - coming one out away from their first World Series championship in his first season, 2011. They made the playoffs in four of his first six seasons in Arlington - and the world got to know what a sublime and entertaining player he was.\n\nWhether he was engaging in an ongoing \"feud\" with shortstop Elvis Andrus, imposing his leadership on the clubhouse or making highlight-reel plays at third base, Beltre was as quietly charismatic as he was subtly dominant on the diamond.\n\nHis numbers are Cooperstown-worthy by a long shot - oh, he also ranks 14th all-time in total bases and 11th with 636 doubles - but modern metrics are also very kind. According to Sports Info Solutions, Beltre has nearly double the number of Defensive Runs Saved than any other third baseman since the statistic was developed in 2003. He also ranks 10th all-time in defensive Wins Above Replacement - for any position.\n\nAs baseball continues to grapple with honoring its past while ushering the game into an occasionally jarring modern era, consensus is elusive. Be it whether games are too long or too short, whether a player is Hall of Fame worthy or even what constitutes a most valuable player, it's inevitable factions will take sides.\n\nThere will be little debating Beltre's legacy, however. And that will make for a glorious day five years from now, when his sustained brilliance is honored in the game's ultimate shrine."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Brown coach Phil Estes stepping down", "description": "Brown football coach Phil Estes is stepping down", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/20/brown-coach-phil-estes-stepping-down/38571649/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:21:38Z", "content": "PROVIDENCE, R.I.

But the Bears have struggled recently, with Estes' resignation coming after a 1-9 season ended with a 49-7 loss to Dartmouth.\n\nEstes says he is deeply grateful to Brown for the opportunity to coach the team and several outstanding players.\n\nSome players have gone on to win Super Bowl titles, including James Develin of the New England Patriots and Zak DeOssie of the New York Giants.\n\nAthletic director Jack Hayes says the search for the next coach will begin immediately.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 550 points today. EPA-EFE/JUSTIN LANE ORG XMIT: JLX21 (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE)\n\nStock investors bid goodbye to their 2018 gains on Tuesday.\n\nThe heavy selling on Wall Street continued, with losses in popular tech stocks spreading to the broader market, a rout that erased the 2018 gains of the Dow and broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index.\n\nNervous investors have been dumping shares of U.S. companies for weeks, as worries about the global economy mount due to obstacles ranging from the fallout from the U.S.-China trade dispute to signs of slowing iPhone sales to fears that Federal Reserve interest rate hikes will hurt growth.\n\nThe selling pressure was again focused in the hard-hit technology sector, where shares of the so-called FAANG stocks \u2013 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet \u2013 were under pressure. All five stocks, which had been leading the market higher during the bull market, are now down more than 20 percent from their highs in the past year, which puts them in bear-market territory. The biggest decliners are Facebook, which has been hounded by data privacy issues, down nearly 40 percent from its recent peak, and Netflix, which is off 37 percent.\n\n\"The sell-off is a continuation of the rotation away from high-flying tech names and ongoing worries about the U.S.-China trade (dispute),\" says Nick Sargen, senior investment advisor for Fort Washington Investment Advisors.\n\nAt the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, which was down almost 600 points at its low, was 552 points lower at 24,466 and trading 1 percent below where it finished in 2017. The S&P 500 finished 1.8 percent lower, pushing it into negative territory for the year. The large-company stock index, considered a proxy for the health of the broader market, briefly dipped 10 percent below its Sept. 20 high, putting it back in so-called \"correction territory.\" It finished the session 9.9 percent below its peak.\n\nThe technology-dominated Nasdaq, which had fallen close to 3 percent earlier and briefly into the red for the year, fell 1.7 percent, extending its losses from its late August high to nearly 15 percent.\n\nAfter Tuesday's plunge, the Dow is 8.8 percent off its recent high.\n\nIn a sign of just how bad the carnage on Wall Street has been in the recent sell-off, more than 45 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 are down more than 20 percent from their highs in the past year, according to Bloomberg data. That means nearly half of the stocks in the broad index are in a bear market.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 is only halfway to a bear market drop of 20 percent, Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, told clients in a report this week that he believes Wall Street is already in a bear market. The good news, he noted, is that 90 percent of the valuation damage the market has suffered in the sell-off is complete.\n\nMore Money: As stocks skid, worries mount for 401(k) investors who can't 'stand the pain'\n\nMore Money: Nissan's Carlos Ghosn fired, arrested over alleged income misconduct\n\nMore Money: These 8 retailers can't afford a disappointing 2018 holiday shopping season\n\nSome Wall Street pros don\u2019t think the selling will end and the market won't make a bottom until fear spikes and another whoosh lower occurs.\n\n\u201cI suspect we need to wash this out deeper before all is said and done,\u201d says Chris Verrone, a partner at Wall Street research firm Strategas Research Partners.\n\nAfter a long period in which investors made money by buying stocks after a sizable swoon \u2013 an approach known as \"buying the dips\" \u2013 that strategy is no longer working, adds Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust.\n\nThe market's losses mount as a long period of low interest rates comes to a close, as the U.S. central bank pushes rates higher in an attempt to get them back to more normal levels. Higher rates result in pushing up borrowing costs on things such as homes and cars.\n\nInvestors are also grappling with concerns that the economy, which has been performing well, has already seen its best days. Most Wall Street economists, however, don't see a recession on the horizon.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/dow-selloff-erases-2018-gains/2064956002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Netflix in December 2018", "description": "Here is what is streaming on Netflix in December of 2018, including \"Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War,\" \"Bird Box\" and the new comedy original \"Ellen Degeneres: Relatable.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/2018/11/20/netflix-december-2018/2056287002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/28911775001/28911775001_5969050504001_5969050834001-vs.jpg?pubId=28911775001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:01:32Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY", "title": "Facebook, Instagram go down again as its 2018 can't end fast enough", "description": "Just over a week since a \"routine test\" took the social networking giant offline, Facebook and Instagram both went down for many users early Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/20/facebook-instagram-go-down-again-its-2018-cant-end-fast-enough/2064823002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b8b0abcb585d9841e5193c3d072eed1e5ce62bc/c=0-30-580-356/local/-/media/2018/11/19/USATODAY/usatsports/MotleyFool-TMOT-6fa75551-facebook-sign_large.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:59:55Z", "content": "There's not a lot to like for Facebook these days.

Others could get items dropped on their doorsteps the same day in more than 250 markets through Target\u2019s partnership with the delivery and personal shopping service Shipt.

Target also opened 12 more small-format stores tailored to the tastes of urban and college communities, in markets like Dallas, New York and Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cThis is allowing us to reach a guest that, in the past, we hadn\u2019t been able to serve.\u2019\u2019 Target CEO Brian Cornell said in the earnings call. \u201cIt\u2019s opening up a door for a new guest to shop at Target, and the reaction has been very positive.''\n\nThe retailer reported net earnings of $622 million, or $1.17 in diluted earnings per share, as compared to a $478-million profit earned during the same period last year.\n\nStill, shares were down 8.18 percent to $70.84 in morning trading.\n\nInvestors may have been reacting to a slight dip in operating profit due to costs ranging from wage hikes to investments, says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Global Data.\n\n\"Some on Wall Street may lament the dip, but the truth is you cannot reinvent a retailer on the cheap,'' Saunders said in an investors note. \"Target is not doing that, and we applaud them for it . . . It is transforming itself into a modern retailer that is relevant to consumers and their needs.''\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/targets-push-onto-toys-r-us-turf-woos-shoppers-heading-into-holidays/2064866002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Maeve McDermott, USA TODAY", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar posted a 'reminder not to overeat' on Thanksgiving, and fans are mad", "description": "Sarah Michelle Gellar posted a series of revealing throwback photos to her Instagram Monday showing her wearing black lingerie.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/20/sarah-michelle-gellars-lingerie-thanksgiving-post-draws-ire/2064816002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/07/USAT/6503dee4-04f7-4613-b614-3ac0b04e0e6e-1056928312.jpg?crop=2315,1320,x0,y359&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:53:23Z", "content": "This Thanksgiving, Sarah Michelle Gellar is learning that her large social media following isn't necessarily something to be thankful for.

There hasn\u2019t been a repeat division winner since 2004, and it\u2019s looking more and more like that streak will continue in 2018. While folks finish up their dessert after an early Thanksgiving dinner, there is a very real chance the Cowboys and Redskins have the same record atop the East come Thursday evening.\n\nThe Good\n\nTwo weeks in a row is a trend. Ezekiel Elliot\u2019s notched over 180 all-purpose yards in consecutive games, and in the process has brought all those pieces claiming he\u2019d \u201clost a step\u201d to a halt. The same questions were raised last season. As Kobe Bryant would ask, \u201care you a different animal, and the same beast?\u201d To that, Elliot would respond with a resounding \u201cYes!\u201d His play would agree.\n\nThe Good\n\nYards do not matter. This Cowboys team, as currently constructed, will rarely outgain an opponent throughout the course of a game. That doesn\u2019t mean their defense isn\u2019t better. It\u2019s incredibly impressive. This Falcons team averaged 32.2 points per game at home prior to this one, with their lone game scoring fewer than 30 being a 23-point effort against the Giants. In a league breaking offensive records like this is the Big-12 Conference, the Cowboys are allowing only 19 points per game.\n\nContinue for the bad and the ugly\u2026\n\nGallery 69 Nice! pics from Cowboys 22-19 win over Falcons"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Charles Curtis", "title": "1 Rams-Chiefs stat will make Bills fans feel the worst", "description": "This is sad.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/rams-chiefs-touchdowns-more-than-buffalo-bills-sad", "urlToImage": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gty-1063608182-e1542724954509.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:49:13Z", "content": "There were a lot of bonkers stats that came out of Monday night\u2019s unbelievable Los Angeles Rams win over the Kansas City Chiefs.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) \u2014 Finally, the year is over for Germany.\n\nThe 2014 World Cup champions, who failed to even make it out of the group stage at this year's tournament in Russia, ended their disappointing campaign with a thud, conceding two late goals in a 2-2 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nEven before the match started, Germany had already been relegated from the top tier in the UEFA Nations League.\n\n\"That was a reflection of 2018,\" Germany forward Timo Werner said of the team's late collapse against the Netherlands. \"You could see it was working but at the end we couldn't get the reward. We need to cross off 2018 and do everything better next year.\"\n\nGermany started the year hoping to defend its World Cup title. But early losses to Mexico and South Korea sent the four-time champions home ahead of schedule. Mesut Ozil then quit the national team soon after, citing \"racism and disrespect\" from German society because of his Turkish roots.\n\nFew coaches could survive a year like that, but Joachim Loew is no ordinary coach.\n\nLoew been in charge since 2006 and has shaped the careers of players like Thomas Mueller, who made his 100th appearance on Monday \u2014 all of them under Loew.\n\nHe was also fortunate to sign a four-year contract extension in May, a month before the World Cup debacle, and his focus is on the 2020 European Championship despite a \"Loew out\" banner in the stands on Monday.\n\nLoew has called 2018 \"a slap in the face,\" but said Germany will soon see the benefits of a post-World Cup rebuild. Key to that, he said, will be Leroy Sane, a player left out of the World Cup team despite being named Premier League young player of the year.\n\n\"Leroy has learned a lot from not being nominated for the World Cup,\" Loew said. \"We can't rebuild the team overnight.\"\n\nThere's no doubt that Germany has depth after winning the 2017 Confederations Cup and European under-21 championship in the same week. The problem so far has been refining that pool of players into a coherent team.\n\nAt times on Monday, Germany looked like its old self, with the forward trio of Werner, Sane and Serge Gnabry combining for both goals. However, Loew used all three of his substitutions to replace them with Mueller, Marco Reus and Leon Goretzka.\n\nWithout any fresh legs at the back, the defense failed to mark Dutch scorers Quincy Promes and Virgil van Dijk.\n\nLoew said he still hasn't found his preferred lineup.\n\n\"It's a long process. I'm also no clairvoyant and don't know what will happen in March (when European Championship qualifying begins),\" Loew said in comments published on the German soccer federation website. \"We have a lot of potential and that gives you a lot of courage for next year.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Those documents included Real Madrid's Super League proposal.\n\nAgnelli, the president of Italian champion Juventus, said clubs had not formally discussed a breakaway plan since 2015.\n\n\"I have nothing to be ashamed about of what happened in the past,\" he said, adding that neither Juventus nor the Switzerland-based ECA appeared to have had data systems hacked.\n\nAgnelli said the 232-member ECA is preparing to extend its working agreement with UEFA beyond 2022.\n\nAhead of 2024, European clubs will have a big say in potential changes agreed on with UEFA and FIFA.\n\nAgnelli reiterated that a key issue will be agreeing on the so-called \"International Match Calendar\" which determines when international competitions for national and club teams will be played. It could lead to 20-team leagues in England and Spain being cut in size to harmonize fixture schedules in different countries.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Shipley spends his time these days reading on an Amazon Kindle and iPad.\n\n\u201cI increase the font size, pick the best style, double space the lines, and make the margins wider. Any book feels like reading a newspaper. This makes eye tracking easier for those with dyslexia. I love how technology has let me continue to read.\u201d\n\nNancy Curran who now teaches art at the private Jemicy School in Baltimore for gifted dyslexics or kids with \u201clanguage-based learning differences,\u201d describes herself as one of the lucky ones, having been diagnosed with dyslexia herself in the 8th grade.\n\n\u201cI was at a top private girls school and did not even know my alphabet. It was groundbreaking for me academically but was still a label that was very misunderstood.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Strouse, 14, attends the Jemicy School in Baltimore, along with other gifted students with dyslexia. (Photo: Lisa Strouse)\n\nCurran says there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all classroom solution for dyslexics, \u201cwhich is so completely different from the traditional school system.\u201d\n\nKids at Jemicy \u2013 the student body ranges from the lowest grades on up through high school age \u2013 are taught with iPads and laptops and most every text book is on tape. Some students create flash cards on their phones. Others take advantage of voice-to-text technology.\n\n\u201cSome (students) are auditory learners, some are visual learners, some are kinesthetic learners,\u201d Curran says. She lists a variety of apps and tools commonly used at the school, Texthelp Read&Write, Grammarly, OpenDyslexic Font for Chrome, Spelling City, Explain Everything and Notability, among them.\n\nOne recent breakthrough, Curran says, is that \u201cMath is being accepted now as a language\u2026where you can pick up on a child who maybe excels with literature or verbal words, but then just crashes with math for no apparent reason. As far as different programs, it seems that new ones are coming out every week.\u201d\n\nJemicy student Elizabeth Strouse, 14, who loves math herself, describes some of the strategies that have helped her. \u201cWhen my teacher says read this chapter, I always listen to it.\u201d\n\nStrouse has also been taught how to color code her writing assignments on a computer: In preparing an essay, for example, a topic sentence would be coded in green, the supporting sentences in yellow, additional details in blue, and a final conclusion in red.\n\nShe also takes comfort in the fact that other classmates are in a similar boat. \u201cKnowing that, you still push yourself, but you don\u2019t have to be that stressed about it to be a certain place. You know that there\u2019s things that can help you and because of those things, it makes it 100 times easier.\u201d\n\nHer goal is to be an engineer or involved in interior design some day.\n\n\u201cDyslexia does not need to be seen as a limitation; it is also a gift,\u201d says Elizabeth's mom, Lisa, who also contacted USA TODAY after reading the Branson article.\n\n\u201cSome (dyslexics) are more likely to take risks with their business decisions and have success, Richard Branson as an example.\u201d But she adds that, \u201cyou\u2019ll find this in every field.\u201d\n\nHow is technology changing your life?

(Photo: Emirates airline (via screenshot))\n\nLast update: 2:55 p.m. ET on Friday; Next update: By 8 p.m. ET.\n\nLooking for an air travel bargain this holiday shopping season?\n\n\u201cBlack Friday\u201d and \u201cCyber Monday\u201d are now firmly entrenched on the ever-growing calendar of holiday marketing gimmicks, giving consumers a virtual cornucopia of deal-hunting opportunities timed to the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThe travel industry has enthusiastically adopted the new retail tradition, with hotels, cruise lines and other travel providers all in on the act.\n\nAirlines have joined the fray, too. But holiday bargain-seekers looking for airline deals might be advised to temper their expectations.\n\nThere are several reasons for that. First, airline sales have become ubiquitous. It\u2019s common to see them throughout the year, often at prices so low that they'd be hard to top. Don\u2019t necessarily assume the Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals are better than ones you might see at other times of the year.\n\nTake airfares to Europe, for example. With airline fares sometimes as low as $500 or $600 during \u201cregular\u201d sales, Cyber Monday or Black Friday sales might not be that much better.\n\nThe same goes for domestic fares, where round-trip prices on some routes drop below $100 during some of the bigger sales throughout the year.\n\nInstead, the bigger values this time of year might come on business-class tickets or on travel \u201cpackages\u201d that airlines sell as a bundled offering that includes hotels and (sometimes) rental cars for a single all-in price.\n\nDoes that mean bargain-seekers should shrug off the holiday sales? Of course not. But knowing what to expect \u2013 and what not to \u2013 can help you make sense of the myriad of bargains set to roll out during the next week.\n\nWe\u2019ve included a handful of airline holiday sales below, and we\u2019ll continue to add noteworthy ones to the list as they\u2019re announced. Some will be flash sales that aren't announced until later in the week, so it pays to keep an eye open for updates.\n\nBefore you get to them, however, keep these tips in mind:\n\nAlways read the fine print. Restrictions can include available travel dates, day-of-the-week exclusions or restrictions on fare types. Some may exclude one-way fares.\n\nBeware of flashy \u201chalf off\u201d discounts or similar deals. They may be as advertised, but some have fine print saying the discount is only available on a carrier\u2019s expensive \u201cfull-fare\u201d tickets.\n\nRemember, most sales cover weak periods of the year when fewer people want to travel. Those are the seats that the airlines are hoping to offload on you during these holiday deals.\n\nResearch airline all-in vacation package prices before the sale so you know whether you\u2019re getting a deal.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to add on airline fees. That $99 flight to Europe isn\u2019t just $99 if you plan to check a bag \u2013 or bring a carry-on if you\u2019re flying a true budget airline.\n\nNow, with all of that out of the way, scroll down for the earliest promotions that you might want to check out. We'll update with other noteworthy deals as they roll out, so check back regularly through Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nUpdates will be added at the bottom of this post; scroll down to see the latest offers.\n\nTRIP REPORT: Reviewing the Delta One Suite with sliding privacy doors (deals continue below)\n\nLast update: 2:55 p.m. ET on Friday; Next update: By 8 p.m. ET.\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nThe deals: An early Black Friday deal rolled out Tuesday, offering special fares and frequent-flyer offers from numerous U.S. cities to destinations in Europe and Australia.

The NRA position got some pushback from the medical profession when it appeared on social media, and plenty more after the Chicago shooting.\n\n\"Lemme guess, \u2066@NRA\u2069, still not \u201cour lane\u201d even when it happens in our own hospitals?\" tweeted Chicago surgeon Emil Fernando. \"I don\u2019t think so. #EndGunViolence \u2066@ThisIsOurLane\u2069 \u2066@Chicago_Police\u2069 \u2066@MercyChicago\u2069 \u2066@GunDeaths\u2069\"\n\nMore: Police officer among 4 dead in 'horrific' Chicago hospital shooting\n\nMore: Medical professionals to NRA: Guns are our lane\n\nElizabeth Stephenson, a cardiologist at the The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, tweeted that \"#ThisisOurLane when bullets kill our patients #ThisisOurLane when bullets kill our family - and make no mistake - she was our family, whether we were lucky enough to know her or not. @choo_ek @ThisIsOurLane\"\n\nTeresa Sellers, who cares for dementia patients, was more pointed. \"Maybe the NRA can wipe up blood and hold the hands of the innocent while they die...and get the reality of the lane that is being discussed,\" she tweeted. \"Hell Fire the world laughs that we are still in the cowboy ways!\"\n\nYou know who are still at work?

(Photo: Zbigniew Bzdak, AP)\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 The gunman accused of killing a doctor, a pharmacist and a police officer at Chicago's Mercy Hospital on Monday was kicked out of the city's fire training program more than four years ago for bullying fellow cadets, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nJuan Lopez, 32, bullied multiple cadets, including some women, during his roughly two months at the Chicago Fire Academy in 2014 before he was fired, Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Merritt said.\n\n\"There were some issues with bullying that he was going to be disciplined for, and he went AWOL,\" Merritt told USA TODAY.\n\nMerritt said he did not have details of the incident for which Lopez was to be disciplined. He said Lopez was fired after failing to show up to work for several days. Lopez did not respond to a wellness check from fire officials.\n\nLopez had been married and had a child with his ex-wife, according to divorce records.\n\nHis former wife said Lopez behaved dangerously before the marriage dissolved. He slept with a pistol under his pillow, she said, and brandished a weapon on multiple occasions during fits of anger with a neighbor and a realtor.\n\nThe woman said that after she began the process to legally separate, Lopez sent her a menacing text message suggesting he would go to her job and \u201ccause a scene.\u201d\n\nPolice released details about the deaths Monday of emergency room physician Tamara O'Neal, 38, pharmacy resident Dayna Less, 25, and Officer Samuel Jimenez, 28.\n\nLopez was killed in the attack. He was wounded in the abdomen and also suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head..\n\nLopez approached O'Neal outside the hospital as she left work Monday evening, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. O'Neal contacted police.\n\nO'Neal told police dispatchers that Lopez, her former fiance, was angry and demanded she return an engagement ring, Guglielmi said. She told dispatchers she feared Lopez was armed.\n\nThe gunman opened fire outside the hospital, mortally wounding O\u2019Neal, Guglielmi said. He fired on a police vehicle, then ran into the hospital.\n\nLess was exiting an elevator with another hospital employee when Lopez shot her.\n\nPolice initially said Less was killed in crossfire. Tuesday, officials confirmed that witnesses said the gunman appeared to intentionally shoot at her.\n\nInvestigators said they did not believe the gunman and Less knew each other.\n\nThe hospital employee with Less was not injured.\n\nAs the hospital went on lockdown, the gunman ran back outside, Guglielmi said. By then, more officers had arrived.\n\nLopez shot again at police, who shielded O'Neal's body with their squad cars before retreating back into the hospital.\n\n\"The officers gave chase,\" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. \"They were (across) a hallway, and he was kind of playing peek-a-boo with the officers, firing down the hallway.\"\n\nJimenez was shot in the neck, Guglielmi said.\n\nMichael Davenport, Mercy\u2019s chief medical officer, said the hospital held its first active-shooter drill just weeks before Monday's shooting \u2013 a move that might have prevented worse carnage.\n\nNot all hospital employees participated in the drill, which was a follow-up on internet and classroom instruction for employees, Davenport said.\n\nHe said it appeared hospital employees executed the \u201crun, hide, fight\u201d instruction. Mercy has its own security, but the hospital officers did not get involved in the incident, Guglielmi said.\n\n\u201cNever in our wildest imagination would we ever think that we would have to experience the day we have,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cIt is our inclination, I can speak for myself, you don\u2019t feel well when you\u2019re hiding. You want to open up a door, and you want to see what\u2019s going on, and you want to help.

The patient, a man using a wheelchair, was the first to notice the sound of gunfire. He quickly rolled himself out of the hospital.\n\nHospital workers around the pharmacy pulled down security shutters and took shelter in an office, Fortune said, putting two locked doors between them and the gunman.\n\n\u201cWe heard more gunshots and arguing,'' Fortune said. \u201cWe stayed barricaded for about 30 minutes until the police (arrived), and we ran out a back (exit).\u201d\n\nJennifer Eldridge, a pharmacy technician, said the moment was harrowing as the gunfire continued.\n\n\u201cYou could hear the shots,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could hear him once he was inside. He wasn\u2019t too far from the pharmacy.\u201d\n\nSteven White, a patient who was near the emergency room entrance, said a police officer told everyone to stay down, and he scurried for cover. White said at least 20 patients were near the entrance when the gunman opened fire.\n\n\u201cHe was shooting in the back,\u201d White said. \"All the women started yelling, and the kids started crying.\"\n\nJohnson credited Jimenez and the other officers who rushed to the scene with preventing more deaths. Jimenez joined the department less than two years ago.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that all those officers who responded are heroes,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nChicago Police officer Samuel Jimenez was killed in the shooting attack Monday. (Photo: CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT / HANDOUT, EPA-EFE)\n\nMost mass shootings in the USA are related to domestic or family violence. The assailants in 54 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2016 killed intimate partners or other family members, according to an analysis by Everytown, a group that advocates for stricter gun laws.\n\nThe gunman legally purchased four weapons in the past five years and had a valid firearms owner identification card and a concealed-carry license, Guglielmi said. Authorities searched residences Tuesday connected to Lopez in Chicago and Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nLopez was enrolled as a graduate student at DePaul University, pursuing a master's degree in public service management, university spokeswoman Carol Hughes said. The gunman earned a bachelor's degree from the university in 2013. He also worked at the Chicago Housing Authority's customer care center, a job Lopez had held since February, according to the agency.\n\nPatrick Connor, chairman of the hospital\u2019s emergency department, described O\u2019Neal, a doctor a couple of years past her medical residency, as a \u201cmost fascinating, hardworking\u201d person.\n\nConnor called O\u2019Neal \u201cthe best person ever\u201d and said she was dedicated to helping others.\n\nShe raised money each year to help pay for school supplies for disadvantaged children. Her one request for him, Connor said, was to have Sundays off so she could sing with her church choir.\n\n\u201cIf you were an extremist, she was the right person for you,\u201d Connor said, holding back tears. \u201cShe never missed work and her total dedication to her church.

The references feel authentic and clever while avoiding the cringe factor that critics who reviewed \"The Emoji Movie\" knew all too well.\n\nThe five most spot-on depictions of social media and viral videos in \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\":\n\n1. YouTube isn't just a place for silly cat videos \u2013 it's a platform where people make a legit living.\n\nOK, so the \"Ralph\" universe's online video site is technically called BuzzzTube, but we're talking about the same thing here. Yesss (voiced by Taraji P. Henson), BuzzzTube's \"head algorithm,\" tells Ralph (John C. Reilly) he can make a ton of money if he can produce a handful of viral videos.\n\nYesss (voiced by Taraji P. Henson, center) shows Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) around cyberspace in the animated sequel \"Ralph Breaks the Internet.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\nAnd that's true for real-life YouTube stars: Lilly Singh, one of the site's top content creators, has more than 14 million subscribers and earned an estimated $10.5 million last year.\n\nBonus: Hardcore fans might notice a cameo appearance by an animated version of YouTube star Colleen Ballinger (better known online as her wacky alter ego Miranda Sings).\n\n2. But make no mistake, some pretty dumb stuff still goes viral.\n\nBefore Ralph can make a viral video, he needs to learn what topics generally do well online. Among them: the ghost pepper challenge, goats and \"Chewbacca Dad: It's like Chewbacca Mom, but a daddy,\" as one of Yesss's assistants puts it.\n\nRalph (voiced by John C. Reilly, center left) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) are wowed by the World Wide Web in \"Ralph Breaks the Internet.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n3. Of course eBay would look like a huge auction house IRL.\n\nRalph and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) swing by a handful of social media and online sites during their visit to the World Wide Web, and Disney got creative with the way those digital forums were manifested in physical locations.\n\nInstagram, for example, is a spacious art museum with users' posts hanging all over the walls, while eBay is an enormous warehouse for individual auctions. Twitter is literally a bunch of birds chirping in trees.\n\nRalph and Vanellope also meet the physical embodiment of a pop-up ad: a guy named J.P. Spamley (played by an uncredited Bill Hader), who brings the duo back to his run-down, gross-looking home. He claims his \"anti-virus guy was just here\" as something that looks like the digital version of a cockroach scurries by.\n\nVanellope (voiced by Sarah Silverman, left) and Ralph (John C. Reilly) have their close friendship tested in \"Ralph Breaks the Internet.\" (Photo: DISNEY)\n\n4. Do. Not. Read. The. Comments.\n\nAt one point, Ralph innocently strolls into an ominously barren part of BuzzzTube: the comments section. He begins reading a few kind words from users excited to see him in videos and naively remarks that the internet is \"So positive!\"\n\nBut then some super-mean \u2013 but also laughably clean as comments go, because this is PG-rated animation \u2013 prove him otherwise. Ralph is called \"stupid,\" \"fat and ugly\" and a \"worthless bum.\"\n\nSteer clear of the comments section, Ralph. They'll only upset you and none of them are as SFW as this one.\n\n5. Vine may be dead, but the references live on\n\nVine, a popular app that allowed users to upload six-second videos, shut down in 2017, but fans of the quick, goofy and irreverent videos have since uploaded their favorites to YouTube.\n\nIt's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot, but one kid playing an online video game has a large orange \"Road Work Ahead\" sign hanging on the wall in his bedroom. Our fingers are crossed that the writers intended it as a nod to one popular vine, in which a youth sees a sign that reads \"Road Work Ahead\" and jokingly expresses concern: \"Uh, yeah, I sure hope it does!\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/11/20/ralph-breaks-internet-5-ways-disney-nails-online-culture/1919120002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP, AP", "title": "AP Top Stories November 20 A", "description": "Here's the latest for Tuesday November 20th: Judge issues ban against Trump asylum policy; Suspect, 3 others dead in Chicago hospital shooting; Shooting in downtown Denver; Washington Post reports Ivanka Trump used personal email for government business.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2018/11/20/ap-top-stories-november-20-/38570979/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5969436654001_5969436446001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:53:46Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Wochit, USA TODAY, Wochit", "title": "Bobby Bones takes home 'Dancing with the Stars' Mirrorball trophy", "description": "Country radio host Bobby Bones and professional dancer Sharna Burgess were crowned the winners \"Dancing With the Stars\" season 27.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/world/2018/11/20/bobby-bones-takes-home-dancing-stars-mirrorball-trophy/38570951/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5969437766001_5969431745001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:51:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Thanksgiving will never be the same with this White Castle stuffing", "description": "White Castle has unveiled its recipe for  \u201chands down the best turkey stuffing,\u201d made with their signature sliders.

On Wednesday, exactly four years before the next World Cup is scheduled to open at Lusail Stadium outside Doha, the country still will be only No. 96.\n\nThere are positives, however, including Qatar's 1-0 victory over Switzerland last week in a friendly match \u2014 an eye-opening result against a team that reached the round of 16 at the last two World Cups.\n\n\"It's a big win for us especially (because) a lot of people don't know us,\" Qatar midfielder Assim Madibo said. \"I think they will know us more after this game ... Now we are only focusing on playing big games so we will get respect and people will know us.\"\n\nRespect has been hard to come by for Qatar's national team and the country's hosting of the tournament in general. The team's ranking has fluctuated between No. 78 and No. 112 since the December 2010 vote, and concerns about labor conditions for migrant workers has been an ongoing issue.\n\nThe win over Switzerland and subsequent 2-2 draw against Iceland were good signs, though a far cry from the progress Iceland has made in the same eight years, rising from No. 110 in the FIFA rankings to No. 36 following a quarterfinal run at the 2016 European Championship.\n\nStill, the team is improving under coach Felix Sanchez, who spent a decade as a youth coach at Barcelona before becoming Qatar's ninth coach in eight years.\n\nAgainst the Swiss, the Qataris defended well and played their way out of danger rather than kicking long balls out from the back. The passing was crisp and accurate and it was from one of the frequent attempts at a breakaway that Akram Afif scored the game's only goal in the 86th minute.\n\nThey're not quite Barcelona, but they're not too bad, either.\n\n\"I was working there for 10 years,\" Sanchez said of his time at Barcelona. \"When you go to work in a different place you need to adapt your philosophy. There are many things that we tried to keep and there are games where we can show more.\n\n\"There are games where we cannot do 100 percent what we have to do and of course you have the opposition in front ... we need to do more things that we're not used to do but it's the way to compete.\"\n\nMost of the players who traveled to Europe for the two friendlies are young and all are based in Qatar \u2014 90 percent of them having graduated from the state-of-the-art Aspire training academy. But with an average age of 24, many will be hitting their peak in 2022.\n\nQatar has also beaten Iraq, China, Palestine and Ecuador this year, but sterner competition is expected next year at both the Asian Cup and the Copa America, where the country is competing as a guest nation and could end up facing Brazil and Argentina.\n\n\"It's steps we have to do to arrive in 2022 ready to compete,\" said Sanchez, who knows his players well after working with most of them on under-age teams and at Aspire.\n\n\"Of course, for the players it's a big motivation to play against such teams and start to feel what is the real pressure in official competition against one of the top national teams in the world like Brazil, Argentina or one of those.\"\n\nAlthough Sanchez seems like the perfect fit because of his years of experience in Qatar, there is no guarantee he will still have his job in four years. Especially with high-profile possibilities like Pep Guardiola and Xavi Hernandez, both with experience playing in Qatar, being mentioned as potential future candidates.\n\nGuardiola's contract as manager at Manchester City expires in 2021, while Xavi \u2014 who plays for Qatari club Al Sadd \u2014 has said he would like to someday move into coaching.\n\n\"Of course it will be a dream to be there but four years in football is ... you cannot say,\" Sanchez said, smiling wryly. \"Hopefully.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Emirates airline (via screenshot))\n\nLast update: 2:55 p.m. ET on Friday; Next update: By 8 p.m. ET.\n\nLooking for an air travel bargain this holiday shopping season?\n\n\u201cBlack Friday\u201d and \u201cCyber Monday\u201d are now firmly entrenched on the ever-growing calendar of holiday marketing gimmicks, giving consumers a virtual cornucopia of deal-hunting opportunities timed to the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThe travel industry has enthusiastically adopted the new retail tradition, with hotels, cruise lines and other travel providers all in on the act.\n\nAirlines have joined the fray, too. But holiday bargain-seekers looking for airline deals might be advised to temper their expectations.\n\nThere are several reasons for that. First, airline sales have become ubiquitous. It\u2019s common to see them throughout the year, often at prices so low that they'd be hard to top. Don\u2019t necessarily assume the Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals are better than ones you might see at other times of the year.\n\nTake airfares to Europe, for example. With airline fares sometimes as low as $500 or $600 during \u201cregular\u201d sales, Cyber Monday or Black Friday sales might not be that much better.\n\nThe same goes for domestic fares, where round-trip prices on some routes drop below $100 during some of the bigger sales throughout the year.\n\nInstead, the bigger values this time of year might come on business-class tickets or on travel \u201cpackages\u201d that airlines sell as a bundled offering that includes hotels and (sometimes) rental cars for a single all-in price.\n\nDoes that mean bargain-seekers should shrug off the holiday sales? Of course not. But knowing what to expect \u2013 and what not to \u2013 can help you make sense of the myriad of bargains set to roll out during the next week.\n\nWe\u2019ve included a handful of airline holiday sales below, and we\u2019ll continue to add noteworthy ones to the list as they\u2019re announced. Some will be flash sales that aren't announced until later in the week, so it pays to keep an eye open for updates.\n\nBefore you get to them, however, keep these tips in mind:\n\nAlways read the fine print. Restrictions can include available travel dates, day-of-the-week exclusions or restrictions on fare types. Some may exclude one-way fares.\n\nBeware of flashy \u201chalf off\u201d discounts or similar deals. They may be as advertised, but some have fine print saying the discount is only available on a carrier\u2019s expensive \u201cfull-fare\u201d tickets.\n\nRemember, most sales cover weak periods of the year when fewer people want to travel. Those are the seats that the airlines are hoping to offload on you during these holiday deals.\n\nResearch airline all-in vacation package prices before the sale so you know whether you\u2019re getting a deal.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to add on airline fees. That $99 flight to Europe isn\u2019t just $99 if you plan to check a bag \u2013 or bring a carry-on if you\u2019re flying a true budget airline.\n\nNow, with all of that out of the way, scroll down for the earliest promotions that you might want to check out. We'll update with other noteworthy deals as they roll out, so check back regularly through Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nUpdates will be added at the bottom of this post; scroll down to see the latest offers.\n\nTRIP REPORT: Reviewing the Delta One Suite with sliding privacy doors (deals continue below)\n\nLast update: 2:55 p.m. ET on Friday; Next update: By 8 p.m. ET.\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nThe deals: An early Black Friday deal rolled out Tuesday, offering special fares and frequent-flyer offers from numerous U.S. cities to destinations in Europe and Australia.

When it was found, the snake was two weeks old and six inches long.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/20/rare-two-headed-snake-found-virginia-two-months-ago-has-died/2064337002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Cassidy Olsen, USA TODAY", "title": "Black Friday 2018: The best Macy's deals on Dyson, KitchenAid, Apple Watches and", "description": "These are the best deals from Macy's Black Friday ad", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/20/black-friday-2018-best-macys-deals-dyson-kitchenaid-mixers-nespresso-and-more/2064020002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/141f7566-9006-433e-b588-ed8a4ca7f6af/141f7566-9006-433e-b588-ed8a4ca7f6af_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:22:03Z", "content": "\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

(Photo: Metafora Production via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Seven weeks after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Trump administration is still scrambling to come up with a cohesive response to the Washington Post columnist\u2019s death and resolve a vexing foreign policy crisis.\n\nDespite unrelenting domestic and international pressure to punish Saudi Arabia for its role in Khashoggi's killing, President Donald Trump has continued to play up the kingdom\u2019s status as a key U.S. ally \u2013 and play down evidence that the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have ordered the American resident's murder.\n\n\u201cTheir strategy has been to hope that the truth doesn\u2019t come out,\u201d said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and national security adviser in the Obama administration, now with National Security Action, an advocacy group critical of Trump's foreign policy agenda.\n\n\"They\u2019ve taken steps to try and let out some of the pressure, especially from Congress,\" he said. \"But with each opening of the pressure valve, new damning revelations have followed about Saudi complicity in this murder.\"\n\nThe Washington Post and other news outlets reported last Friday that the CIA has concluded that the crown prince, the country\u2019s de facto ruler, ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder. The Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that the CIA\u2019s analysis was based on multiple intelligence sources.\n\nSaudi Arabia has repeatedly denied that Salman had any involvement in the death of Khashoggi, who was killed Oct. 2 inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and critic of the Saudi regime who fled his home country last year, had gone into the diplomatic facility to get documents he needed for his upcoming marriage to a Turkish woman.\n\nTurkish officials say their evidence shows that Khashoggi was brutally murdered and dismembered inside the consulate by Saudi operatives. Saudi officials have offered shifting accounts \u2013 first claiming Khashoggi left the consulate unharmed and eventually conceding he was murdered there. Khashoggi\u2019s remains have still not been found.\n\nAwaiting \u2018full report\u2019\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said the CIA had not \"assessed anything yet\" and called Saudi Arabia a \"spectacular ally.\" Trump said his administration would produce a \u201cfull report\u201d detailing the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi\u2019s death, including \u201cwho did it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, White House officials had little information on the status of that report, and officials at the CIA and the State Department declined to comment on it. Several foreign policy experts said they did not expect Trump's promised report to be a full accounting.\n\n\"I expect the administration to stall and prevaricate,\" said Bruce Riedel, a Middle East expert with the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank in Washington.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former adviser to six previous secretaries of state, said the Trump administration has gone to \u201cextreme lengths\u201d to give the princeand other members of the Saudi royal family the benefit of the doubt, and he expects any report on Khashoggi\u2019s death to follow that line.\n\n\"I suspect the administration\u2019s strategy is to argue there is not a proverbial smoking gun\" proving the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing, said Miller, now with the Wilson Center, a foreign policy research organization. He said it's part of a broader effort by the administration to \"preserve at all costs this relationship with Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"Congress clearly has other things in mind.\"\n\nSenior lawmakers in both parties say they\u2019re convinced the crown prince, known by his initials MBS, knew about and directed Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\n\"If you know anything about Saudi Arabia and anything about MBS, the fact that he didn't know about it is impossible for me to believe,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Sunday. \" ... He's irrational. He's unhinged. And I think he's done a lot of damage to the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has taken two steps to respond to Khashoggi\u2019s killing; barring 21 Saudis from traveling to the U.S., and imposing sanctions on 17 Saudi individuals.\n\n\"The administration seems far from paralyzed,\" said Danielle Pletka, a senior vice president for foreign and defense policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"It has demanded answers, sanctioned individuals in Saudi and demanded a cease fire in Yemen,\" where a Saudi-led coalition is battling rebels backed by Iran.\n\n\" ... It is Trump himself who remains reluctant to finger the Crown Prince,\" she added.\n\nSanctions not enough\n\nLawmakers welcomed the sanctions but said it was not enough. Graham and others are pushing legislation that would suspend potentially billions of dollars in U.S. weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose mandatory sanctions on individuals responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death under the Magnitsky Act. It would also require the Trump administration to document human rights in Saudi Arabia and impose new accountability measures for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said that Khashoggi\u2019s death should not jeopardize possible U.S. weapons sales to the kingdom or the broader U.S.-Saudi alliance. The administration is relying heavily on Saudi Arabia in its campaign to isolate Iran.\n\nPletka said Khashoggi's death presents the administration with a \"no-win situation,\" complicated by Trump\u2019s inclination to contradict those he believes are motivated by domestic politics rather than Saudi human rights considerations. Other experts agreed that punishing Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi, while trying to preserve the broader alliance, is a complicated task.\n\n\"There\u2019s no simple answer to this,\" said Price. But there are several steps the administration could take to signal this \"is not business as usual,\" he said, such as ending all U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen and calling on the regime to release all its political prisoners.\n\n\"We're not hearing anything close to that just yet,\" Price said. \"The administration had hoped these sanctions would be the end of it.\"\n\nContributing: John Fritze and Christal Hayes\n\nMore: Trump says he's taking 'a lot of things into consideration' on Khashoggi's killing.

(Photo: Google Street View)\n\nBELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Alaska Airlines' plan to start its 18 daily flights out of Everett likely will impact traffic at Bellingham International Airport, but officials here are trying to attract more destinations \u2014 including Mexico \u2014 for local and Canadian travelers.\n\nBellingham's airport is located about 70 miles north of Everett, Washington, where the Paine Field airport is set to get its first commercial flights in decades early next year.\n\nAlaska Airlines is now selling tickets for flights from Everett's Paine Field beginning Feb. 11. The airline is kicking off ticket sales with special fares as low as $39 one way.\n\nIn an unexpected move, Southwest Airlines also sent out a news release saying that it has decided not to fly out of Paine Field, transferring its slots to Alaska and keeping all of its area flights at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.\n\nThe Alaska flights out of Everett will be to eight western U.S. cities: Las Vegas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Orange County, California.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Alaska Airlines: Everett Paine Field flights will begin Feb. 11\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Southwest adds 10 new routes, cuts two; drops Paine Field plan\n\nThe effort to add flights at Paine Field would position it as a secondary airport for Seattle, which is about 40 miles to the south. Traffic in the region has made it difficult for some in metro Seattle to get to the city's primary airport, Seattle-Tacoma International, which is further south of downtown.\n\nBellingham, on the other hand, sits in the northwest corner of Washington state. It's more than 100 miles from Seattle and draws heavily from Canadians and local residents. Airport officials there expect the new options in Everett may draw some fliers there.\n\nWhen Alaska first announced plans for Everett in January, Port of Bellingham Aviation Director Sunil Harman said he expected passenger traffic at the Bellingham airport to drop by about 5 percent.\n\nGiven the air service demand and the infrastructure constraints in the north Seattle area, Harman said in an email Thursday, he believes this new capacity will quickly be saturated and by 2020, Bellingham will resume growing.\n\nLocal and Canadian passengers make up most of Bellingham's market. After years of decreasing numbers because of a weakening Canadian dollar, Bellingham's passenger numbers have stabilized this year.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: From Buffalo to Bellingham, U.S. airports court Canadian flyers\n\nAccording to data collected by the Port of Bellingham, more than 313,000 people took flights out of the Bellingham airport through October, about 1,000 more than the same period in 2017.\n\nHarman said some factors in the stabilizing numbers was increased service from Allegiant, along with the use of larger planes by Alaska. The return of seasonal flights to Denver also helped, he said.\n\nPassenger numbers could also get a boost in the final weeks of 2018 as Allegiant started its new nonstop service from Bellingham to Tucson, Arizona on Thursday.\n\n\"With the number of Canadians owning and purchasing winters homes in the (Tucson) area .... this should be a successful market,\" Harman said.\n\nThe year-round service operates twice weekly, according to a news release from Allegiant. With the new flight, Allegiant now flies to seven cities out of Bellingham, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Diego.\n\nAlaska Airlines has started seasonal service from Bellingham to Hawaii, but also recently ended its service to its hub in Portland.\n\nThe loss of the Portland market was disappointing to Harman, who said they are working to restore that destination. Port officials also are \"aggressively\" pursuing United Airlines to try and establish service in Bellingham.\n\nOther markets they hope to land include Mexico, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Reno.\n\nThe peak year for the airport was in 2013, when nearly 600,000 people flew out of Bellingham, according to The Bellingham Herald archives. At the time, the Canadian dollar was about on par with the U.S. dollar, an indicator of how influential the Canadian market is to the Bellingham airport when the loonie is strong.\n\nContributing: Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Photo tour: Behind the scenes at the Boeing factory in Everett\n\nThis file photo from September 2014 shows an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 on approach to Los Angeles International Airport.

(Photo: Evan Agostini, Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Many young boys grow up with superheroes adorning their walls. Jonah Hill grew up with a picture of Martin Scorsese on his.\n\nThe actor related the poignant anecdote at a star-studded benefit Monday evening at the Museum of Modern Art, honoring the celebrated director both for his contributions to both cinema and to film restoration and preservation.\n\n\"You might not even understand how often just the image of you creates young people who want to be filmmakers every single day,\" said Hill, who worked with Scorsese on \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and just released his directorial debut, \"Mid90s,\" last month.\n\nHill added: \"As far as I'm concerned that's the coolest thing in the entire world. Thank you for just existing, because I am only up here because you did what you did.\"\n\nAlso among the speakers at MoMA's annual film benefit, which raises funds to bring great works of film to the museum's collection, were Hollywood heavyweights Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, two of the actors most closely associated with Scorsese.\n\nMore: Why it took 28 years to bring Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' to the screen\n\nDiCaprio, who's appeared in five Scorsese films including \"Shutter Island,\" ''The Departed,\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" also went back to his youth to describe the influence Scorsese, 76, had on him.\n\nHe told the audience how when he was just 15, and starting his journey as an actor, his father took him to a movie theater for inspiration.\n\n\"He pointed at the screen, and as the reels of 'Goodfellas' began to spin, he said, 'This is the epitome of modern filmmaking,'\" DiCaprio recounted. \"'This is someone who you may be lucky enough one day to work with, and when it comes to directors, Martin Scorsese is where the bar is set.'\"\n\nThe actor added that from that moment, \"I made it a goal, I made it a relentless ambition to work alongside the master we're celebrating here tonight.\" The pair is about to start on its sixth collaboration, the crime thriller \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nDiCaprio also spoke of Scorsese as a lifelong teacher, from his constant on-set references to film history to his efforts to restore and preserve old films with The Film Foundation, which he founded in 1990.\n\n\"No one on earth has so relentlessly pioneered the salvation of movie history with such commitment the way Martin Scorsese has,\" DiCaprio said.\n\nDe Niro, who's made nine feature films with Scorsese, including classics like \"Taxi Driver,\" ''Raging Bull\" and \"Goodfellas,\" spoke of the director's many years of friendship.\n\n\"Marty's gift for friendship is directly related to his many gifts for filmmaking,\" the actor said. The director has, he said, \"a giant heart that understands and embraces every character he helps us create, and every story he tells.\"\n\nDe Niro also quipped to the crowd that Scorsese's first career ambition was to be a priest. \"My theory was that he changed when he realized that being a priest meant serving God, but being a director meant BEING God,\" he said.\n\nHill told the story of how Scorsese had instructed an actor in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" to punch him for real, because the fake punches were looking, well, fake.\n\nHill noted that he had adopted that technique for \"Mid90s,\" but Scorsese, when he came to the podium, jokingly admonished him. \"I wouldn't advise that for young filmmakers,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/11/20/martin-scorsese-reunites-leonardo-dicaprio-robert-de-niro/2064479002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Buzz60, Buzz60, Buzz60", "title": "Ivanka Trump used personal email for White House business", "description": "Throughout the 2016 Presidential campaign, President Trump called out Hillary Clinton for using her private email for official White House business.Now White House Advisor Ivanka Trump reportedly might be doing the same thing.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/world/2018/11/20/ivanka-trump-used-personal-email-white-house-business/38570595/", "urlToImage": "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5969392109001_5969390982001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:49:44Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Alan Siegel", "title": "2018 NFL playoff picture through Week 11 - Touchdown Wire", "description": "Touchdown Wire 2018 NFL playoff picture through Week 11 Touchdown Wire With the season past the midway point, let's see how the playoff picture is shaping up.

Patrick Mahomes threw for 478 yards and a Monday Night Football record six touchdowns. The bad? Kansas City turned the ball over five times, gave up 455 total yards, and still lost to the Rams, 54-51. If the Chiefs were slightly less sloppy, they likely would\u2019ve pulled off the road win.\n\n2. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2-1)\n\nThe Steelers needed a late comeback capped by end-zone dive by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to finally beat the Jaguars on Sunday, but the win, no matter how ugly, has Pittsburgh in prime position. The Chargers are on tap in two weeks, but if the Steelers want to hold onto the bye, they can\u2019t overlook the Broncos this week.\n\n3. New England Patriots (7-3)\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s win means the Patriots didn\u2019t gain any ground in the playoff race this week. Meanwhile, the Chargers and Texans are nipping at New England\u2019s heels. A win against the rival Jets is essential if the Pats still want a chance at a bye.\n\n4. Houston Texans (7-3)\n\nThe Texans are on a seven-game winning streak, but during that stretch hadn\u2019t beaten a team that currently has a winning record until Sunday, when they knocked off the Redskins in Washington. Houston faces the Titans on Monday night.\n\n5. Los Angeles Chargers (7-3)\n\nAfter an ugly loss to the Broncos, L.A. looks to rebound against the lowly Cardinals. After that, the Chargers travel to Pittsburgh for a big Sunday night clash.\n\n6. Baltimore Ravens (5-5)\n\nIn his first NFL start, quarterback Lamar Jackson completed 13 of 19 passes for 150 yards and ran for 117 yards on 27 carries. Not bad for the rookie signal caller, who led the Ravens to a 24-21 victory over the Bengals. Now in the playoff hunt, Baltimore hosts Oakland this week.\n\nNFC\n\n1. Los Angeles Rams (10-1)\n\nIn the game of the year so far, the Rams outlasted the Chiefs. Jared Goff threw for 413 yards and four touchdowns, including the winning score, a 40-yard strike to Gerald Everett. Linebacker Samson Ebukam even scored twice, first on a fumble recovery return and then on an interception return. It was not, however, a banner night for the L.A. defense, which gave up 546 total yards.\n\n2. New Orleans Saints (9-1)\n\nAnother week, another demolition project complete. Seven days after destroying the Bengals, the Saints blew out the Eagles, 48-7. Drew Brees, who looks like the MVP front runner, leads the league with a ridiculous 76.9 completion percentage. That would break the single-season NFL record (72.0) he set last year.\n\n3. Chicago Bears (7-3)\n\nChicago notched a huge win over the rival Vikings on Sunday night and now has Detroit on Thanksgiving. One thing to watch: quarterback Mitch Trubisky reportedly injured his shoulder against Minnesota. It\u2019s unclear how severe it is.\n\n4. Washington Redskins (6-4)\n\nWashington\u2019s up-and-down season continues; the Redskins have split their last four games. After losing to the Texans last Sunday at home, Washington now has to play at rival Dallas on Thanksgiving. A week later, the Skins are on the road at Philadelphia. Two straight wins could go a long way toward an NFC East crown.\n\n5. Carolina Panthers (6-4)\n\nComing off a bad loss to the Lions, the Panthers host the Seahawks this week. If Carolina can just be a little sharper it\u2019ll go a long way. After Seattle, the Panthers have the Buccaneers and the Browns before a huge matchup against the Saints on December 17.\n\n6. Minnesota Vikings (5-4-1)\n\nThe Vikings are 2-2 in their last four games. Quarterback Kirk Cousins has thrown four interceptions in Minnesota\u2019s last three games, including two in last week\u2019s loss to the Bears. With the Packers this week and then the Patriots and Seahawks up after that, Minnesota\u2019s playoff hopes could be dimming."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "National Trust for Historic Preservation, Lauren Walser, National Trust for Historic Preservation", "title": "Raise a glass to the golden era of train travel at Los Angeles' Union Station", "description": "Imperial Western Beer Co. and The Streamliner are now open at Los Angeles\u2019 Union Station.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2018/11/20/imperial-western-streamliner-bar-los-angeles-union-station/2060755002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/107e7567-ff1f-4c99-a6c9-291f1bf58311-4_Imperial_Western_Imperial_Western_seating_cr_Frank_Wonho_Lee_orig.jpg?crop=5988,3368,x0,y630&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:45:48Z", "content": "Last Slide Next Slide The restored space highlights the original Art Deco, Spanish Colonial, and Southwestern design features.

(Photo: Frank Wonho Lee)\n\nFor decades, the former Fred Harvey restaurant at Los Angeles\u2019 Union Station sat vacant, its soaring ceiling and Art Deco, Spanish Colonial Revival, and Southwestern design elements hidden from the public.\n\nWhen it opened in 1939, the restaurant \u2013 designed by architect Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter as part of the Fred Harvey chain of eateries found at many railroad stations starting in the 1870s \u2013 was a popular spot for hungry travelers and, in the 1940s, men returning home from war. But the restaurant closed in 1967. It remained largely empty, used only for the occasional film shoot or special event.\n\nFinally in October 2018, following a major four-year renovation process, the space reopened its doors to the public as two new dining establishments: Imperial Western Beer Co., a restaurant and bar with its own attached brewery, and The Streamliner, a smaller craft cocktail bar.\n\nBoth put their historic details on full display.\n\nImperial Western Beer Co., named after the legendary Southern Pacific train of the 1930s, is a cavernous space featuring tiled walls, a floor designed to look like a Navajo rug, and windows that flood the space with natural light. With seating for more than 400 patrons, the restaurant is now also equipped with light fixtures and custom-built furniture, including deep leather booths and a bar made of brass, walnut and fluted glass, all inspired by 1940s train travel, along with tables for games like pool, shuffleboard and checkers.\n\nOn the menu, there's a selection of craft beer brewed in-house, plus items like oysters, fish tacos, fried chicken, burgers and po\u2019boys.\n\nAdjacent to Imperial Western Beer Co. is The Streamliner, a much smaller, more intimate lounge in what was once a breezeway leading to the former Fred Harvey restaurant. Today it retains many of its Streamline Moderne details, like its curved walls, amber bubble glass, and the original wainscot panels that were uncovered in the restoration process.\n\nCocktails are the main draw, but the menu also includes beer, wine, and plenty of bar snacks.\n\nBoth Imperial Western Beer Co. and The Streamliner are the vision of 213 Hospitality, a Los Angeles-based, preservation-minded hospitality group helmed by Cedd Moses. The team at 213 Hospitality partnered with design firm AvroKo, architect Janel Wright Design, and R.S. Herman Architects to bring the storied Union Station restaurant back to life. The Los Angeles Conservancy served as an advisor on the project.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2018/11/20/imperial-western-streamliner-bar-los-angeles-union-station/2060755002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "L.A. bars recall the golden age of train travel", "description": "Imperial Western Beer Co. and The Streamliner are now open at Los Angeles\u2019 Union Station.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2018/11/20/imperial-western-beer-co-streamliner-open-l-s-union-station/2061432002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/b2c49f0a-2c0f-42b9-a69b-88558d84a0c8-1_Imperial_Western_Imperial_Western_overall_cr_Frank_Wonho_Lee_orig.jpg?crop=5957,3351,x1,y349&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:43:35Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nImperial Western Beer Co., named after the legendary Southern Pacific train of the 1930s, is a cavernous space featuring tiled walls, a floor designed to look like a Navajo rug, and windows that flood the space with natural light.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump will have as many as two more Republican votes in the Senate next year, but he also will confront wavering Republicans, a loss of centrists and a coterie of Democratic presidential candidates in no mood for compromise.\n\nIn other words, the Senate will remain a tough place for Trump to do business.\n\nRepublicans flipped their fourth Senate seat this week when Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson conceded to Republican Rick Scott after a grueling, 12-day recount. If Republicans win a runoff on Tuesday in Mississippi \u2013 the last holdover from the Nov. 6 election \u2013 they will have a 53-seat majority, two more than the party has now.\n\nBut the cushioning may provide little comfort for Trump.\n\n\u201cI'm doubtful that the extra seats are that valuable in a legislative sense,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist.\n\nThe Senate's new composition will change the political dynamic beyond just vote counts. Outspoken Republican critics of the president such as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee will be gone. Mitt Romney\u2019s election in Utah, on the other hand, elevates a well-known voice who vociferously opposed Trump in 2016.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the landscape may change for the president in the next Senate:\n\nSlightly bigger cushion\n\nIn a place where votes are often close, two more seats give Republicans more breathing room. That could help Trump get more of his appointees confirmed \u2013 including another Supreme Court justice, if a vacancy occurred. And it could help the GOP block efforts to remove Trump from power should House Democrats pursue an impeachment.\n\nBut based solely on vote tallies, the GOP gain of two won't amount to much given that 60 votes are still needed for virtually all controversial bills. Trump has pressed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change Senate rules to lower that threshold, but the Kentucky Republican has rejected the idea in the past.\n\n\"My age-old question is whether the president and his team have learned anything at all about the legislative process, especially when it comes to the Senate,\" said Jim Manley, who worked for former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \"Trump, for one, can\u2019t get over the fact that McConnell's never going to change the rules of the Senate.\"\n\nMost appointments, even high-profile nominees like Justice Brett Kavanaugh, can win confirmation with a simple majority.\n\nOn the other hand, two more votes could take the pressure off centrist Republicans such as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom helped tank the GOP-led repeal of the Affordable Care Act last year, Binder said.\n\n\"Their votes are conceptually less pivotal now that Republicans hold more seats,\" she said.\n\nNervous Republicans\n\nThat dynamic will be especially important to watch given the 2020 Senate map.\n\nIn the reverse of this year, it is Republicans who will be defending most of the Senate seats up for election in 2020. But unlike the challenge many Democrats faced in seeking re-election in states carried by Trump, only two Republicans will be up in states Trump lost in 2016.\n\nOne of those senators, Collins, drew the ire of Democrats who had supported her before she voted to confirm Kavanaugh. An online campaign to defeat Collins has raised more than $3.7 million even though she does not yet have an opponent.\n\n\u201cSusan Collins has to repair her relationship with the Democrats in Maine,\u201d said Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker.\n\nColorado Sen. Cory Garner represents a state recently considered winnable by either party but now looks increasingly Democratic. And Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis will have to hold on to states won by both Trump and President Barack Obama.\n\nBut because McConnell now has a few more votes to spare, it will be easier to give vulnerable senators a pass on a tough vote, said John Hudak, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cIn a Senate with 51 votes, you don\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d Hudak said. \u201cIn a Senate with 53 votes, you do.\u201d\n\nFewer moderate Democrats\n\nRepublicans defeated three of the Democrats who voted with them most often, leaving fewer opportunities to pad their slim majority with help from the other side.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is more polarized,\u201d said Steve Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nDefeated Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, for example, worked with Republicans this year to ease some of the banking regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. Donnelly and Heitkamp sided with fellow Democrats on votes that split the parties slightly less than two-thirds of the time in the last two years, according to Congressional Quarterly.\n\nBut two other line crossers \u2013 West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester \u2013 survived. And Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who has voted with his party about 60 percent of the time since winning a special election in 2017, will face the voters in his conservative state again in 2020, giving him an incentive to showcase a moderate record.\n\nWhile Baker said there\u2019s always opportunities for bipartisan action in the Senate, such islands of cooperation are rare in today\u2019s sea of partisanship.\n\n\u201cThe American people just have to be satisfied with the fact that there are very, very few areas of legislation in which there is going to be cooperation between Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Baker said.\n\nLooming presidential election\n\nVoters may be ready to tune out elections for a while, but with as many as a dozen Democrats in the Senate already eyeing a presidential run, it will be difficult to separate all but the most routine legislation from the 2020 campaign.\n\nFrom high-profile names such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to lesser known figures like Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the Senate floor is likely to become a proving ground for Democratic opposition to Trump.\n\nThe sheer number of Senate Democrats believed to be considering a run for president could wind up having practical implications for the chamber's schedule, too.\n\nDemocrats considering a run will need to attend fundraisers in California and New York, taking them away from Washington with increasing frequency. As they move closer to primary season, they'll have to devote considerably more time to early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThat could prove a headache for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on close votes.\n\n\"It\u2019s definitely going to be a situation in which he\u2019s got to herd rabbits or cats \u2013 or some other creature that doesn't want to be herded,\" Baker said.\n\nTrump loyalists\n\nTwo Republican senators who had publicly criticized Trump \u2013 Arizona\u2019s Flake and Tennessee\u2019s Corker \u2013 retired rather than seek re-election this year. Corker\u2019s successor, Marsha Blackburn, tied herself closely to Trump, as did the Republicans who defeated Donnelly, Heitkamp and McCaskill.\n\nThat could ramp up the already-high Trump loyalty in the GOP caucus.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Scott, who narrowly defeated Nelson, did try to put some distance between himself and Trump in his campaign advertising \u2013 despite being one of the first prominent Republican politicians in the nation to embrace Trump's candidacy in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhen I don\u2019t agree with what President Trump does or says, I\u2019ve said it,\u201d Scott said in a Spanish-language ad that aired at low levels. \u201cMy only commitment is with you.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Mitt Romney dine at Jean Georges restaurant in New York City in November 2016, when Trump was still the president-elect. (Photo: Drew Angerer)\n\nBut the incoming senator who may be most likely to cross swords with Trump is Utah\u2019s Romney. During the 2016 presidential race, Romney called Trump \u201ca phony\u201d and \u201ca fraud\u201d and said he didn\u2019t have the temperament or character to be president. While Trump endorsed Romney\u2019s Senate bid, Romney did not run as a Trump acolyte and represents a state where a lot of Mormon voters are conservative but have been put off by Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThis is a former (GOP presidential) nominee who has a strong political base of his own and could really be a thorn in the side of the president,\u201d Hudak said.\n\nPlus, the midterms were the first time the president really lost, and the way Republicans will respond will be interesting, he added. Although Republicans expanded their Senate majority while losing the House, they could've had a much better night given how many seats Democrats were defending.\n\n\"Even though Democrats came up short,\" Hudak said, \"it does speak a little to vulnerability that exists in the Trump brand, in that Republican coalition, that McConnell has to be wary of.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/donald-trump-faces-senate-challenges-despite-gop-midterm-wins/2059265002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "The Bellingham Herald, Dave Gallagher, The Bellingham Herald", "title": "Will new airline flights in Everett hurt nearby Bellingham airport?", "description": "Bellingham's airport is about 70 miles north of Everett, where Paine Field is set to get its first commercial flights in decades early next year.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2018/11/20/paine-field-new-everett-airport-threat-nearby-bellingham/2052890002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/b6812c1d-8b83-40f7-8332-f2fb7343cd65-ALASKA_AIRLINES_JET.jpg?crop=3219,1811,x0,y273&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:15:31Z", "content": "This image, provided by Google Street View, shows the Bellingham International Airport in northwest Washington state.

(Photo: Simon Brooke-Webb, sbw-photo)\n\nWhat's to love about Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, the giant new cruise ship that was christened in Miami on Thursday?\n\nA lot, if you're a fan of big, bustling, resort-like vessels that are chock full of activities.\n\nAt 228,081 tons, Symphony is the largest cruise ship ever, and it's packed full of gee-whiz attractions such as a thrill slide that plunges nearly 100 feet and a Bionic Bar with a robot bartender.\n\nA larger version of Royal Caribbean's massive Harmony of the Seas, Symphony boasts three main pool areas, a water slide complex, an adults-only solarium, an ice skating rink, two rock climbing walls, a basketball court and a mall-like indoor promenade with shops, bars and eateries. Like Harmony, it also has an open-air, tree-lined area called Central Park with restaurants, bars and upscale shops such as Bulgari.\n\nRELATED: Fireworks light up sky as Symphony kicks off maiden voyage from Miami | Twitter gawks as Symphony arrives | Mexico welcomes Symphony, too\n\nUSA TODAY received early access to Symphony earlier this year in advance of its first cruise with paying passengers, and here we highlight five things cruisers will love about the vessel.\n\n1. The spectacular top-deck fun zones. Like Harmony, Symphony has a trio of thrilling, three-deck-high slides that straddle two giant pool areas. Starting side-by-side, the yellow-and-blue Typhoon and Cyclone slides spin around each other as they descend toward the ship's Main Pool. The third slide, Supercell, drops into a \"champagne bowl\" before disgorging passengers in front of the nearby Beach Pool. More watery fun can be found just steps away at Splashaway Bay, a kiddie aqua park with smaller slides, water cannons, a multi-platform jungle gym and a gigantic drench bucket. As if that's not enough, there's another watery fun-in-the-sun area, the Sports Pool, just across from Splashaway Bay, as well as two surfing pools, a miniature golf course and more.\n\n2. The Boardwalk amusement area. Located at the back of Symphony, this outdoor play zone isn't the first of its kind on a Royal Caribbean ship. But it just may be the best. The line has revamped the concept with a new family-focused sports bar and arcade venue called Playmakers. Also new is a candy and ice cream haven called Sugar Beach. Add in a hand-carved wooden carousel (a Boardwalk staple), a Johnny Rockets diner, a surf shop and a massive outdoor \"aqua theater\" that's home to impressive aerial performances, and it's hard not to see the allure. Boardwalk, meanwhile, is the terminus for what just might be the most ambitious attraction ever conceived for a cruise ship \u2014 the Ultimate Abyss. Beginning atop the vessel on Deck 16 and ending at the Boardwalk on Deck 6, it's a twisting twin tube ride that plunges nine decks (in a nod to the superstitious, there is no Deck 13 on Symphony).\n\n3. The Royal Promenade. It's been nearly two decades since Royal Caribbean began putting these sprawling interior malls full of shops, bars and eateries on its cruise ships, and they just keep getting better. As is the case on Harmony, the Royal Promenade on Symphony features a Bionic Bar \u2014 a concept that first debuted in 2014 on Royal Caribbean's Quantum of the Seas. It's also home to a lively pub called the Copper & Kettle (which fills the space housing the Boot & Bonnet pub on Harmony); the Latin-themed Boleros nightspot; and On Air, the ship's karaoke bar. Among new venues: A store selling anything and everything with a Symphony of the Seas logo (in the location where a Kate Spade shop resides on Harmony).\n\n4. The Ultimate Family Suite (if you can afford it). New on Symphony is what Royal Caribbean is billing as the most spectacular family suite on land or sea. Two decks high and larger than some city apartments, the 1,346-square-foot complex is chock full of fun-for-the-family features including a slide connecting a children's room on its second level to the main living area below, a private cinema with an 85-inch HD television, a floor-to-ceiling LEGO wall and a 212-square-foot balcony complete with a full-size whirlpool. Built with two bedrooms and sleeping up to eight people, it also comes with its own private butler, known as a Royal Genie at Royal Caribbean. The downside of the Ultimate Family Suite: There's only one of them on board Symphony, and it's been selling for tens of thousands of dollars per week.\n\n5. Lively entertainment. Royal Caribbean has been at the forefront of an evolution in cruise ship entertainment in recent years, and nowhere is that more evident than on Symphony, which boasts an adaptation of one of Broadway's biggest crowd-pleasers: The musical Hairspray. Playing in the ship's Broadway-style, 1,401-passenger theater, the 90-minute show features many of the classic songs from the original production. Symphony also is chock full of other entertaining outlets including a comedy club, jazz club, karaoke bar and the outdoor AquaTheater. But the surprise star of the ship's entertainment offerings may be its signature ice skating show, 1977, which kicks off with dozens of choreographed, light-emitting drones dancing above the ice and features stunning visual effects that make the ice appear to transform before your eyes. The kicker on Symphony's entertainment? None of it \u2014 not even the musical Hairspray \u2014 comes with an extra charge.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/11/20/symphony-seas-5-things-love-new-royal-caribbean-giant/1974705002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Gene Sloan, USA TODAY", "title": "The dazzling shows on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, world's largest cruise ship", "description": "Royal Caribbean's new Symphony of the Seas,  the world's largest cruise ship, features Broadway-style shows including Hairspray.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/cruises/2018/11/20/symphony-seas-cruise-ship-shows-entertainment-photos/1991720002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/13/USAT/10164b5c-f52f-46ea-b2f5-522a689e403f-1523286061_sots-r-5249.JPG?crop=2999,1680,x0,y139&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:11:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\nRoyal Caribbean has been at the forefront of an evolution in cruise ship entertainment in recent years, and nowhere is that more evident than on the line's new Symphony of the Seas.

Bills (25): Apparently Josh Allen's return is near. But after Matt Barkley saved season, how can Buffalo possibly consider benching him? Easily. I was kidding.\n\n29. Jets (26): They have to weigh Sam Darnold's health against loss of valuable game repetitions ... but while operating suspect attack. Tough dilemma.\n\n30. 49ers (31): They've technically got a top-10 defense. Doesn't feel that way given league-low five takeaways or 27 points they allow on weekly basis.\n\n31. Raiders (32): They're now up to nine sacks this season. A dozen individual players have at least that many. Khalil Mack has eight in eight games.\n\n32. Cardinals (30): If they can't beat Oakland, you can pencil them in for 2-14. Aside from Detroit at home, Cards will be massive underdogs rest of way.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "David Koenig, AP Airlines Writer", "title": "American Airlines' pilot union pushes management on delays", "description": "Union leaders say pilots will push American for more pay and schedule changes they believe will reduce chronic delays at the world's biggest airline.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2018/11/20/american-airlines-pilot-union-pushes-management-delays/2064365002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/b743f81a-272f-4453-8eb3-5c8a78a54f91-USAT_NOV-12.jpg?crop=1199,674,x0,y126&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:06:47Z", "content": "Last Slide Next Slide DALLAS (AP) Union leaders say pilots will push American Airlines for more pay and schedule changes that they believe will reduce chronic flight delays at the world's biggest airline.

In 2017, American granted additional raises \u2014 8 percent on average for pilots and 5 percent for flight attendants \u2014 that cost close to $1 billion over three years and angered some investors.\n\nCarey also said the union wants American to reduce its practice of shifting on-duty pilots to fill in for others who call in sick, can't legally handle a flight because of crew-rest requirements, or other reasons.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: American adds Dubrovnik, Berlin and Bologna amid international shake-up\n\nRescheduling is a frequent subject of complaints among American's pilots. Carey said it leads to delays or canceled flights. American's operation, he said, \"is not running as well as it should be.\"\n\nThrough August, nearly 24 percent of flights on American and American Eagle have arrived at least 15 minutes late, the worst record among the four largest U.S. airlines, according to government figures. American is on pace for its lowest on-time rating since 2014.\n\nAirline spokesman Matt Miller said the company and the union have worked together \"to improve the lives of our 15,000 pilots over the past several years and we are eager to build on that relationship\" in negotiations.\n\nMiller said the company's scheduling practices comply with federal rules and contracts with pilot and flight attendant unions. He said pilots are only rescheduled when there are disruptions, including bad weather.\n\n\"We understand the impact this can have on our pilots and we always try to balance that impact with the impact to our customers,\" he said.\n\nAmerican's management faces negotiations with pilots and, shortly after that, flight attendants, as its profit is falling due to higher fuel costs. This year through September, Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines Group earned $1.1 billion, down 41 percent from a year ago. The airline's stock has dropped 31 percent since the start of the year.\n\n\"Sentiment on (American) may be as bad as it's been since the shares started trading in 2013. To some, the situation feels hopeless,\" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay wrote recently in a note to clients.\n\nKeay blamed the bearish outlook on thin profit margins, high debt and lack of free cash flow. He also called on American to fix its operation, even if it costs money.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: American completes 'Heritage' plane rollout with TWA, AirCal paint jobs\n\nIN PICTURES:Retro photos from American Airlines' predecessor airlines\n\nIN PICTURES: Scenes from US Airways' last-ever flight\n\nAmerican Airlines' Boeing 777 tails are seen at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Oct. 14, 2016.

It can\u2019t be fixed with more debt.\n\nIn Leland, North Carolina, on Sept. 26, 2018. (Photo: Ken Blevins/The Star-News via AP)\n\nFor the second year in a row, hurricane season has deliveredunprecedented devastation. Communities across the southeastern United States face a challenging recovery after Hurricanes Florence and Michael destroyed homes, schools, and businesses with record-setting flooding and winds. Florence cost dozens of lives and an estimated $38 billion to $50 billion in losses. And although it is too early to calculate the losses from Michael, those totals will also be in the billions.\n\nBut weather catastrophes other than hurricanes \u2014 such as isolated rainstorms inland or on the coast \u2014 can also cause disaster-level flooding. Flooding threatens every state, not just those on the coast; in fact, since the beginning of 2008, six of the seven states that experienced the most flood-related disaster declarations were in landlocked parts of the country. All told, U.S. flood-related damage totals more than $750 billion since 2000.\n\nThat means it\u2019s past time for Congress to overhaul the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides federally backed coverage for homeowners and small businesses in more than 22,000 communities across the country. Congress has ignored a nationwide call for reforms to the NFIP for more than a year and instead has passed no-change extensions of the program seven times. The next deadline for reauthorizing the NFIP \u2014 Nov. 30 \u2014 is almost upon us.\n\nNFIP policy drains money flood after flood\n\nThe problem? Current NFIP policy provides funds to flood-stricken communities to rebuild homes and businesses exactly the way they were before a storm \u2014 leaving a community just as vulnerable as it had been before the flood. Although financial support for recovery and rebuilding is critical to help Americans return to their homes, businesses, and lives after a flood, NFIP policy gives people and businesses no incentive to build flood-resistant structures, move to less flood-prone areas, or take other cost-effective steps to mitigate future flood risk.\n\nAnd with storms getting increasingly worse, costs will continue to skyrocket. In fact, the NFIP was $20 billion in debt even before Florence and Michael, and Congress has no solid plans to pay off that debt or encourage communities to become more resilient. That makes the program a money pit for taxpayer dollars.\n\nMore: FEMA: We incorporate lessons in real time\n\nFEMA rules can deny help to poor hurricane victims who need it most. Here's why.\n\nPuerto Rico was rocked by Hurricane Maria, ruined by FEMA's negligence, reviled by Trump\n\nCongress can begin to reform the NFIP by tying the program\u2019s spending to progress: requiring improved mapping of areas at risk of flooding and expanding the universe of insured properties, which would give communities better tools to prepare for disasters. Additional steps should include a requirement for sellers to disclose flood risk to homebuyers and the creation of a revolving loan fund program, which would help participating states provide low-interest loans for projects that help mitigate risk \u2014 including raising foundations of homes or installing flood vents to limit damage to structures; nature-based solutions, such as restoring wetlands and green spaces to soak up excess water; and buying out repeatedly flooded properties.\n\nNFIP must enforce infrastructure, building codes\n\nAnd to complement the goals of NFIP reforms, lawmakers should prioritize flood resilience in building standards. Because of insufficient building codes, storms frequently push infrastructure beyond its limits, repeatedly endangering lives and leaving an unnecessarily large bill for the American taxpayer. Federal policy should require significant upgrades to codes for federal buildings, as well as commercial and residential structures built with federal funding, so they can better withstand flooding.\n\nRight now, our country is using yesterday\u2019s policies and standards to pay for today\u2019s floods with tomorrow\u2019s money. And that can\u2019t be fixed with emergency relief packages and more debt. Without NFIP reforms, communities will become even more susceptible to flood damage \u2014 and taxpayers will continue to pay for subpar structures.\n\nLawmakers in Congress must seize the opportunity before them and improve the NFIP before Nov. 30. Investing more taxpayer dollars now, before the next disaster hits, will save American lives and increase the resiliency of our communities.\n\nCraig Fugate was Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama, and David Paulison was FEMA administrator from 2005 to 2009 under President George W.

(Photo: Robert Cohen, AP)\n\nAmid the frenzy of holiday shopping deals on Black Friday, you may be tempted to buy a Christmas tree \u2013 but your wallet will thank you if you delay the purchase.\n\nIf you can hold off all the way until Christmas Eve, you'll get the best deal. The average price of a Christmas tree in the United States drops to its lowest point at $47 on Dec. 24, according to a report by Square and the National Christmas Tree Association.\n\nAnalyzing Square sales of Christmas trees, the report found buying in the next week or so will net the highest price tag: On Black Friday, Christmas trees cost an average of $77, and that figure spikes to $81 on Cyber Monday. If you can wait just a couple weeks, the average cost drops to $64 on Dec. 18, according to the report.\n\nAs a perishable and seasonal product, the trees don't have much use after Christmas Day. Thus, as the holiday season progresses, sellers mark down prices \"knowing that if they don't sell them by Christmas Eve, they're probably not going to sell them,\" says Tim O'Connor, executive director of the National Christmas Tree Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like an airplane seat: once you get closer to the flight time, if that seat isn\u2019t sold, it will never be sold once the plane takes off,\" O'Connor said. \"If that tree isn\u2019t sold on December 26, it\u2019s not very valuable.\u201d\n\nMany customers choose to buy early. In 2017, the National Christmas Tree Association found adults purchased 27.4 million real Christmas trees and \"virtually all\" were bought Black Friday and the following two to three weekends, O'Connor said.\n\nPrices may be a factor for some, but O'Brien said other considerations \u2013 such as when families can come together to buy the tree \u2013 may have greater sway on when customers make purchases. Black Friday can be a time that entire families can shop for a tree as many have gotten together for Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cFamilies shop for trees when it fits their schedules nicely,\" O'Connor said.\n\nThe report also noted the average price of Christmas trees increased 17% \u2013 from $62 to $73 \u2013 between 2015 and 2017.\n\nO'Connor says the change reflects fluctuations in supply. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, an oversupply of Christmas trees caused growers to lose money and some to exit the business. Now that suppliers are growing fewer trees, demand has matched supply, making the industry profitable once again, O'Connor said.\n\nIn addition, millennials are having an impact on the market. While some members of older generations turned to fake trees as their kids moved out of the house, millennials \u2013 people born between 1981 and 1996 \u2013 have been opting for natural and locally grown trees.\n\nMillennials are \"becoming the most important customers for Christmas tree growers,\" O'Connor said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY intern Ben Tobin on Twitter: @TobinBen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/when-best-time-buy-christmas-tree-black-friday-deals/2053121002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "NFL power rankings: Week 11", "description": "Take a look at how the NFL teams stand after 11 weeks of play in the 2018 season.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/nfl/2018/11/20/nfl-power-rankings-week-11/2063126002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/83febfc6-5d77-4c39-bb57-048e99b43be1-USATSI_11695500.jpg?crop=3825,2152,x0,y185&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:55:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "None\n\n32.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump will have as many as two more Republican votes in the Senate next year, but he also will confront wavering Republicans, a loss of centrists and a coterie of Democratic presidential candidates in no mood for compromise.\n\nIn other words, the Senate will remain a tough place for Trump to do business.\n\nRepublicans flipped their fourth Senate seat this week when Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson conceded to Republican Rick Scott after a grueling, 12-day recount. If Republicans win a runoff on Tuesday in Mississippi \u2013 the last holdover from the Nov. 6 election \u2013 they will have a 53-seat majority, two more than the party has now.\n\nBut the cushioning may provide little comfort for Trump.\n\n\u201cI'm doubtful that the extra seats are that valuable in a legislative sense,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist.\n\nThe Senate's new composition will change the political dynamic beyond just vote counts. Outspoken Republican critics of the president such as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee will be gone. Mitt Romney\u2019s election in Utah, on the other hand, elevates a well-known voice who vociferously opposed Trump in 2016.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the landscape may change for the president in the next Senate:\n\nSlightly bigger cushion\n\nIn a place where votes are often close, two more seats give Republicans more breathing room. That could help Trump get more of his appointees confirmed \u2013 including another Supreme Court justice, if a vacancy occurred. And it could help the GOP block efforts to remove Trump from power should House Democrats pursue an impeachment.\n\nBut based solely on vote tallies, the GOP gain of two won't amount to much given that 60 votes are still needed for virtually all controversial bills. Trump has pressed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change Senate rules to lower that threshold, but the Kentucky Republican has rejected the idea in the past.\n\n\"My age-old question is whether the president and his team have learned anything at all about the legislative process, especially when it comes to the Senate,\" said Jim Manley, who worked for former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \"Trump, for one, can\u2019t get over the fact that McConnell's never going to change the rules of the Senate.\"\n\nMost appointments, even high-profile nominees like Justice Brett Kavanaugh, can win confirmation with a simple majority.\n\nOn the other hand, two more votes could take the pressure off centrist Republicans such as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom helped tank the GOP-led repeal of the Affordable Care Act last year, Binder said.\n\n\"Their votes are conceptually less pivotal now that Republicans hold more seats,\" she said.\n\nNervous Republicans\n\nThat dynamic will be especially important to watch given the 2020 Senate map.\n\nIn the reverse of this year, it is Republicans who will be defending most of the Senate seats up for election in 2020. But unlike the challenge many Democrats faced in seeking re-election in states carried by Trump, only two Republicans will be up in states Trump lost in 2016.\n\nOne of those senators, Collins, drew the ire of Democrats who had supported her before she voted to confirm Kavanaugh. An online campaign to defeat Collins has raised more than $3.7 million even though she does not yet have an opponent.\n\n\u201cSusan Collins has to repair her relationship with the Democrats in Maine,\u201d said Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker.\n\nColorado Sen. Cory Garner represents a state recently considered winnable by either party but now looks increasingly Democratic. And Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis will have to hold on to states won by both Trump and President Barack Obama.\n\nBut because McConnell now has a few more votes to spare, it will be easier to give vulnerable senators a pass on a tough vote, said John Hudak, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cIn a Senate with 51 votes, you don\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d Hudak said. \u201cIn a Senate with 53 votes, you do.\u201d\n\nFewer moderate Democrats\n\nRepublicans defeated three of the Democrats who voted with them most often, leaving fewer opportunities to pad their slim majority with help from the other side.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is more polarized,\u201d said Steve Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nDefeated Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, for example, worked with Republicans this year to ease some of the banking regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. Donnelly and Heitkamp sided with fellow Democrats on votes that split the parties slightly less than two-thirds of the time in the last two years, according to Congressional Quarterly.\n\nBut two other line crossers \u2013 West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester \u2013 survived. And Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who has voted with his party about 60 percent of the time since winning a special election in 2017, will face the voters in his conservative state again in 2020, giving him an incentive to showcase a moderate record.\n\nWhile Baker said there\u2019s always opportunities for bipartisan action in the Senate, such islands of cooperation are rare in today\u2019s sea of partisanship.\n\n\u201cThe American people just have to be satisfied with the fact that there are very, very few areas of legislation in which there is going to be cooperation between Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Baker said.\n\nLooming presidential election\n\nVoters may be ready to tune out elections for a while, but with as many as a dozen Democrats in the Senate already eyeing a presidential run, it will be difficult to separate all but the most routine legislation from the 2020 campaign.\n\nFrom high-profile names such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to lesser known figures like Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the Senate floor is likely to become a proving ground for Democratic opposition to Trump.\n\nThe sheer number of Senate Democrats believed to be considering a run for president could wind up having practical implications for the chamber's schedule, too.\n\nDemocrats considering a run will need to attend fundraisers in California and New York, taking them away from Washington with increasing frequency. As they move closer to primary season, they'll have to devote considerably more time to early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThat could prove a headache for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on close votes.\n\n\"It\u2019s definitely going to be a situation in which he\u2019s got to herd rabbits or cats \u2013 or some other creature that doesn't want to be herded,\" Baker said.\n\nTrump loyalists\n\nTwo Republican senators who had publicly criticized Trump \u2013 Arizona\u2019s Flake and Tennessee\u2019s Corker \u2013 retired rather than seek re-election this year. Corker\u2019s successor, Marsha Blackburn, tied herself closely to Trump, as did the Republicans who defeated Donnelly, Heitkamp and McCaskill.\n\nThat could ramp up the already-high Trump loyalty in the GOP caucus.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Scott, who narrowly defeated Nelson, did try to put some distance between himself and Trump in his campaign advertising \u2013 despite being one of the first prominent Republican politicians in the nation to embrace Trump's candidacy in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhen I don\u2019t agree with what President Trump does or says, I\u2019ve said it,\u201d Scott said in a Spanish-language ad that aired at low levels. \u201cMy only commitment is with you.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Mitt Romney dine at Jean Georges restaurant in New York City in November 2016, when Trump was still the president-elect. (Photo: Drew Angerer)\n\nBut the incoming senator who may be most likely to cross swords with Trump is Utah\u2019s Romney. During the 2016 presidential race, Romney called Trump \u201ca phony\u201d and \u201ca fraud\u201d and said he didn\u2019t have the temperament or character to be president. While Trump endorsed Romney\u2019s Senate bid, Romney did not run as a Trump acolyte and represents a state where a lot of Mormon voters are conservative but have been put off by Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThis is a former (GOP presidential) nominee who has a strong political base of his own and could really be a thorn in the side of the president,\u201d Hudak said.\n\nPlus, the midterms were the first time the president really lost, and the way Republicans will respond will be interesting, he added. Although Republicans expanded their Senate majority while losing the House, they could've had a much better night given how many seats Democrats were defending.\n\n\"Even though Democrats came up short,\" Hudak said, \"it does speak a little to vulnerability that exists in the Trump brand, in that Republican coalition, that McConnell has to be wary of.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/20/donald-trump-faces-senate-challenges-despite-gop-midterm-wins/2059265002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Cahill international career ends with a win for Australia", "description": "Tim Cahill's farewell game for Australia ended in a 3-0 win over Lebanon, leaving the Socceroos' all-time leading scorer with 50 career goals and 108 caps", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/11/20/cahill-international-career-ends-with-a-win-for-australia/38570519/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e5bacb746fabe04a979aec5a30513a774cbdf3b/c=0-1276-3465-3225/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/bb8b69031eb0459ab6d2030b1eb73016.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:43:20Z", "content": "Australia's Tim Cahill, right, is congratulated by Lebanon's Moot Az Bellah El Jounaidi at the end of their international soccer friendly in Sydney, Tuesday, Nov. 20, 2018.

He says, \u2018I know you\u2019re busy on the 15th of December, I\u2019ll fight you on the 16th, or whenever you want.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat would you say?\u2019\u2019\n\nMore: HBO steps out of the ring, ending its storied history of boxing coverage\n\nAlvarez, the Mexican middleweight star who understands English but prefers to speak Spanish, turned to a translator and they conferred. The translator turned toward the reporter.\n\n\u201cIs that a true statement?\u2019\u2019 he asked.\n\nThere was no need for translation after Alvarez was told Mayweather\u2019s offer was hypothetical. He would eagerly welcome a rematch against Mayweather, who in 2013 handed Alvarez (50-1-2) the only defeat of his career.\n\n\u201cAnytime he\u2019s ready, I\u2019m ready,\u2019\u2019 Alvarez, 28, told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cIf the day comes that he wants to come out of retirement for it, I\u2019m a different fighter, I\u2019m more mature, I\u2019m a great, A-level fighter now and it would be a great opportunity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had that little itch for (a rematch) since way back, and now I\u2019m more experienced and more mature.

Nor is there any indication Mayweather (50-0) wants to face Alvarez.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a very boring fight. He didn\u2019t come to fight. He won over experience,\" Alvarez said of their 2013 bout.\n\nOver the past two years, Alvarez said, his interest in a rematch has increased as he has seen it discussed online and he fielded questions about the possibility. His talk about skills he\u2019d need to defeat Mayweather suggest he\u2019s given the bout thought.\n\n\u201cWe have to work hard for that fight,\u2019\u2019 Alvarez said. \u201cWe have to work hard very hard for that fight because he\u2019s a fighter that doesn\u2019t throw too much punches.\n\n\u201cNow the fighters, the opponents I\u2019ve been working with, are strong fighters, slow fighters. So to fight a fighter like him and to beat him would be totally different because now we have to get speed into the mix and we\u2019ll do everything that\u2019s possible to do it, to accomplish that goal of winning. And we have to work hard and get a lot of punches in and speed and really more velocity.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nOn Dec. 15, Alvarez will be moving up to 168 pounds from 160 pounds for his fight against Fielding (27-1), a British middleweight. The two will face at Madison Square Garden. Though a fight against Mayweather is a long shot, Alvarez said he would entertain the possibility of a third third fight against Golovkin.\n\nThe two fought to a draw in 2017 and Alvarez won the rematch by majority decision Sept. 15 after it was delayed following Alvarez testing positive for a banned substance that he said was the result of eating tainted meat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fight that could happen,\u2019\u2019 Alvarez said. \u201cYou know, down the line it could happen. We have a fight on Dec. 15 first, but it\u2019s a fight that could totally happen. If the fans want it, if the people want it and it\u2019s in demand, it totally could happen. But that\u2019s further down the line. We\u2019re focused on this fight now.\u2019\u2019\n\nThough he seemed to dismiss the idea of fighting an MMA star \u2013 asserting that a boxer always would dominate in the boxing ring and an MMA fighter always would dominate in the Octagon \u2013 he praised the Mayweather-Conor McGregor boxing match that generated more than $300 million.\n\n\u201cIt was more of entertainment,\u2019\u2019 Alvarez said. \u201cThe fight sold a lot, everybody tuned in, it made a lot of sales, a lot of pay-per-view (buys). It was a spectacular event. \u2026They did their job and made a big, huge money-making event.\u2019\u2019\n\nMoneymaker is now a fitting description for Alvarez. He made about $50 million for his last fight against Golovkin and recently signed a $365 million deal for 11 fights over five years with DAZN, an online streaming service dedicated to sports.\n\nGrowing up on a farm in Mexico, Alvarez did not imagine amassing such fortune.\n\n\u201cI never envisioned the magnitude of it,\u2019\u2019 he said of the contract. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in my vision. I knew that it could happen, but I couldn\u2019t even believe it and couldn\u2019t even dream of it. But seeing it and having it now, you see these things and they come to life and you live them.\n\n\u201cYou can only see and believe and there\u2019s more to come. There\u2019s a lot more to come.\u2019\u2019"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Janna Herron, USA TODAY", "title": "Store credit cards: How to get the most out of them during the holidays", "description": "You'll likely be asked to sign up for a store credit card while holiday-shopping this year.

USA TODAY\n\nProfile view of a young woman paying with a credit card to a store clerk in a supermarket (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWhen you're shopping for the holidays, it\u2019s nearly inevitable that a cashier will ask if you want to sign up for the store's credit card. Whether you should depends on your financial discipline.\n\nThree-fourths of Americans have at least one store credit card in their wallet, according to a recent survey from CompareCards.com. But nearly half of them regret it.\n\n\u201cPeople make bad decisions when they are pressured into things and that\u2019s what happens a lot of times at the checkout counter,\u201d says Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards.com.\n\nInstead of signing up on the spot, take a brochure or research the card online later, so you know the terms and perks. If you still like the card, you can apply for it again the next time you\u2019re in the store.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know:\n\nWeigh the benefits\n\nSign-up bonuses: One of the biggest card incentives retailers dangle is a hefty discount or reward on your first purchase. For example, you get 30 percent off your first purchase with a Kohl\u2019s charge card, plus another 15-percent discount once you receive the actual card. REI will give you a $100 gift card after your first purchase.\n\n\u201cThis can make a difference if you\u2019re shopping on a budget,\u201d Schulz says, \u201cbut the key is being able to pay off that balance at the end of the month.\u201d\n\nMacy's reports its latest earnings performance. (Photo: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOngoing perks: Stores also provide ongoing discounts or rewards for existing cardholders. In some cases, those who spend more get better rewards. Macy\u2019s cardholders with Platinum status get 5 percent back in rewards on store purchases, a perk not available to Silver or Gold status cardholders.\n\nYou may also get early access to sales, special promotions or invite-only events. Other cards allow you stack discounts. \u201cIf you have the Target Red card, which is 5 percent off, and a coupon for 10 percent off, you get both discounts,\u201d says Bill McCracken, president of Phoenix Synergistics, a financial services research company.\n\nMore than a store card: Some cards can also be used outside of the branded store. These cards typically display the Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express logo, and could supplant your regular credit card if the rewards are generous enough.\n\nFor example, you can earn 4 percent back on gas, 3 percent on restaurants and travel and 1 percent on all other purchases with the Costco Visa card on top of the 2 percent back you get on purchases made at the warehouse club chain.\n\nCredit building: Younger people with no or little credit history can use retail cards to build their credit. Typically, it\u2019s easier to qualify for a store credit and there\u2019s usually no annual fee to pay. Additionally, these cards come with smaller limits than regular credit cards, providing a brake if your spending gets out of control. If you manage the card responsibly, \u201cthat opens the door\u201d for more credit access, McCracken says.\n\nPossible pitfalls\n\nHigh APR: The average annual percentage rate for a store credit card is almost 25 percent, according to CompareCards.com, compared with 16.5 percent for regular credit cards. That rate can quickly get you in trouble if you bust your budget.\n\n\u201cThe truth is the average store credit card is so high that if you carry a balance or can\u2019t pay off a purchase at the end of month, it\u2019s not worth getting,\u201d Schulz says.\n\nSpecial financing: Nine out of 10 store cards offer so-called special financing offers often with deferred interest, according to CompareCards.com. This usually means that if you pay your balance off within an introductory period \u2014 say 12 months \u2014 then you won\u2019t be charged interest. But if a balance remains after that period, you will be charged all the interest that would have accrued from the time you made the original purchase.\n\nCredit score impact: Applying for a store card can hurt your credit score in three ways, according to John Ulzheimer, a credit expert who formerly worked at Equifax and FICO.\n\nHard inquiry: The store will pull your credit report as part of the approval process. This inquiry can hurt your credit score.\n\nCredit age: A new account can lower the overall age of your credit accounts in your credit history, another ding to your score.\n\nUtilization: Store cards typically have low limits. Using a large portion of that available credit can lower your credit score.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the cumulative effect of all three metrics you begin to question whether opening the account was worth saving a few dollars on your purchases,\u201d Ulzheimer says.\n\nBottom line\n\nA store card can be a great way to stretch your gift budget by 10 percent or more this year. But with any credit card, you should only sign up if you consistently stay within your means and pay your bills on time. Stick to stores you frequently visit or expect to use judiciously for your gifts this year.\n\n\u201cIf you use it for most of your holiday shopping, maybe take some scissors to it in January,\u201d McCracken says.\n\nBest store cards\n\nHere are five store credit cards to consider this holiday season. The top ones come from CompareCards.com's list of best store credit cards for October 2018.\n\nAmazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card\n\nYou earn 5 percent back at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market; 2 percent at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores; and 1 percent on all other purchases.\n\nNew cardholders receive a $70 Amazon.com gift card after approval.\n\nThere is no annual fee, but you must have a Prime membership, which costs $119 a year, to get the rewards rate. If you don't renew your membership, you'll be downgraded to the Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card with a lower rewards rate.\n\nTarget REDcard Credit Card\n\nYou get an instant 5 percent discount on Target and Target.com purchases at checkout. Other cards often require you to redeem rewards or points later.\n\nThis card has no annual fee, and you receive exclusive card benefits, such as early access to special events, free two-day shipping, extended returns and more.\n\nYou can only use this card at Target stores and online at Target.com.\n\nTJX Rewards Credit Card\n\nYou earn 5 points for each $1 you spend at T.J.Maxx and its partner stores: Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores and online at tjxmaxx.com or sierratradingpost.com.\n\nNew cardholders get 10 percent off their first online or in-store purchase. Rewards certificates you earn can be redeemed at T.J. Maxx and its partner stores.\n\nIf you want to earn rewards outside the retailer's stores, you can sign up for the TJX Rewards Platinum Mastercard.\n\nLowe's Advantage Card\n\nYou get 5 percent off eligible Lowe's purchases at checkout. This card also has no annual fee.\n\nYou can benefit from the everyday discount or take advantage of the card's special financing benefit.\n\nThe special financing offer and discount can't be combined. The special financing offer is not available for purchases less than $299.\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi\n\nYou earn 4 percent cash back on gas for the first $7,000 per year and then 1 percent after that; 3 percent on restaurants and travel; 2 percent at Costco and Costco.com; and 1 percent on all other purchases.\n\nTo earn the rewards rate, you must have a Costco membership, which costs $60 a year for the basic Gold Star level.\n\nThe cashback reward is distributed only once a year after your February billing statement closes.\n\nCLOSE The program includes automatic Gold Status and more way to earn stars.

A lot happened this week, and here is our rankings to help piece everything together, as we enter Thanksgiving \u2014 the beginning of the home-stretch of the NFL season.\n\n10. (Last week: 7) Minnesota Vikings (5-4-1):\n\nIt\u2019s maddening to watch Kirk Cousins struggle in prime-time games, considering how much the Vikings shelled out for him, money-wise. Minnesota remains one of the NFL\u2019s most talented teams, but will need to stave off a handful of clubs to hang on to an NFC wild card spot.\n\n9. (Last week: NR) Indianapolis Colts (5-5):\n\nWith a much-improved defense filled with budding stars \u2014 Darius Leonard, Malik Hooker \u2014 and the return of elite Andrew Luck, the Colts are team to watch in 2019, and now, even this season. GM Chris Ballard has done a remarkable job in a short period of time with Indianapolis. As of now, they have the inside track on the AFC\u2019s No. 6 seed, and aren\u2019t completely out of the running in the AFC South, either. After a 1-5 start, they\u2019ve currently won four straight games by an average margin of 19.3 points per game. They are rolling, to say the least.\n\n8. (Last week: 5) Los Angeles Chargers (7-3):\n\nAfter a beautiful six-game winning streak, the old Chargers reared its ugly head. This could be an aberration for their 2018 season, but the 23-22 home loss to the Denver Broncos looked like a result we\u2019ve seen too often from them in recent seasons. They still look like a safe bet to be the AFC\u2019s top wild card team, though.\n\n7. (Last week: NR) Houston Texans (7-3):\n\nThe Texans have received a lot of luck throughout their seven-game winning streak. But nonetheless, they\u2019re on a seven-game winning streak, for heaven\u2019s sake. A home win over the Tennessee Titans next Monday night may put the AFC South on ice.\n\n6: (Last week: 10) Chicago Bears (7-3):\n\nIn Khalil Mack, the Bears have the second-best defensive player in the NFL (behind the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Aaron Donald), who brought Chicago\u2019s defense to new heights.\n\nJust like recent greats such as Brian Urlacher, Lance Briggs, Charles Tillman and Julius Peppers, the Bears always seemingly have a defensive All-Pro leading the way for a monstrous defense. Mitchell Trubisky has continued his up-and-down play, but the Bears will be a tough out in the NFC postseason, due to their defense, which has become one of the league\u2019s best units once more.\n\nThe Khalil Mack trade helped transform a franchise and swung an entire division. I wrote about the most impactful NFL trade in a decade \u2014 and the revival of football in Chicago. https://t.co/0dUiZfuTEw \u2014 Robert Mays (@robertmays) November 19, 2018\n\n5. (Last week: 6) New England Patriots (7-3):\n\nThe Patriots move up a spot during their bye week, thanks to an incompetent home loss by the Chargers. If the league truly begins after Thanksgiving, then it\u2019s time for the Patriots to shine once again. The return of Rob Gronkowski should help.\n\nAfter missing three of the past four games with a lingering back injury, Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski is expected to be able to play in New England\u2019s next game after Sunday\u2019s bye against the New York Jets, per sources. More on ESPN\u2019s Sunday NFL Countdown. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 18, 2018\n\n4. (Last week: 4) Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2-1):\n\nThe Steelers special season continues with a savage takedown of their recent nemesis, the Jacksonville Jaguars, by the way of a 16-point second-half comeback to win in the final seconds. Pittsburgh has now won six straight games, and is making a case for being the best team in the AFC heading into Thanksgiving.\n\n3. (Last week: 2) Kansas City Chiefs (9-2):\n\nIn the weirdest (and most exciting) game in NFL regular season history, Patrick Mahomes\u2019 six touchdowns were ultimately not enough to beat the Los Angeles Rams, in part because of his five turnovers \u2014 with two interceptions in the final two minutes.\n\nThe Chiefs are still the most exciting team in football, and control their own destiny in capturing the AFC\u2019s No. 1 seed. They\u2019ll have the bye week to rest up and figure out something (anything) on defense. Their offense is set. They\u2019ve averaged 45.5 points per game in their two losses this season.\n\n2. (Last week: 3) Los Angeles Rams (10-1):\n\nDown 51-47 with less than three minutes left, and no timeouts, Jared Goff came through on the biggest drive of his career, to put the Rams up 54-51, and ultimately beat the Chiefs in perhaps the greatest regular season game ever.\n\nWith the Saints\u2019 schedule down the stretch, the Rams still have a shot at the NFC\u2019s top seed.\n\n1. (Last week: 1) New Orleans Saints (9-1):\n\nThe Saints are on a torrid pace that makes one wonder if there is any way that they don\u2019t win Super Bowl LIII. \u2018Peaking too early\u2019 will certainly be a term thrown around but Drew Brees is certainly on a mission. A fairly-tough schedule to close out the regular season should keep them sharp heading into January."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Kelly Tyko, USA TODAY", "title": "What stores are open on Thanksgiving?

What does it mean? And how does it affect both Wall Street and Main Street? Adam Shell explains.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE)\n\nIn a span of two phone calls, Daniel Milan found out last week just how nervous some of his Detroit-area investors were about the stock market\u2019s recent rough ride.\n\n\u201cTwo clients called and said they wanted to get out of the market completely,\u201d says Milan, a managing partner and investment adviser at Cornerstone Financial Services in Birmingham, Michigan.\n\nBoth investors said they couldn't \u201cstand the pain\u201d of seeing the Dow Jones industrial average fall more than 500 points in a single day and watching their account balances shrink. They told him they would rather \u201ccut their losses.\u201d\n\nThe get-me-out instinct from these individuals captures the rising nervousness on Main Street as stock prices start sinking on a regular basis following the blue-chip average's record high on Oct. 3.\n\n\"It gets them a little wary,\" says JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at discount brokerage TD Ameritrade. Still, despite lots of selling, there's been \"very little panic,\" he notes.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s latest drop, which has knocked Apple \u2013 the most valuable stock in the U.S. \u2013 down more than 20 percent from its recent high and pushed the Dow down nearly 7 percent below its peak \u2013 is causing investors to question the staying power of a bull market that turns 10 years old in March. At its peak, the broad market's bull gain totaled 333 percent.\n\nRisks pile up\n\nWeighing on the mood of investors is a list of challenges and negative headlines that seem to mount on a daily basis. There are fears about the global economy slowing over the U.S.-China trade fight and concerns about the steep price drop in Apple and other popular technology stocks. Rising borrowing costs are also a sticking point, as they make financing purchases of big-ticket items such as homes and SUVs pricier. Adding to the angst are concerns that the momentum for deregulation under President Donald Trump could slow now that Democrats hold the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of challenges that could disrupt the market and shake confidence,\u201d says Chris Larkin, senior vice president of trading at discount brokerage ETrade.\n\nThe Dow's nearly 400-point drop Monday did little to boost confidence.\n\nMore Money: Jeep Wrangler drivers report 'death wobble' on highways\n\nMore Money: Budgets, family drama and stuff: How do you manage holiday gift-giving?\n\nMore Money: David's Bridal files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, aims to stay in business\n\nSigns of anxiety on rise\n\nSigns of investors nervousness are beginning to emerge.\n\n* Shrinking number of bulls: In one sign of rising cautiousness, the number of individual investors that say they are bulls, or think stocks will be up in the next six months, fell from 41.3 to 35.1 percent (below the long-term average of 38.5 percent) in the week ending Nov. 14, according to a survey from the American Association of Individual Investors. And bears swelled to an above-average 36 percent, which means bears now outnumber bulls.\n\nMore Money: David's Bridal files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, aims to stay in business\n\nMore Money: Nissan's Carlos Ghosn fired, arrested over alleged income misconduct\n\nMore Money: These 8 retailers can't afford a disappointing 2018 holiday shopping season\n\n* Buyers turn more defensive: Investors are no longer blindly buying on the dip, Wall Street speak for buying stocks when they are cheaper after a big market drop. Instead, TD Ameritrade says it has started to see retail investors become \"more selective\" about their trading.\n\nApple investors, for example, have gone on a buyers' strike of sorts.\n\n\"They have backed off,\" Kinahan says. \"Buying has slowed down. What it tells me is investors are seeing the opportunity is lower for the market than before.\"\n\nInvestors, Kinahan adds, have also been reading more of the firm's educational materials on its website. They're also showing more interest lately in so-called defensive stocks, such as companies that sell everyday goods to consumers, including names such as Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.\n\n\"In times of uncertainty, investors want to own established stocks that pay them a dividend that they can stay in for awhile until things settle down,\" he says.\n\n* Investors express angst: Investors are making their fears known to pollsters. When asked by E-Trade after the midterm elections how long they thought the current bull market would last, 22 percent said \"the end is near,\" and another 34 percent said the end would be within two years.\n\nSimilarly, a quick post-election survey by Charles Schwab of 150 of its clients found that while 63 percent \"feel bullish\" about the market, 37 percent \"feel bearish\" and think the market is due for a significant decline.\n\nA poll of more than 100 financial advisers by fund company Ariel Investments also captured the more negative mindset of investors. Fifteen percent of advisers' clients said they \"want to reduce exposure to stocks,\" and another 5 percent said they \"want to cut their exposure to equities altogether.\" More than half (55 percent) of financial advisers said their clients today are \"less willing to take on risk and more concerned with avoiding loss.\"\n\n* Money starts to move out of stocks: While investors haven't exited the stock market in a stampede, more money has come out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange traded funds than has flowed in, Investment Company Institute data show.\n\nIn the three weeks ending Oct. 17, for example, a period that saw the market flirt with a 10 percent drop, or correction, outflows of more than $22 billion hit funds and ETFs that invest in domestic stocks. But after two weeks of calm, when money flowed back into U.S. stock funds and ETFs, outflows resumed again, with nearly $4 billion exiting, ICI data show.\n\nMoney also returned to bond funds, seen as a safer play for investors. In the latest week of data, there were net inflows of $777 million into fixed-income funds. That followed four weeks of massive outflows totaling nearly $38 billion, an exodus that was due to people losing money on their bond funds when prices fell and the yield on the 10-year Treasury hit a multiyear high.\n\nWhat's an investor to do?\n\nThere are always risks facing the stock market, and investors need to keep their fears in perspective, Milan says. He has been reminding his jittery clients that the Dow is still up more than 1 percent for the year and that business conditions, such as economic growth and corporate earnings, remain solid.\n\nHe's also been stressing that the lower stock prices have created a good opportunity to buy with any cash sitting on the sidelines.\n\nWhat Milan is not recommending is for clients to flee the market completely.\n\n\"What we try not to let happen is let them run scared and move all their cash to a money market account,\" Milan says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/stock-market-401-k-investors-worries-mount/2010624002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Special to USA TODAY, Susannah Hutcheson, Special to USA TODAY", "title": "How I became a chef and writer: Samin Nosrat, author of 'Salt Fat Acid Heat'", "description": "With a show on Netflix based on her book \"Salt Fat Acid Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking,\" Samin Nosrat is taking over the culinary world.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/getting-started/2018/11/20/samin-nosrat-salt-fat-acid-heat-book-netflix/2053323002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/19/USAT/c78c777a-c4ee-4fc0-b6a6-b29569a2b4e3-1810-PAMU-NETFLIX-SAMIN_0041_1_1.jpg?crop=2099,1181,x1,y167&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:00:02Z", "content": "Samin Nosrat is a chef and award-winning author of the book \"Salt Fat Acid Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking,\" which now has its own show on Netflix.

The author of \"Salt Fat Acid Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking\" and the writer of a column in New York Times Magazine, Nosrat knows food \u2013 and she knows how to write and talk about it.\n\nUSA TODAY caught up with the chef, author and writer to talk about everything from half-and-half and her favorite podcasts to the joy of cooking vegetables and the importance of surrounding yourself with the right people.\n\nQuestion: What\u2019s your coffee order?\n\nNosrat: I just drink regular drip coffee, but I\u2019m kind of a coffee baby. I put a lot of half and half in it to the point where, if I have to ask someone else to get the coffee for me, I\u2019m like \u2018you have to put more half-and-half than you ever think anybody would ever want.\u2019 The visual cue that I use is that it should look like Haagen-Dazs coffee ice cream.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the last book you read?\n\nNosrat: I\u2019m feeling very exerted in many ways, so I\u2019m trying to give myself easy reading and easy TV consumption, so I actually bought \u201cTo All the Boys I Loved Before\u201d by Jenny Han, the young-adult novel that the movie is based on.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\n\nNosrat: For sure making this series. When we first announced the show, it was at this industry event where there was a press junket, and I went into TV Guide, which was one of the places that took my photo. They were like, \u2018how are you today?\u2019 I don\u2019t know about you, but I grew up reading TV Guide. I did not grow up thinking one day I would be in it. I just cannot believe that I get to do this amazing project.\n\nDiane von Furstenberg: How I became an iconic fashion designer and philanthropist\n\nScott Harrison: How I helped bring millions of people clean water with charity: water\n\nCharlie Hamilton James: How I became a photographer for National Geographic\n\nQ: What are some of your go-to songs or podcasts?\n\nNosrat: Podcasts:\n\n\u2022 I love \u201cForever 35\u201d \u2013 it basically is like a beauty podcast by two people who are not experts. It\u2019s like bubblegum.\n\n\u2022 I love \u201cLongform,\u201d which is an interview podcast with writers. I feel like I\u2019ve learned so much about writing and storytelling by listening.\n\n\u2022 I love \u201cSong Exploder,\u201d which is a podcast about the process and the story behind a song. I listen to every one and sometimes it\u2019s about a song or a musician that I\u2019m familiar with and really like and other times it\u2019s somebody I\u2019ve never heard before, but the interviewing is so incredible that I always learn something.\n\n\u2022 I also love \u201cStill Processing,\u201d and it may be my all-time favorite. It\u2019s two culture writers from the New York Times. They are so smart and they have this incredible way of connecting the dots between big and little things in the world. Again, from listening to them I\u2019ve learned a lot about how to be a better storyteller.\n\nMusic:\n\n\u2022 California Honeydrops. We put a song in the show, which made me so happy. They\u2019re one of my favorite local bands. They\u2019re really vibrant and fun, and what I listen to if I need to up the energy vibe.\n\n\u2022 This is super random \u2013 the beauty of Spotify is how you discover things you probably never would have heard about. There\u2019s this band called Khruangbin, and it\u2019s Thai surf music. It\u2019s just really groovy feeling.\n\n\u2022 I made all these cooking playlists, all the different vibes of cooking: when you are angry, when you are happy, when you are heartbroken. Another musician I love Kasey Johansing, she has this amazing honey voice. I love some old-timey Van Morrison. I love Stevie Wonder \u2013 he\u2019s probably my all-time favorite. I love Nina Simone.\n\nSamin Nosrat is a chef and award-winning author of the book \"Salt Fat Acid Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking,\" which now has its own show on Netflix. (Photo: Handout)\n\nQ: Who\u2019s been your biggest mentor?\n\nNosrat: I\u2019m gonna be a little subversive here. I don\u2019t feel like I can give one single answer to that because I feel like one of the things that is unique about the way I work in the world is that I exist in a bunch of different worlds, a bunch of different industries and landscapes. I\u2019m just a deeply curious person, and so I feel very lucky that I have a career in cooking, and a career in writing, and now I have a career in making television.\n\nI feel like there have been different people I have looked to in each of those fields who have been so impactful for me. Michael Pollan is absolutely my writing mentor \u2013 he has been so generous with me throughout my career. My cooking mentor is a chef named Christopher Lee, who really sort of took me under his wing and protected me and gave me so many opportunities throughout my cooking career. Who\u2019s my mentor in this new world? I don\u2019t even know \u2013 I\u2019m still looking.\n\nQ: What does your career path look like?\n\nNosrat: There\u2019s this amazing Steve Jobs anecdote. He gave the story in a commencement speech about how you can only connect the dots when you look backward, but looking forward, you know, as you\u2019re trying to plan your career or your life, there\u2019s not really a very clear way to be able to predict what\u2019s going to happen. I think that is very applicable for me, certainly from where I sit now looking back, and as I figure out what\u2019s next. Because people will come up to me and say, just in conversation, if I\u2019m meeting somebody, 'what do you do?' And sometimes I say I\u2019m a cook, sometimes I say I\u2019m a writer. They always want to know, \u2018how many books have you written?\u2019 or \u2018what restaurant do you work at?\u2019 and I don\u2019t always have a traditional answer to those questions. At first I struggled a lot with not getting into any normal idea of somebody else\u2019s version of being a cook or being a writer, and now I think of it as an amazing strength. For me, it all sort of comes together around storytelling.\n\nOriginally, I wanted to be a poet. I really went to college and was an English major thinking I would go to poetry school and be that kind of storyteller. Then, I fell into cooking and sort of realized that I might need to make some money to support my poetry habit. Cooking became this amazing part of my life and probably for 10 years, I just cooked and put all of my time and energy into becoming a better cook for the sake of trying to master this skill. At some point, cooking became less about food than it did about the people around the table, the people who grew the food, the people who make the food. I realized that cooking and food were just another medium for me to tell stories, and so that was kind of a really wonderful way to bring my two loves of writing and cooking together. That sort of set the path for me to start really writing about food, first in magazines and newspapers and then eventually in a book. Now I have the incredible privilege of having this column in the New York Times Magazine that is both my greatest pleasure and my greatest pain, to write this thing every month. So that feels really wonderful and then that turned into the amazing opportunity to tell stories, ultimately about people but while talking about food, in this new medium of film and of TV. I feel, again, so lucky. For me, there is this theme of storytelling that so clearly ties it all together.\n\nDeRay McKesson: How I became a civil rights activist\n\nMichael Bierut: How I became a designer\n\nQ: What\u2019s your biggest career high and biggest career low?\n\nNosrat: I\u2019m definitely riding a tidal wave of a high right now with this show, and this is an amazing thing. But, I think for me what may have even been more meaningful \u2013 because it was something that I really just wanted to do since I was a little kid \u2013 was writing and publishing my book. I think that getting that book done and getting it out in the world \u2013 if I had to rank the experiences that one might be a little bit more meaningful, you know.\n\nLow: There have been so many to choose from, but let\u2019s pick. I\u2019ll just give you a list:\n\n\u2022 There were two book deals I bungled before I got mine, and in retrospect those were books I was not meant to write. At the time, it felt very heartbreaking.\n\n\u2022 I applied twice for a Fulbright grant: the first time I was the first alternate, and the second time I didn\u2019t even make it past the first round.\n\n\u2022 I ran a restaurant for five years that was almost the entire time financially failing, and ultimately we closed it in 2009 because we couldn\u2019t make the numbers work. I wasn\u2019t that happy doing that job, I wasn\u2019t prepared to be a manager \u2013 just because you\u2019re a good cook doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be a good manager \u2013 and I was really young, and not really properly given the training or support to be a good manager. So, I was unhappy and stressed out and feeling the burden of a restaurant \u2013 in which I was not an owner or a partner \u2013 but, I felt like it was mine. The stress of that for a long time, and the biggest low was, in those years, when I was mean to people because I didn\u2019t know another way to be a leader to get what I wanted out of them. I think that the thing I learned from that was that, A: I needed to go to therapy and deal with my temper, and figure out, how do I make better decisions to put myself in situations where I\u2019m going to be able to use the skills and the tools I\u2019m working on developing to communicate better with people? Looking back, the thing I feel the most regret and pain over is that I didn\u2019t treat everyone that I worked with (with) total respect and kindness.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the biggest lesson you\u2019ve learned throughout your career?\n\nNosrat: No matter what I do, no matter what industry I\u2019m in, no matter what project I\u2019m working on, my rule \u2013 my die-hard rule \u2013 is that the people you surround yourself with are everything. For me, I want to be around creative, vulnerable, transparent, communicative, empathetic people. Of course we\u2019re all flawed, of course we\u2019re not always our best selves, but I think making the choices to work with people who will work their butts off, who will give everything they have, who care and who are nice to each other, even in really tricky situations, is to me what determines my joy or happiness in a particular project or situation more than anything else \u2013 more than what we accomplish or don\u2019t accomplish.\n\nQ: What\u2019s your favorite dish to make?\n\nNosrat: My favorite dish to make is any sort of dish that involves multiple vegetables. I love vegetables so much. I love being fed vegetables. I think that it\u2019s an act of care for somebody to feed me vegetables, it\u2019s an act of self-care for me to eat them. I grew up in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s where every children\u2019s television show was about how, like, \u2018ew! I don\u2019t want to eat my brussels sprouts!\u2019 It was just a gag, right? Like, \u2018don\u2019t eat your broccoli.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s a way where I sort of very much absorbed that narrative that vegetables were gross, and it wasn\u2019t until I became a cook \u2013 and my mom, I will say, is an amazing cook. It\u2019s just that in Persian cooking, which is what I grew up eating, we primarily ate greens and herbs rather than cooked vegetables that you do a lot in Western cooking \u2013 so, for me, when I learned how to properly cook and season a beet (I thought I always hated beets) or I cooked asparagus until it was crisp and green and delicious in salted water that allowed the salt to go in and fully season the thing through. Any vegetable to bring the best out of it is my greatest joy, so feeding people vegetables where I think they might assume they\u2019re going to be underwhelmed or maybe being sent something that they don\u2019t want to eat or they don\u2019t like, and then surprising them? That gives me so much joy. Usually I put a salsa, some nuts and some cheeses on top and some herbs to make it delicious. I\u2019m just like, vegetables are my everything!\n\nQ: What advice would you give to someone who follow in your footsteps?\n\nNosrat: You have to build up a resistance, like an immunity, to failure. It\u2019s a really big part of both being a cook and being a writer. You\u2019re going to burn stuff, you\u2019re going to ruin things, you\u2019re going to add too much salt, you\u2019re going to undercook that chicken and bring it to the table and embarrass yourself \u2013 it always happens. And, yet, the beautiful thing about is cooking is, there\u2019s always tomorrow. There\u2019s always another opportunity to eat. Practice is everything in cooking. Nobody is born knowing how to be a great chef \u2013 it\u2019s all through practice and hard work.\n\nThe exact same thing is applicable in writing. One of my favorite quotes about writing is from Gustave Flaubert. He said, \u201cprose is like hair; it shines with combing.\u201d Nothing that I say or write or think comes out perfectly the first time, and usually the biggest part of writing for me is revising. I have to revise stuff an untold number of times to get it to be good, and I think there\u2019s a way where when people only see your unfinished product, they assume, \u2018you whipped that cooking right up!\u2019 or \u2018you whipped that article right up!\u2019 but a lot of work goes into it. I did maybe whip up that roast cauliflower, but you know what came before that was 17 years of practice.\n\nBe ready to fail, and get up and try again. And practice, practice, practice, no matter what you\u2019re doing.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/getting-started/2018/11/20/samin-nosrat-salt-fat-acid-heat-book-netflix/2053323002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Ben Tobin, USA TODAY", "title": "Why you should avoid buying a Christmas tree on Black Friday or Cyber Monday", "description": "Amid the frenzy of holiday shopping deals on Black Friday, you may be tempted to buy a Christmas tree \u2013 but your wallet will thank you if you delay.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/when-best-time-buy-christmas-tree-black-friday-deals/2053121002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/13/USAT/6e538957-6151-4877-a32d-f6074bdba8f6-AP_Missouri_Daily_Life_1.JPG?crop=3614,2030,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:00:02Z", "content": "Millennials are doing it for the 'gram, Instagram that is.

The St. Louis area ranked 11th overall and seventh in the weather category. (Photo: Robert Cohen, AP)\n\nAmid the frenzy of holiday shopping deals on Black Friday, you may be tempted to buy a Christmas tree \u2013 but your wallet will thank you if you delay the purchase.\n\nIf you can hold off all the way until Christmas Eve, you'll get the best deal. The average price of a Christmas tree in the United States drops to its lowest point at $47 on Dec. 24, according to a report by Square and the National Christmas Tree Association.\n\nAnalyzing Square sales of Christmas trees, the report found buying in the next week or so will net the highest price tag: On Black Friday, Christmas trees cost an average of $77, and that figure spikes to $81 on Cyber Monday. If you can wait just a couple weeks, the average cost drops to $64 on Dec. 18, according to the report.\n\nAs a perishable and seasonal product, the trees don't have much use after Christmas Day. Thus, as the holiday season progresses, sellers mark down prices \"knowing that if they don't sell them by Christmas Eve, they're probably not going to sell them,\" says Tim O'Connor, executive director of the National Christmas Tree Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like an airplane seat: once you get closer to the flight time, if that seat isn\u2019t sold, it will never be sold once the plane takes off,\" O'Connor said. \"If that tree isn\u2019t sold on December 26, it\u2019s not very valuable.\u201d\n\nMany customers choose to buy early. In 2017, the National Christmas Tree Association found adults purchased 27.4 million real Christmas trees and \"virtually all\" were bought Black Friday and the following two to three weekends, O'Connor said.\n\nPrices may be a factor for some, but O'Brien said other considerations \u2013 such as when families can come together to buy the tree \u2013 may have greater sway on when customers make purchases. Black Friday can be a time that entire families can shop for a tree as many have gotten together for Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cFamilies shop for trees when it fits their schedules nicely,\" O'Connor said.\n\nThe report also noted the average price of Christmas trees increased 17% \u2013 from $62 to $73 \u2013 between 2015 and 2017.\n\nO'Connor says the change reflects fluctuations in supply. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, an oversupply of Christmas trees caused growers to lose money and some to exit the business. Now that suppliers are growing fewer trees, demand has matched supply, making the industry profitable once again, O'Connor said.\n\nIn addition, millennials are having an impact on the market. While some members of older generations turned to fake trees as their kids moved out of the house, millennials \u2013 people born between 1981 and 1996 \u2013 have been opting for natural and locally grown trees.\n\nMillennials are \"becoming the most important customers for Christmas tree growers,\" O'Connor said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY intern Ben Tobin on Twitter: @TobinBen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/when-best-time-buy-christmas-tree-black-friday-deals/2053121002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Opinion contributor, Gary Wishnatzki, Opinion contributor", "title": "Thanksgiving without the sides: Lack of farm labor could make fruits, vegetables unaffordable", "description": "My farm's fresh strawberries are available at reasonable prices all year because of foreign labor.

But immigration rules could put farms in the lurch.\n\nStrawberry cartons are seen at a supermarket in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, on Sept. 13 (Photo: EPA-EFE)\n\nThis Thanksgiving, as your family gathers together to eat classic holiday sides like green beans, sweet potatoes, corn and apple pie, imagine what it would be like to not have those dishes on your table. Because unless something is done about the lack of qualified agriculture workers that growers like myself are facing, we are headed down a path where the average American will not be able to afford fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nAs a third-generation family farmer with decades of experience, I\u2019ve spent years grappling with the impact of this worker shortage.\n\nI grow strawberries. This April, at the beginning of peak harvest season, I didn\u2019t have enough workers to pick all the ripe berries before they rotted in the fields. In a single month, I lost $500,000.\n\nWhen I first entered the strawberry business in the 1970s, the fruit was considered a luxury item. In the winter, we\u2019d sell them to New York City vendors for the equivalent of nearly $200 a box today. If you wanted to bake a pie with fresh fruit, you had to wait until the early summer harvest. Today, fresh strawberries are readily available and reasonably priced in grocery stores year-round because farms like my own are growing more fruit.\n\nJobs Americans don't want\n\nIt takes a lot of workers to pick those acres, but the domestic labor simply isn\u2019t available. This means that unless our elected officials make drastic changes to immigration policy \u2014 and allow us to hire more foreign-born workers \u2014 many Americans will soon have to give up their strawberries and other crops that must be laboriously picked by hand.\n\nMore: I spent two years serving my country with AmeriCorps. In return, Uncle Sam sent me a bill.\n\nWhy so busy? Our flawed college system takes toll on families years before tuition is due\n\nDespite the risks, I can't imagine being anything but a California firefighter\n\nThe United States already imports more than half of the fresh fruits and almost a third of fresh vegetables that Americans eat. This is happening because the demand for fresh produce has been steadily increasing, while the number of people willing to work on farms has plummeted.\n\nEvery year, I advertise for American workers and get few replies. It\u2019s why, according to data from New American Economy, in 2014 immigrants account for more than 77 percent of Florida\u2019s ag workers. In California, they account for 69 percent of the ag workforce that same year.\n\nNationally, according to the 2013-14 National Agricultural Workers Survey, 73 percent of farm workers are foreign-born.\n\nDeclining numbers of immigrant laborers\n\nTo operate at full capacity, I rely on temporary foreign-born workers hired through the H-2A visa program. But H-2A is a complete mess.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s incredibly expensive. On average, growers pay $2,500 per worker to cover transportation, housing and visa fees. This is on top of the mandated $11.12 minimum pay per hour in Florida, which is more than the state\u2019s required minimum wage of $8.25. In California, the mandated minimum hourly rate is even higher at $12.57 per hour, more than the $11 minimum wage there.\n\nSome of my workers, on piece-rate, were earning upwards of $25 per hour some weeks last season.\n\nSecond, there is so much red tape that my workers often arrive late, like this year, or have to leave before the harvest is complete.\n\nIn recent years, the number of new immigrants arriving here to work in agriculture has fallen by 75 percent. In Florida, we lost more than 8,500 field and crop workers between 2002 and 2014. The remaining workers are aging, which means the shortage will only increase over the next five to 10 years. Soon, we\u2019ll be competing with countries like Mexico to import labor.\n\nAutomated farming is the future of our industry, but we\u2019re not quite there yet. We still need enough workers to handpick crops and bridge the gap until the technologies are mature. Otherwise, we\u2019ll go out of business before we reach that point.\n\nAmerican consumers should be concerned. If growers like me must downsize or go out of business, then shoppers will lose year-round availability and be forced to pay a lot more for produce. Worse, we\u2019ll be relying even more on foreign imports. This doesn\u2019t bode well for American food security.\n\nIf you care about maintaining access to affordable, American-grown food, I urge you to join me in asking our legislators to reform immigration policy. We need to make it easier to hire foreign workers when we need them without worrying about caps, cost and deadlines. Until that happens, both American farmers \u2014 and the families we feed \u2014 will be left in the lurch.\n\nGary Wishnatzki is a third-generation family farmer and the owner and operator of Wish Farms in Florida and California.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

It produces 3.2 million tons of mismanaged plastic waste a year, of which 1.29 million tons ends up in the ocean, the study said.\n\nLuhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia\u2019s coordinating minister of maritime affairs, said the whale\u2019s discovery should raise public awareness about the need to reduce plastic use, and had spurred the government to take tougher measures to protect the ocean.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sad to hear this,\u201d said Pandjaitan, who recently has campaigned for less use of plastic. \u201cIt is possible that many other marine animals are also contaminated with plastic waste and this is very dangerous for our lives.\u201d\n\nHe said the government is making efforts to reduce the use of plastic, including urging shops not to provide plastic bags for customers and teaching about the problem in schools nationwide to meet a government target of reducing plastic use by 70 percent by 2025.\n\n\u201cThis big ambition can be achieved if people learn to understand that plastic waste is a common enemy,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/dead-whale-indonesia-had-plastic-cups-flip-flops-stomach/2064300002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Hyung-Jin Kim, Associated Press", "title": "North Korea blows up 10 guard posts to ease tensions with South", "description": "North Korea blows up 10 guard posts to ease tensions with South", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/north-korea-blows-up-guard-posts/2064297002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/47e4bb8f-49ee-423b-bbaf-0d0bbfcedaaf/47e4bb8f-49ee-423b-bbaf-0d0bbfcedaaf_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:18:52Z", "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2013 North Korea on Tuesday blew up some of its front-line guard posts as part of an agreement to ease tensions along its heavily fortified border with South Korea, Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said.

They later withdrew weapons and troops from 11 of their guard posts and decided to completely dismantle 10 of them by the end of November.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said it confirmed the dismantling of 10 North Korean guard posts on Tuesday. A ministry statement said North Korea had informed the South of its plans in advance.\n\nSouth Korea began dismantling 10 of its guard posts with dynamite and excavators last week. Ministry officials said Tuesday that they haven\u2019t completed the demolitions yet.\n\nMore: North Korea tests new 'ultramodern tactical weapon' amid stalled diplomatic efforts\n\nMore: North Korea running at least 13 secret operating bases for ballistic missile program, new study shows\n\nThe Korean border, the world\u2019s most heavily armed with an estimated 2 million land mines, has been the site of deadly fighting and bloodshed. Called the Demilitarized Zone, it was originally created as a buffer at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nSouth Korea had about 60 posts inside the DMZ guarded by layers of barbed wire and manned by troops with machine guns. North Korea was estimated to have 160 such front-line posts. Once the dismantling is done, the two Koreas are to jointly verify their work by the end of December. They haven\u2019t decided when they will dismantle the rest of the guard posts.\n\nUnder the September agreements, the Koreas have also taken steps to disarm their shared border village of Panmunjom, halted live-fire drills along the border and have been removing mines at a front-line area to conduct their first joint searches for Korean War dead.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have improved since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to South Korea and the United States early this year with a vague promise to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. U.S.-North Korea talks on the North\u2019s nuclear program haven\u2019t produced much progress since Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump held the countries\u2019 first summit in Singapore in June.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/north-korea-blows-up-guard-posts/2064297002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Adam Shell, USA TODAY", "title": "As stocks skid, worries mount for 401(k) investors who can't 'stand the pain'", "description": "401(k) investors' worries are rising as the stock market sinks and concern about bull market's health mounts.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/stock-market-401-k-investors-worries-mount/2010624002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/15/USAT/7e1066cd-d419-46f0-9449-7a026a5eb705-Stock_Market_Worries.JPG?crop=5584,3149,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:00:07Z", "content": "Bear Market is a term that sends fear into Wall Street and investors.

And how does it affect both Wall Street and Main Street? Adam Shell explains.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE)\n\nIn a span of two phone calls, Daniel Milan found out last week just how nervous some of his Detroit-area investors were about the stock market\u2019s recent rough ride.\n\n\u201cTwo clients called and said they wanted to get out of the market completely,\u201d says Milan, a managing partner and investment adviser at Cornerstone Financial Services in Birmingham, Michigan.\n\nBoth investors said they couldn't \u201cstand the pain\u201d of seeing the Dow Jones industrial average fall more than 500 points in a single day and watching their account balances shrink. They told him they would rather \u201ccut their losses.\u201d\n\nThe get-me-out instinct from these individuals captures the rising nervousness on Main Street as stock prices start sinking on a regular basis following the blue-chip average's record high on Oct. 3.\n\n\"It gets them a little wary,\" says JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at discount brokerage TD Ameritrade. Still, despite lots of selling, there's been \"very little panic,\" he notes.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s latest drop, which has knocked Apple \u2013 the most valuable stock in the U.S. \u2013 down more than 20 percent from its recent high and pushed the Dow down nearly 7 percent below its peak \u2013 is causing investors to question the staying power of a bull market that turns 10 years old in March. At its peak, the broad market's bull gain totaled 333 percent.\n\nRisks pile up\n\nWeighing on the mood of investors is a list of challenges and negative headlines that seem to mount on a daily basis. There are fears about the global economy slowing over the U.S.-China trade fight and concerns about the steep price drop in Apple and other popular technology stocks. Rising borrowing costs are also a sticking point, as they make financing purchases of big-ticket items such as homes and SUVs pricier. Adding to the angst are concerns that the momentum for deregulation under President Donald Trump could slow now that Democrats hold the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of challenges that could disrupt the market and shake confidence,\u201d says Chris Larkin, senior vice president of trading at discount brokerage ETrade.\n\nThe Dow's nearly 400-point drop Monday did little to boost confidence.\n\nMore Money: Jeep Wrangler drivers report 'death wobble' on highways\n\nMore Money: Budgets, family drama and stuff: How do you manage holiday gift-giving?\n\nMore Money: David's Bridal files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, aims to stay in business\n\nSigns of anxiety on rise\n\nSigns of investors nervousness are beginning to emerge.\n\n* Shrinking number of bulls: In one sign of rising cautiousness, the number of individual investors that say they are bulls, or think stocks will be up in the next six months, fell from 41.3 to 35.1 percent (below the long-term average of 38.5 percent) in the week ending Nov. 14, according to a survey from the American Association of Individual Investors. And bears swelled to an above-average 36 percent, which means bears now outnumber bulls.\n\nMore Money: David's Bridal files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, aims to stay in business\n\nMore Money: Nissan's Carlos Ghosn fired, arrested over alleged income misconduct\n\nMore Money: These 8 retailers can't afford a disappointing 2018 holiday shopping season\n\n* Buyers turn more defensive: Investors are no longer blindly buying on the dip, Wall Street speak for buying stocks when they are cheaper after a big market drop. Instead, TD Ameritrade says it has started to see retail investors become \"more selective\" about their trading.\n\nApple investors, for example, have gone on a buyers' strike of sorts.\n\n\"They have backed off,\" Kinahan says. \"Buying has slowed down. What it tells me is investors are seeing the opportunity is lower for the market than before.\"\n\nInvestors, Kinahan adds, have also been reading more of the firm's educational materials on its website. They're also showing more interest lately in so-called defensive stocks, such as companies that sell everyday goods to consumers, including names such as Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.\n\n\"In times of uncertainty, investors want to own established stocks that pay them a dividend that they can stay in for awhile until things settle down,\" he says.\n\n* Investors express angst: Investors are making their fears known to pollsters. When asked by E-Trade after the midterm elections how long they thought the current bull market would last, 22 percent said \"the end is near,\" and another 34 percent said the end would be within two years.\n\nSimilarly, a quick post-election survey by Charles Schwab of 150 of its clients found that while 63 percent \"feel bullish\" about the market, 37 percent \"feel bearish\" and think the market is due for a significant decline.\n\nA poll of more than 100 financial advisers by fund company Ariel Investments also captured the more negative mindset of investors. Fifteen percent of advisers' clients said they \"want to reduce exposure to stocks,\" and another 5 percent said they \"want to cut their exposure to equities altogether.\" More than half (55 percent) of financial advisers said their clients today are \"less willing to take on risk and more concerned with avoiding loss.\"\n\n* Money starts to move out of stocks: While investors haven't exited the stock market in a stampede, more money has come out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange traded funds than has flowed in, Investment Company Institute data show.\n\nIn the three weeks ending Oct. 17, for example, a period that saw the market flirt with a 10 percent drop, or correction, outflows of more than $22 billion hit funds and ETFs that invest in domestic stocks. But after two weeks of calm, when money flowed back into U.S. stock funds and ETFs, outflows resumed again, with nearly $4 billion exiting, ICI data show.\n\nMoney also returned to bond funds, seen as a safer play for investors. In the latest week of data, there were net inflows of $777 million into fixed-income funds. That followed four weeks of massive outflows totaling nearly $38 billion, an exodus that was due to people losing money on their bond funds when prices fell and the yield on the 10-year Treasury hit a multiyear high.\n\nWhat's an investor to do?\n\nThere are always risks facing the stock market, and investors need to keep their fears in perspective, Milan says. He has been reminding his jittery clients that the Dow is still up more than 1 percent for the year and that business conditions, such as economic growth and corporate earnings, remain solid.\n\nHe's also been stressing that the lower stock prices have created a good opportunity to buy with any cash sitting on the sidelines.\n\nWhat Milan is not recommending is for clients to flee the market completely.\n\n\"What we try not to let happen is let them run scared and move all their cash to a money market account,\" Milan says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/20/stock-market-401-k-investors-worries-mount/2010624002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Jill Lawrence, USA TODAY", "title": "Democrats need to be ruthless on fixing voting.

What good are policy gains if you can't sustain them?\n\nElection workers place ballots into electronic counting machines at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Florida. (Photo: Joe Cavaretta, AP)\n\nLet\u2019s get real about fixing voting. There are some things Democrats can do now in the states, and there are some they can do the next time they control the House, Senate and White House.\n\nYes, Republicans are missing from that sentence. Democrats need to help themselves, not engage in another futile effort to get Republicans on board with what ought to be a no-brainer. The urgency of this cannot be overstated: It should be the top priority for every Democrat in America. Because what good are policy gains if you can't sustain them?\n\nI can't fault elected Democrats for going for wins like the Affordable Care Act when they are in control, and playing hardball to get them. The ACA certainly benefited from steely determination \u2014 and pushing the envelope on Senate procedure \u2014 in the face of long odds. President Barack Obama\u2019s nominations were another example; many moved along only after then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democrats voted to eliminate the filibuster on them and allow approval by a simple majority of 51.\n\nVoting fixes might protect Democratic gains\n\nIn 2009, after majority Senate Democrats turned a five-page bill protecting historic war sites into a 466-page package of 160 conservation-oriented public lands bills and pushed it through, Republicans were resentful for years. One Democrat told me that \"of course\" there was no incentive to negotiate with Republicans: \"We didn't need to, so why would we?\" That is a fact of life on both sides.\n\nBut as aggressive and ruthless as Democrats have been in pursuing policy goals, their achievements are under constant legislative, executive and judicial threat because they failed to put in place political machinery to protect them. That neglect is having painful consequences for health care, the environment, consumer protection, Wall Street regulation, the tax code and the national debt. And more backsliding is inevitable, given the makeup of President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nIn the best of all worlds, Congress would standardize voting procedures; pour money into equipment, training and security; require nonpartisan redistricting commissions; adopt a national Voting Rights Act that requires federal approval of voting changes in all states (not just some as in the original act); and make Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico states with two senators apiece, one House member for Washington (population close to 700,000) and five members for Puerto Rico (population 3.3 million).\n\nIt's only fair that they become states. Vermont and Wyoming have fewer people than Washington does, yet they have full voting rights and representation in Congress. As for Puerto Rico, well, a seven-member congressional delegation surely would have raised an immediate ruckus over the federal response to Hurricane Maria. That alone underscores what happens when people have no real representation.\n\nMore: Upgrade voting systems, restore Voting Rights Act, end suppression before 2020\n\nRepublicans are rigging elections to win. They're anti-voter and anti-democracy.\n\nFlorida's disorganized ballot counting exposed the dark underbelly of election systems\n\nThere is, however, a larger reason Washington and Puerto Rico should be states. The nation and in particular the Senate are on a dangerous course. Conservatives, many from vast but sparsely populated states, increasingly are making decisions opposed by liberals densely packed in cities and inner suburbs. It isn't unusual for Democrats to win the national popular vote in House and presidential elections, without racking up the proportionate victories.\n\nThat\u2019s even true this year. Democrats are headed to as much as a 9-percentage point win in the popular vote and have picked up at least 37 House seats \u2014 yet in gerrymandered North Carolina, Republicans won 50.3 percent of the popular vote and 10 of 13 House seats.\n\nThe soonest Democrats could run the table nationally from Washington would be 2021. In the meantime, the House Democrats should pass all reforms they can and force Republicans to show what side they're on. And state activists should aim to put reforms directly before voters in 2020 ballot measures wherever possible. This year, while a few states added voting restrictions, more states made it easier to vote and changed how districts are drawn to prevent gerrymandering situations like North Carolina.\n\nVoting reforms also ought to be top priority in the 14 \"trifecta\" states where Democrats now control the state house, state senate and governorship. And whether through the party or other organizations, by whatever means are legal, rich Democrats ought to direct money to equipment upgrades, professionalizing voter administration (including ballot design) and candidates who are committed to reforms.\n\nRepublicans are not interested in solutions\n\nSix years ago, I urged Republicans to take up voting reform, in part to counter the impression that they did not want minorities or young people to have an easy time voting. Instead, they have gone in the opposite direction. The party brand is now racist rhetoric and suppression tactics from the top on down.\n\nMaybe this is sacrilege, and as a longtime believer in compromise, I hate saying it, but Democrats need to move forward immediately on their own and be as brutal in protecting their own interests as Republicans have been in protecting theirs. This means removing obstacles to voting and taking every step possible to ensure that all votes count.\n\nGiven America's demographic trajectory and the dark path the GOP is on, a voting overhaul is likely to help Democrats more than Republicans right now. That could change, but first the Republican Party would have to be reborn as a practical, tolerant and conservative party that's interested in facts, evidence and constructive solutions to real problems.\n\nJill Lawrence, a resident of Washington, D.C., is the commentary editor of USA TODAY and author of \"The Art of the Political Deal: How Congress Beat the Odds and Broke Through Gridlock.\" Follow her on Twitter: @JillDLawrence\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

(Photo: HANDOUT, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2013 North Korea on Tuesday blew up some of its front-line guard posts as part of an agreement to ease tensions along its heavily fortified border with South Korea, Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said.\n\nIn September, the Koreas\u2019 militaries agreed at a leaders\u2019 summit in Pyongyang to eventually dismantle all guard posts inside the 248-kilometer (155-mile) -long, 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) -wide border. They later withdrew weapons and troops from 11 of their guard posts and decided to completely dismantle 10 of them by the end of November.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said it confirmed the dismantling of 10 North Korean guard posts on Tuesday. A ministry statement said North Korea had informed the South of its plans in advance.\n\nSouth Korea began dismantling 10 of its guard posts with dynamite and excavators last week.

Called the Demilitarized Zone, it was originally created as a buffer at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nSouth Korea had about 60 posts inside the DMZ guarded by layers of barbed wire and manned by troops with machine guns. North Korea was estimated to have 160 such front-line posts. Once the dismantling is done, the two Koreas are to jointly verify their work by the end of December. They haven\u2019t decided when they will dismantle the rest of the guard posts.\n\nUnder the September agreements, the Koreas have also taken steps to disarm their shared border village of Panmunjom, halted live-fire drills along the border and have been removing mines at a front-line area to conduct their first joint searches for Korean War dead.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have improved since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to South Korea and the United States early this year with a vague promise to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. U.S.-North Korea talks on the North\u2019s nuclear program haven\u2019t produced much progress since Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump held the countries\u2019 first summit in Singapore in June.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/20/north-korea-blows-up-guard-posts/2064297002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, Editors, USA TODAY", "title": "Transgender Day of Remembrance, College Football Playoff rankings: 5 things to know Tuesday", "description": "Transgender Day of Remembrance, College Football Playoff rankings, and more of the biggest news to start your day.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/20/transgender-day-remembrance-college-football-playoff-rankings/1999524002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/1a3e66ed-1d9d-4ea8-9a33-114cb44f6cce-AP_Ukraine_Transgender_Day.JPG?crop=4106,2325,x0,y23&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:22:31Z", "content": "A young woman attends a gay and lesbian rally a few days before the International Transgender Day of Remembrance in Kiev, Ukraine, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018.

Trump has denied news reports that the CIA has concluded Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing last month inside the Saudi embassy in Turkey. The president, who has touted the importance of the U.S.-Saudi alliance, has also cast doubt on allegations the prince may have been involved. Trump said over the weekend that the report would get to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding the death, but White House officials have said very little since then. Trump is likely to face questions from reporters about Khashoggi as he departs Washington on Tuesday for his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Any charges could shed light on whether Russia coordinated with Trump's campaign.(Nov. 16) AP\n\nRather than federal indictment, Assange deserves a tweaked version of one of Washington\u2019s hottest honors \u2014 a Medal of Freedom with a steam whistle.\n\nJulian Assange (Photo: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWikileaks founder Julian Assange has been secretly indicted by the Trump administration\u2019s Justice Department, \u201ca drastic escalation\u201d of the feds\u2019 efforts against him, the New York Times reported. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has denounced Wikileaks as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service\u201d and labeled Assange a \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201ccoward,\u201d and \u201cenemy.\u201d But rather than a federal indictment, Assange deserves a tweaked version of one of Washington\u2019s hottest honorifics.\n\nWikileaks has been in the federal crosshairs since it released scores of thousands of documents exposing lies and atrocities regarding the Afghan and Iraq wars, thanks to leaks from Army corporal Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Wikileaks released emails from the Democratic National Committee showing that its nominating process was rigged to favor Hillary Clinton. During the final month of the campaign, Wikileaks disclosed emails from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta.\n\nTrump loved WikiLeaks when it was convenient\n\nIn the final month of the presidential campaign, Donald Trump declared, \u201cI love WikiLeaks\u201d and mentioned it more than a hundred times. However, since Trump took office, he is following Washington protocols and viewing whistleblowers as public enemies.\n\nThe Assange indictment is far more threatening than Trump tweets snarling at CNN. The ACLU warns that prosecuting Assange for Wikileaks\u2019 publishing operations would be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and sets a \u201cdangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.\u201d Trevor Timm of the Freedom of the Press Foundation declared: \u201cAny charges brought against WikiLeaks for their publishing activities pose a profound and incredibly dangerous threat to press freedom.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to appreciate Wikileaks without recognizing how federal secrecy has become far more pervasive and dangerous since 9/11. If someone had massively leaked U.S. government documents on Iraq in January 2003, the Bush administration campaign for war might have been thwarted. The federal government made almost 50 million decisions to classify information last year. Politicians and federal agencies have long recognized that \u201cwhat people don't know won't hurt the government.\u201d\n\nMore: Ron Paul: Whistle-blowers are heroic, patriotic\n\nWhat WikiLeaks reveals: Our view\n\nManning should have served a decade: Our view\n\n\u201cTruth will out\u201d is the biggest fairy tale in Washington. U.S. troops are now fighting in 14 foreign nations: will the Pentagon tell us all about it? The National Security Agency illegally tracked every citizen\u2019s phone calls: no federal official disclosed the system that a federal judge castigated as an \u201calmost Orwellian\u201d surveillance scheme. And what are the betting odds of Americans seeing the dirt on the U.S. government\u2019s long-term collusion with the Saudi regime (despite its atrocities at home and abroad)?\n\nOn the same day the Assange indictment scored headlines, Trump awarded seven Presidential Medals of Freedom. No controversy greeted posthumous awards to Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley \u2014 unlike the ruckus regarding Miriam Adelson, wife of Republican super-donor Sheldon Adelson. Public Citizen, a liberal nonprofit, howled that the Adelson award \u201cis just the latest sign of [Trump\u2019s] ability to corrupt and corrode all aspects of the government.\u201d New York Times columnist Paul Krugman caterwauled that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201cand an insult to people who received the medal for genuine service.\u201d\n\nUpdate the freedom awards to kill coverups\n\nIn reality, Presidential Medals of Freedom have routinely been exploited to buttress the political establishment, with bevies of awards for political operators, members of Congress, and pliable foreign leaders. President Lyndon Johnson distributed a bushel of Medals of Freedom to his Vietnam War architects and enablers, perhaps as consolation prizes for losing the war. (The medal awarded to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, whose lies about the war making progress cost thousands of Americans and Vietnamese their lives, fetched $40,625 at an auction a few years ago.) President George W. Bush conferred Medals of Freedom on his Iraq war team, including CIA chief George \u201cSlam Dunk\u201d Tenet, Iraq viceroy Paul Bremer, and ambassador Ryan Crocker, whom Bush called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lawrence of Arabia.\u201d Some of the biggest fabulists of the modern era \u2014 including Henry Kissinger and Dick Cheney \u2014 also pocketed the award.\n\nThe controversies over Assange and Adelson provide a serendipitous opportunity to update the freedom awards. Because few things are more perilous to democracy than permitting politicians to coverup crimes, there should be a new Medal of Freedom category commending individuals who have done the most to expose official lies. This particular award could be differentiated by including a little steam whistle atop the medal \u2014 vivifying how leaks can prevent a political system from overheating or exploding.\n\nAssange would deserve such a medal \u2014 as would Thomas Drake and Edward Snowden (who revealed NSA\u2019s abuses), John Kiriakou (who revealed CIA torture), and Daniel Ellsberg (who leaked the Pentagon Papers). Admittedly, there may be no way to stop presidents from giving steam whistle freedom awards to political donors\u2019 wives.\n\nOrganizations like Wikileaks are among the best hopes for rescuing democracy from Leviathan. Unless we presume politicians have a divine right to deceive the governed, America should honor individuals who expose federal crimes. Whistleblowers should be especially welcome by anyone riled up over Trump\u2019s lies.\n\nJames Bovard, author of \"Attention Deficit Democracy,\" is a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors.

(AP) \u2014 Every so often, Wisconsin's Ethan Happ makes a move around the bucket that reminds some college basketball experts of an NBA Hall of Fame forward.\n\nIt's more about how Happ freed himself to get to the hoop for the 25th-ranked Badgers than the shot itself.\n\nCheck out the footwork. It reminded ESPN analyst and former Duke center Jay Bilas , among others recently on Twitter, of former Boston Celtics great Kevin McHale.\n\nAssistant coach Howard Moore can't help but agree. While Happ might have not have McHale's shooting touch, Wisconsin's 6-foot-10 senior is just about as good as anyone in the college game in the lane.\n\n\"But as far as the footwork and the knack of understanding angles and ways to get to the rim, without having ... to just leap over everyone and finish, I think is pretty remarkable to see how comparable they are,\" Moore said.\n\nHapp is off to another strong start, averaging 18.3 points, 12.0 rebounds and 7.7 assists for Wisconsin (3-0). The preseason All-American is the nation's only player averaging even 18 points, 10 rebounds and six assists.\n\nHe was clutch in the Badgers' biggest game so far, getting 30 points and 13 rebounds last week at Xavier, a win that helped propel back into the AP Top 25 on Monday for the first time since the final poll of the 2016-17 season.\n\nThe competition ramps up this week at the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas. The Badgers open against Stanford on Wednesday, and could face either Florida or Oklahoma on Thanksgiving Day.\n\n\"The things we work on every day are simple, but still they are hard to do. It's hard to be consistent,\" coach Greg Gard said after a 96-59 win over Houston Baptist on Saturday. \"The goal is to become better by becoming more consistent.\"\n\nHapp might be the ideal role model for consistency.\n\nA four-year starter, Happ is already Wisconsin's career rebounding leader . He's also seventh in points, 12th in assists, sixth in blocks and third in steals.\n\n\"He is unique type player. He doesn't shoot from the perimeter at all, but yet he just tears you up inside,\" Houston Baptist coach Ron Cottrell said.\n\nHapp did take part in NBA draft workouts in the offseason, using that time in part as a learning experience. He figured to return to school as long as he wasn't forecast to be a potential first-rounder.\n\nHapp could improve his game by being able to hit mid-range jumper consistently and getting better from the foul line. A career 56 percent free-throw shooter, Happ is 5 of 11 (45 percent) so far this season.\n\nIn the paint with the ball, though, Happ has few peers.\n\n\"The footwork of Wisconsin's Ethan Happ is impeccable. McHale-esque, without the McHale shooting touch. Impressive,\" Bilas said in his tweet about Happ's performance against Xavier.\n\nIt's not the first time that Happ has heard that comparison, either. But while he's watched highlights of McHale, Happ doesn't necessarily model his game after the former Celtics star , or any one big man for that matter.\n\n\"I attribute my post game to growing up as a guard and having that footwork, and then taking guard skills and moves into the post,\" Happ said. \"Using the other side of the rim a lot, stuff like that.\"\n\nLike a good student of the game, Happ has also learned moves from both former teammates and opponents, like former Michigan State forward Matt Costello.\n\nThere's also Michael Jordan.\n\n\"I watch a lot of Michael Jordan highlights,\" Happ said, \"but I wouldn't say I model my game after him.\n\n\"For me, it's learning in-game and throughout my career from (former Wisconsin player) Frank Kaminsky and what he did, and (former teammate Nigel Hayes) and what he did,\" Happ said. \"Seeing guys in person and playing against them, their moves.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Even before the fourth lead change of the fourth quarter, well before the 1,001st yard of combined offense was tallied, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Rams already knew this was a classic.\n\nTwo powerhouse NFL teams at the peak of their brilliance dueled deep into the night at an ecstatic Coliseum, racking up eye-popping numbers that stretched the box score and credulity.\n\nThere were 14 touchdowns, including three by defensive players. There were 56 first downs. There were 105 points, with 50 from each team \u2014 the first time that's ever happened in an NFL game.\n\nIn the final moments, the Rams did just enough to leave with a win they'll savor for years.\n\nAnd if these teams meet again at the Super Bowl in 2 1/2 months, the Chiefs will remember the sting from coming up just short.\n\nJared Goff threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Everett for the go-ahead score with 1:49 to play, and the Rams outlasted the Chiefs for a 54-51 victory Monday night in a showdown that somehow surpassed the hype.\n\n\"It was a crazy game, crazy game,\" said Goff, who passed for 413 yards and four touchdowns and even ran for another score . \"It seemed like whoever had the ball at the end was going to win the game. There was times where we felt like we were going to put the knife in and finish them, and there were times where it was the other way around, where we had to claw back into it.\"\n\nPatrick Mahomes passed for a career-high 478 yards with six touchdown passes in his latest jaw-dropping effort for the Chiefs (9-2), but he also threw two interceptions in the final 1:18 as the Rams (10-1) claimed the highest-scoring Monday night game ever played.\n\nThe highest-scoring game in the league this season was an offensive fantasia of ingenious scheming from mastermind coaches Andy Reid and Sean McVay \u2014 along with 21 combined penalties to keep things interesting. The second half was an extended thriller featuring 59 combined points.\n\nBoth teams scratched out fourth-quarter leads, only to see them evaporate. Mahomes hit Tyreek Hill with a 73-yard TD pass just when the Rams appeared to be pulling away early in the fourth, and Goff replied with two late TD passes to Everett , a backup tight end with 31 career catches before this game.\n\n\"It was a whirlwind,\" McVay said. \"I feel like I might need a couple of beverages to relax tonight, but it was great. This is what you love so much about the game.\"\n\nAnd this game was ultimately decided by defense: Marcus Peters and Lamarcus Joyner came up with late interceptions as the Rams stopped Mahomes' final efforts.\n\n\"It's always fun to play against real good teams,\" Mahomes said. \"You get to go out there and have fun ... (but) it's the same as when we played New England. You can't make mistakes against great teams. You need to limit your mistakes, but be aggressive.\"\n\nThe Coliseum's first Monday night game since 1985 was staged on short notice after the NFL moved the matchup from Mexico City to Los Angeles six days ago due to poor field conditions at Azteca Stadium. The Rams used the opportunity to give free tickets to thousands of first responders and families recovering from the dual tragedies of nearby wildfires and a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks.\n\nThose fans got an incredible treat for their reward \u2014 and if the video-game-like spectacle they saw turns out to be a Super Bowl preview, Atlanta will get an All-Madden-level show as well.\n\n\"It was just cool,\" said Todd Gurley, whose 13-game touchdown streak somehow ended in this offensive showcase. \"It was a last-minute game and everybody (came) out in support. Had the families here, had the responders, so it was just a great overall crowd and it was good for the city.\"\n\nThis game has loomed in capital letters on the NFL's regular-season schedule ever since these teams confirmed their status as offensive powerhouses in September. The Rams and Chiefs are the league's biggest favorites along with New Orleans and New England \u2014 the teams responsible for the only other losses by Los Angeles and Kansas City this season.\n\nMahomes had the most prolific passing game in the NFL this year, but he and Goff both made key mistakes.\n\nRams linebacker Samson Ebukam returned Mahomes' fumble and a one-armed interception for the first two TDs of his NFL career, while Kansas City's Allen Bailey returned Goff's fumble for a go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"It was electric,\" Ebukam said. \"It's hard to describe, because I'm still like in a game mode right now. I haven't calmed down yet, so it hasn't really all sunk in yet.\"\n\nBIG FINISH\n\nThe final seven minutes were particularly frantic and sweet: After Chris Conley caught his second TD pass from Mahomes for a 51-47 lead with 2:47 to play, Goff replied with a 75-yard TD drive in 58 seconds, hitting Everett down the Rams' frenzied sideline.\n\nPeters \u2014 the former Pro Bowl cornerback traded by Kansas City to Los Angeles last winter \u2014 then intercepted Mahomes' underthrown ball near midfield with 1:18 to play, but the Rams only managed to take 14 seconds off the clock on their next three plays.\n\nThe Coliseum roiled in anticipation of a big finish by Mahomes, but the Chiefs were pushed back to their 13 with 50 seconds left thanks to a booming punt by Johnny Hekker. Joyner intercepted Mahomes' final desperate heave with 13 seconds left.\n\n\"We can learn from this,\" Reid said. \"We can't give up 21 points on turnovers. Have to take care of the football. We created some turnovers and points, (but had) too many penalties. We'll heal up and get set to go for the stretch run.\"\n\nTIMELY DEFENSE\n\nFor all the offensive brilliance on display, both defenses made game-changing plays as well.\n\nAaron Donald forced two fumbles while sacking Mahomes, and Ebukam returned the first for a TD in the second quarter. The Rams' unsung outside linebacker then made a spectacular one-armed interception at the line of scrimmage in the third quarter before returning it 25 yards for a score, powering over Mahomes to reach the end zone.\n\nINJURIES\n\nChiefs: WR Sammy Watkins had one catch for 4 yards against his former team after missing last week's game with a foot injury.\n\nRams: CB Troy Hill, WR Brandin Cooks and Peters all went to the locker room early in the second half with cramps. They all returned.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nChiefs: Bye week, followed by a trip to Oakland on Dec. 2.\n\nRams: Bye week, followed by a trip to Detroit on Dec. 2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

McGuire had moved from the sideline to the microphone. They were together in the locker room before a game when McGuire came out and firmly set his hands on Self's shoulders, and the impressionable young coach waited for some words of wisdom.\n\n\"OK, we got it,\" Self recalled hearing from behind McGuire, where a camera crew was positioned to get some B-roll film for the broadcast. McGuire turned on his heel and walked away.\n\n\"He never said a word,\" Self said with a chuckle.\n\nSelf recalled the story this week ahead of the second-ranked Jayhawks' game against Marquette in the NIT Season Tip-Off on Wednesday in New York. Fifth-ranked Tennessee meets Louisville in the other tournament semifinal, and the winners will meet for the championship on Friday night.\n\n\"Playing Marquette and either Louisville or Tennessee in a three-day window will tell us a lot,\" Self said. \"I think this is a really good field, as good as any tournament in the country.\"\n\nThere are some pretty good fields in other tournaments, though.\n\nTop-ranked Duke, second-ranked Gonzaga and No. 8 Auburn got started in the Maui Invitational on Monday. No. 15 Mississippi State is headed to Las Vegas for the MGM Resorts Main Event, No. 14 Florida State and No. 19 LSU highlight the AdvoCare Invitational, and No. 4 Virginia and No. 25 Wisconsin are the marquee teams at the Battle 4 Atlantis starting Wednesday.\n\n\"I think this is a big thing in all our programs,\" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said of the Maui Invitational. \"It's one tournament that really moves the needle with your own players, obviously with your fans \u2014 at least, ours are always asking what year are we going back to Maui. Even in recruiting, if you mention Maui in recruiting, the kids are very excited about getting over here.\"\n\nStill, the Las Vegas Invitational may have the toughest quartet of teams of any tournament in the country. Seventh-ranked North Carolina faces Texas in the opening semifinal Thursday night while No. 11 Michigan State faces No. 17 UCLA in the other.\n\n\"I feel like we are a whole different team from our game against Kansas. That was our first time being thrown out into the fire,\" Spartans guard Cassius Winston said. \"Now we know our roles and we are looking forward to these upcoming games because it's a whole different caliber.\"\n\nSTARTING THE WEEK\n\nNo. 12 Kansas State beat Missouri 82-67 to win the Paradise Jam on Monday night. No. 6 Nevada, No. 7 North Carolina and No. 17 UCLA won campus games in the Las Vegas Invitational. Top-ranked Duke rolled in Maui, where No. 8 Auburn needed overtime to beat Xavier. No. 16 Florida State beat Canisius in a campus game of the AdvoCare Invitational and No. 16 Clemson squeaked by Akron in the Cayman Islands.\n\nBRUTAL BIG TEN\n\nMichigan State coach Tom Izzo jokingly blamed former athletic director Mark Hollis for leaving him with a brutal nonconference schedule. But things won't get much easier once league play begins. The Spartans are joined in the Top 25 by ninth-ranked Michigan, No. 20 Iowa, No. 23 Ohio State, No. 24 Purdue and No. 25 Wisconsin, while Nebraska and Indiana are the next two schools receiving votes.\n\nThe Wolverines have already won the Air Force Reserve Tip-Off, the Hawkeyes won the 2K Classic, the Badgers are playing in the Battle 4 Atlantis and Ohio State is hosting its own Buckeye Classic.\n\nBEAT-UP BIG EAST\n\nReigning national champion Villanova lost twice to fall out of the Top 25. Marquette also fell out after getting routed by Indiana. Xavier got shellacked by Wisconsin, Creighton lost to Ohio State and Seton Hall was stomped by Nebraska in an awful week for the Big East.\n\nPerhaps the league can turn things around in holiday tournaments.\n\nXavier lost to Auburn in the opening round in Maui on Monday. Creighton is playing in the Cayman Islands. Marquette has the Jayhawks up next while Butler is in the Battle 4 Atlantis.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Butch Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThe Associated Press has been honoring college football's best with an All-America team since 1925. The full three-team AP All-America selections will be unveiled in December. The 10th All-America watch of the season features Tua Tagovailoa's stretch run; Michigan State's tenacious defensive end; and an Egg Bowl edge matchup.\n\nSPOTLIGHT\n\nTua Tagovailoa, QB, Alabama\n\nThe Tua Express slowed in November with two solid \u2014 but not spectacular \u2014 games against good LSU and Mississippi State defenses. The Tide needed Tagovailoa to play more than most expected against The Citadel and he, of course, fattened up the stats against the FCS team. Much like the Heisman race, the competition for All-America quarterback seems to be down to Oklahoma's Kyler Murray and Tagovailoa \u2014 with Washington State's Gardner Minshew and West Virginia Will Grier trailing. Tagovailoa still leads the nation in passer efficiency rating at 212.22 and yards per attempt at 12.1. The sophomore has 31 touchdown passes and two interceptions, and he has run for four touchdowns, though an achy knee has limited that part of his game.\n\nOutlook: Tagovailoa has the Iron Bowl against Auburn and the SEC championship game against No. 5 Georgia to make a strong closing statement versus two top-30 defenses.\n\nWHO'S HOT\n\nKenny Willekes, DE, Michigan State\n\nWillekes has been one of the leaders of a tough Michigan State defense all season, but he has been especially difficult to block recently \u2014 even though the Spartans are a on a two-game losing streak.\n\nWillekes has seven tackles for loss in the last two games and 9\u00bd over his last three. The 6-foot-4, 260-pound junior had a season high 13 tackles against Ohio State and followed it with nine more against Nebraska. The Spartans have managed only 12 points the past two games, so the good work done by Willekes and the defense has not been rewarded.\n\nWHO'S NOT\n\nAJ Dillon, RB, Boston College\n\nDillon was a preseason All-American after a huge freshman season, but a nagging ankle injury has kept him out of two games and limited him in others. He still ranks 10th in the nation in rushing at 116.89 yards per game, but he hasn't topped 5.0 yards per carry in a game since September. In the past three games, Dillon has 251 yards on 77 carries (3.3 yards per carry).\n\nGROUP OF FIVE STAR\n\nNate Harvey, DE, East Carolina\n\nHarvey has been one of the most disruptive players in the country, leading the nation in tackles for loss with an American Athletic Conference record 24 and ranking second in sacks with 13.5. Toiling for a team with just three victories, Harvey has not gotten much national attention. He's been a revelation. A former walk-on and reserve running back, Harvey moved to defense this season and at 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds he has been a nightmare for opponents to block.\n\nON THE LINE\n\n(Former Auburn offensive lineman and ESPN analyst Cole Cubelic identifies an o-lineman worth watching)\n\nRishard Cook, OG, UAB\n\nA 340-pound junior who started four games last year and moved into a full-time starting roll on the Blazers' offensive line this season.\n\n\"Big and physical. Fun to watch him pull as he always seems to knock guys out of the way. Solid at the point of attack, particularly in the run game,\" Cubelic said.\n\nALL-AMERICA MATCHUP\n\nMontez Sweat, DE, Mississippi State vs. Greg Little, OT, Mississippi.\n\nThe Egg Bowl is likely to come down to whether Ole Miss' potent offense, led by quarterback Jordan Ta'amu, can roll up some points against a stingy Mississippi State defense. Up front, there will be a matchup of possible first-round draft picks. Sweat is second in the SEC in sacks with 9\u00bd. Little was a second-team midseason All-American and former five-star recruit.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When fans tune into NBC's Thanksgiving night broadcast of the Falcons-Saints game, they might do a double take.\n\nRather than seeing Mike Tirico, Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison in the studio for the pregame and halftime programs, those three will be calling the game.\n\nIt's nothing new for Tirico, who does play-by-play on Notre Dame games for NBC, spent years as the main voice on ESPN's Monday night games, and has been working nationally televised contests on holidays since 2002.\n\nDungy has worked in the booth before, too, including with Tirico. For Harrison, though, this is a first-time experience.\n\n\"This is definitely unfamiliar territory for me,\" says Harrison, who played 15 pro seasons at safety and won two Super Bowls. \"I'm trying to figure what I want to talk about, how I want to focus on the offense or the defense. Mike tells me just to talk about what you see, that my being on the field and in the locker room as a player, just talk about what you feel like you want to talk about and have fun.\n\n\"I am not going to try to be Cris Collinsworth or Troy Aikman. I will trust my instincts.\"\n\nThere's one thing Harrison definitely knows he won't do.\n\n\"One of the things I am focusing, there are many announcers who think they have to talk about every single thing they see on every single play,\" he says. \"That's one of the things that really irks me when I watch a game. I promise I will not be that guy. There will be no one saying, 'Shut the hell up Rodney, I am tired of listening to you.' That will not happen.\"\n\nDungy laughs when the Harrison remark is relayed. The Hall of Fame coach, like Harrison, is not one to pull his punches, but he also knows he can't be wailing away verbally.\n\nWhat Dungy and Harrison can bring to the game is something not delivered by most NFL broadcasts: the perspective of the defense. So their critiques figure to be refreshing when you consider how many analysts in booths on the networks are former quarterbacks.\n\n\"I think Rodney really will give some insight they do not really get elsewhere,\" Dungy says. \"Especially in a game like this, which will be so much of an aerial attack and passing. So, what should and can be done on defense to counteract it. In that area, I think we will both have good things to say.\n\n\"It is a fine line how much to say, and I have worked with Mike twice and he is great because he will lead us into things, help us know when to talk and when not to. When I have something to say that will be helpful to the audience, that is when you want to say it. If it is not going to add to their knowledge, then you keep quiet.\"\n\nTirico recognizes the importance of the comfort level the trio of announcers can carry into the broadcast. After all, they not only spend all of Sunday together, they also share thoughts via text or phone during the week.\n\nThat can be a key for any broadcast crew. If there is any tension or animosity, it often is detected by the audience.\n\n\"It's a bit easier having the last couple of years together, or the few Thursday nights we worked on the field, being around the package when we had it,\" Tirico says. \"Every Sunday for the better part of 11 to 12 hours we are catching every game in the league and then doing the pregame show live and then watching the Sunday night game.\n\n\"There is no learning curve for getting comfortable with the guys.\"\n\nAnd the viewers are certain to benefit.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLamar Jackson ran 27 times and threw only 19 passes to win his first NFL start.\n\nThat's not a typo.\n\nFilling in for injured quarterback Joe Flacco, Jackson ran for 117 yards in Baltimore's 24-21 victory over Cincinnati on Sunday. The 2016 Heisman Trophy winner had more rushing attempts than any quarterback since 1970 and became the first to gain over 100 yards since Colin Kaepernick had 113 on Nov. 27, 2016.\n\nCalling his own number worked so Ravens coach John Harbaugh let Jackson tuck it and take off all day. But old-school football won't cut it in a pass-crazy league where quarterbacks are posting ridiculous numbers every week. Even Harbaugh realizes Jackson can't run the ball at that pace in the future.\n\n\"Yeah, you don't want your quarterback getting hit that much,\" Harbaugh said Monday. \"It's not going to last that way. So, that's pretty self-evident.\"\n\nPlenty of running quarterbacks have been successful, though taking hits exposes them to more injuries. Michael Vick is the all-time leading rusher among quarterbacks but he missed a bunch of games during his career. Carson Wentz isn't considered a \"running QB\" but he tore two knee ligaments on a scramble last season and missed the playoffs and Super Bowl.\n\n\"Quarterbacks don't run forever in the NFL,\" Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said after Jackson juked and sprinted his way past his team. \"Sooner or later, they get hurt, and they don't run the same.\"\n\nNOT INTERESTED: After losing quarterback Alex Smith for the rest of the season, the NFC East-leading Redskins signed Mark Sanchez to be Colt McCoy's backup. They also worked out Kellen Clemens, Josh Johnson, T.J. Yates and EJ Manuel.\n\nSanchez hasn't started a game since 2015. He has thrown 86 touchdown passes and has 86 interceptions with a 73.9 career passer rating. Clemens (16 TDs, 21 INTs, 68.9), Johnson (5 TDs, 10 INTs, 57.7), Yates (10 TDs, 11 INTs, 70.7) and Manuel (20 TDs, 16 INTs, 77.1) are much less impressive. But there's an unsigned quarterback \u2014 Kaepernick \u2014 with 72 TDs, 30 INTs and 88.9 rating. He's also 4-2 in the playoffs. Like the rest of the NFL, the Redskins weren't interested.\n\nRUNNING IT UP: Saints coach Sean Payton defended his decision to go for a fourth-and-7 leading by 31 points early in the fourth quarter. Drew Brees threw a 37-yard TD pass to Alvin Kamara with 13:15 left in a 45-7 win over Philadelphia. Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, who began his career with the Saints and was beat on the play, wasn't pleased. He raised both of his middle fingers at Payton. But Jenkins spoke to Payton after the game and told a reporter: \"I'm a competitor. I love Sean to death. I know what type of guy and coach he is. That was more so personal between me and him.\"\n\nUNAGGRESSIVE DOUG: Eagles coach Doug Pederson's unconventional style was lauded during the team's run to a Super Bowl victory last season, but he's played it safe more often this year. On the opening possession in Philadelphia's lopsided loss at New Orleans, the Eagles faced a fourth down and less than a yard at the Saints 24. Pederson elected to punt even though his offense needed to try and score and keep Brees and Co. off the field as long as possible.\n\n\"That's one I look at that maybe you do something different right,\" Pederson said in hindsight.\n\nNO CHALLENGE: Broncos coach Vance Joseph decided not to challenge a 2-point conversion to save a timeout and it nearly cost him until Brandon McManus kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired to beat the Chargers. Joseph chose not to toss the red flag after Case Keenum came up short on a 2-point draw following Phillip Lindsay's touchdown run that put Denver ahead 20-19 with 12 minutes left. He said one of the officials told the quarterback his team should challenge the call because it was so close. But Joseph said his assistants in the booth didn't see it clearly enough to risk losing a timeout.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football writer Arnie Stapleton and AP Sports Writer David Ginsburg contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes threw for the most yards in the NFL this season and had his second six-touchdown game. But it is the five turnovers the Kansas City quarterback committed that led to the Chiefs dropping their second game this season.\n\nMahomes threw three interceptions and had two fumbles in Monday night's 54-51 loss to the Los Angeles Rams at the LA Memorial Coliseum. Three of the turnovers resulted in Rams touchdowns, including a fumble and interception return for TDs by Rams linebacker Samson Ebukam.\n\n\"I gave them 21 points through turnovers,\" said Mahomes, who completed 33 of 46 passes for 478 yards. \"It sucks right now, plain and simple. You wanted a win like that over a playoff team.\"\n\nIt is the first three-interception game of Mahomes' career. The first pick came when Ebukam stuck his left hand up at the line of scrimmage and came down with the ball before returning it for a touchdown.\n\nMahomes said he was intending to throw to tight end Demetrius Harris, but that he babied the throw instead of putting more velocity on it.\n\nThe last two picks came on the final drives as the Chiefs were attempting to tie the game with a field goal.\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid said the Marcus Peters interception with 1:18 remaining was mostly the result of pressure by Ebukam. The last one, which was picked off by LaMarcus Joyner with 13 seconds remaining at the Rams 28, was Mahomes trying to make a play late.\n\nThe two fumbles were the results of strip sacks by Aaron Donald, who has a league-leading 14.5 sacks.\n\n\"He's made enough of those plays where you have full trust in him,\" Reid said. \"We always talk about protecting the ball and he usually does a good job of that.\"\n\nWide receiver Chris Conley, who had seven receptions for 74 yards, said this is the first game that felt as if it had a postseason feel.\n\n\"Both teams were charged and ready to play like the playoffs. You have to be at your best though, because there are no second chances and do overs.\"\n\nDespite the turnovers, Reid was impressed with the way Mahomes was able to battle through some early adversity. Early in the fourth quarter, he fired a 73-yard touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill to bring the Chiefs within 40-37. It was Mahomes' second-longest completion of the season.\n\n\"He's resilient and has confidence in himself. Things are going to happen in a game,\" Reid said. \"The great ones come back firing and tries to rip their hearts out the next series.\"\n\nFor a team that has high postseason aspirations, one concern could be that most of Mahomes' interceptions have come against quality defenses. Besides the three against the Rams, he threw two in a loss to New England on Oct. 14 and two against Jacksonville on Oct. 7.\n\nRams linebacker Dante Fowler Jr., who has faced Mahomes twice this season, said he felt like Mahomes was getting a little rattled late in the game.\n\n\"When you are in situations like that, his first year in situations like that, it's kind of hard. We put the pressure on him and we did a good job,\" Fowler Jr. said.\n\nFor Mahomes, the lessons from this loss were the same as when the Chiefs lost to the Patriots 43-40 on Oct. 14: You can't make mistakes against good teams.\n\nKansas City goes into the bye at 9-2 and with the best record in the AFC. Reed and Conley are confident that Mahomes will be ready for the December stretch drive.\n\n\"Patrick is a gamer. We are behind him and we know he will bounce back from this and get better,\" Conley said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He hit me, I hit the shot.

This season, thus far, the Sun Devils are averaging 86 points per game, and outrebounding teams, 51-34.\n\n\"It's been a drastic change from last year; we were a fun, free-flowing team that could hit the deep 3s, and I had guards that could attack the lane, and we played a lot of small ball,\" Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley said. \"This year it's like the polar opposite of that. We talked about guys wanting to rebound, and you're not gonna find a team that's more imposing physically at all positions. For us to outrebound them is a statement to how physical we were.\"\n\nThe Sun Devils held off a second-half rally by Mississippi State, which tied the game at 65 when Nick Weatherspoon drained a long-range jumper just inside the 3-point line with one minute left in the game.\n\n\"They have great size, they're very physical, they played big \u2014 which is difficult for us \u2014 I thought they just pounded us,\" Mississippi State coach Ben Howland said. \"They're a very good team.

(Photo: John Moore, Getty Images)\n\nA federal judge in San Francisco blocked new rules put into place by President Donald Trump that limit the ability of immigrants to request asylum, a legal blow to the administration\u2019s efforts to curb legal immigration that opens the door for more members of the immigrant caravan to request asylum in the USA.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jon Tigar ruled late Monday that the administration's new policy of cutting off asylum to immigrants who enter the country illegally appears to run afoul of U.S. law that specifically allows them to do so.\n\nThe 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival,\" may apply for asylum. On Nov. 9, Trump tried to overrule that law, signing a presidential proclamation ending the ability of immigrants to request asylum if they enter the country illegally.\n\n\u201cThe rule barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country outside a port of entry irreconcilably conflicts with the INA and the expressed intent of Congress,\" wrote Tigar, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. \"Whatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden.\u201d\n\nMore: Immigrants' makeshift shelter in Tijuana nears capacity\n\nMore: Job fair kicks off for stranded immigrants facing long wait times in Tijuana\n\nTigar issued a temporary restraining order, meaning the administration is forbidden from enforcing the new rules until the court case proceeds Dec. 19.\n\nIn a joint statement Tuesday, the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that a collection of advocacy groups were able to sue the federal government to stop the asylum policy. The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of four groups that help immigrants.\n\nThe statement did not announce an appeal, but it made clear that the administration will fight Tigar\u2019s ruling in court.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch's legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border,\" wrote Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman and Justice spokesman Steven Stafford.\n\nThe White House later issued a statement saying the \u201cdecision will open the floodgates, inviting countless illegal aliens to pour into our country on the American taxpayer\u2019s dime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis temporary injunction is yet another example of activist judges imposing their open borders policy preferences, which are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American people, and interfering with the executive branch\u2019s authority to administer the immigration system in a manner that ensures the Nation\u2019s safety, security, and the rule of law,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAs that legal process moves along, the ruling could have an immediate impact on members of the immigrant caravan of mostly Central Americans who are gathering in Tijuana to try to enter the USA.\n\nAsylum is a form of protection granted to people who fear persecution in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Department of Homeland Security data.\n\nThe number of asylum applications has skyrocketed in recent years, from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.\n\nTrump signed his directive after a monthlong attack against the immigrant caravan. He took to the campaign trail to warn about a looming \"invasion\" from caravan members who were criminals, gang members and \"Middle Easterners.\"\n\nTo justify the move, he relied on a law that allows a president to suspend entry of foreigners if he signs a proclamation declaring them \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" That's the same rationale he used to implement his controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries. The first two versions of the travel ban were shot down in court, but the third was upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nDepartment of Justice lawyers cited the travel ban decision in the asylum lawsuit.\n\n\"Consistent with this explanation, the proclamation imposes limited measures to ameliorate the crisis along the southern border,\" the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU argued that the president's powers over immigration are not absolute and do not allow him to unilaterally cut off asylum for entire groups of people.\n\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling makes clear that the President cannot override Congress, and will save lives,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who brought the suit.\n\nIn court filings, the ACLU argued that the asylum restrictions were a direct challenge to the clear intention of Congress when it passed the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. The group cited a 1951 United Nations treaty signed by the United States that says \"refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry\" because extreme situations sometimes \"require refugees to breach immigration rules.\"\n\nThe ACLU used the example of the immigrant caravan, which is massing by the thousands in Tijuana, Mexico. Many members have said they want to present themselves at ports of entry to make their asylum request, but the majority cannot do so because U.S. officials at the San Ysidro Port of Entry can process only about 100 requests a day.\n\nThat has left caravan members stranded in Tijuana, a \"life-threatening\" situation that leaves them vulnerable to criminals who seek to take advantage of them, the ACLU attorneys wrote.\n\n\"Asylum seekers turned back from a port of entry have been raped, beaten, and kidnapped and held for ransom by cartel members waiting outside,\" they wrote. \"Asylum seekers who need to reach safety as quickly as possible thus often feel compelled to enter the United States along the border, outside of a port of entry, in order to escape their persecutors and the violence on Mexico\u2019s side of the border.\"\n\nA separate lawsuit filed in Washington challenges another move by the Trump administration to limit asylum claims. In that case, the ACLU and other groups say the administration overstepped its legal limits when it issued rules barring immigrants from qualifying for asylum based on domestic abuse or gang violence.\n\nLawyers argued that case Monday, and the judge could issue a ruling any day.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-new-asylum-rules-migrant-caravan/2060994002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "For The Win, Andy Nesbitt, For The Win", "title": "Jared Goff, Andrew Whitworth share special moment with families of shooting victims", "description": "The Rams had an epic win Monday night.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Amid a disappointing showing that fell well short of Stanley Cup expectations, the St. Louis Blues fired coach Mike Yeo a quarter of the way into the season and named Craig Berube as his interim replacement.\n\nSt. Louis general manager Doug Armstrong announced the change hours after Monday night's loss to the Los Angeles Kings, the Blues' third shutout in the last four games. At 7-9-3, the Blues are in last place in the Central Division, and their 17 points rank next-to-last in the NHL, ahead of only Los Angeles.\n\nSomething had to give for the Blues after they failed to make the playoffs last season, falling one point short when they lost to Colorado in their 82nd game. They lost in the second round under Yeo in 2017, after he was a midseason replacement for fired coach Ken Hitchcock.\n\nAfter no coaches were fired last season, the 45-year-old Yeo is the third NHL coach to lose his job this month, following the Kings' John Stevens and the Blackhawks' Joel Quenneville. Yeo went 73-49-11 in parts of three seasons with the Blues, with one playoff series victory.\n\nBerube had been an associate coach on Yeo's staff since the summer of 2017. Before that, he was coach of the Blues' AHL affiliate and has NHL head-coaching experience from parts of two seasons with Philadelphia.\n\nThe 52-year-old Berube is a midseason replacement for the second time, after replacing Peter Laviolette with the Flyers three games into the 2013-14 season. Berube played 1,054 NHL games and racked up 159 points and 3,149 penalty minutes.\n\nYeo joined the Blues as an assistant in 2016 after five seasons with Minnesota. The Wild made the playoffs in three of Yeo's four full seasons, and he was fired 55 games into 2015-16.\n\nThe Blues came into the season with championship aspirations after acquiring center Ryan O'Reilly in a trade from Buffalo and signing forwards Tyler Bozak, Patrick Maroon and David Perron. Yeo was considered to be on the hot seat, and two consecutive losses led to his dismissal.\n\nFollowing the late-night announcement, the team called a news conference for Tuesday morning with Armstrong and Berube.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Gaudreau became the 10th player in franchise history, and first since Olli Jokinen on Feb. 14, 2011, to register four points in a period.\n\nGaudreau's handiwork began 2:36 into the game when he set up Tkachuk, who also matched his career best in points. Tkachuk whipped a 20-foot wrist shot past Malcolm Subban for a power-play goal.\n\nGaudreau made it 2-0 at 6:49, ripping a shot over Subban's glove to complete a tic-tac-to passing sequence with linemates Elias Lindholm and Monahan.\n\n\"Smart play by a smart player,\" said Gaudreau, describing Lindholm's play that began the sequence. \"He's 20 to 30 feet ahead of us and he has a one-on-two, pulls up, finds (Monahan), next thing you know it's a two-on-two then I'm coming in the play and it's a three-on-two. For him to have that awareness, he's pretty smart.\"\n\nGaudreau pounced on a turnover in the Vegas slot and set up Monahan's one-timer for a 3-0 lead at 10:59, then capped off his record-tying period by setting up Monahan's second of the period and team-leading 12th goal.\n\n\"He's a big-time threat to take the puck to the net and then when he pulls up and delays, you've got guys with good timing coming late, that's when you see all those seam passes and East-West passes,\" Peters said. \"All of a sudden, the goaltender is out playing the shooter and it's a long lateral pass and he can't get across.\"\n\nTJ Brodie and Sam Bennett rounded out the scoring for Calgary (12-8-1), which plays Vegas again on Friday.\n\nNick Holden and Max Pacioretty scored third-period goals for the Golden Knights, who were coming off a 6-3 win in Edmonton on Sunday\n\n\"It's hard to believe that this happened tonight, the way we played last night but that's hockey,\" Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said. \"It's pretty disappointing and I hope they're disappointed because they didn't show up.\"\n\nFor the Flames, who lead the league with six third-period comebacks, Monahan says it was nice to play from in front for a change.\n\n\"It's fun, obviously, when you're putting the puck in the net and you're winning like that. That's the best part of hockey,\" said Monahan. \"This is a team, I think we needed a win like that.\"\n\nSecond-year Czech goaltender David Rittich made 20 saves to improve to 7-1-0. It was the second start in a row for the 26-year-old Rittich, who is getting more playing time with veteran Mike Smith struggling.\n\nSubban went the distance for Vegas, finishing with 25 stops. After going 13-4-2 as a rookie last season, Subban has lost all four starts this season.\n\n\"I don't have any answers for you right now, but we're supposed to be a fast team and it's probably the slowest we played all year,\" Vegas winger Reilly Smith said.\n\nNOTES: Flames RW James Neal has gone without a point in his last seven games and is stuck at 499 career points. He has just four points (one goal, three assists) in 21 games since signing a five-year, $28.75 million contract in the summer.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGolden Knights: At Arizona on Wednesday night.\n\nFlames: Host Winnipeg on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOne of the most anticipated NFL games of the season lived up to its immense hype.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams outlasted the Kansas City Chiefs, 54-51, in the highest scoring game in the 49-season history of Monday Night Football.\n\nThe 105-point outburst topped the long-standing 95-point tally posted by the Green Bay Packers and Washington Redskins in a 48-47 classic during the 1983 season at legendary Lambeau Field.\n\nHere is a look at the wild numbers from Monday's unforgettable evening at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum:\n\n105 combined points \u2014 That is the third-most in NFL history, behind the Washington Redskins' 72-41 win (113 points) over the New York Giants in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals' 58-48 win (106 points) over the Cleveland Browns in 2004.\n\n54 points \u2014 The Rams have the third-highest point total in MNF history. The Philadelphia Eagles beat the Washington Redskins, 59-28, in 2010. In 1988, the Indianapolis Colts beat the Denver Broncos, 55-23.\n\n50-burgers \u2014 Monday night's Rams-Chiefs thriller was the first game in NFL history in which both teams scored 50 or more points. There have been some close calls through the years, including recently. Three seasons ago, the New Orleans Saints beat the New York Giants, 52-49. In 2013, the Denver Broncos beat the Dallas Cowboys, 51-48, in a game famous for the slowest 1-yard touchdown run in league history (Note: not an official stat). In a 2009 NFC wild-card playoff game, the Arizona Cardinals beat the Green Bay Packers, 51-45, in overtime.\n\nFour fourth-quarter lead changes \u2014 The final of the four was Jared Goff's 40-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Everett with 1:49 left in the game. Interceptions by Marcus Peters and Lamarcus Joyner assured there wouldn't be a fifth lead change in the final period.\n\n1,001 yards combined \u2014 The Chiefs posted 546 total yards of offense, while the Rams had 455. The game's biggest yardage-gainer was Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill, whose 10-catch, 215-yard and two touchdown performance probably helped some fans win their fantasy football games.\n\nTwo losses with 40 points \u2014 The Chiefs' two losses this season came in games in which they have scored 40 or more points. The Chiefs lost to the Patriots, 43-40, in Week 6. The last team to lose multiple games when scoring 40 or more points was the 1966 Giants. The Giants' losses came in back-to-back weeks. The Giants lost to the Redskins in that infamous 72-41 game, then a week later, lost 49-40 to the Browns.\n\nSix TD passes \u2014 Patrick Mahomes threw six touchdowns in a game for the second time this season. He has joined Ben Roethlisberger (2014) and Y.A. Tittle (1962) as the only players since 1950 with multiple games with six or more touchdown passes in a single season.\n\nFifth time \u2014 Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, Rams-Chiefs was just the fifth time that opposing teams each had one or fewer losses in Week 11 or later. The others: Chiefs (9-0) vs. Broncos (8-1) in 2013, Packers (10-1) vs. Cowboys (10-1) in 2007, Giants (10-1) vs. 49ers (10-1) in 1990 and Colts (9-1) vs. Broncos (9-1) in 1977.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jim Reineking on Twitter @jimreineking.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

(AP Photo/Michael Owen Baker) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jalen Hill's career night on the boards helped UCLA avoid a big upset.\n\nHill had 20 rebounds to lead UCLA to an 80-65 win over Presbyterian College on Monday night.\n\n\"Of course I knew, I was the one who was going to get them\" Hill said of how many rebounds he had. \"It was about activity. I do what I do for my team and stay in my role. That's what I did.\"\n\nJaylen Hands had 19 points for the 17th-ranked Bruins (4-0), who had to fend off a rally by the Blue Hose (3-3) before pulling away. UCLA built a 24-point lead early in the second half, but saw it dwindle to three points. UCLA's 21 turnovers didn't help matters.\n\n\"I thought that was as careless as we've been since we started the season,\" UCLA coach Steve Alford said. \"Our turnovers were extremely careless and that hurt our defense.\"\n\nPresbyterian College outscored UCLA 39-20 over the first 12:20 of the second half to cut UCLA's lead to 61-58. That was as close as Presbyterian would get as UCLA answered with a 12-2 run to put the game away.\n\n\"I think it was a little bit of Coach getting on our (behind) and a little bit of our pride,\" UCLA guard Kris Wilkes said. \"It was like our pride got taken away a little bit by them coming in and making that run, period. The first group didn't do too great and the second group fell right in behind us. We have to play for 40 minutes.\"\n\nHill helped the Bruins cause by pulling down so many rebounds, including seven on the offensive end.\n\n\"Proud of J-Hill,\" Alford said. \"Thought he had a tremendous night. Not only did he get 20 rebounds but had three assists, no turnovers, got a blocked shot, got a steal, made 5 of 6 free throws. Loved his activity. That's the motor we've got to have from J. He was a huge bright spot tonight.\"\n\nBruins freshman Moses Brown made the first basket of the game a good one with a slam dunk. Brown, the 7-foot-1 center who became the first freshman to record double-doubles in each of his first three games, was back at it Monday but fell three rebounds shy of a double double. He had an assortment of dunks, including an alleyoop dunk after a long crosscourt pass from Hands.\n\nAdam Flagler led Presbyterian College with a game-high 29 points.\n\n\"To play against basketball royalty in UCLA and in a historic venue like Pauley Pavilion was special for our program,\" Presbyterian coach Dustin Kerns said. \"UCLA is the biggest team in America and makes scoring and defending difficult. I was proud of our fight and (we) made it a one-possession game late in the game. We showed a lot of toughness and this made us better.\"\n\nRAINING THREES\n\nPresbyterian College missed 19 of 22 3-point attempts in the first half. The Blue Hose attempted 45 3-pointers and made 10 of 23 in the second half.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nPresbyterian College (S.C.): The Blue House played back-to-back Top 25 teams as it lost its previous game to Marquette, 74-55. Those experiences against two of the best teams in the country should bode well in Big South Conference action.\n\nUCLA: Is getting its newcomers plenty of experience and confidence, even if that playing time comes against teams that were outmatched. The Bruins also learned how to rally when its 22-point halftime lead was cut to 3.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPresbyterian: Hosts St. Francis (NY) on Nov. 28, following a holiday break.\n\nUCLA: Plays No. 11 Michigan State on Thursday in the Continental Tire Las Vegas Invitational.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And from now on, if I don't score in the next 20 (games) 5-on-5, I am not going to lose it. I am just going to stay patient and keep working hard.\"\n\nBryan Little, Mark Scheifele, Kyle Connor also scored for Winnipeg.\n\n\"He is really hard on himself and wants to get better at every aspect of his game,\" Little said of Laine. \"For him it's just staying positive and not being so hard on himself.\"\n\nElias Pettersson, Tyler Motte and Nikolay Goldobin scored for Vancouver, which lost its sixth straight game.\n\nConnor Hellebuyck stopped 22 shots for the Jets. Jacob Markstrom made 43 saves for the Canucks.\n\nThe Jets had 49 shots on goal, the most allowed by Vancouver in a game this season.\n\nBut Vancouver head coach Travis Green said he still saw positives in his team's performance, especially after going down 4-1 in the second period.\n\n\"We made a game of it,\" Green said. \"I didn't expect them to just lay down. We've talked about how we want to play. And part of how we want to play is when it's hard. When you're up against it a little bit, you've got to dig deep and play.\"\n\nWinnipeg opened the scoring just over a minute in after Markstrom tried to clear the puck along the boards. Little collected the puck at the point and hammered it in as Markstrom slid back into his net.\n\nThe Canucks responded with a power-play goal after Dustin Byfuglien was called for slashing.\n\nGoldobin sent a behind-the-back pass to defenseman Ben Hutton, who fed Pettersson. The Canucks' rookie fired a shot past Hellebuyck, tying the game.\n\nPettersson now has 12 goals in his first 17 NHL games.\n\nMarkstrom faced a barrage of 23 shots in the opening period, including a hard wrister from Nikolaj Ehlers that went off his blocker.\n\nThe rebound popped out to the side and Scheifele poked it in to give the Jets a 2-1 lead.\n\nWinnipeg added another first-period goal when Connor scored on a power play. Connor's point streak (four goals, three assists) is at five games.\n\nMidway through the second period, Pettersson and Hutton collided while trying to clear the puck from in front of the Vancouver net.\n\nLaine collected the puck and got off a quick wrist shot that sailed past Markstrom to make it 4-1 for the Jets.\n\nMotte got one back for the Canucks, scoring his second goal of the year on a short-handed breakaway.\n\nIt was Goldobin who brought Vancouver within one. The right-winger slid the puck across the crease, forcing Hellebuyck to sprawl, then tucked it into the net behind the netminder's skate.\n\nNOTES: Laine registered two goals in the third period for the sixth three-goal game of his career.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJets: At Calgary on Wednesday.\n\nCanucks: At Anaheim on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Fraser's boyfriend told WKYC that Fraser owned the home and rented it out to Mason's sister. Fraser was reportedly dropping off the couple's children when she was killed by Mason, who was allegedly waiting for her at the home.\n\nIn the 911 call, a woman who identifies herself as Mason\u2019s sister tells dispatch that Mason admitted to attacking his ex-wife.\n\n\"He said he stabbed her ... and she's dead,\" she can be heard saying on the call.\n\nFraser's body was found in the driveway, and sources tell WKYC that Mason apparently attempted suicide after her death.\n\nCourt documents say Mason drove his ex-wife's 2015 Audi SUV into a police cruiser while attempting to flee the scene, causing serious injuries to an officer's lower legs and ribs. He and Mason were both treated at a local hospital for their injuries.\n\nMason fled on foot and was later arrested. He has been charged with felonious assault for the events that followed his ex-wife's death, but charges related to Fraser's death have not been filed.\n\nThis undated photo provided by Ohio Department of Corrections shows Lance Mason. Mason, a former Cleveland-area judge who spent nine months in prison for beating his wife at the time is now a suspect in her stabbing death over the weekend and is likely to be charged, authorities said Monday, Nov. 19, 2018. (Ohio Department of Corrections via AP) ORG XMIT: CD201 (Photo: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, AP)\n\nMason pleaded guilty in 2015 to attempted felonious assault and domestic violence and served nine months in prison. Police say Mason punched his then-wife 20 times and slammed her head against a car dashboard five times as they drove with their children. Her injuries required reconstructive surgery. According to court documents, she sued him in civil court, and was awarded a $150,000 judgment.\n\nMason, who was also a former state representative and state senator, was removed from his judge's seat roughly a month after the August 2014 incident. His status as a convicted felon prohibits him from serving as an Ohio judge in the future, and the Ohio Supreme Court has also indefinitely prohibited him from practicing law.\n\nHowever, Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson hired Mason in 2017 to serve as the city\u2019s director of minority business administrator.\n\nFraser was the niece of well-known motivational speaker George C. Fraser who, in a statement to WKYC, called her \u201ca young lady who was loved, gracious, and a community servant.\" She was a sixth-grade teacher at Woodbury Elementary School in Shaker Heights, and her two daughters with Mason both attend the school system.\n\nThe Shaker Heights School District closed all of its buildings Monday and Tuesday to make grief counselors available to students and staff.\n\nThe local teachers' association held a candlelight vigil to honor Fraser at Woodbury Elementary on Monday and set up a GoFundMe page in her honor.\n\nInterim Superintendent Stephen M. Wilkins called the loss of Fraser \"tragic.\"\n\n\"She touched so many of our children\u2019s lives and will be deeply missed,\" Wilkins said in a statement. \"Her loss is unexpected and the impact of this news on our entire school community is unimaginable and profound.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/19/former-ohio-judge-beat-ex-wife-accused-stabbing-death/2063674002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Duke rolls over San Diego State 90-64 in Maui Invitational", "description": "Top 25 Capsules", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/11/20/duke-rolls-over-san-diego-state-90-64-in-maui-invitational/38570009/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e741621086400e475485d80bfc8b28451e6c6822/c=0-698-2030-1840/local/-/media/2018/11/20/USATODAY/usatsports/4a93f67993564d4fa6e40494706d5434.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:51:14Z", "content": "Duke forward RJ Barrett (5) looks for net over San Diego State during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Maui Invitational, Monday, Nov. 19, 2018, in Lahaina, Hawaii.

(AP Photo/Steve Yeater) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Kings sprinted out to a big lead and used their up-and-down style to put Oklahoma City on its heels. Then they got a big lift from Buddy Hield's perimeter shooting to finish off the Thunder.\n\nDave Joerger also got a bit of love from the Golden1 Center crowd after reports surfaced over the weekend that the Sacramento coach was at odds with management over the direction of the team.\n\nHield made three consecutive 3-pointers late in the fourth quarter and scored 25 points, Marvin Bagley III had his first career double-double and the Kings beat the Thunder 117-113 on Monday night to spoil Russell Westbrook's return.\n\n\"We're a hard-playing team and that's what our reputation going around the league is,\" Joerger said. \"In the first half we played maybe as fast as we've played since at Miami (on Oct. 29). We like to play that fast but we got tired. But we kept at it and kept battling.\"\n\nIman Shumpert scored 21 of his 23 points in the first half, Bogdan Bogdanovic added 16 points and the Kings beat the Thunder for the second time this season. Bagley, the second overall pick in the draft, had 15 points and 13 rebounds, while De'Aaron Fox had 13 assists.\n\nWestbrook had 29 points and 13 assists in his first game back in Billy Donovan's lineup since Nov. 5. The seven-time All-Star had missed five games with a left ankle sprain, then left the team Saturday to welcome the birth of twin daughters that same night. He flew to Sacramento and rejoined the Thunder on Monday morning.\n\n\"They were coming at us with their pace and we were kind of always backpedaling,\" Donovan said. \"We were never able to generate any force coming back.\"\n\nThe Kings blew a 19-point lead and were up 98-96 when Hield went on a tear from the perimeter. His first 3 extended the lead to 101-96. After Jerami Grant's floater for the Thunder, Hield made back-to-back shots beyond the arc.\n\nOklahoma City cut the gap to 115-113 on Paul George's fourth 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds remaining. Fox then made a pair of free throws to seal it for Sacramento.\n\n\"Right spots, right time,\" Hield said. \"Just trying to pick spots where I could read the defense and the stuff they were giving up.\"\n\nGeorge added 27 points and nine rebounds. Steven Adams had 11 points and 15 rebounds for Oklahoma City, which had been an NBA-best 10-1 over its previous 11 games.\n\n\"We didn't shoot well,\" George said. \"They sped the game up. We were winning at one point and we didn't finish this game out.\"\n\nThings got chippy early in the third quarter after Willie Cauley-Stein was fouled hard from behind by Westbrook while going for a layup. As he was going out of bounds Cauley-Stein appeared to shove Westbrook, who stumbled back before going after the Kings' 7-foot center. Adams intervened and grabbed Cauley-Stein, who then shoved Adams while the two were underneath the basket.\n\nCauley-Stein and Adams were called for offsetting technical fouls.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nThunder: Terrance Ferguson missed his second straight game for personal reasons. No timetable has been given for his return. ... Nerlens Noel sat out with an illness.\n\nKings: Sacramento was held to a season-low 15 points in the third quarter. The previous low was 17 against Miami on Oct. 29. The Kings had 10 assists on 15 buckets in the first quarter. ... Shumpert had 26 points in the Kings' 131-120 win over the Thunder in Oklahoma on Oct. 21. ... Kosta Koufos sat out a fourth consecutive game with right calf soreness.\n\nVOCAL SUPPORT\n\nJoerger received a standing ovation from the crowd of 16,250 during pregame introductions. Joerger was the subject of a story by Yahoo Sports that suggested the coach was in hot water with Kings management over his handling of the team's younger players, specifically Bagley, who has come off the bench in all 17 games this season.\n\n\"I love it here,\" Joerger said. \"Listening to the ovation tonight, that was really cool. I appreciated the pregame.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThunder: Play at Golden State on Wednesday.\n\nKings: Play at Utah at Wednesday.\n\n__\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez)\n\nUpdated: After actor James Woods used his Twitter account to call attention to a veteran who sent a distressed tweet, authorities located the man who had tweeted he was contemplating death by suicide.\n\n\"After numerous attempts to locate (Andrew) MacMasters yesterday, several of our officers were able to make contact with him to verify his well-being as well as ensuring that the appropriate resources were made available to him in reference to his tweet,\" Maitland (Fla.) Police Department Lieutenant Louis Y. Grindle told USA TODAY.\n\nThe \"Salvador\" actor, 71, alerted the Orlando Police Department Monday night and asked authorities to perform a wellness check on MacMasters, a former Marine.\n\n\"A man named Andrew MacMasters just said on @Twitter that he is sitting in a parking lot and is going to kill himself,\" Wood tweeted to his nearly 2 million followers. \"He\u2019s sitting with his dog, a black lab, possibly in a WalMart parking lot.\"\n\nWoods' plea for help included a screenshot from MacMasters' Twitter account, which has since been deleted.\n\n\"I'm on Twitter every day, I retweet all the time but this is the first tweet I've ever written,\" user @macmasters_a tweeted Thursday. \"I'm (a) good guy, I'm a veteran, I love America. I'm gonna kill myself tonight. I've lost everything I have nobody, nobody cares.\"\n\nHello, @OrlandoPolice. A man named Andrew MacMasters just said on @Twitter that he is sitting in a parking lot and is going to kill himself. He\u2019s sitting with his dog, a black lab, possibly in a WalMart parking lot. Can you do a #WelfareCheck? He is a Marine Vet. His tweet: pic.twitter.com/8DwqWVVkhC \u2014 James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 20, 2018\n\nWoods responded to MacMasters' cry for help in a series of tweets, initially asking the veteran to \"tell me where you are.\"\n\n\"We can talk. I don\u2019t care what anybody thinks. Do you? Let\u2019s have a conversation. Just you\u2026 and I,\" Woods said in one tweet to MacMasters, adding in another, \"I\u2019m following you now, so you can DM me. We can talk privately. Or we can talk openly right here. Lot of people worried about you right now.\"\n\nThe actor tried to engage the distraught veteran: \"Someone said you\u2019re Andrew. In Orlando? Im not trying to trap you. Let\u2019s just talk. You also have your dog. Your little schnoot. Boy or girl?\"\n\nSo think about this. A lot of vets, I understand, have come to where you are tonight. If you could just push this decision off tonight, at least, maybe you would also inspire another vet to seek help. You could save another man, too. By waiting to do this. https://t.co/L5NiEbQv5j \u2014 James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 20, 2018\n\n\"So think about this. A lot of vets, I understand, have come to where you are tonight,\" Woods continued. \"If you could just push this decision off tonight, at least, maybe you would also inspire another vet to seek help. You could save another man, too. By waiting to do this.\"\n\nIn 2016, the most recent data available, the Department of Veterans Affairs said about 20 veterans a day take their own lives, a suicide rate 1.5 times greater than Americans who never served in the military. And veterans accounted for 14 percent of all adult suicide deaths in the U.S. in 2016, even though only 8 percent of the population has served.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, the actor tried to comfort MacMasters. \"I\u2019m driving cross country. Sitting in a motel room. I have all night. I know that sounds dorky, but here I am! I would love to talk. Just talk. I won\u2019t push you into anything,\" he said.\n\nSo I\u2019m see that Andrew\u2019s tweet has been deleted. Andrew, don\u2019t feel embarrassed that you reached out in the darkness. Nobody thinks you\u2019re foolish for that. You know every one of us reaching out to you right now has some depression, too. I\u2019ll say it. I do. \u2014 James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 20, 2018\n\nOnce it was clear the suicidal veteran could no longer be reached on Twitter after deleting his social media account, Woods turned to his followers to gather information on MacMasters' location.\n\nThe \"Casino\" actor learned his home address and forward it to authorities in Maitland, Florida, who promptly checked his residence. MacMasters was not there.\n\nOkay. Just talked to Maitland Police. The dispatch supervisor there was terrific. He\u2019s confident they will find him. I gave Billy, the dispatcher, Andrew\u2019s home address and the info a reliable source DMed me. They are all over this. \u2014 James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 20, 2018\n\n\"If only Andrew could see the THOUSANDS of fellow Americans who are pulling for him. It\u2019s like he\u2019s lost behind enemy lines and we are cheering him home, willing him to survive,\" Woods tweeted. \"Andrew, do this for the 'other 21' vets a day who don\u2019t make it home from the darkness. Stay alive!\"\n\nWoods continued to update the search on Twitter, sharing tweets from people who notified MacMasters' family, including the veteran's mother and brother.\n\nIf only Andrew could see the THOUSANDS of fellow Americans who are pulling for him. It\u2019s like he\u2019s lost behind enemy lines and we are cheering him home, willing him to survive.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Even before the fourth lead change of the fourth quarter, well before the 1,001st yard of combined offense was tallied, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Rams already knew this was a classic.\n\nTwo powerhouse NFL teams at the peak of their brilliance dueled deep into the night at an ecstatic Coliseum, racking up eye-popping numbers that stretched the box score and credulity.\n\nThere were 14 touchdowns, including three by defensive players. There were 56 first downs. There were 105 points, with 50 from each team \u2014 the first time that's ever happened in an NFL game.\n\nIn the final moments, the Rams did just enough to leave with a win they'll savor for years.\n\nAnd if these teams meet again at the Super Bowl in 2 1/2 months, the Chiefs will remember the sting from coming up just short.\n\nJared Goff threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Everett for the go-ahead score with 1:49 to play, and the Rams outlasted the Chiefs for a 54-51 victory Monday night in a showdown that somehow surpassed the hype.\n\n\"It was a crazy game, crazy game,\" said Goff, who passed for 413 yards and four touchdowns and even ran for another score . \"It seemed like whoever had the ball at the end was going to win the game. There was times where we felt like we were going to put the knife in and finish them, and there were times where it was the other way around, where we had to claw back into it.\"\n\nPatrick Mahomes passed for a career-high 478 yards with six touchdown passes in his latest jaw-dropping effort for the Chiefs (9-2), but he also threw two interceptions in the final 1:18 as the Rams (10-1) claimed the highest-scoring Monday night game ever played.\n\nThe highest-scoring game in the league this season was an offensive fantasia of ingenious scheming from mastermind coaches Andy Reid and Sean McVay \u2014 along with 21 combined penalties to keep things interesting. The second half was an extended thriller featuring 59 combined points.\n\nBoth teams scratched out fourth-quarter leads, only to see them evaporate. Mahomes hit Tyreek Hill with a 73-yard TD pass just when the Rams appeared to be pulling away early in the fourth, and Goff replied with two late TD passes to Everett , a backup tight end with 31 career catches before this game.\n\n\"It was a whirlwind,\" McVay said. \"I feel like I might need a couple of beverages to relax tonight, but it was great. This is what you love so much about the game.\"\n\nAnd this game was ultimately decided by defense: Marcus Peters and Lamarcus Joyner came up with late interceptions as the Rams stopped Mahomes' final efforts.\n\n\"It's always fun to play against real good teams,\" Mahomes said. \"You get to go out there and have fun ... (but) it's the same as when we played New England. You can't make mistakes against great teams. You need to limit your mistakes, but be aggressive.\"\n\nThe Coliseum's first Monday night game since 1985 was staged on short notice after the NFL moved the matchup from Mexico City to Los Angeles six days ago due to poor field conditions at Azteca Stadium. The Rams used the opportunity to give free tickets to thousands of first responders and families recovering from the dual tragedies of nearby wildfires and a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks.\n\nThose fans got an incredible treat for their reward \u2014 and if the video-game-like spectacle they saw turns out to be a Super Bowl preview, Atlanta will get an All-Madden-level show as well.\n\n\"It was just cool,\" said Todd Gurley, whose 13-game touchdown streak somehow ended in this offensive showcase. \"It was a last-minute game and everybody (came) out in support. Had the families here, had the responders, so it was just a great overall crowd and it was good for the city.\"\n\nThis game has loomed in capital letters on the NFL's regular-season schedule ever since these teams confirmed their status as offensive powerhouses in September. The Rams and Chiefs are the league's biggest favorites along with New Orleans and New England \u2014 the teams responsible for the only other losses by Los Angeles and Kansas City this season.\n\nMahomes had the most prolific passing game in the NFL this year, but he and Goff both made key mistakes.\n\nRams linebacker Samson Ebukam returned Mahomes' fumble and a one-armed interception for the first two TDs of his NFL career, while Kansas City's Allen Bailey returned Goff's fumble for a go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"It was electric,\" Ebukam said. \"It's hard to describe, because I'm still like in a game mode right now. I haven't calmed down yet, so it hasn't really all sunk in yet.\"\n\nBIG FINISH\n\nThe final seven minutes were particularly frantic and sweet: After Chris Conley caught his second TD pass from Mahomes for a 51-47 lead with 2:47 to play, Goff replied with a 75-yard TD drive in 58 seconds, hitting Everett down the Rams' frenzied sideline.\n\nPeters \u2014 the former Pro Bowl cornerback traded by Kansas City to Los Angeles last winter \u2014 then intercepted Mahomes' underthrown ball near midfield with 1:18 to play, but the Rams only managed to take 14 seconds off the clock on their next three plays.\n\nThe Coliseum roiled in anticipation of a big finish by Mahomes, but the Chiefs were pushed back to their 13 with 50 seconds left thanks to a booming punt by Johnny Hekker. Joyner intercepted Mahomes' final desperate heave with 13 seconds left.\n\n\"We can learn from this,\" Reid said. \"We can't give up 21 points on turnovers. Have to take care of the football. We created some turnovers and points, (but had) too many penalties. We'll heal up and get set to go for the stretch run.\"\n\nTIMELY DEFENSE\n\nFor all the offensive brilliance on display, both defenses made game-changing plays as well.\n\nAaron Donald forced two fumbles while sacking Mahomes, and Ebukam returned the first for a TD in the second quarter. The Rams' unsung outside linebacker then made a spectacular one-armed interception at the line of scrimmage in the third quarter before returning it 25 yards for a score, powering over Mahomes to reach the end zone.\n\nINJURIES\n\nChiefs: WR Sammy Watkins had one catch for 4 yards against his former team after missing last week's game with a foot injury.\n\nRams: CB Troy Hill, WR Brandin Cooks and Peters all went to the locker room early in the second half with cramps. They all returned.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nChiefs: Bye week, followed by a trip to Oakland on Dec. 2.\n\nRams: Bye week, followed by a trip to Detroit on Dec. 2.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 Instant classic.\n\nThat sums up the much-hyped Monday night matchup that, well, lived up to the hype as the Los Angeles Rams outscored the Kansas City Chiefs 54-51 in undoubtedly the most wildly entertaining NFL offensive explosion ever staged at the historic Los Angeles Coliseum.\n\n\u201cIt was a whirlwind,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay concluded after participating in the first game in NFL history when both teams topped 50 points. \u201cI feel like I might need a couple of beverages to relax.\u201d\n\nThis, folks, is what the NFL wants you to see.\n\nIt was like Arena Football met a Madden video game. Fourteen touchdowns. A combined 1,001 yards. A whopping 105 points, the most in \"Monday Night Football\" history and third-highest total in any game. Eight lead changes \u2013 four in the fourth quarter. And two spectacular 400-yard passers \u2013 Patrick Mahomes and Jared Goff \u2013 left standing at the end.\n\nMahomes threw for six touchdowns and 478 yards \u2026 and it still wasn\u2019t enough. Not with three interceptions, including a pick-six, and two lost fumbles.\n\n\u201cIt sucks right now,\u201d Mahomes said.\n\nThen again, despite the turnovers, he still had a chance to win.\n\nGoff, though, fired a 40-yard TD strike to Gerald Everett with 1:49 remaining \u2013 his fourth scoring pass \u2013 to provide the winning points.\n\nAnd even that wasn\u2019t a sure thing until the end.\n\nMahomes had two final chances to rally the Chiefs in the final two minutes, but each drive ended with interceptions on deep throws downfield. Marcus Peters intercepted Mahomes with 1:28 left, then Lamarcus Joyner sealed the outcome with a pick with 13 seconds remaining.\n\nThe result keeps the Rams (10-1) with the NFC\u2019s best record, while the Chiefs (9-2) remain atop the AFC race to claim a No. 1 playoff seed.\n\n\u201cWe can learn from this,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great experience, two heavyweights going against each other. You obviously can\u2019t give up 21 points when you\u2019re in a game like this, and we did that on turnovers. You\u2019ve got to take care of the football.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping that you bet the \u201cover.\u201d\n\nShoot, the over/under projection of 64 points was eclipsed way back in the third quarter.\n\nAnd when one of those high-flying offenses didn\u2019t convert on third down, it just seemed plain weird.\n\nSo, too, was the fact that a defensive player, Rams linebacker Samson Ebukam, scored two touchdowns \u2013 one on an 11-yard fumble-return and the other on a 25-yard interception runback \u2013 in a game dominated by offense.\n\nKansas City\u2019s defense got on the scoreboard, too. Allen Bailey snagged a Goff fumble, forced by Justin Houston, and walked in for a 2-yard TD return early in the fourth quarter that put the Chiefs back in front, 44-40.\n\nOf course, that wasn\u2019t enough, either, as it provided another lesson.\n\nAs Chiefs linebacker Dee Ford put it, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to score a couple more times on defense.\u201d\n\nThree other things we learned or confirmed:\n\n1. Mahomes is unflappable\n\nWhenever it seemed like the Chiefs\u2019 young gunslinger was poised to crack, he came back for more. Both times when Mahomes lost fumbles on strip-sacks, then again after throwing a pick-six, he responded by leading Kansas City on touchdown drives. And that was just one reflection of his resilience as the Chiefs trailed 13-0 early, then opened the fourth quarter in a 40-30 hole.\n\n2. The \"all-star\" officiating crew clearly wanted a shootout\n\nThe ridiculous penalties against Kansas City defensive backs early in the game \u2013 especially a shoulder-to-shoulder unnecessary roughness call on an incompletion before the game\u2019s first touchdown \u2013 set the tone. And the flags weren\u2019t exactly flying both ways. By the end of the first quarter, the Chiefs were stung for 82 yards.\n\nNot that some of the penalties weren\u2019t deserved. But nor was the blatant miss of an incompletion to Tyler Higbee early in the third quarter \u2013 the ball bounced off the turf and into the hands of the Rams tight end as he rolled over during a fall \u2013 that boosted a go-ahead TD drive.\n\n3. You can only hope to contain Aaron Donald\n\nThe Rams\u2019 monster defensive tackle left his fingerprints all over the game \u2013 and Mahomes \u2013 while demonstrating how tough it will be for Khalil Mack to prevent him for repeating as the NFL\u2019s defensive player of the year. Yes, there was some defense sprinkled within the offensive smorgasbord. After drawing a couple of holding penalties, No. 99 produced his first strip-sack of the game late in the second quarter to produce instant points. Ebukam picked up the loose football for an 11-yard walk-in TD return. Early in the third quarter, Donald smashed into Mahomes for a 16-yard sack-and-swat, recovered by linemate John Franklin-Myers to jump-start another TD drive."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Freshmen lead Oral Roberts over Ecclesia College 109-72", "description": "D.J.

(AP Photo/Steve Conner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Louisville is fast building a reputation for its bursts to start the third quarter. And Monday night, the Cardinals needed one in the worst way after slogging through the first half.\n\nHolding a 31-28 tenuous halftime lead, the fifth-ranked Cardinals utilized a 17-3 third-quarter run to race past Boise State 74-55.\n\n\"In the first half, we were just standing around and watching,\" Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. \"But the first play of the second half for us started on a breakaway for a layup. And that was the first time in the game our whole team ran the floor.\"\n\nFor Louisville (3-0), that was the spark required to squelch any ideas Boise State had for an upset.\n\n\"We weren't getting any movement or spacing on the court,\" said Louisville's returning All-American Asia Durr, who finished with a game-high 20 points. \"Coach called a timeout and we got a few shots off after that. Overall, this wasn't one of our better games, but we gutted it out.\"\n\nBoise State (3-1), which lost to Louisville 74-42 in the first round of the NCAA tournament in March, matched the Cardinals early, but struggled to keep pace with Louisville's up-tempo game in the second half.\n\nDurr and Arica Carter, who finished with 16 points, combined for a lethal spark in the third quarter to all but put the game away.\n\n\"Asia played well and Arica hit some big shots there and separated us from them,\" Walz said. \"And we're going to continue to need that.\"\n\nLouisville shot 34.5 percent from the floor in the first half, before hitting 55 percent of its shots in the second half, including 63 percent from 3-point range. The Cardinals also outrebounded Boise State 37-29.\n\nBraydey Hodgins and Riley Lupfer scored 12 and 11 points, respectively, to lead Boise State.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nWhile the start of the third quarter helped Louisville put the game away, Boise State coach Gordy Presnell saw the wheels fall off about 90 seconds earlier.\n\nAfter Hodgins hit a 3-pointer to put Boise State ahead 28-24 with 1:37 remaining before halftime, Louisville closed out the quarter on a 7-0 run.\n\n\"That really took the wind out of our sails right before halftime,\" Presnell said.\n\nBIG BLOW\n\nEarly in the second quarter, Louisville starting guard Jazmine Jones landed hard on her hip on a play underneath the basket and never returned. She tallied six points in her first eight minutes on the court.\n\nAfter the game, Walz said he was unsure the extent of her injury but said she would be evaluated further on Tuesday.\n\n\"We really need her,\" Walz said. \"Jazmine was being a difference maker for us on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLouisville: Walz's focus on getting his team more battled tested early is paying early dividends. The Cardinals chose to play two of their first three games against NCAA Tournament participants from last season. Louisville passed with flying colors. But it doesn't get any easier with two more NCAA tourney teams on the schedule this month.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos won the Mountain West last season and were picked to do so again. Despite the loss, Boise State should gain even more confidence heading into conference play later this season after going toe-to-toe with Louisville.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisville: After opening with three games on the road, the Cardinals will be in Las Vegas against Arizona State on Friday for the Southpoint Shootout.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos leave home for the first time this season, traveling to Long Beach, Calif., for the Beach Classic to face Idaho.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: CESARE ABBATE, EPA-EFE)\n\nROME \u2013 Archaeologists have found a fresco in an ancient Pompeii bedroom that depicts a sensual scene of the Roman god Jupiter, disguised as a swan, and a legendary queen of Sparta from Greek mythology.\n\nThe figure of Leda being impregnated by the god in swan form was a fairly common home decoration theme in Pompeii and Herculaneum, another town destroyed in A.D. 79 by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius near present-day Naples.\n\nBut Pompeii archaeological park director Massimo Osanna praised this fresco as exceptional since it was painted to make it appear Leda was looking at whoever saw the fresco upon entering the bedroom.\n\n\"Leda watches the spectator with a sensuality that's absolutely pronounced,\" Osanna told Italian news agency ANSA.\n\nMore: Inside an ancient forest: Surrounded by 4,000-year-old trees in VR\n\nMore: Earliest cave paintings of animal discovered in Indonesia, dating back 40,000 years\n\nThe fresco's details include a depiction of Leda protecting the swan with her cloak as the bird sits on her lap.\n\nOsanna noted the fresco's context of the Greek \"myth of love, with an explicit sensuality in a bedroom where, obviously beside sleep, there could be other activities.\"\n\nThe fresco, with its colors still remarkably vivid, was discovered Friday during ongoing work to consolidate the ancient city's structures after rains and wear-and-tear in past years caused some ruins to collapse, the tourist site's officials said.\n\nThe bedroom is located near a corridor by the entranceway of an upscale domus, or home, where another splendid fresco was discovered earlier this year, said the archaeological park, which is part of the Italian Culture Ministry.\n\nLeda is an important figure in Greek mythology. She was said to have borne children fathered by the god Zeus, the Greek version of Jupiter, and by a mortal king of Sparta. According to myth, her children included the beautiful Helen of Troy and the twins Castor and Pollux.\n\nOsanna said one hypothesis is that the home's owner was a rich merchant who wanted to give the impression he was culturally advanced by incorporating myth-inspired frescoes. It appeared the artist was inspired by a 4th century B.C. sculpture by Timotheos, he said.\n\nBecause of safety concerns, unexcavated parts of the domus will probably remain that way, ANSA said. Archaeologists are considering removing both frescos found in the home to a place where \"they can be protected and shown to the public,\" Osanna was quoted as saying.\n\nPompeii's sprawling, partially excavated grounds are one of Italy's top tourist attractions.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/19/archaeologists-discover-sensual-fresco-ancient-pompeii-bedroom/2063114002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "David Kender, Reviewed.com", "title": "Black Friday deals on the most popular toys: Pomsies, Sony PlayStation Classic, Legos", "description": "Black Friday deals on the most popular toys", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2018/11/19/black-friday-2018-deals-most-popular-kids-toys-pomsies-sony-playstation-classic-legos-and-more/2063427002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.myfoxzone.com/assets/GANNETT/images/af2535d3-3372-45c9-a556-27b6a62888f9/af2535d3-3372-45c9-a556-27b6a62888f9_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T04:20:26Z", "content": "\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

(AP) \u2014 Pekka Rinne continued his dominance over Tampa Bay and tied a record with one of his boyhood heroes in the process.\n\nRyan Johansen had a goal and an assist, Rinne stopped 29 shots, and the Nashville Predators beat the Lightning 3-2 on Monday night.\n\nIt was Rinne's 319th victory, tying him with Miikka Kiprusoff for most NHL wins by a Finnish-born goaltender.\n\n\"For sure it's a cool thing,\" he said. \"Kiprusoff is one of my heroes for sure. I got to play against him and things like that, but when I was a teenager growing up, I looked up to him. To me, he's the greatest Finnish goalie. It's pretty cool that I'm tied with him.\"\n\nRinne improved to 9-0-1 in his career against the Lightning. His best save came on Brayden Point's breakaway in the first period. He also denied J.T. Miller and Victor Hedman in an 11-second span late in the second after the Predators were hemmed in their zone for a prolonged period of time following an icing.\n\nKyle Turris and Filip Forsberg also scored for Nashville, which has won two straight.\n\n\"We know that they're one of the top teams in the league, and it ended up being a good game, a good matchup,\" Nashville coach Peter Laviolette said.\n\nHedman and Nikita Kucherov had the goals for Tampa Bay, which snapped its two-game winning streak. Louis Domingue finished with 31 saves.\n\nForsberg gave the Predators a 2-1 lead at 6:43 of the second. Skating into the Lightning zone on the right side,\n\nMattias Ekholm left a drop pass for his Swedish countryman just inside the blue line. Forsberg skated to the left faceoff dot and snapped a quick wrist shot high to Domingue's glove side.\n\n\"We have to have better starts,\" Lightning forward Alex Killorn said. \"We haven't had great starts as of late. If we can do that, it will be a much different game for us.\"\n\nJohansen made it 3-1 at 10:16 of the second when he tipped Craig Smith's wrist shot from the right side over Domingue's stick.\n\n\"I think for a fan, tonight's game was awesome,\" Johansen said. \"They got to see two of the top teams in the league right now going toe to toe. We did a lot of good things. They did good things. Ultimately, we found a way to get the win done.\"\n\nLate in the second, Killorn had an apparent goal disallowed as he was sent to the penalty box for tripping Nashville defenseman Ryan Ellis.\n\n\"They dictated the pace in the first half, and we dictated in the second half,\" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. \"We both scored three, one was called back. That was the ultimate difference in the game.\"\n\nKucherov pulled the Lightning within one at 3:25 of the third. Point carried the puck in on the right side and found Kucherov skating through the slot, where he made a move on Rinne before beating him with a backhand.\n\nRinne gloved down another attempt by Kucherov all alone in front with 7:31 left in the third to preserve the Nashville lead.\n\nIn the final seconds of the third, Ekholm pulled a puck off of the goal line after Hedman's shot hit Rinne and trickled behind the Finnish netminder toward the goal line.\n\nHedman scored the game's first goal at 5:10 of the opening period. Carrying the puck into the Nashville zone on the left side, Hedman pulled up at the top of the left faceoff circle and ripped a slap shot over Rinne's glove.\n\nTurris tied it with 4:41 left in the first. Tampa Bay killed of 53 seconds of a Predators two-man advantage, but with just 3 seconds remaining in the second penalty, Turris beat Domingue with a slap shot from the right faceoff dot just inside the near post.\n\nTurris has goals in back-to-back games.\n\nNOTES: Lightning D Erik Cernak picked up the secondary assist on Hedman's goal, registering his first career NHL point. ...

Although the SPLC lists them as a hate group, they have repeatedly denied any connection to the \u201calt-right.\u201d\n\nThe document, written by Commander Michael McCabe, states that the Proud Boys were \u201cpublically (sic) categorized as an extremist group by the FBI in 2018.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the report marks the first time the group has been publicly labelled as \u201cextremist\u201d by the FBI.\n\nMcCabe told the British newspaper that the FBI revealed the classification of the Proud Boys as an extremist group during an Aug. 2 briefing at Clark County\u2019s west precinct.\n\nAccording to the report, the FBI warned local law enforcement that the group is recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that they have \u201ccontributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.\u201d\n\nThe report was not intended to investigate the Proud Boys but rather the membership of a Clark County sheriff\u2019s deputy in the group.\n\nThe investigation found that Deputy Sheriff Erin Willey, who worked as a probationary deputy from June 2017 to June 2018, was active with the Proud Boy Girls, \u201can affiliate group of women who openly support the ideology of the Proud Boys.\u201d She was involved with the group from November 2016 to October 2017, but failed to disclose this information. Her association with the group came to light when The Columbian, a Washington daily newspaper, obtained photos of Willey wearing Proud Boy Girls apparel.\n\nHer affiliation with the group violated two of the sheriff\u2019s office's policies, including the non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy, and may have prevented her from passing the background check necessary to hold any law enforcement position, the report states.\n\nAfter Willey\u2019s firing, Clark County Sheriff Chuck Atkins released a statement: \u201cLaw enforcement officers are peacekeepers whose core mission is to protect and safeguard the community. My expectation is that my employees do not engage in activities or associations that undermine or diminish our role as peacekeepers.\u201d\n\nThe timeline constructed during the investigation found that the Proud Boys were not an \u201cofficial hate group\u201d at their inception, but rather gained attention as their membership grew.\n\nThe group found itself in the national spotlight when several members were arrested in connection with a street brawl after McInnes spoke at a New York Republican club in mid-October. Deputy Commissioner John Miller told the New York Times that the NYPD has opened a criminal investigation into the organization itself.\n\nShortly after the fight, McInnes and the group were banned from Facebook and Instagram because of policies against hate groups.\n\nThe FBI could not immediately be reached for comment but released a statement to the Guardian and other outlets saying while \u201cthe FBI does not and will not police ideology\u201d, the agency \u201cregularly assesses intelligence regarding possible threats and works closely to share that information with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/19/fbi-categorizes-proud-boys-extremist-documents-reveal/2063099002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Kristin Lam, USA TODAY", "title": "At least 1 dead, 3 injured in downtown Denver shooting, authorities say", "description": "1 dead, 3 injured in Denver shooting", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/19/multiple-people-shot-denver-hospital/2062184002/", "urlToImage": "https://media.krem.com/assets/GANNETT/images/1c55e026-ceae-42f6-aabc-639691fae38d/1c55e026-ceae-42f6-aabc-639691fae38d_1140x641.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T03:59:45Z", "content": "DENVER \u2014 One person was killed and four others injured in a shooting Monday afternoon in downtown Denver.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Teammates and friends in the minors, Los Angeles Kings rookies Calvin Peterson and Matt Luff pulled off NHL firsts in the same game.\n\nPeterson earned his first shutout and Luff scored his first goal, leading the Kings to a 2-0 victory over St. Louis on Monday night \u2014 hours before the scuffling Blues fired coach Mike Yeo.\n\n\"It's unreal,\" Luff said. \"We were talking when I gave him a hug on the ice about that. Couldn't have picked a better day for it to happen with him getting his first shutout. We talked about it on the plane. He's probably one of the best kids so I'm happy it happened for him.\"\n\nPeterson, making his third start for the Kings, stopped 29 shots. He is the 24th rookie goaltender to start a game for Los Angeles. In college at Notre Dame and in the minor leagues, Peterson had 20 shutouts.\n\n\"On the personal side, to get the shutout was very cool,\" Peterson said. \"And for Luffer to get his first (goal) was very cool, too. So it was an all-around great night.\"\n\nNot for the Blues.\n\nFollowing the team's latest defeat, St. Louis general manager Doug Armstrong named Craig Berube interim coach. At 7-9-3, the Blues are in last place in the Central Division, and their 17 points rank next-to-last in the NHL \u2014 ahead of only Los Angeles.\n\nThe 45-year-old Yeo joined the Blues as an assistant in 2016 after five seasons with Minnesota.\n\nThe Kings, last in the Pacific Division, had lost four of five before beating St. Louis in a game featuring teams with the worst records in the Western Conference.\n\nInterim coach Willie Desjardins said it was a good win for the Kings.\n\n\"They're hard to play against,\" Desjardins said. \"They had a few chances. I thought we played pretty good overall.\"\n\nThe Blues have lost four of their last five. This marked the third time they were shut out this season.\n\n\"It's hard to win if you don't score goals,\" Blues forward Vladimir Tarasenko said. \"I have no words. We're trying hard, maybe too hard. If we don't score, it's zero in every game and it's really frustrating.\"\n\nLos Angeles went up 1-0 at 8:18 of the second period. Luff, a 21-year-old right wing, scored his first goal on his sixth career shot when hit a wrister from the right circle. Adrian Kempe fed the wide-open Luff for the goal.\n\n\"It wasn't a perfect shot but luckily it went in,\" Luff said. \"I thought about it a little bit in the previous games. Tonight it was in my head just don't think about it. I kind of just blocked it out and shot my shot and it went in.\"\n\nAnze Kopitar added an empty-netter with 30 seconds left.\n\nThis was the first meeting this season between the teams. St. Louis won two of three last season and is 6-3-0 in the last nine matchups.\n\nBlues goalie Jake Allen faced 26 shots in falling to 5-3 in his career against the Kings. Allen was pulled with 1:45 to play but the Blues were unable to score.\n\n\"You can't win hockey games without scoring goals,\" Blues defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. \"This has to be a harder place to play.\"\n\nNOTES: St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Harrison Bader, accompanied by team mascot Fredbird, dropped the ceremonial first puck. ... Blues D Carl Gunnarsson and F Jaden Schwartz will be out through the weekend. Both sustained upper-body injuries in the Blues' 4-1 win at Vegas last Friday. ...

We keep playing. We keep fighting.\"\n\nHarrell had 25 points and 11 rebounds, Lou Williams added 16 points and a season-high 11 assists, and the Clippers rallied past the struggling Atlanta Hawks 127-119 on Monday night to win their fifth straight game.\n\nTobias Harris scored 24 points and Mike Scott had a season-high 18 on six 3-pointers for the Clippers, who erased a 15-point deficit in the second half for the second consecutive game.\n\nThe Clippers, playing without second-leading scorer Danilo Gallinari, improved to 11-5. At this point last season, after winning in Atlanta, they were 5-11.\n\nTrae Young scored 19 of his 25 points in the first half, and Taurean Prince had 21 points for the rebuilding Hawks, who dropped to 3-14 and have lost eight in a row.\n\n\"I know everybody in Atlanta wants us to win now,\" Young said. \"It's tough because we're right there. It's just that finish, and we're going to get it done.\"\n\nLos Angeles trailed 87-72 in the third quarter, but went on a 20-4 run to take a 97-96 lead early in the fourth. Young lost the ball on the Atlanta end, and Williams whipped a pass across the baseline to Scott for a 3 that prompted the Hawks to call a timeout.\n\nAtlanta quickly regrouped, taking the lead back when Prince, who missed the previous two games with an Achilles injury, dunked on the ensuing possession. A 3-pointer by Alex Len put the Hawks up by five.\n\nIt was all Los Angeles from there. Scott hit a 3 off an assist from Williams to give the Clippers the lead for good with 4:08 remaining. Williams fed Harrell for a strong reverse layup and a three-point play, and Harrell followed by knocking away Young's pass before Scott hit another 3 to make it 117-110.\n\nWilliams, in his 14th season and second with the Clippers, knows his younger teammates depend on him to set the tone as the leader off the bench.\n\n\"I've seen a lot in this league,\" he said. \"I have probably been in every single position that you could be in. Whether it's being almost an All-Star, starting or coming off the bench, I have a lot of experience, and when I talk, guys listen.\"\n\nGallinari was sick and unable to play for the first time this season. Avery Bradley started in his spot after missing the last six games with a left ankle sprain, finishing with five points in 20 minutes.\n\nThe Clippers have won seven of eight. Atlanta has dropped 12 of 13.\n\nHarris scored 12 points in the first period, but the Hawks were ahead by five entering the second. Young gave Atlanta its biggest lead at eight with a fast-break layup.\n\nLos Angeles went on a 15-3 run to take a 50-44 lead on Patrick Beverley's fast-break layup before the Hawks' 14-3 run put them up by seven on DeAndre' Bembry's free throws. Harris ended the first half with a long 3 that made it 64-61.\n\n\"We keep putting ourselves in holes, which is too dangerous,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \"This is a really fun team to coach.\"\n\nSOLID RETURN\n\nJohn Collins, in his second game back for Atlanta after missing the first 15 this season with a left ankle injury, had 18 points, six assists, three rebounds and five fouls in 21 minutes. Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce had Collins on a limit of playing in bursts of 3-4 minutes before coming out.\n\nHURTING\n\nHawks forward Omari Spellman started but left after four minutes with a bruised right hip.\n\nPOOR TIMING\n\nBeverley was called for a technical in the third after disputing a foul call with official Courtney Kirkland, and Atlanta scored the next 11 points to take an 87-72 lead. Early in the fourth while he was on the bench, Beverley and Rivers made gestures of disbelief that Kirkland called a foul on Scott even though Len had his arms around him. Beverley did not return to the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nClippers: Visit Washington on Tuesday.\n\nHawks: Host Toronto on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A stunned Ovechkin, who had already scored twice, applauded the save and even gave Price a low five.\n\n\"Maybe a lucky save, I don't know,\" said Ovechkin, grinning. \"Obviously it was a pretty cool play. It was a beautiful save. Fans were cheering for him and I was kind of the same.\"\n\nAdded Price, who made 29 saves in defeat: \"It's obviously pretty cool.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 As a contested layup by Pelicans guard Ian Clark caromed off the rim, Julius Randle barreled into the paint, grabbed the offensive rebound and quickly fired it to the perimeter, where Darius Miller caught it in rhythm and nailed a 3-pointer.\n\nIt was the kind of effective hustle play that Randle has been providing in bunches lately, just as the Pelicans hoped he would when they acquired him to help fill the void left by DeMarcus Cousins' departure in free agency.\n\nAnthony Davis had 29 points and nine rebounds, Randle added 21 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in 25 minutes, and New Orleans won its third straight with a 140-126 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night.\n\n\"I was just being aggressive. I was just playing hard. If I make mistakes, I don't really care. I just play through them,\" Randle said. \"When I play with that mindset, without thinking about anything else, I'm successful.\"\n\nRandle injected the Pelicans with the energy and play-making they needed from their top reserve. He had six of New Orleans' 14 offensive rebounds as New Orleans totaled 21 second-chance points. He also made nine of his 13 shots.\n\nPelicans guard Jrue Holiday said Randle has recently changed games with \"his motor, really. The way he's been decisive offensively. I feel like he's kind of like a bull down there.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Randle is also comfortable starting fast breaks with outlet passes or on the dribble after he comes down with rebounds, and Holiday credited his first-year teammate for making the right plays when he handles or distributes the ball, sets screens and rolls to the hoop.\n\n\"He's been doing everything,\" Holiday said.\n\nE'Twaun Moore scored 24 points and Holiday 21 for New Orleans, which shot nearly 58 percent (59 of 102). Nikola Mirotic hit three of four 3-point attempts and finished with 13 points, while second-year pro Frank Jackson, who because of injury did not make his debut until this season, scored 12 points\n\nDeMar DeRozan scored 21 points and Bryn Forbes added 20 for the Spurs, who defeated Golden State a night earlier but have now lost four of five. Dante Cunningham hit all five 3s he attempted and scored 19 points, but did not score in the second half. Rudy Gay added 17 points.\n\n\"As the game went on, their athleticism got to us,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"They played really well and were aggressive. They shot it well and they did a good job moving the ball and moving bodies. We just didn't have enough juice.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSpurs: Fell to 2-6 on the road. ... Marco Belinelli and Jakob Poeltl each scored 11, while LaMarcus Aldridge grabbed 10 rebounds. ... Attempted just six 3s in the second half, missing five. ... Committed 15 turnovers that led to 25 Pelicans points.\n\nPelicans: Randle now has six career triple-doubles. ... New Orleans improved to 8-1 at home, including 8-0 when Davis plays. ... Had 34 assists on 59 made field goals. ... Holiday had nine assists but also committed five of New Orleans' 11 turnovers.\n\nPIVOTAL RUNS\n\nSharp shooting from deep in the first half helped San Antonio build a 10-point lead. The Spurs hit 10 of their first 14 3-point shots, with Cunningham hitting all five he attempted in front of what used to be his home crowd. When Forbes hit his fourth 3 of the game, San Antonio led 60-51 with 4:28 still left in the second quarter.\n\nBut Randle's driving layup 10 seconds later marked the beginning of a game-turning 17-5 Pelicans run during the next 3 1/2 minutes.\n\nMoore hit a pair of 3s during the spurt, Randle added a follow shot while being fouled and Jackson converted a pair of transition layups, one a reverse as he was fouled.\n\nSan Antonio was still as close as 83-82 on Gay's fade in the third quarter. But New Orleans responded with seven straight points on Wesley Johnson's wing 3 and consecutive dunks by Davis, and the Pelicans methodically built a double-digit lead that got as large as 20.\n\nJACKON'S PROMISE\n\nJackson hasn't always been a regular in New Orleans' rotation this season, but that could change given his recent play.\n\n\"It's exciting to see somebody so young come out and have meaningful minutes, be able to hold his own,\" Holiday said. \"I feel like his confidence and the confidence from the coaches grow every single day.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSpurs: Host Memphis on Wednesday night.\n\nPelicans: Visit Philadelphia on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) \u2014 Hockey was almost secondary to the Florida Panthers and Ottawa Senators on Monday night.\n\nThe teams dealt with two separate delays that left a number of players shaken. The teams were sent to their dressing rooms with 3:37 remaining in the first period as first responders dealt with a medical emergency in the stands as a fan required CPR.\n\nThe time remaining in the period was played at the start of the second, but another delay ensued when Vincent Trochek twisted his right leg awkwardly and required a stretcher to be taken off the ice.\n\n\"This was one of the weirder games I've been involved in, it was very tough,\" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. \"We all knew they were trying to revive the gentleman, so nobody was thinking hockey there. Our prayers are definitely with the patient and the family.\"\n\nMike Hoffman scored and extended his point streak to 16 games in his return to Ottawa after being traded to Florida, and the Panthers topped the Senators 7-5.\n\nTroy Brouwer, Aleksander Barkov, Jared McCann, Evgenii Dadonov, Micheal Haley and Frank Vatrano also scored for Florida.\n\nHoffman, who has nine goals and 10 assists in the streak, admitted the goal was special.\n\n\"That was a big goal,\" Hoffman said. \"That I was able to do it made it that much more special to put the nail in the coffin. I was excited that I scored, but I guess other people aren't allowed to get excited if you get a goal.\"\n\nJuho Lammikko picked up four assists. James Reimer stopped 33 shots and the Panthers beat the Senators for the second time in eight days.\n\nMatt Duchene had a pair of goals for the Senators. Drake Batherson, Zack Smith and Brady Tkachuk also scored.\n\nCraig Anderson allowed six goals on 22 shots before being replaced by Mike McKenna. McKenna gave up one goal on nine shots.\n\nIt was a strange game in many ways. The first period was cut short due to a medical emergency in the stands. The remaining time was played at the start of the second, but a second delay ensued when Vincent Trochek twisted his right leg awkwardly and required a stretcher to be taken off the ice.\n\nTrailing 6-3, the Senators made things interesting as Smith and Tkachuk scored and cut the deficit to a single goal at the halfway mark of the third. Ottawa had two power-play opportunities, but were unable to capitalize.\n\n\"That's the one positive to come out of the game,\" Smith said. \"We didn't give up. It would have been easy to just coast through the third being down three goals, but we came in the room and we talked and we knew we could come back on these guys.\"\n\nSmith admitted it was difficult to get back into the game with the two medical emergencies.\n\n\"We tried our best, both teams, to put both incidents behind us and play a hockey game,\" Smith said. \"Those are two things you never want to see.\"\n\nThe Panthers made it 4-1 when Dadonov banged a puck over the goal line with 0.3 seconds remaining in what was the first period.\n\nOttawa cut the lead in half early in the second as Duchene scored his second of the game off a great feed from Batherson. Shortly after that, Batherson scored on the power play off a pass from Duchene, who has 15 points (six goals, nine assists) in his last seven games.\n\nHaley, playing in his first game of the season, and Vatrano also scored, ending Anderson's night.\n\n\"It wasn't pretty, but at the end it was a gutsy win and points we needed,\" said Haley.\n\nThe Senators opened the scoring as Duchene netted his ninth of the season early in the first, but the Panthers answered with three goals for a 3-1 lead in the shortened period.\n\nBrouwer tied the game on a one-timer from the side of the net. A power-play goal by Barkov gave the Panthers the lead, and McCann made it 3-1 midway through the period, scoring on a partial breakaway.\n\nNOTES: Christian Jaros returned to the Senators blue line after being a healthy scratch. Chris Wideman found himself the odd man out.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSenators: At Minnesota on Wednesday.\n\nPanthers: At Tampa Bay on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Brandon Dill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 While the rest of the NBA trends toward high-scoring, fast-paced offenses, the Memphis Grizzlies are relying on defense.\n\nAnd the longtime partnership of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol.\n\nConley scored 28 points, Gasol had 17 points and 15 rebounds, and the Grizzlies pulled away over Dallas 98-88 on Monday night to snap the Mavericks' four-game winning streak.\n\n\"In today's league, I think a lot of teams are so used to things being easy, nobody really wants to play defense,\" Conley said. \"Everybody wants to get up and down and shoot 3s. So, when they come upon a team that gets into you and is physical and actually plays defense, it's a different game for them.\"\n\nThis one had 17 lead changes and 15 ties before Memphis reeled off 10 straight points in the late stages for the biggest lead in the game for either team. Garrett Temple and Conley each converted 3-pointers in the stretch that gave Memphis the lead for good. The Mavericks' 88 points were not only a season low, but the first time this season Dallas didn't reach 100.\n\n\"That's what Memphis is all about,\" said guard Dennis Smith Jr., who led the Mavericks 19 points. \"They've been like that for years.\"\n\nNeither teams held a lead of more than six points until the final Memphis rally. Several Memphis players said their physical play can wear teams down, and at some point, cracks start showing in the opponents' play.\n\nAs it did in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I thought we played three tough, solid quarters,\" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \"And then the fourth, we had some breakdowns.\"\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. finished with 13 points and Temple added 12 as Memphis won its sixth in the last seven.\n\nDeAndre Jordan added 17 points and a season-high 20 rebounds. Luka Doncic had 15 points and 10 rebounds \u2014 the rookie's first double-double of his career \u2014 but was 6 of 20 from the field.\n\nThe main impact from the Memphis defense wasn't on turnovers \u2014 Dallas ended the game with 11 \u2014 but rather the Mavericks shooting a season-low 34 percent.\n\n\"We want to be a unique team \u2014 you see all these high, high scoring games \u2014 that holds teams to under 90 points. And grinds out wins,\" Temple said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nMavericks: Doncic was 0 of 6 in the first quarter before converting the first shot of the second quarter. ... Dallas made only four 3-pointers in the first half, including three by Dorian Finney-Smith. Doncic had the fourth one. ... Jordan has led Dallas in rebounding in all but one game this season (Harrison Barnes with 13 on Nov. 6 against Washington). ... The Maverick previous low in points for a game this season was in the season-opener when they scored 100 points in a loss to Phoenix\n\nGrizzlies: Conley converted a 4-point play in the closing seconds of the first half. ... Gasol had eight rebounds in the first quarter. His 15 for the game was a season-high. ... Gasol, who entered the game having made 12 of 25 3-pointers over the last three games, missed all five of his shots from outside the arc. ... Memphis won its 11th game of the season, halfway to last year's total of 22.\n\nSEE YOU COME SPRING TIME\n\nThe two teams will not meet again until March 2 at Dallas. Then the Southwest Division foes will play a back-to-back in April \u2014 in Dallas on April 5 and then in Memphis on April 7.\n\nCONLEY SHOOTING\n\nConley, coming off a season where a played only 12 games because of a season-ending heel injury, struggled shooting in the early stages this year as he got back into game shape. He has connected on 50 of 102 shots over his last six games. \"I sure hope you didn't think I was going to shoot like 10 percent for the rest of the year\" Conley said after the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMavericks: Host Brooklyn on Wednesday night.\n\nGrizzlies: Travel to San Antonio to face the Spurs on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Mfiondu Kabengele knew he was ready to make the jump from reserve to a major contributor this season.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 sophomore had a career night Monday, even doing it while coming off the bench.\n\nKabengele scored a career-high 18 points in 19 minutes as No. 14 Florida State warmed up after a seven-day layoff to put away Canisius 93-61 on Monday night. The nephew of former NBA All-Star center Dikembe Mutombo, Kabengele shot 6 of 12 from the floor and added six rebounds.\n\n\"Fi is a monster,\" Florida State guard M.J. Walker said. \"Those plays like that, his potential is crazy. It gave us momentum.\"\n\nWalker and Terance Mann added 12 points for Florida State, which opened 3-0 for a third straight season.\n\nBut the Seminoles needed Kabengele in the worst way as Canisius (1-1) closed the deficit in the second half. The Golden Griffins trailed most of the game but cut the lead to 47-41 with 14:12 left. Kabengele then came in the game and scored seven points in less than two minutes to put the Seminoles back up 58-41 with 12 minutes to go.\n\n\"My role on the team is to bring energy, crash the glass and be a post scorer,\" Kabengele said. \"So when I felt like we were playing very sluggish, I knew that I was going to come in eventually. So I mentally prepared myself. Make sure you provide energy so the guys can feed off it.\"\n\nMalik Johnson scored 20 points for Canisius (1-1), which had 13 first-half turnovers and finished the night with 19.\n\nTakal Molson and Isaiah Reese added 15 points apiece for Canisius, which shot 22 of 52 (42.3 percent). Canisius had multiple players in foul trouble and looked down the bench for help in the second half, turning to seldom-used Dantai St. Louis for 27 minutes.\n\n\"(He) played three total minutes last season,\" Canisius coach Reggie Witherspoon said. \"And he gave us great effort. But that's outside of your comfort zone.\"\n\nScott Hitchon was ejected for a flagrant foul after pushing Mann to the floor with 13:10 left in the game. Hitchon started but was in foul trouble and didn't have a point or a rebound.\n\nThe Seminoles shot 31 of 59 (52.5 percent) and also made 7 of 14 3-pointers.\n\nDEPTH OF THE ROSTER\n\nFlorida State scored 51 bench points, led by Koumadje's 18 and Devin Vassell's 10 points. All 11 Seminoles who played in the game scored. The win-by-committee approach that Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton favors was on full display as the team's leading scorer through two games, P.J. Savoy, took just two shots and had two points in 22 minutes.\n\n\"The guys who came in the game for them appeared to be jumping on a train or a bus that was already moving,\" Witherspoon said. \"Whoosh. Full-speed intensity.\"\n\nSTILL SIDELINED\n\nThe Seminoles have recorded three wins by double figures but the they are doing it without their leading scorer from last season, Phil Cofer. The senior forward suffered a preseason injury to his right foot and must wear a walking boot. He's not ready to return to practice, Hamilton said.\n\n\"I don't think he's anywhere close to being ready to play,\" Hamilton said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nCanisius: The Golden Griffins hung tough with Florida State for long stretches of the game but didn't have the depth. Johnson, Takal Molson (15 points) and Isaiah Reese (15 points) had 50 of Canisius' 61 points.\n\nFlorida State: The Seminoles looked good after a seven-day layoff, easily winning for the 33rd time in 35 home games since November 2016. The Canisius game is the first of five games in a 10-day stretch.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCanisius travels to Orlando to face Villanova as the Golden Griffins continue play in the AdvoCare Invitational.\n\nFlorida State continues play in the AdvoCare Invitational on Thursday against UAB in Orlando.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: CESARE ABBATE, EPA-EFE)\n\nROME \u2013 Archaeologists have found a fresco in an ancient Pompeii bedroom that depicts a sensual scene of the Roman god Jupiter, disguised as a swan, and a legendary queen of Sparta from Greek mythology.\n\nThe figure of Leda being impregnated by the god in swan form was a fairly common home decoration theme in Pompeii and Herculaneum, another town destroyed in A.D. 79 by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius near present-day Naples.\n\nBut Pompeii archaeological park director Massimo Osanna praised this fresco as exceptional since it was painted to make it appear Leda was looking at whoever saw the fresco upon entering the bedroom.\n\n\"Leda watches the spectator with a sensuality that's absolutely pronounced,\" Osanna told Italian news agency ANSA.\n\nMore: Inside an ancient forest: Surrounded by 4,000-year-old trees in VR\n\nMore: Earliest cave paintings of animal discovered in Indonesia, dating back 40,000 years\n\nThe fresco's details include a depiction of Leda protecting the swan with her cloak as the bird sits on her lap.\n\nOsanna noted the fresco's context of the Greek \"myth of love, with an explicit sensuality in a bedroom where, obviously beside sleep, there could be other activities.\"\n\nThe fresco, with its colors still remarkably vivid, was discovered Friday during ongoing work to consolidate the ancient city's structures after rains and wear-and-tear in past years caused some ruins to collapse, the tourist site's officials said.\n\nThe bedroom is located near a corridor by the entranceway of an upscale domus, or home, where another splendid fresco was discovered earlier this year, said the archaeological park, which is part of the Italian Culture Ministry.\n\nLeda is an important figure in Greek mythology. She was said to have borne children fathered by the god Zeus, the Greek version of Jupiter, and by a mortal king of Sparta. According to myth, her children included the beautiful Helen of Troy and the twins Castor and Pollux.\n\nOsanna said one hypothesis is that the home's owner was a rich merchant who wanted to give the impression he was culturally advanced by incorporating myth-inspired frescoes. It appeared the artist was inspired by a 4th century B.C. sculpture by Timotheos, he said.\n\nBecause of safety concerns, unexcavated parts of the domus will probably remain that way, ANSA said. Archaeologists are considering removing both frescos found in the home to a place where \"they can be protected and shown to the public,\" Osanna was quoted as saying.\n\nPompeii's sprawling, partially excavated grounds are one of Italy's top tourist attractions.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/11/19/archaeologists-discover-sensual-fresco-ancient-pompeii-bedroom/2063114002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Bears say quarterback Trubisky has right shoulder injury", "description": "The Chicago Bears say quarterback Mitchell Trubisky hurt his right shoulder in their victory over the Minnesota Vikings", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/19/bears-say-quarterback-trubisky-has-right-shoulder-injury/38569183/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2887f5d7d58a75a6437c45e987fd994202334aff/c=0-156-3000-1844/local/-/media/2018/11/19/USATODAY/usatsports/bd657ecebb1f40a5843be2b5c4014b6f.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T03:20:27Z", "content": "Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky (10) slides for yardage against Minnesota Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen (97) and defensive back Holton Hill (24) during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Chicago.

USA TODAY\n\nBobby Bones won the \"DWTS\" mirrorball trophy. (Photo: Craig Sjodin, ABC)\n\nThe coveted Mirrorball trophy has a new owner.\n\nCountry-radio host Bobby Bones and pro Sharna Burgess were crowned the winners of Season 27 of \"Dancing With the Stars,\" beating out fellow competitors model Alexis Ren (with pro Alan Bersten), \"Harry Potter\" star Evanna Lynch (with pro Keo Motsepe) and Disney Channel star Milo Manheim (with pro Witney Carson).\n\n\"Thank you to the people and thank you to Sharna, who made all this possible,\" an emotional Bones said after co-host Tom Bergeron named him the winner.\n\nThe final four were challenged to learn two dances Thanksgiving week, the first a style of dance the celebrity contestants performed earlier in the season and the second a new freestyle.\n\nHere is what went down during the finale:\n\nRepeat dances\n\nRen kicked off the competition with another dose of showmance with partner Bersten. During a pre-taped package before their performance, Ren declared she's \"really found love\" and \"never felt better.\"\n\nThe pair's chemistry was evident in their Argentine tango to \"Swan Lake\" by Ray Chew Live. Ren and Bersten scored a 27 out of 30, with judge Bruno Tonioli adding that the \"the connection works\" in the routine.\n\nNext, Bones pulled his MC Hammer pants back out for another shot at the cha-cha with Burgess. Before hitting the dance floor to \"U Can't Touch This,\" the duo pondered on \"How did we get here?\"\n\nRelated: 'Dancing With the Stars' finals: Can Bobby Bones actually win while 'clueless at dance'?\n\nDespite not having any dance experience, the radio personality credited \"showing up and putting in the hours\" to his success on the show. He scored a 24 out of 30 on his fun routine that got the judges laughing.\n\nLynch, the clear front-runner after Juan Pablo Di Pace's shocking semifinal exit, continued to show her growth in the competition with a redo of her Halloween tango.\n\nDancing to Rihanna's \"Disturbia,\" the \"Harry Potter\" alum and Motsepe dominated the ballroom with a hauntingly good routine, earning a perfect 30 out of 30. It was Lynch's third week in a row picking up a perfect score.\n\nRelated: 'Dancing With the Stars': Shocking elimination after contestant earns two perfect scores\n\nAs if that were not enough, her \"Potter\" co-star Emma Watson surprised Lynch with a special video message: \"You are in the final. I am so proud of you. I don't know where those dancing skills came from but you are unbelievable. We are so proud of you. We love you. We are rooting for you.\"\n\nNext, Manheim gave his Charleston another go to \"Living in New York City,\" this time with a live performance from Robin Thicke. He brought his A-game with high energy and Charleston swivels, worthy of a 30 out of 30.\n\nInaba doubled down on her belief that the Disney star was the person to beat, which would have made the 17-year-old the youngest competitor in \"DWTS\" history to win the Mirrorball trophy.\n\nFreestyle dances\n\nRen gave it her all in a freestyle dance to a live performance of Avril Lavigne's new single, \"Head Above Water.\" Their dramatic routine full of emotion also earned a 30 out of 30.\n\nThe couple reflected on their journey together following their last dance together. \"Thank you so much. This has been the best experience of my life,\" Ren said while hugging Bersten. (Awww)\n\nBones' hard work finally paid off in the freestyle round, when he earned his first perfect score of the entire season at what couldn't have been a better time.\n\nThe radio host let his personality \u2013 and flossing skills \u2013 shine in a \"Greatest Showman\"-themed routine to Panic! at the Disco\u2019s \"The Greatest Show.\" At one point, former contestant DeMarcus Ware lifted Bones over his head like he was lifting weights.\n\n\"You\u2019ve always been the people\u2019s champion. And tonight you\u2019ve become my champion,\" judge Len Goodman applauded, while Tonioli added, \"That was the perfect freestyle for a free spirit.\"\n\nManheim went all out for his final routine with lots of props, including numerous umbrellas, intricate footwork and Bill Withers' \"Ain't No Sunshine.\" He and Carson scored a 30 out of 30, their second perfect score of the night.\n\n\"My mind is blown right now. I don't think we've ever seen a freestyle with that much content,\" Inaba said.\n\nLynch also finished the competition on a high note with another perfect score. Set to Bjork's \"It\u2019s Oh So Quiet,\" her dance moves did all the talking in a spellbinding performance that seriously impressed the judges.\n\nGoodman called her last routine the \"cherry on the cake,\" adding it \"showed every part of your dancing off beautifully.\"\n\nIn the end, it was Bones who hoisted the trophy.\n\nRelated: 'Dancing With the Stars' finals: Can Bobby Bones actually win while 'clueless at dance'?\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/19/dancing-stars-finals-winner-season-27/2062156002/"}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "AP, AP", "title": "Eichel's OT winner lifts Sabres by reeling Penguins 5-4", "description": "Jake Eichel's shot squirted past Casey DeSmith 45 seconds into overtime as the surging Buffalo Sabres rallied to beat the struggling Pittsburgh Penguins 5-4", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/11/19/eichels-ot-winner-lifts-sabres-by-reeling-penguins-5-4/38569167/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b35d76e4e6f191b1808e294168e002f199ceccf/c=0-451-2310-1750/local/-/media/2018/11/19/USATODAY/usatsports/4454bcf7deaf412d80ba3fdfdeb0321b.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T03:12:28Z", "content": "Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Casey DeSmith (1) stops a shot by Buffalo Sabres' Zemgus Girgensons (28) in the first period of an NHL hockey game in Pittsburgh, Monday, Nov. 19, 2018.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The Buffalo Sabres might be for real. The Pittsburgh Penguins might be in real trouble.\n\nThe proof came over the final 30 minutes of Buffalo's rousing 5-4 overtime victory on Monday night. The Sabres reeled off the final four goals, the last on a shot from the right circle by Jake Eichel that squirted past Casey DeSmith 45 seconds into the extra period to give Buffalo its sixth straight win.\n\n\"It's just unbelievable the resiliency the past two weeks,\" Sabres head coach Phil Housley said.\n\nBuffalo beat the Penguins for just the second team in the last 11 meetings by hanging in there after Pittsburgh took a 4-1 lead. Momentum shifted early in the second period when the Sabres killed a 5-on-3 power play to keep the deficit at three. Zach Bogosian kick started the comeback with a one-timer 10:39 into the second and the young Sabres took off from there.\n\nTage Thompson, Casey Nelson and Casey Mittlestadt which has won six straight for the first time since the 2009-10 season. Carter Hutton withstood an early flurry from Pittsburgh and finished with 36 saves.\n\n\"We just stayed the course and we didn't bend,\" Housley said. \"And obviously Carter Hutton made some huge saves at the right time.\"\n\nTanner Pearson had a goal and an assist for the Penguins, his first points with Pittsburgh since being acquired in a trade with Los Angeles last week. Phil Kessel picked up his 10th for the Penguins and Jake Guentzel and Derick Brassard also scored.\n\nDeSmith made 35 stops but spent most of the final 30 minutes under heavy duress from the Sabres. Pittsburgh has won just once in its last 10 games.\n\n\"We're well aware of the position that we're in,\" Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said. \"We've got a proud group. I do think we're getting better in a lot of areas. We're not getting the results.\"\n\nThe Penguins woke up Monday tied with Florida for last place in the Eastern Conference thanks to the franchise's longest extended funk since Sidney Crosby's rookie season in 2005-06. Crosby missed his third straight game with an undisclosed upper-body injury but cautioned that it was far too early for Pittsburgh to panic.\n\nAnd for the first 30 minutes, the Penguins did what they've done to Buffalo so regularly during Crosby's tenure: they dominated.\n\nBrassard gave Pittsburgh the lead 8:46 into the first when he beat Hutton to the stick side on a 2-on-1 for his second goal of the season. The Sabres tied it less than three minutes later on a sequence that seemed to sum up Pittsburgh's bumpy start. Dominik Simon tripped while attempting to clear the puck near the blue line, allowing Buffalo to keep it in. Sam Reinhart whipped a cross-ice pass to Thompson, who fired a one-timer that beat DeSmith cleanly.\n\nPittsburgh responded when Kessel tapped in a pretty feed from Pearson with 3:45 left in the first. Guentzel put in his own rebound 1:24 into the second and Pearson followed with his first goal in 32 games as the Penguins pushed their lead to 4-1.\n\nYet little has come easy for Pittsburgh during the opening quarter of the season and the improved Sabres kept chipping away.\n\nEichel forced a turnover behind the Pittsburgh net that started a sequence that ended with Bogosian ripping a one-timer by DeSmith from the right circle. Nelson drew Buffalo within a goal with 84 seconds left in the second when Nelson's shot from the point smacked off Pittsburgh defenseman Jack Johnson and into the net.\n\nThe Sabres continued to push, and when Mittelstadt beat DeSmith to draw even just past the midway point of the third, Buffalo had all the momentum it would need while improving to 5-6-1 when trailing after two periods this season.\n\n\"It's something else,\" Hutton said. \"Obviously, it's something we don't want to get in the habit of, but it seems to be a habit. Just resiliency here. We never stop working.\"\n\nNOTES: Both teams went 0 for 3 on the power play. ... Penguins placed C Matt Cullen on injured reserve Monday with a lower-body injury. Sullivan said Cullen is out \"longer term.\" ... Pittsburgh D Kris Letang became the second defenseman in team history to play in 700 games, joining Brooks Orpik (703). ... The Penguins brought back Hall of Famer Craig Patrick to serve as a pro scout. Patrick spent 17 years as Pittsburgh's general manager from 1989-2006, helping the franchise win consecutive Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992. ...

(AP) \u2014 Once seventh-ranked North Carolina started taking care of the basketball, the Tar Heels had no trouble taking care of Saint Francis of Pennsylvania.\n\nCameron Johnson scored 20 points, freshman Nassir Little added 19 and North Carolina beat Saint Francis 101-76 on Monday night in the on-campus round of the Las Vegas Invitational.\n\nLuke Maye had 11 points and 10 rebounds, Kenny Williams had a career-high nine assists and freshman Coby White finished with 16 points for the Tar Heels (5-0), who shot 52 percent and never trailed.\n\nNorth Carolina fought through some early turnover trouble and finally pulled away from the pesky Red Flash (1-3), reaching triple figures for the third time in four games.\n\nYes, they committed a season-high 18 turnovers. But only six of them came in the final 15 minutes, when the Tar Heels turned a six-point game into yet another blowout.\n\nCoach Roy Williams said program patriarch Dean Smith \"used to say that turnovers are either selfishness or carelessness.\n\n\"And half of ours were carelessness, and half were selfishness,\" Williams added. \"If you want to be good, don't turn the sucker over.\"\n\nJamaal King had 21 points, Andre Wolford scored 18 and Keith Braxton added 14 to lead the Red Flash, who shot 34 percent but early in the second half were within striking distance of their first Top 25 victory since 1959. They pulled to 58-52 with less than 15 minutes left on Braxton's pretty layup between two defenders.\n\nKenny Williams hit a big 3-pointer and Johnson followed with a steal and a layup to start the decisive 11-0 run and put the Tar Heels back up by double figures to stay.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSaint Francis: The Red Flash certainly haven't been afraid to challenge themselves. This was the second of three Top 25 opponents in an eight-day span. They acquitted themselves much better than in their last matchup \u2014 a 95-58 loss to No. 20 UCLA \u2014 and especially in their last visit to the North Carolina Triangle, a 124-67 setback at then-No. 1 Duke last December.\n\n\"I think it's forced our guys to understand how focused you have to be,\" coach Rob Krimmel said. \"Whether you're playing here in Chapel Hill or back in Loretto, Pennsylvania, the need and that sense of urgency to play hard and to play together. ... Hopefully, being kind of on edge for the better part of the first month and understanding the attention to detail, they'll build those habits that we'll need coming into January and February.\"\n\nNorth Carolina: There wasn't a whole lot in this one that pleased Roy Williams, at least not early. When the Tar Heels weren't fouling the Red Flash, they were throwing the ball to them \u2014 with 12 turnovers in the first 24 minutes that led to 18 points for Saint Francis. This became the blowout everyone expected once UNC tightened things up.\n\n\"The biggest frustrations to me were the turnovers and putting them on the free throw line too much,\" Williams said.\n\nKEY STAT\n\nThe Red Flash kept themselves in the game early by drawing contact and getting to the free throw line. Eight of North Carolina's 10 fouls in the first half sent Saint Francis to the stripe, and the Red Flash kept it close by making 14 of 16 free throws. But in the second half they took just 11 free throws and made six.\n\nHIGHLIGHT\n\nThe top play in this one came midway through the first half. The Tar Heels came away with the ball after a scrum under Saint Francis' basket, and Kenny Williams lofted a perfect cross-court, alley-oop pass to Little, whose dunk pushed the lead to 29-17.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\"I wish they'd frickin' be faster learners.\" \u2014 Roy Williams, after he learned half his team's turnovers were committed by freshmen.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaint Francis: Visits No. 13 Virginia Tech on Friday.\n\nNorth Carolina: Faces Texas on Thursday night in the Las Vegas Invitational.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Although the SPLC lists them as a hate group, they have repeatedly denied any connection to the \u201calt-right.\u201d\n\nThe document, written by Commander Michael McCabe, states that the Proud Boys were \u201cpublically (sic) categorized as an extremist group by the FBI in 2018.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the report marks the first time the group has been publicly labelled as \u201cextremist\u201d by the FBI.\n\nMcCabe told the British newspaper that the FBI revealed the classification of the Proud Boys as an extremist group during an Aug. 2 briefing at Clark County\u2019s west precinct.\n\nAccording to the report, the FBI warned local law enforcement that the group is recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that they have \u201ccontributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.\u201d\n\nThe report was not intended to investigate the Proud Boys but rather the membership of a Clark County sheriff\u2019s deputy in the group.\n\nThe investigation found that Deputy Sheriff Erin Willey, who worked as a probationary deputy from June 2017 to June 2018, was active with the Proud Boy Girls, \u201can affiliate group of women who openly support the ideology of the Proud Boys.\u201d She was involved with the group from November 2016 to October 2017, but failed to disclose this information. Her association with the group came to light when The Columbian, a Washington daily newspaper, obtained photos of Willey wearing Proud Boy Girls apparel.\n\nHer affiliation with the group violated two of the sheriff\u2019s office's policies, including the non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy, and may have prevented her from passing the background check necessary to hold any law enforcement position, the report states.\n\nAfter Willey\u2019s firing, Clark County Sheriff Chuck Atkins released a statement: \u201cLaw enforcement officers are peacekeepers whose core mission is to protect and safeguard the community.

(Cole Burston/The Canadian Press via AP) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 It took the Toronto Maple Leafs a little while to shake their West Coast hangover.\n\nZach Hyman scored two goals late in third period and the Maple Leafs extended their winning streak to four games with a 4-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Monday night.\n\nHyman's second goal of the season came with 4:22 left in regulation when he redirected a shot from the point by Morgan Rielly. Hyman added an empty-netter with 61 seconds left.\n\nJohn Tavares had a goal and an assist, and Tyler Ennis also scored for Toronto. Andersen made 37 saves. Mitch Marner and Ron Hainsey each had two assists\n\nThe Leafs were coming off a three-game California sweep. Toronto has a league-best 9-1-0 record on the road. The Leafs improved to 6-5-0 at home.\n\nThe win wasn't pretty for Toronto as Columbus built a two-goal lead after dominating the first 20 minutes.\n\n\"We reset in the first intermission,\" Andersen said. \"None of us were too happy with our effort ... we know we can play a lot better.\n\n\"We came out in the second and third and proved it.\"\n\nCam Atkinson and Pierre-Luc Dubois each had a goal and an assist for Columbus. Sergei Bobrovsky made 22 stops.\n\nThe Blue Jackets lost in regulation for the first time in eight games (5-1-2).\n\n\"Freddie shut the door after that first period and we kind of rallied behind him,\" said Hyman. \"All four lines contributed ... just a big team win.\"\n\nToronto came in with the league's third-best record, while Columbus was one spot back in fourth.\n\nBlue Jackets head coach John Tortorella was left fuming by the sequence that led to Hyman's winner.\n\n\"Dumb. It's peewee coverage,\" he said. \"We played well enough to win, and not to get a point out of it off a simple coverage off the faceoff ... . It's dumb.\"\n\nTied 2-2 through 40 minutes, Marner had a backhand chance for the Leafs from the slot with just over eight minutes to go after Tavares hit the side of the net.\n\nAndersen made a big save at the other end moments later on a scramble in the crease before Hyman redirected Rielly's shot past Bobrovsky.\n\nColumbus pulled Bobrovsky with 1:45 remaining.\n\nDown 2-0 after the first, Toronto got on the board with 6:59 left in the second when Ennis used a couple of spin moves and slid the puck through Bobrovsky's legs from a tough angle.\n\n\"Our line has been doing a good job of getting pucks in and working it low,\" Ennis said. \"It was nice to see it go in.\"\n\nAndersen then stopped Josh Anderson's move to the backhand on a breakaway to keep the Leafs down by one before Marner tied the game.\n\nMarner stepped past Columbus defenseman Scott Harrington before tapping his own rebound back in front of Bobrovsky's net, where Tavares scored his 13th.\n\nMarner now has one goal and seven assists during a five-game point streak.\n\n\"Our team never gives up,\" said Marner. \"That's something we need to make sure we keep going.\"\n\nDespite coming out flat following victories over the Los Angeles Kings (5-1), San Jose Sharks (5-3) and Anaheim Ducks (2-1 in overtime) last week, Toronto could have easily found themselves up 2-0 early on Monday.\n\nEnnis hit the post on a 2-on-1 break under three minutes in before Connor Brown somehow chipped a puck off the iron from the lip of the crease.\n\nColumbus carried much of the play and took the lead with 5:21 remaining in the first after some sloppy play from Rielly and Hainsey.\n\nDubois knocked down Hainsey's clearing attempt and fed Atkinson, who beat Andersen between the pads for his 13th goal and seventh in the last five outings.\n\nColumbus went up 2-0 with 47.5 seconds left in the period on another Leafs defensive miscue as Dubois cleaned up in front after Atkinson lost the puck on an attempted move between the legs for his 10th.\n\nWith the victory, Leafs head coach Mike Babcock passed Red Kelly and Pat Burns for fifth place in franchise history with 133 regular-season coaching wins. Punch Imlach leads with 370, followed by Pat Quinn (300), Hap Day (259) and Dick Irvin (215).\n\nNOTES: There were no penalties called in the game. ... Bobrovsky had allowed just one goal in each of his last four starts prior to Monday. ... Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews practiced with his teammates Sunday for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury Oct. 27. The 21-year-old wore a red non-contact jersey for that session and was also out for Monday's optional morning skate. ...

The 21st overall pick in the 2017 NHL draft, Chytil scored for the fourth straight game to become the first teenager in franchise history to accomplish that feat.\n\n\"I am happy we are winning and I can help the team with goals,\" Chytil said. \"I am trying to play hard and play my game.\"\n\nJimmy Vesey also scored and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 16 shots to help the Rangers win their sixth straight at home. New York has also won eight of its last 10 overall (8-1-1).\n\nThe Rangers trailed 1-0 before Vesey tied it with his seventh about 9 1/2 minutes into the second as he twisted his body around Dallas' Roman Polak before backhanding a loose puck past goalie Ben Bishop while falling to the ice.\n\n\"Hard work feels good,\" New York coach David Quinn said. \"It feels good. And so these guys have put a lot into it and when you get rewarded with the wins, you really have that feeling. And that's kind of the (feeling) we have right now.\"\n\nTyler Seguin scored early in the second period to give Dallas the lead. Bishop made 12 saves before leaving after two periods due to a lower body injury. Anton Khudobin stopped nine of the 10 shots he faced in the third.\n\nThe Stars snapped a two-game win streak and fell to 3-3-2 in their last eight.\n\nChytil put the Rangers ahead with a snap shot from the top of the left circle. Before shooting, he cut behind Stars defenseman Joel Hanley, in effect using him as a screen.\n\n\"It's not an excuse but for me it was a little tough because maybe I wasn't warm enough,\" Khudobin said. \"At the same time, he went back-forth, back-forth and I was kind of thinking he might go to the middle but he stayed on the (left) side and snuck (one) right by me.\"\n\nLundqvist kept the game even, and made a spectacular glove save on Stars rookie defenseman Miro Heiskanen's shot from the slot with 1:05 left in the second.\n\n\"I am relying on my reads_back to the way I played waiting for the puck (and) reading the shot,\" said Lundqvist, who faced a 6 on 5 in the final 2:17. He only had to make one save_on an Alex Radulov wrist shot--while benefitting from two Fredrik Claesson blocked shots, and one each from Marc Staal and Jesper Fast.\n\n\"I feel comfortable,\" Lundqvist said.\n\nDallas took a 1-0 lead on Seguin's power play goal 2:17 into the second. The Stars' center ripped a laser from the left faceoff dot to open the scoring. It was Seguin's seventh goal of the season, including the second on the power play, and came 44 seconds after Bishop's right pad save on Brett Howden's short-handed attempt.\n\nDallas finished the game 1 for 4 on the power play, while holding New York to 0 for 2.\n\n\"The power play was poor,\" Stars coach Jim Montgomery said.\n\nNOTES: One day after being called up, RW Steven Fogarty dressed and played on New York's fourth line. The game was his first of the season, and his second career NHL game. In 19 games with AHL Hartford this season, Fogarty had seven goals and seven assists. ... New York D Brady Skjei was scratched for the second straight game. ... Rangers RW Mats Zuccarello missed his second straight due to an undisclosed injury. ... During his pregame availability, Montgomery acknowledged he had discussions with New York about its coaching vacancy after the Rangers fired Alain Vigneault. \"We did have some conversations,\" Montgomery said. \"(Dallas GM) Jim Nill (was) very aggressive in his pursuit of me, and the lifestyle in Dallas was a lot more similar for my family to Denver.\" Prior to being hired by the Stars on May 4, Montgomery was the coach at the University of Denver for five seasons where he compiled a 125-57-26 record and won the national championship in 2017. New York eventually hired Quinn from Boston University on May 13. ... Dallas scratched D Ben Gleason, RW Brett Ritchie and C Devin Shore. ... The teams will meet once more this season, March 5 in Dallas. ...

(AP Photo/Michael Perez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Joel Embiid gave another lesson in dominance. Only this time, Suns rookie Deandre Ayton actually was grateful for it.\n\nEmbiid scored 19 of his 33 points after halftime and added 17 rebounds to help the Philadelphia 76ers beat Phoenix 119-114 on Monday night.\n\nBen Simmons added 19 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for Philadelphia, which won its third straight while improving to 9-0 at home, remaining the only team in the league unbeaten at home. The 76ers play five of their next six in Philadelphia.\n\nEmbiid upped his averages to 27.9 points and 13.1 rebounds while reaching at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in a game for the 11th time. He also has a league-leading 17 double-doubles.\n\n\"I know that's my job,\" Embiid said. \"They need me to dominate.\"\n\nAyton had 17 points and nine rebounds in his first matchup against fellow 7-footer Embiid.\n\nEmbiid scoffed at analysts' comparisons of Ayton to him made on draft day, saying on Twitter: \"Don't compare Ayton to me either. I play DEFENSE.\" The boisterous 76ers center then told ESPN in a preseason interview that Ayton was \"about to get his (butt) kicked.\"\n\nTo his credit, the No. 1 pick responded to pregame questions about Embiid by saying he would let his game do his talking.\n\nAnd Ayton did just that in the first possession, finishing Devin Booker's pass with an alley-oop dunk for an emphatic start to the game. Then, he forced Embiid into a turnover in the 76ers star's first touch on offense.\n\nBut Embiid got the better from that point.\n\nStill, Ayton was glad for the on-court tutorial.\n\n\"It was fun to finally play against Joel,\" he said. \"The way he used his body, I'm going to use that, steal that. Thank you for teaching me. He put in a lot of work; I have to put in a lot of work, too.\"\n\nEmbiid downplayed his previous comments about Ayton and spoke favorably of him.\n\n\"A lot of people misunderstand me; I talk a lot of trash,\" Embiid said. \"He's talented and has a lot of potential. I'm a big fan.\"\n\nBooker had 37 points and eight assists for the Suns, who started a four-game road trip with their sixth loss in seven games. Phoenix, which fell to 3-13 overall and 0-7 on the road, has the worst record in the West and is one of three winless road teams in the NBA.\n\nStrong first-half shooting helped Phoenix to a surprising 62-57 halftime lead. The 76ers took control in the third, going up for good on Embiid's three-point play 3:45 into the quarter. They ended the period ahead 92-86 and led by as many as 12 early in the fourth on J.J. Redick's runner.\n\nThe Suns hung around and T.J. Warren's 3-pointer with 3:06 remaining cut it to 109-104. But Embiid's follow layup with 58 seconds left made it 114-106 and was the clincher.\n\nBUTLER'S CONTRIBUTION\n\nFour-time All-Star Jimmy Butler, in his fourth game with the 76ers after last week's trade with Minnesota, had 16 points after hitting a 3-pointer as time expired in overtime to lead Philadelphia to a 122-119 win at Charlotte on Saturday.\n\nBRIDGES' HOMECOMING\n\nPhiladelphia native and Villanova product Mikal Bridges had 13 points in 23 minutes for Phoenix. The rookie was drafted 10th by the 76ers before being shipped to the Suns for the No. 16 pick, Zhaire Smith, and a 2021 first-round pick. Smith has yet to play due to a left foot injury and an allergic food reaction that will sideline him at least until January.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSuns: Veteran G Trevor Ariza returned after missing the previous two games due to personal reasons and had 10 points. ... Warren finished with 21. ... Former 76ers F Richaun Holmes received a warm ovation when he entered in the first quarter.

Charlotte (2-2) is no stranger to comebacks, having rallied from 24 down to upset Oklahoma State by two points earlier this season.\n\nLongwood (4-1) built an 11-point lead, 26-15 early in the second half, but Charlotte quickly made it a two-point game and surged ahead 31-30 after Martin's second trey. That kicked off a 13-3 run capped by a Dravon Mangum layup with five minutes to play. The freshman scored nine points and had 10 rebounds.\n\nIsaiah Walton was held to 12 points, his first game below 20 this season, with 10 rebounds but 11 turnovers. Lorenzo Phillips scored 10 for the Lancers.\n\nThe game was a rematch of sorts from UMBC's shocking upset of top-seeded Virginia in the opening round of last season's NCAA Tournament. Longwood's Griff Aldrich was an assistant for the 16th-seeded Retrievers, Charlotte's Ron Sanchez with the Cavaliers.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Pistons led 66-46 at halftime, and the game was never close after that.\n\n\"We had a lot of positives,\" Casey said. \"I thought our defense was solid and we started the game well.

The Los Angeles Lakers play at Cleveland on Wednesday night.\n\nDrummond scored 13 points in the first quarter. The Pistons led 38-27 after one, then scored the first 11 points of the second. Bullock's 3-pointer in the final seconds made it a 20-point advantage at the half.\n\nThe lead reached 30 in the third quarter before the Cavaliers went on an 18-2 run that lasted well into the fourth, making the final score a little more respectable.\n\n\"I feel like we were on a run, and we were rolling,\" Cleveland's Collin Sexton said. \"When it's like that, I feel like anything's possible.\"\n\nSexton led the Cavs with 18 points, and Jordan Clarkson contributed 16.\n\nRECORD\n\nThe Pistons shot 13 of 38 from 3-point range.

(AP) \u2014 The NBA's new scoring leader was determined his latest big night wouldn't go to waste.\n\nKemba Walker scored 43 points, giving him 103 in his last two games, and the Charlotte Hornets battled back to beat the Boston Celtics 117-112 on Monday night.\n\nWalker followed up his NBA season-best, 60-point effort in an overtime loss to the 76ers on Saturday night with another spectacular performance. He scored 21 points in the fourth quarter and made 14 of 25 shots overall, including seven more 3-pointers.\n\nHe finished 7 of 10 from the floor with four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter as Charlotte erased a 10-point deficit to pull even at 8-8 on the season.\n\n\"I just wanted to win, man,\" Walker said. \"I wanted to win a close game. We've been in every game for the most part. There's a couple we haven't been in but you know things just haven't been going our way in those situations and tonight it did and it felt good.\"\n\nWalker passed Golden State's guard Stephen Curry to take over the NBA scoring lead at 29.6 points per game.\n\nWalker also passed the injured Curry for the league lead in 3-pointers made with 65.\n\n\"It means a lot but it's still the early season,\" Walker said. \"I would've never, ever in my life thought I would be that high up in the rankings as far as scoring in the NBA. But I'm going to try to keep it up, do what I can to win games.\"\n\nWalker outdueled Boston's Kyrie Irving, who finished with 27 points and 11 assists.\n\nJeremy Lamb had 18 points and Willy Hernangomez added 14 as the Hornets beat the Celtics for the first time in eight tries.\n\nThe Celtics entered the fourth quarter leading 87-84 and quickly stretched the lead to double digits behind Irving, who scored and was fouled on a drive.\n\nBut Walker refused to lose this time.\n\nThe two-time All-Star simply took over, scoring on drives, midrange jumpers and from long distance. He scored 11 straight points in one stretch, including a 3-pointer from the right wing and a nifty Euro step move through the lane.\n\n\"He's been unbelievable, especially when your whole game plan is to stop him and he is still going off and doing what he does,\" said Celtics forward Gordon Hayward. \"He's an unbelievable player.\"\n\nIt was Walker who delivered the knockout punch with a clutch 3 from 27 feet away with 32 seconds left, bringing fans to their feet and putting the Hornets up by six. Irving missed two open 3s down the stretch and the Hornets escaped with the win to pull even at .500.\n\nAfter one big shot, a pumped-up Walker screamed \"This is my city!\"\n\n\"We were looking for another 60 but I think 43 will do tonight,\" joked Hornets coach James Borrego. \"He's incredible. This is a special player, a special performance and a special start to an NBA season.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCeltics: Jayson Tatum finished with 18 points and six rebounds. ... Finished 9 of 32 from 3-point range.\n\nHornets: Nic Batum continued to struggle with his shot in the early going, missing his first four attempts before knocking down a pair of 3-pointers. Batum, who failed to score against the 76ers, had nine points. ... Malik Monk has missed his last 16 3-point attempts and didn't play in the second half.\n\nHAYWARD OFF THE BENCH\n\nAron Baynes got the start over Hayward at forward for Boston. The change didn't matter all that much as both were 1 of 4 from the field in the first half.\n\n\"I'm OK with whatever I can do to help us win,\" Hayward said. \"Right now, I just have to focus on myself and getting myself better and being a better basketball player.\"\n\nCoach Brad Stevens said it was more about getting Hayward in the right group, adding that \"we're probably not done tweaking the lineups.\"\n\nPARKER'S BIG CONTRIBUTION\n\nEighteen-year NBA veteran Tony Parker only had seven points, but made two clutch midrange jumpers in the final 2 minutes for the Hornets.\n\nThose possessions allowed Walker to play off the ball for a few possessions.\n\n\"Having Tony on the floor with him tonight allowed (Walker) to move off of the ball and that's what we try to do,\" Borrego said. \"We try to mix it up on them so they don't get locked in on his pick-and-roll. That's our job, to move him around and disguise him as much as we can.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCeltics: Host Knicks on Wednesday night.\n\nHornets: Host Pacers on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Kansas State outscored Savannah State 48-4 in the second half on Jan. 7, 2008.\n\n\"A lot of us were a little down after that game (St. Johns). We felt we disappointed some people,\" Baker said. \"But it humbled us and made us better as a team. Coach (Steve Pikiell) said you can either lose or you can learn. I think it helped us learn.\"\n\nOne thing the Scarlet Knights studied was suffocating defense.\n\nEastern Michigan (4-2) was 0 of 7 from the free-throw line in the first half, and didn't score until Kevin McAdoo's jumper at the 14-minute mark. The Eagles didn't score again until there was 5:36 left in the first half.\n\n\"We really needed an identity as a defensive team,\" Baker said. \"We took a step forward in that category today.\"\n\nBaker was 7-of-9-shooting, made six 3-pointers and had five assists.

After going 0 of 7 from the foul line in the first half, Eastern Michigan finished a putrid 3-of-17 shooting.\n\nFIRST WIN FOR SCARLET KNIGHTS\n\nThis is the first win over Eastern Michigan for Rutgers. In the only other meeting, EMU defeated Rutgers 74-71 win on Dec. 9, 1995 before going on to win the Mid-American Conference title and defeat Duke in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nEastern Michigan: The Eagles were picked to finish first in the West Division in the MAC preseason poll, and only second overall to Buffalo. They have fared well despite two blowout losses, to Rutgers and 84-46 at Duke.\n\nRutgers: The Scarlet Knights rebounded from a 19-point loss at home against a talented St. John's team on Friday.

(AP) \u2014 The Green Bay Packers are winless on the road and there are questions about coach Mike McCarthy's job security.\n\nHowever they enter Sunday night's game at Minnesota trailing the Vikings by just one game for the final NFC wild-card spot.\n\n\"We fully understand where we are. We understand what our record is,\" McCarthy said on Monday. \"We need to win on the road. That's something we haven't done.\"\n\nThe game against the Vikings will be Green Bay's fourth road game in five games coming out of their bye. They were tied or ahead in the fourth quarter at the Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots and again on Thursday against the Seattle Seahawks, but lost all three games.\n\nThe bad news for the Packers is that the latest defeat left them at 4-5-1. The good news is the NFC playoff chase is jumbled. While Chicago seized control of the NFC North race with its victory over Minnesota on Sunday night, the Vikings (5-4-1) lead the Seattle Seahawks (5-5), Dallas Cowboys (5-5) and Packers in the pursuit for the last playoff spot.\n\n\"We understand that there's still a lot of football left,\" safety Tramon Williams said. \"As long as there's a lot of football left, we know that we have a chance to be where we want to be at. Will it be easy? No, but we're optimistic.\"\n\nHaving played on Thursday, the Packers got a short break to get ready for that game in Seattle. Four starters didn't travel to Seattle because of injuries \u2014 receiver Randall Cobb, safety Kentrell Brice, cornerback Kevin King and outside linebacker Nick Perry.\n\nTight end Jimmy Graham suffered a broken thumb during the first half and defensive tackle Mike Daniels sustained a foot injury during the second half. McCarthy said Graham \"intends to try to play\" while Daniels will miss a couple of weeks.\n\nThe return of Cobb and Graham could bolster an inconsistent offense. Green Bay ranks eighth in yards, but only 13th in points because of mediocre production on third down (19th) and in the red zone (14th). Cobb had a huge game in a come-from-behind-victory over Chicago in Week 1 with nine catches for 142 yards, including the game-winning, 75-yard touchdown.\n\nOver the past nine games, however, he's been inactive five times and caught 17 passes for 116 yards and no touchdowns. Graham is second on the team with 34 receptions, but has only one catch in three of his past four games.\n\n\"Everybody is very frustrated. Nobody wants to lose games,\" Cobb said. \"We don't go out and work every day in the offseason to come into the season in shape and go through training camp and beat each other up in training camp and go through seasons and lose games. Nobody wants to do that. That's not fun. We want to win games and we've won a lot around here. We've got to find a way to get back on track.\"\n\nThe Packers are running out of time, regardless of what the playoff standings suggest. A sixth consecutive road loss on Sunday would put Green Bay two games behind Minnesota (plus the head-to-head tiebreaker) with five to play.\n\nStill, the Packers have a chance. They were 4-6 at this point in the 2016 season and reached the NFC championship came. Among the four primary challengers for the last playoff spot, the Packers have the easiest remaining schedule. Their final six opponents have a combined winning percentage of (.425), followed by the Seahawks (.442), Cowboys (.500) and Vikings (.542).\n\n\"Our reality, it's where we expect to be,\" McCarthy said. \"Regardless of what anybody's opinion is, we expect to complete the goal that we set out back in April. That's the big-picture focus. But it's not anything we're talking about right now.\n\n\"Because part of the message today, there's not a whole lot to talk about. We know where we are, we knew this four-game stretch was going to be a challenge, we didn't hit the target as well as we'd like, but now we have six seven-day stretches here. We have full intentions of going to Minnesota and winning this game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Pacers defeated the Jazz 121-94. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Pacers coach Nate McMillan saw exactly what he wanted Monday night.\n\nBig men Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner showed off their strength. Bojan Bogdanovic knocked down shots from the perimeter. Indiana shared the ball and played defense.\n\nWith All-Star guard Victor Oladipo sidelined with an injured right knee, the Pacers delivered their most complete game of the season. Bogdanovic scored 21 points, Sabonis nearly had a triple-double and Turner added 12 points and six rebounds to lead the Pacers past the Utah Jazz 121-94.\n\n\"When I talk about ball movement and you get those opportunities from the (3-point line) and all over the place and you get everybody involved, this is what we're talking about,\" McMillan said.\n\nThe result: Indiana won its third straight, all at home, and recorded its most lopsided victory since opening night.\n\nThey didn't miss Oladipo one bit.\n\nBogdanovic went 9 of 14 from the field, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. Sabonis had 19 points, nine rebounds and a career-high nine assists in 26 minutes, and Turner wound up with four assists and three blocks.\n\nThe Pacers also forced 18 turnovers, committed three and had a season-high 35 assists.\n\nThe numbers only told part of the tale.\n\n\"They executed the game plan perfectly,\" McMillan said. \"We needed to get pressure on Utah. They do a good job of executing their half-court offense. I thought we did that, and then we got out (on offense) and played at the tempo we wanted.\"\n\nSure, it came against a weary opponent closing out a five-game trip.\n\nRicky Rubio matched his season high with 28 points and had six assists and four turnovers. Center Rudy Gobert finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds but wasn't much of a factor. Jae Crowder scored 14 and was the only other Jazz player to reach double figures.\n\nCoach Quin Snyder even gave his starters some extra rest, pulling the last of his starters with 5:03 to play.\n\n\"They came out and blew stuff up,\" Donovan Mitchell said after scoring seven points. \"I had two turnovers early just from being loose with it. That set the tone.\"\n\nIt was never really close after Indiana jumped to a 19-12 lead and opened the second quarter on a 7-0 run to make it 39-19.\n\nRubio answered with a 14-point scoring flurry in the second quarter, and a 3 from Joe Ingles cut the deficit to 47-41.\n\nIndiana answered with four straight points, closed the half with a 57-47 lead and started the second half on a 9-0 run to make it 71-53 and the Jazz never got closer than 12 the rest of the game.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nJazz: Went 2-3 on the trip. ... Gobert has 15 double-doubles this season. ... Rubio and Gobert combined for 15 baskets. The rest of the team had 21. ... Ingles played in his 239th consecutive game, the NBA's second-longest active streak. ... Utah was outscored 33-11 on points off turnovers and was outrebounded 44-33.\n\nPacers: Have won four of five and improved to 3-4 against Western Conference teams. ... Tyreke Evans made his first start with Indiana and had eight points and five assists in place of Oladipo. ... Rookie Aaron Holiday scored 19 points while Thaddeus Young and Doug McDermott each had 12.\n\nMISSING PIECE\n\nFollowing the game, McMillan pointed to one telling stat.\n\nLast season, the Pacers were winless without Oladipo. This season, they're 1-0.\n\n\"Tonight they stepped in as a team and played solid,\" he said. \"You've just got to find a way to go out and get it done.\"\n\nTHEY SAID IT\n\nJazz: \"We have to play with more force, more precision defensively and we have to finish possessions and need everyone on the defensive end,\" Snyder said. \"They were more physical than us.\"\n\nPacers: \"I feel like every game we play and a little bit more and every game we play more, I feel like our chemistry builds,\" Sabonis said when asked about teaming with Turner.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJazz: Plays its only home game in a 13-day stretch when Sacramento comes to town Wednesday.\n\nPacers: Will try to extend their winning streak Wednesday in Charlotte.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Hingle, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThese players saw their fantasy values increase or decrease most based on their performances in Week 11:\n\nSizzlers\n\nWR Tre'Quan Smith, New Orleans Saints: The rookie was Drew Brees' favorite target Sunday, catching 10 passes for a career-high 157 yards and a TD. He'd never had more than three receptions in any previous game.\n\nRB Josh Adams, Philadelphia Eagles: Adams scored the Eagles' only touchdown in a blowout loss to the Saints. With 53 yards rushing and 19 receiving, he seems to have taken over as the team's No. 1 back.\n\nWR Doug Baldwin, Seattle Seahawks: He said his ailing knee is no longer an issue \u2014 then backed it up with season-highs in targets (10) and receptions (7), as well as his first trip to the end zone.\n\nTE Jordan Reed, Washington Redskins: Reed's production increased after backup quarterback Colt McCoy relieved an injured Alex Smith. He finished with seven catches for 71 yards and his first score since Week 1.\n\nQB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens: The former Heisman winner racked up 117 rushing yards and 150 passing in his first NFL start. There's a chance he holds onto the starting job, even after Joe Flacco's hip injury heals.\n\nWeek 11 fantasy takeaways:Several backup QBs thrust into action\n\nFizzlers\n\nRB Dalvin Cook, Minnesota Vikings: Cook couldn't find any running room against the Chicago Bears, but gaining 9 total yards and losing a fumble (despite playing a career-high 59 snaps) isn't a good sign with several tough matchups looming.\n\nQB Ryan Fitzpatrick, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Tossing two quick interceptions right after halftime, with one returned for a touchdown, sent FitzMagic to the bench. Now his starting job has disappeared.\n\nWR Devin Funchess, Carolina Panthers: QB Cam Newton finished with 357 passing yards, but thanks to several drops, Funchess finished with just two catches for 39 yards. He hasn't topped 50 yards or scored a touchdown since Week 7.\n\nTE Jimmy Graham, Green Bay Packers: Graham had one catch before breaking his thumb against the Seahawks. He'll try to keep playing with it in a split, but the injury will limit his effectiveness in the passing game.\n\nWR Demaryius Thomas, Houston Texans: Even with a bye week to adjust to his new team, Thomas only had one pass thrown his way. Meanwhile, Keke Coutee returned from his injury and caught five of nine targets for 77 yards.\n\nFollow Steve Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "One story from every state.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 No listless start for Jarron Cumberland this time. Encouraged by his coach to assert himself from the outset, Cincinnati's junior guard shot early and had a career night.\n\nCumberland scored half of Cincinnati's points during an opening 22-4 run, and he matched his career high with 27 points on Monday night while leading the Bearcats to a 78-52 victory over Western Michigan.\n\nCincinnati (3-1) concluded a four-game stretch that opened its rebuilt on-campus arena, winning the last three after a loss to Ohio State.\n\nFollowing a 76-64 win over Milwaukee , coach Mick Cronin pushed Cumberland \u2014 the Bearcats' top returning scorer \u2014 to be more aggressive at the start of games. The junior guard saw video of the coach's postgame media session and took it to heart.\n\n\"I watched the press conference after the last game,\" Cumberland said. \"I do need to get started at the beginning of games and not wait until the second half. I need to play a whole game.\"\n\nCronin reminded him before the game about his slow starts, joking that he would have the trainer give him smelling salts if necessary to get him going.\n\n\"I think it worked,\" Cronin said. \"He came out ready to play.\"\n\nCumberland made 5 of his first 6 shots as the Bearcats quickly took control and had 19 points in the first half. Cumberland finished 11 of 19 from the field and had a team-high six assists. Nysier Brooks added 15 points and 10 rebounds, his second straight double-double.\n\nMichael Flowers scored 23 points \u2014 18 in the first half \u2014 and had a team-high seven rebounds for Western Michigan (3-2). The Broncos had more turnovers (8) than shots attempted (7) during Cincinnati's opening spurt, managing only one field goal.\n\n\"Early on they jumped up on us big, and I thought that we were timid,\" coach Steve Hawkins said. \"I felt like we had our spots but we didn't attack.\"\n\nWestern Michigan never got closer than 11 points the rest of the way, with Cincinnati leading by as many as 26.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWestern Michigan: The Broncos made 16 3-pointers against NAIA Aquinas College on Saturday, one shy of the school record. They were 6 of 20 against the Bearcats.\n\nCincinnati: Point guard Justin Jenifer missed a win over Milwaukee on Friday night with a stomach virus. He started on Monday, played 18 minutes, missed all four of his shots and had five assists.\n\nSPEAK UP\n\nCronin said Cumberland's next big challenge is to become more assertive with teammates and help the newcomers do things right on the floor. Cumberland is one of the quietest players but he's counted on to provide leadership this season.\n\n\"That's his biggest adjustment,\" Cronin said. \"He's got to do it, though. If we're going to be any good, we need his voice and not just his points.\"\n\nSERIES STUFF\n\nThe teams hadn't played since Dec. 17, 1966. The Bearcats have won their last eight meetings and lead the series 16-1.\n\nAT THE LINE\n\nWestern Michigan did a good job drawing fouls, but the Broncos were only 16 of 31 on free throws, with center Seth Dugan going 6 of 14. The Bearcats were 13 of 17 on free throws.\n\n\"Our free throws just killed us down the stretch,\" Hawkins said.\n\nDOUBLES ALL AROUND\n\nBrooks (12 points, 11 rebounds) and Trevon Scott (15 and 10) had their first career double-doubles during the win over Milwaukee. Brooks followed it with the second of his career, helping Cincinnati dominate the boards 42-27.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams head to Niceville, Florida, for the next round of the Emerald Coast Classic. The Broncos play Southern on Friday, while the Bearcats play George Mason.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alonzo Adams) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Every week, the story seems the same \u2014 Oklahoma gives up a ton of points, yet Heisman contender Kyler Murray puts up crazy numbers and the Sooners pull out a victory.\n\nThe sixth-ranked Sooners (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) have allowed at least 40 points in victories over Texas Tech, Oklahoma State and Kansas the past three weeks. That winning formula that might not work against an offense the caliber of West Virginia's in a Friday showdown that will send the victor to the conference title game. The 12th-ranked Mountaineers (8-2, 6-2) have with their own Heisman candidate in quarterback Will Grier and an offense that ranks in the top 10 nationally in scoring, total yards per game and yards passing per game.\n\nThe Sooners are still winning with interim defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill, but their chances at reaching the College Football Playoff could vanish if things don't get better in a hurry. Despite the numbers, Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley remains confident in McNeill and said he has seen improvement since firing Mike Stoops earlier in the season.\n\n\"I think our effort's been good,\" Riley said. \"Would I say our effort's been elite all the time? Not all the time. It's been good, and I think it's been particularly good since we made the change. I don't think effort has been a major factor in the times when it hasn't gone well for us.\"\n\nKansas, one of the worst offensive teams in the Big 12, gained 524 yards against the Sooners in Oklahoma's 55-40 win on Saturday . Freshman Pooka Williams ran for a career-high 252 yards on just 15 carries for the Jayhawks.\n\n\"Last weekend, we didn't tackle well,\" Oklahoma linebacker Kenneth Murray said. \"We didn't play well as a group. A lot of times we were in position to make the play, but we just din't make the play. So as a group, we've got to get better at making plays. We've got to get better at finishing tackles. That's just something that we get together as a group and assess.\"\n\nLinebacker Curtis Bolton, who led the Sooners with 10 tackles against Kansas, said Oklahoma's issues come even before tackling.\n\n\"Tackling is a byproduct of hustling to the ball,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, we've got to hustle to the ball better. Tackling \u2014 a lot of form issues, yeah, but we need to run to the ball better before we talk about form tackling.\"\n\nThat's a lot to fix in a short time, given what West Virginia brings to the table. Grier ranks third in the nation in pass efficiency, receiver David Sills V is tied for second nationally with 13 receiving touchdowns and Kennedy McKoy is coming off a career-best 148-yard rushing performance against Oklahoma State.\n\nGary Jennings has 692 yards and 11 touchdowns receiving and Marcus Simms has 44 catches for 682 yards.\n\n\"I know Sills gets a lot of headlines, but they've got two or three other cats out there that are making a lot of other plays for them,\" Riley said. \"They stretch you certainly. And they're running the football well, pretty experienced offensive line. Very good offense all the way around. Going to be challenged every way you can against this group.\"\n\nEven with all that, Oklahoma has reason to be confident. The Sooners have won 16 straight November games dating back to 2014.\n\n\"This is how this one probably should come down to,\" Riley said. \"It's kind of a perfect script for us, going and playing on the road, tough environment, good football team, lot of things on the line. That's just the way we like it. These are the kind of games we've been able to win here for the last few years.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons can't afford to lean on Matt Bryant's powerful right leg this week.\n\nField goals won't be enough to keep pace against the high-scoring New Orleans Saints on Thursday night.\n\nBryant's four field goals provided all of Atlanta's scoring until Julio Jones caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Ryan with less than two minutes remaining against Dallas on Sunday. That touchdown tied the game before the Cowboys won 22-19 on Brett Maher's 42-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nThe Saints (9-1) have won nine straight . They led the NFL with their average of 37.8 points per game through Sunday's games.\n\n\"Field goals against them isn't going to cut it the way they're putting points up,\" coach Dan Quinn said Monday.\n\nThe Falcons (4-6) already have lost one shootout against the Saints, 43-37 in overtime on Sept. 23.\n\n\"When we get our chances, we have to convert,\" Ryan said Monday. \"We've been doing a good job of that for the most part of the year. ... We've got to be aggressive with our plays when we get our chances.\"\n\nQuinn said the Falcons can win a high-scoring game, even against the Saints.\n\n\"We are. We're equipped,\" Quinn said. \"Certainly when you're going against another team that's high scoring, it was no surprise to see that in the first game, either.\"\n\nJones has touchdown catches in three straight games, but the Falcons are in a scoring slump. They rank ninth in the league with their average of 26.3 points, but they've been held below 20 points in four games this season, including back-to-back losses to the Cowboys and Cleveland.\n\nAtlanta led Dallas 6-3 at halftime despite being held to 110 yards. For the game, the Falcons had 354 yards, their third-lowest total of the season.\n\nThe two straight losses were devastating to Atlanta's playoff hopes after it won three straight to reach .500.\n\nQuinn said the Falcons shouldn't be worried about their fading playoff hopes.\n\n\"Right now we have no luxury of looking at anything big picture,\" Quinn said. \"Right now there's one picture and that's New Orleans and that's Thursday.\"\n\nAtlanta managed only 80 yards rushing against Dallas. Tevin Coleman had only eight carries for 58 yards, even though he gained 11 or more yards on four runs. The eight carries were his second fewest of the season.\n\nQuinn said \"it's going to be important\" to establish the run. But he said he was only seeking balance, not a greater commitment to the run.\n\n\"When you're in the red zone against them you better finish with it in the end zone because they're certainly able to score and they've shown that this year,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether it's in the run game or it's in the pass game, it's about being able to find explosive games and being able to score. That's the name of the game when you're facing a team with an explosive offense like them.\"\n\nNOTES: The Falcons are attempting to determine if linebacker Deion Jones will play this week. Jones came off injured reserve last week after missing two months with a broken right foot but was inactive against Dallas . Quinn said Jones did not participate in the team's walkthrough practice on Monday, but instead was scheduled for work after the practice \"so we'll get a better assessment of where he's at.\" Quinn said the goal was to \"keep pushing and develop to see where he's at with his confidence level with his foot.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Roberts was one of many first responders who received tickets to the game as the Rams honored those impacted the past two weeks by the shooting at a Thousand Oaks bar and Southern California wildfires.\n\n\"The past couple weeks as a firefighter is the toughest I have experienced,\" Roberts said. \"To have one monumental event and have the active shooter was enough for one whole career. Then you add on a fire that impacts the exact same area, we just didn't have a chance to breathe.\"\n\nThe Rams train in Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting at a country music bar on Nov. 7. The next day a pair of wildfires broke out in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, forcing thousands of people to flee.\n\nRoberts got off work Monday morning. He then picked up his wife and son before heading to the LA Memorial Coliseum to enjoy the game with friends and colleagues. The game was originally scheduled to be played in Mexico City before the NFL moved it back to Los Angeles due to poor field conditions.\n\n\"To come together, take a deep breath and watch some good football is monumental,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe Thousand Oaks Titans youth football team, who trained at the Rams facility last Friday before its Pacific Youth Football League final, were also at the game after being treated to a pregame VIP tailgate party.\n\n\"It was very hard. We had kids coming in from as far as San Bernardino and Long Beach where they had been relocated. They came every night, just sometimes we didn't have fields to practice on,\" coach Steve Szakos said.\n\nSeveral of the 25 players \u2014 including quarterback Jacob Poley \u2014 were evacuated from their homes. Poley and his family have returned home, which is still standing.\n\n\"This has taught me to be more thankful and that nothing is for granted. You have to appreciate everything,\" the 14-year old Poley said.\n\nThe California Lutheran University Choir sang the National Anthem and were joined by first responders, who held the flag. Cal Lutheran alumnus Justin Meek, who was one of the 12 victims in the shooting, was a member of the choir for four years.\n\n\"They are honored to be singing and share in everything. For these students to go back out and be with other people is good,\" choir director Wyant Morton said.\n\nKaren and Jordan Helus, the wife and son of fallen Ventura County Sheriff Sergeant Ron Helus, lit the LA Coliseum torch prior to kickoff.\n\nVentura County Sheriff sergeants Jason Robarts and Dave Brantley both knew Helus for over 25 years and said that he would be overwhelmed with the outpouring of support for his family.\n\n\"Seeing everyone come out it makes you get through it a lot easier,\" Robarts said. \"The guy was one of the most tactically sound. If there was someone I wanted to go in and deal with a situation it was this guy. What is hard is we had the right person doing the job.\"\n\nDylan and Derek Adler, the 17- and 12-year old sons of Sean Adler, served as honorary water boys for the game. Sean Adler was a member of the security team at the bar.\n\n\"It's a way to get my mind off everything. It's almost overwhelming what people are willing to do for us,\" Dylan Adler said.\n\nKevin Demoff, the Rams Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Football Operations, said after the Rams 54-51 victory that the game was one way for the organization to show its appreciation to everyone.\n\n\"Right after the Borderline shooting you are trying to figure out how to lead your community and 12 hours later you are wondering if you are even going to have a community,\" he said. \"Our organization saw it not as a challenge but really an opportunity to put the best of Los Angeles and its people on display and I think you saw that tonight.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Hilton during the first half of an NFL football game against the Tennessee Titans, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck looks and sounds like his old self.\n\nHe's smiling, cherishing each snap. He's throwing touchdowns and winning games, staying healthy and chasing the kinds of milestones so many expected when the Indianapolis Colts made him the top overall pick in the 2012 draft.\n\nYes, at age 29, he's again having fun playing football.\n\n\"I was not in a good spot a year ago. I remember that. I am in a good spot now,\" Luck said in his trademark low-key tone following Sunday's 38-10 victory over Tennessee.\n\n\"My perspective is a little different toward this game. I appreciate things maybe a little bit more and I think that's pretty consistent with anybody who's been out for significant time with an injury.\"\n\nTwelve months ago, Luck was questioning everything from whether a second surgical procedure might alleviate the pain in his right shoulder to whether he would ever play another NFL game.\n\nHe had been shut down for the season by going on injured reserve and headed to Europe where he continued rehabbing in relative anonymity.\n\nHe spent Thanksgiving and Christmas in the Netherlands and when he returned home, just before Indy's season finale, Luck recounted some of the emotional challenges he faced during his prolonged recovery from a partially torn labrum in his throwing shoulder.\n\nEven then, things didn't go according to plan.\n\nThe only NFL coach Luck played for, Chuck Pagano, was fired a few days after his return. New England offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels accepted the Colts' coaching job then backed out, paving the way for Frank Reich to eventually take over while Luck's recovery essentially started over.\n\n\"We were throwing little \u2014 I don't even know what kind of balls they were \u2014 weighted balls, but they didn't have points on them,\" Reich said when asked to recount Luck's status when he first arrived in town.\n\n\"He was patient. I give him a lot of credit. He was really patient and he just said he was going to stay patient and trust the process and he did that. So that's a lot of credit to him.\"\n\nLuck didn't start throwing footballs until May, didn't start throwing at practice till mid-June and was kept on a strict pitch count at training camp.\n\nSo when the Colts started 1-5 and Luck was throwing short, some naturally wondered if Luck would ever regain his pre-injury form.\n\nA month later, there are no more doubts.\n\nLuck is in the midst of his best pro season with his completion rate (67.3 percent) and rating (101.8) at career highs and his 29 TD passes ranked second in the league to Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes. Luck has reduced the number of interceptions and forced passes and hasn't been sacked in five weeks, a total of 214 consecutive dropbacks.\n\nThe closest Tennessee even came to touching Luck on Sunday was when Luck tried to catch a touchdown pass from tight end Eric Ebron.\n\nAs a result, Indy (5-5) has won four straight to jump back into the playoff picture.\n\nIf Luck throws three more TD passes this weekend against Miami, he will tie Peyton Manning (eight) for the second-longest streak of consecutive games in league history with only New England's Tom Brady (10) ahead of him. And the deep throws have returned, too.\n\nBut the more people talk about Luck's gaudy numbers, the more focused Luck becomes on enjoying football and life.\n\n\"It's nice that the results are positive for us certainly, but I wouldn't say that I'm having more fun,\" he said. \"I'm just enjoying it. It's a great group of guys. It's a great group of coaches (and a) great building.\"\n\nIf the injury taught Luck anything, it's how quickly things can change in the NFL.\n\nHe lost right guard Matt Slauson to a season-ending back injury after Week 5 and now, in the midst of this remarkable streak, he may be missing center Ryan Kelly, who left Sunday's game with a knee injury in the fourth quarter. Reich said doctors are still evaluating Kelly's knee.\n\nThe loss of Kelly could be huge, given offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo recently said Kelly was playing at a Pro Bowl level and was one of the best centers in the league.\n\n\"We feel like Evan (Boehm) is ready if he's the one playing,\" Reich said Monday. \"Obviously Ryan is playing at a super high level. So I am not going to suggest that there wouldn't be any changes, but they would be very minimal.\"\n\nLuck understands what it will be like for Kelly if he can't play.\n\nAfter fighting through the physical pain and mental difficulty, the agony of defeat and the heartache of not being able to help out, Luck believes he has come out the other end as a better player.\n\n\"Everybody's got a story to tell. Certainly as a quarterback in this league, if you play for a couple years you're going to have gone through something,\" he said. \"I'd like to think that what happened, the result of that is probably the best thing for my career, the best thing that could've happened.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 While the Browns relaxed during the bye week, their fired former coach went back to work.\n\nHue Jackson's got a new gig.\n\nAnd this strange season in Cleveland will take another odd turn Sunday when the Browns face the Bengals and Jackson, who somehow survived an 0-16 season and was only briefly unemployed before being hired last week as a special assistant to Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis.\n\n\"It is Hue,\" defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah said.\n\nBut even though Jackson has changed back into Bengals stripes, the Browns aren't worried that their ex-coach on the sideline gives Cincinnati an added advantage.\n\n\"It's a divisional game!\" cried Browns safety Damarious Randall. \"We knew what they were doing before he went over there and they know exactly what we're going to do. At the end of the day, we're just going to go out and punch them in the mouth \u2014 straight up. That's exactly what you have to do on the road rivalry games. You have to go punch them in the mouth.\n\n\"If that's what we do, it doesn't matter what they have over there.\"\n\nJackson's same-season reunion against the Browns seems to be unprecedented. The NFL doesn't keep record of coaches facing their former teams.\n\n\"It is surprising,\" Browns guard Kevin Zeitler said.\n\nThe Browns (3-6-1) returned from their week off healthier than they've been all season, and there was even chatter inside the locker room about making a playoff run over the next six weeks.\n\nFirst, though, comes a somewhat awkward reunion with Jackson, who was fired on Oct. 29, a day after the Browns lost in Pittsburgh. Jackson's dismissal wasn't unexpected, given his struggles in Cleveland.\n\nBut his return to Cincinnati, where Jackson worked as offensive coordinator with the Bengals (5-5) under Lewis before he was hired by the Browns in 2016, has created two matchups in which the spotlight will be focused on him \u2014 whether he likes it or not.\n\nJackson had a good rapport with his players in Cleveland and several on Monday said they were thrilled he landed on his feet so quickly.\n\n\"It will feel a little awkward, but I'm very happy for coach Jackson,\" cornerback T.J. Carrie said. \"He is a great coach and a great person. It was not going to be a long time before he wasn't without a job, so it is really good just to be able to see him in a position where he is being able to control a lot of the things over there.\"\n\nJackson's intimate knowledge of Cleveland's personnel, schemes and playbook would seem to give the Bengals an almost unfair benefit.\n\nBut like Randall, Carrie said AFC North games are decided by which team executes better and not by any insider knowledge.\n\nCarrie doesn't think Jackson jumping teams makes any difference.\n\n\"These divisional games, we play year in and year out twice a year,\" he said. \"We know what they are going to do. They know what we are going to do. There is not really more scheme-wise that they can really dive into that we can surprise them with. It is all going to be about going out there and playing smash-mouth football.\"\n\nInterim Browns coach Gregg Williams said he was \"happy\" for Jackson and called him a \"very smart coach.\" However, he said the Browns won't change any of their play call or audibles and Jackson's familiarity with the Browns won't make much difference once the game starts.\n\n\"There is nothing private in our world anymore,\" Williams said. \"Every single clip of film is out there for everybody to watch. It is about execution. We have to go and execute. Even in practices, our guys know what the guys on the other side of the ball are going to be doing, but they get out-executed at times.\"\n\nRandall said Jackson's impact will be minimal.\n\nIt's not him vs. the Browns, it's the Bengals vs. the Browns.\n\n\"The game is on 11-on-11 up on the field and I don't feel like them having him over there is going to give them no type of edge,\" he said.\n\n\"It is what it is. They see what we do up on film. Whatever they need to know, they can watch film and see it. We don't got nothing to hide over here, we're here to play football and that's exactly what we're going to do.\"\n\nNOTES: Williams said he intends to interview for Cleveland's full-time job once the season ends. Last week, general manager John Dorsey said Williams had earned an interview with the job he's done since stepping in. ... The starting left tackle job remains an open competition between rookie Desmond Harrison and Greg Robinson, who started the past two games before the bye.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And though there is no easy way to answer that, it\u2019s becoming clearer by the week that the Jags made several bad decisions this offseason and prior that are finally starting to surface.\n\nMost fans agree that signing quarterback Blake Bortles to a three-year extension certainly belongs atop the list of bad decisions made by the current regime, as it now appears he\u2019s not the answer for their franchise. Despite that extension, there are some who feel that continuing with the fifth-year veteran past this season could have severe consequences, including former Florida Times-Union writer Vito Stellino.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s game he chimed in on an issue that resonated with plenty of fans: whether staying the course with Bortles and the offense would turn fans away after 2018.\n\nFor a team desperate for revenue sources, they have to think what effect on ticket sales will be if they bring Bortles back. And time to trash this run first philosophy to protect QB and find a QB who wins games. It's a passing league now. \u2014 Vito Stellino (@vitostellino) November 18, 2018\n\nEach of the statements by Stellino rings true, but those on the Jags\u2019 philosophy are worth addressing in a separate post.\n\nAs for his thoughts on the team\u2019s revenue, it\u2019s become very clear that owner Shad Khan has put emphasis on maximizing it, especially over the last year or two. If you need proof, just listen to the statements by Jags president Mark Lamping about the team and city needing more venues like Daily\u2019s Place, or read a post on Khan\u2019s statements about his attempt to buy Wembley Stadium. That\u2019s not to say the Jags are moving, especially when considering how hard they\u2019re now pushing for an entertainment district in Lot J, but it does show that Khan is trying to get as much money as possible off of the Jags from various sources.\n\nThe problem with that is he doesn\u2019t have the product on the field to warrant an increase in Jags revenue. Without having the answer \u2014 or at least consistent play \u2014 at the most important position in football, it will be hard to maximize revenue regardless of where the Jags play.\n\nSimply put, after five years of watching the team play, Khan\u2019s patience with Bortles may be wearing thin. As a businessman he has to know the fans ultimately won\u2019t accept it either, which could hurt all the progress the Jags have made in terms of ticket sales. For that reason, it could force his hand to get involved with the draft process, which he likely has done in the past.\n\nThe 2014 selection of Bortles, who played at Central Florida, may be proof the Jags aim for the splash signings that excite the local fan base. Additionally, it may not be a coincidence that the Jags have also drafted three other first-round players out of Florida universities. To put that in perspective, four of Dave Caldwell\u2019s six first-round selections came from Florida schools. That\u2019s enough to make you wonder if the eighth-year owner has his hands in the selection process, too.\n\nConsidering all of the above, Jags fans may be in store for a change at quarterback next season not just because of the effect on sales, but also because it\u2019s time to explore other options after five years of little progress from Bortles. Basically, it\u2019s a change that would be a win-win for everyone as it could have a positive impact on the team\u2019s performance, revenue and the fan base if addressed correctly.\n\nAs for Bortles, it certainly isn\u2019t out of the realm of possibilities that he could be returning in 2019 as he will be a $21 million cap hit next season. On top of that, Caldwell seems to believe in him. However, Khan knows as well as anyone that keeping Bortles as a starter will almost certainly have a negative impact on the fan base. That could lead to a dispute between ownership and management, and the odds of ownership winning that battle are very high."}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "USA TODAY, USA TODAY", "title": "Multiple in critical condition after Chicago hospital shooting", "description": "Multiple people are wounded, including a police officer, after a shooting at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, police said.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2018/11/20/multiple-critical-condition-after-chicago-hospital-shooting/2062299002/", "urlToImage": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/20/USAT/699c2b18-8065-4a1e-9eba-611835688eaa-VPC_CHICAGO_HOSPITAL_SHOOTING_DESK_THUMB.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:41:32Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "usa-today", "name": "USA Today"}, "author": "Jamie L.

The meetings were an 11th-hour attempt to help employees with 12 or more years at GM decide whether they want to take a voluntary buyout.\n\nGM employees who talked to the Press did so on condition of anonymity because their jobs are at risk.\n\nMore: GM memo: We must cut costs, can't wait to see what happens in industry\n\nMore: GM offers buyouts to 18,000 salaried workers, says layoffs possible\n\nThe meetings were presented as informational and GM managers told employees, \"Nobody\u2019s under pressure to sign up or fear they\u2019ll be threatened with firing or termination if they don\u2019t sign up,\" said a former senior-level GM manager who spoke with several employees who attended the meetings.\n\n\u201cGM (leaders) haven\u2019t decided what they\u2019re going to do if there is a shortfall \u2013 if they don\u2019t hit 7,000,\" the source said. \"They said they may start the process in mid-January for involuntary releases.\u201d\n\nA GM spokesman would not confirm that date or that GM would pursue involuntary cuts. He said he was not aware of any company-wide meetings last week. If there were meetings, they would have been staff by staff, he said. He also said he was not aware of any figures or targets the company has set or would share with workers.\n\nGM has said it must trim costs amid the rising prices of raw materials and plateauing car sales. So on Oct. 31, GM CEO Mary Barra sent an email to all 50,000 salaried GM employees in North America saying the automaker is offering voluntary buyouts to the 17,700 salaried employees who have 12 years or more with GM. Most global executives are also eligible.\n\nGM has said if it cannot achieve enough cost savings between the buyouts and other cost-cutting measures, it might consider involuntary job cuts after the first of the year.\n\nOne adviser who has been working with several GM employees and managers said the process of selecting the voluntary and involuntary job cuts will happen quickly.\n\n\u201cGM will complete the voluntary buyouts by Nov. 29. The managers we\u2019ve talked to are already making their list and will select their cuts in January,\u201d said the adviser, who did not want to compromise his clients\u2019 identities by having his name published.\n\nHe said on Jan. 15 GM will announce the involuntary job eliminations and \u201cwalk people out.\u201d\n\nThe buyout packages include six months pay and six months of health care coverage, the GM spokesman confirmed. Those who opt to take the buyout have until the end of the year to continue with GM, with severance effective Jan. 1.\n\nThe six-month pay and six-month health care is the same severance a GM employee with 12 years or more experience would receive if they were involuntarily terminated, GM employees said. That's why some inside the company say interest in the buyout has been lukewarm.\n\nGM has said the move is being done to speed up work on developing electrified vehicles.\n\nGM will be \"further integrating our Global Propulsion organization with vehicle engineering\" and boosting the total number of engineering resources dedicated to electric vehicles, GM spokesman Mike Albano said in a statement.\n\nMore: Why GM is moving 3,000 workers from Pontiac to Warren\n\nEconomist Jon Gabrielsen, an adviser to the auto industry, has said he expects that 7,000 salaried jobs will be cut from GM in metro Detroit, \"over the course of an auto downturn in the next two to three years, plus as much as another 7,000 in hourly based on how much sales soften.\"\n\nThe UAW contract for hourly workers with Detroit's automakers expires in September 2019.\n\nCrosstown rival Ford also is working to reduce its salaried workforce.

(AP Photo/Danny Karnik) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Ezekiel Elliott still had five more games to watch last year after the Dallas Cowboys lost in Atlanta at the beginning of their star running back's six-game suspension over domestic violence allegations.\n\nAfter playing a huge role in helping the Cowboys thrust themselves into the NFC East race with a win at the Falcons, Elliott will be right in the middle of trying to get them back to the playoffs instead of having to watch a season go south without the 2016 NFL rushing champ.\n\n\"We can't lose this grit. We can't lose the way we're going out there and working every day. We can't lose the way we're going out there and competing on Sundays,\" Elliott said after a 22-19 win over the Falcons . \"We've got to build on that.\"\n\nIt's quite a two-game streak to build on for Dallas (5-5): road victories over the past two Super Bowl participants from the NFC, before which the Cowboys were winless away from home and teetering on playoff extinction just halfway through the season.\n\nAnd it set up a Thanksgiving showdown against Washington (6-4) on Thursday with the division lead on the line.\n\n\"That's all that much more reason to appreciate how this team's come together and be where we are right now,\" owner and general manager Jerry Jones said. \"We (Cowboys and Redskins) don't always play for a title, but to some degree, we're playing for it out there Thanksgiving day.\"\n\nBoth victories featured winning drives to answer tying fourth-quarter touchdowns \u2014 first against defending champion Philadelphia . The Cowboys actually answered two tying TDs in the final quarter against the Eagles.\n\nElliott had two of his five 100-yard rushing games and combined for 388 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns in wins over the Eagles and Falcons.\n\nInstead of wondering what they'll do without that kind of production, the Cowboys are feeding off growing confidence in an offensive line that is finally absorbing changes and the residual benefits of new No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper, acquired in a trade when Dallas was 3-4 going into its open week.\n\n\"We've talked about that for a couple weeks now,\" quarterback Dak Prescott said. \"The way teams are playing us and the way they're playing Amari and adjusting their coverages has given us favorable boxes. The offensive line is doing a great job of taking advantage of that. Zeke's finding holes and making people miss.\"\n\nPrescott was sacked a career-high eight times in his first game without Elliott last year against the Falcons, the start of a three-game losing streak.\n\nAlthough the Cowboys won the final three without their running back, the margin for error was gone. A loss to Seattle in Elliott's return eliminated Dallas a year after Prescott and Elliott led the team to an NFC-best 13 wins.\n\nThe reward for the current two-game surge is three straight home games, although one-loss New Orleans is the middle opponent. After an extended break following the Saints game, the Eagles visit. Philadelphia's hopes of a repeat are fading coming off a blowout loss at New Orleans.\n\n\"We played our way back into this thing, but this one is every bit as big as the last two,\" executive vice president of personnel Stephen Jones said on his radio show Monday. \"So, we got to pull this off and it's great we put ourselves back into a position to be relevant here.\"\n\nThe formula from the two road wins seems to be the best hope for the Cowboys. The defense keeps them in games, as it has done several times this season, while the offense makes the winning plays late.\n\nOne of the fourth-quarter TDs against Atlanta was set up by rookie linebacker Leighton Vander Esch's second interception in as many games.\n\n\"We're gelling at the right time,\" Prescott said. \"We're complementing the defense. They get turnovers. We're turning them into points and when you do that, you give yourself a chance. We know we're going to be in every game.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It's 11:12, and OU still sucks.\"\n\n\"Breckyn Hager violated the Conference rule that prohibits coaches, student-athletes, athletic department staff and university personnel from making negative comments about other member institutions,\" Bowlsby wrote in his reprimand, where he added the conference \"expected\" a public apology.\n\nHager obliged.\n\n\"I have the utmost respect for the University of Oklahoma and their football program and know a number of players on their team, and I want to apologize to them,\" he wrote in his statement.\n\n\"I want to represent myself, my family, my football program, my University, and the Big 12 Conference in the best possible way.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Kerryon Johnson has been a bright spot for Detroit in a season with plenty of struggles.\n\nNow the Lions are finally coming off a win \u2014 but Johnson exited that victory with a left knee injury.\n\nDetroit's rookie running back went down in the second half of Sunday's win over the Carolina Panthers, and although the Lions had to be pleased to snap a three-game losing streak, they face a daunting task over the next couple of weeks.\n\nDetroit has a short turnaround before its Thanksgiving game against Chicago \u2014 not a great situation for a player recovering from an injury \u2014 and then the Lions face the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nJohnson has boosted Detroit's previously moribund running game. He has rushed for 641 yards on the season \u2014 more than anyone on the Lions managed last season \u2014 but it's not clear when he'll be able to play again.\n\n\"Not sure what his situation is, but we've dealt with it in other areas on our team before. Just next guy up, let's go,\" quarterback Matthew Stafford said.\n\n\"We have a bunch of guys in that room that are talented. If they need to play more, they'll play more. If they don't, then we'll roll with what we have.\"\n\nDetroit was already without wide receiver Marvin Jones (knee) against Carolina. Then Johnson left the game, but the Lions were able to win anyway thanks to some big catches by receiver Kenny Golladay.\n\nDetroit (4-6) still faces an uphill climb to make the playoffs. Its next two games are at home but against first-place teams. If Johnson isn't available, the path becomes even tougher.\n\n\"We'll take it day by day. We'll see how it goes,\" coach Matt Patricia said Monday. \"We just have to stay even keel with all of it and make sure we prepare like we're just pushing forward.\"\n\nJohnson leads the Lions with 118 carries. LeGarrette Blount has 78 and Stafford has 21. No other Detroit player has more than nine. Blount is averaging only 2.3 yards per attempt.\n\n\"Certainly, Kerryon has a skillset that's great, just like a lot of our other guys do,\" Patricia said. \"I think we have good players, we have dynamic guys, guys that can make plays in different ways and it's not cookie-cutter. Football is not that way. When you have a different player that's in and in the same position, it doesn't mean that they can do the same thing. You have to be able to adjust.\"\n\nThe Lions could always bring in someone from outside the organization to help at running back, but there's not much time before the next game.\n\nRunning back Zach Zenner, who signed with the Lions earlier this month, could have a bigger role now. Zenner has played sporadically for Detroit since the 2015 season \u2014 he had 88 carries in 2016.\n\n\"No matter what it means for me, it's always disappointing to see a teammate get injured,\" Zenner said. \"Kerryon's a good teammate, good person, good friend. So it's certainly tough to see him have an injury. I don't know what the situation is. Hopefully he'll be back, ready to go, but if not, I'll be ready to do whatever I'm asked.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Sam Darnold is out of his walking boot and has started jogging. Next step for the New York Jets quarterback: getting back on the field.\n\nDarnold sat out the team's first practice after its bye-week break while he continues to recover from a foot strain.\n\nThe rookie wore a green Jets cap and sweats as practice began Monday, and mostly watched from the side while Josh McCown and Davis Webb threw passes in individual drills.\n\n\"The foot is really good,\" Darnold said, adding that he's experiencing no pain. \"I feel really good. Like I said last week, just following protocol right now, but it feels really good. (I've) been walking around on it fine. It's just stable progressions throughout the week, I think.\"\n\nDarnold was injured during the Jets' 13-6 loss at Miami on Nov. 4. McCown started in his place the following week, a 41-10 defeat at home to Buffalo.\n\nIt's uncertain if Darnold will be able to start against New England on Sunday.\n\n\"Right now, it's status quo,\" coach Todd Bowles said. \"Day to day, week to week.\"\n\nThe Jets aren't required to submit an injury report until Wednesday, after the first official practice of the week is held. Bowles said he and the team would have to see if Darnold might be able to participate, but insisted he had no gut feeling.\n\n\"Not at this time, I don't,\" Bowles said. \"Honestly, I don't.\"\n\nIf Darnold can't go, it would be McCown starting against the Patriots at home. The 39-year-old veteran struggled in his season debut, along with the rest of the offense, in the loss to the Bills. McCown was 17 of 34 for 135 yards and two interceptions.\n\nDarnold hopes to be able to practice at some point this week, but insists he'll follow the direction of head athletic trainer John Mellody and his staff. That might mean sitting out a second straight game and missing his first matchup with Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and Co.\n\n\"I think the idea of going up against him and the Patriots, Coach Belichick, all those guys, it's a cool thing,\" Darnold said, \"especially with me growing up in the era where they really controlled the whole NFL, for the most part.\n\n\"So it's really cool to be able to have a chance to go up against them, if I get the opportunity this weekend.\"\n\nDarnold, the No. 3 overall draft pick this year, leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and struggled in his past three games before the injury \u2014 including being picked off four times against the Dolphins. That has done nothing to shake the confidence of his coaches or teammates.\n\nThe 21-year-old signal caller also remains positive about the experience he has gained in his first season.\n\n\"I had some time to think about it,\" Darnold said. \"I thought throughout the year I've been progressing and getting better. Yeah, the Miami game, it wasn't a step in the wrong direction, (but) it was just a little bump in the road, I think. I think other than that, I've been continuing to improve every single week, and I'm just going to try to do that if I get the chance to play.\"\n\nAfter a whirlwind of a transition from college to the draft to the NFL during the past several months, Darnold used the bye-week break to catch his breath and spend some time with his friends and visiting Manhattan.\n\nThat meant even passing on extra film study for a few days.\n\n\"When I was here doing rehab and all of that stuff, I was watching film a little bit, but for the most part it was a good time to get away from it, reset my mind,\" Darnold said. \"I knew when I got back today, I was going to get after it.\"\n\nTeams have different views on how to handle rookie quarterbacks , and whether it's best to start them right away or have them sit a bit and absorb things from the sideline.\n\nDarnold won the starting job out of training camp and was under center in Week 1 for the Jets. Given his struggles \u2014 two TDs, seven INTs \u2014 in his past three games, some fans and media thought perhaps the injury might have been a blessing for Darnold so he could watch a bit rather than play.\n\n\"No, I want to be out there,\" Darnold said. \"I want to be out there playing with the guys, but I think the biggest thing for me was to just watch Josh go about a game week. I think watching him on the field, watching him on the practice field helped me out a lot. So in terms of that, it was good.\n\n\"But I definitely want to be out there with my guys.\"\n\nNOTES: WR Robby Anderson (ankle) and LG James Carpenter (undisclosed) were among those who did not dress for practice. C Spencer Long (knee/finger) participated after missing New York's previous game. ... The Jets signed DL Destiny Vaeao to the practice squad.
