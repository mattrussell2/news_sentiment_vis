A gated outdoor courtyard can accommodate hundreds more.\n\nThe city's thriving factories are always looking for workers, and several thousand Haitian migrants who were turned away at the U.S. border have found jobs and settled here in the last two years, but the prospect of thousands more destitute Central Americans has posed new challenges.\n\nDelia Avila, director of Tijuana's family services department, who is helping spearhead the city's response, said migrants who can arrange legal status in Mexico are welcome to stay.\n\n\"Tijuana is a land of migrants. Tijuana is a land that has known what it is to embrace thousands of co-nationals and also people from other countries,\" Avila said.\n\nMexican law enforcement was out in force in a city that is suffering an all-time-high homicide rate. A group of about 50 migrants, mostly women and children, walked through downtown streets Thursday from the city shelter to a breakfast hall under police escort.\n\nAs buses from western and central Mexico trickled in overnight and into the morning, families camped inside the bus terminal and waited for word on where they could find a safe place to sleep. One shelter designed for 45 women and children was housing 100; another designed for 100 had nearly 200.\n\nMany endured the evening chill to sleep at an oceanfront park with a view of San Diego office towers and heavily armed U.S. Border Patrol agents on the other side of a steel-bollard fence.\n\nOscar Zapata, 31, reached the Tijuana bus station at 2 a.m. from Guadalajara with his wife and their three children, ages 4, 5 and 12, and headed to the breakfast hall, where migrants were served free beef and potatoes.\n\nBack home in La Ceiba, Honduras, he was selling pirated CDs and DVDs in the street when two gangs demanded \"protection\" money. He had already seen a colleague gunned down on a street corner because he couldn't pay. He said gangs called him and his wife on their cellphones and showed up at their house, threatening to kidnap his daughter and force her into prostitution if he didn't pay.\n\nWhen he heard about the caravan on the TV news last month, he didn't think twice.\n\n\"It was the opportunity to get out,\" Zapata said.\n\nZapata said he hopes to join a brother in Los Angeles but has not yet decided on his next move. Like many others, he planned to wait in Tijuana for others in the caravan to arrive and gather more information before seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nByron Jose Blandino, a 27-year-old bricklayer from Nicaragua who slept in the converted gymnasium, said he wanted to request asylum but not until he could speak with someone well-versed in U.S. law and asylum procedures.\n\n\"The first thing is to wait,\" Blandino said. \"I do not want to break the laws of any country. If I could enter in a peaceful manner, that would be good.\n\nTo claim asylum in San Diego, migrants enter their names in a tattered notebook held together by duct tape and managed by the migrants in a plaza outside the entry to the main border crossing.\n\nOn Thursday, migrants who registered six weeks ago were getting their names called. The waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 names and stands to become much longer with the caravans.\n\nFrancisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months in Mexico at current processing rates. For that reason, the state has asked Mexican federal authorities to encourage others in caravans to go to other border cities.\n\nRueda reported that about 1,750 migrants from the caravan had now reached Tijuana. Private shelters can house about 700, and the city-owned gym and sports complex has a capacity of 1,000 with the potential to expand to 3,000.\n\n\"This is not a crisis,\" he told reporters, while allowing that \"this is an extraordinary situation.\"\n\nThere are 7,000 jobs available in the state for those who can obtain legal status in Mexico, Rueda said. He touted Tijuana's integration of Haitian migrants over the last two years and the state's relatively low unemployment rate.\n\nThe migrants have met some resistance from local residents, about 100 of whom confronted a similar-size group of Central Americans who were camped out by the U.S. border fence Wednesday night.\n\n\"You're not welcome\" and \"Get out!\" the locals said, marching up to the group.\n\nPolice kept the two sides apart.\n\nVladimir Cruz, a migrant from El Salvador, shook his head and said: \"These people are the racists, because 95 percent of people here support us.\"\n\n\"It is just this little group. ... They are uncomfortable because we're here,\" Cruz said.\n\nPlayas de Tijuana, as the area is known, is an upper-middle-class enclave, and residents appeared worried about crime and sanitation. One protester shouted, \"This isn't about discrimination, it is about safety!\"\n\nThere are real questions about how the city of more than 1.6 million will manage to handle the migrant caravans working their way through Mexico, which may total 10,000 people in all.\n\n\"No city in the world is prepared to receive this number of migrants,\" said Tijuana social development director Mario Osuna, adding that the city hopes Mexico's federal government \"will start legalizing these people immediately\" so they can get jobs and earn a living.\n\nDozens of gay and transgender migrants in the caravan were already lining up Thursday to submit asylum claims, though it was unclear how soon they would be able to do so.\n\nThe caravan has fragmented somewhat in recent days in a final push to the border, with some migrants moving rapidly in buses and others falling behind.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds were stranded for most of the day at a gas station in Navojoa, some 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from Tijuana.\n\n\"We were dropped here at midnight ... in the middle of nowhere, where supposedly some buses were going to come pick us up, but nothing,\" Alejandra Grisel Rodriguez of Honduras told The Associated Press by phone. \"We are without water, without food.\"\n\nAfter about 12 hours seven buses began arriving to collect the migrants, Rodriguez said, but they quickly filled up.\n\n\"We would need at least 40 or 50,\" she said.\n\nJesus Edmundo Valdez, coordinator of firefighters and civil defense in Navojoa, said Wednesday that authorities were providing food, water and medical attention to migrants there. His phone rang unanswered Thursday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza in Culiacan, Mexico, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "17 Democrats vow opposition to Nancy Pelosi's speaker bid", "description": "Are Democrats in disarray over their impending takeover of the House?

Instead, the county's results from last Tuesday\u2019s election will stand until manual recount totals in the state's closely contested Senate race come in Sunday at noon.\n\nGOP Senate candidate Rick Scott's campaign charged that embattled Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes intentionally submitted late results so that they would be invalidated. In the recount, Scott's Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, lost more votes than Scott -- meaning Scott would have seen a net gain of 779 votes if Snipes hadn't been late.\n\nThe news of the bungled ballot count comes after Snipes boasted about never missing a deadline.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be at this point,\u201d she said Thursday afternoon.\n\nLater, Snipes acknowledged that \"the results were in progress when I came out and made\" that statement.\n\n\"An election like the one we just finished almost has so many moving parts and so many components,\" Snipes said. \"I'm pleased that we were able to accomplish what we did accomplish in the period of time that was available.\"\n\nOther Broward County officials were more blunt.\n\n\u201cBasically, I just worked my ass off for nothing,\u201d said Joseph D\u2019Alessandro, Broward County\u2019s election planning and development director.\n\nD\u2019Alessandro said he had a hard time uploading the results in time because he wasn\u2019t familiar with the website used to send them to the secretary of state.\n\n\"Basically, I just worked my ass off for nothing.\" \u2014 Broward election official Joseph D\u2019Alessandro\n\n\u201cWe uploaded to the state two minutes late so the state has chosen not to use our machine recount results,\u201d D\u2019Alessandro said in the surprise announcement. \u201cThey are going to use our first unofficial results as our second unofficial results.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the Florida governor's race, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis holds a sizable 33,683-vote lead over Democrat Andrew Gillum following the machine recount, a 0.41-percentage point margin high enough under state law to avoid a mandatory manual recount that triggers when a race is within 0.25 percentage points. Gillum, who gained only 1 vote on DeSantis in the recount, still has not conceded in the race.\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott holds a 12,603-vote lead over Nelson after the machine recount, a slim 0.15-percentage point advantage that automatically triggers a manual recount.\n\nAs of the 3 p.m. deadline for a machine recount of three close statewide contests, nearly all of Florida\u2019s 67 counties \u2014except Palm Beach and Hillsborough counties \u2014 had reported updated results. Hillsborough County intentionally refused to report its recount figures, which would have awarded Scott approximately 150 votes, because the recount turned up 846 fewer votes in total than the county's initial tally.\n\n\"Even though we achieved 99.84 percent success in our recount effort, we are not willing to accept that votes go unreported,\" Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Craig Latimer told reporters. \"For that reason, the Canvassing Board has decided that the first unofficial results will stand as our second unofficial.\"\n\nTRUMP SAYS 'DISASTER' SNIPES SHOULD BE FIRED, SUGGESTS SHE'S INTENTIONALLY SABOTAGING REPUBLICANS\n\nBroward County has been under the microscope since the recount was ordered Saturday, and Thursday\u2019s apparent mistake was just the latest in a series of missteps for the largely Democratic county. Last week, a judge sided with Scott's campaign in a lawsuit in which he alleged Snipes had violated state public records law and the Florida Constitution by withholding critical ballot information.\n\nEarlier this year, a judge found that Snipes had illegally destroyed ballots in a 2016 congressional contest, leading the secretary of state's office to assign election monitors to supervise her office.\n\n\u201cIt would have been both surprising and shocking if they had actually started [the recount] on time and completed it on time,\u201d Cathy Lerman, principal of the Lerman Law Firm in Florida, told Fox News.\n\nProtesters have been camped outside Broward\u2019s Lauderhill recount site for six days.\n\nSome carried signs that read, \u201cCorrupt Snipes!!! Lock Her Up!\u201d \u201cBusted Brenda\u201d and \u201cI trust [Michael] Avenatti more than Brenda!\u201d while shouting at election officials, counter-protesters and the news media.\n\n\u201cWhen they call this woman incompetent, they\u2019re wrong,\u201d President Trump told The Daily Caller on Wednesday, referring to Snipes. \u201cShe\u2019s very competent but in a bad way.\u201d\n\nSince the recall was officially ordered on Saturday, Broward elections staff have had to sort through more than 3.5 million pages of ballots before they actually started to count votes. Several counties, like Miami-Dade, planned ahead and finished much faster than Broward.\n\nNow that the machine recount deadline has passed, counties will have until noon on Sunday Nov. 18 to submit results from a manual recount in the Senate race between Nelson and Scott.\n\nPalm Beach Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher testified by phone on Thursday that she expects her county, whose recount machines experienced systemic hardware and software issues this week, to complete counting votes in the Senate race in the \u201cwee hours of today or tomorrow,\" and to submit updated numbers in time for the Nov. 18 deadline.\n\nThese updated numbers would count as long as they are submitted on time, even if Palm Beach County officials are not finished recounting in other races. There would only be a default to the original election numbers if no new numbers across the board are submitted by Nov. 18.\n\nAdditional rulings on several court cases initiated by both parties could come overnight or early tomorrow.\n\n\"We have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election,\u201d Judge Mark E. Walker, the Obama-appointed chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, said Thursday. \u201cYet we still chose not to fix it.\u201d\n\nJudge Walker, who said he would be working deep into the night reviewing several cases pending before him, denied one motion in open court just late Thursday evening: a request to release a list of names of voters whose ballots have been set aside because their signatures did not match the ones on file with state officials.\n\nFor example, some voters' mail-in ballots were flagged and set aside because the signatures on their ballots were substantially different from the signatures the voters separately provided the Department of Motor Vehicles to obtain a license or other official document.\n\nJudge Walker has extended the deadline for voters whose ballots had been rejected for signature issues to resolve the problem with election officials until 5 p.m. on Saturday, so that their votes can be counted. But on Thursday he said he would not allow the court to be \"used\" by either party to \"target\" individual voters, which he predicted would happen if he took the additional step of releasing the voters' identities.\n\nFox News' Peter Doocy and Faith Mangan contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Paradise evacuees face uncertain future, norovirus outbreak", "description": "Survivors of the Camp Fire are coming to terms with the staggering aftermath of California's deadliest and most destructive fire; Claudia Cowan reports from the devastated town of Paradise.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5967602148001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/15/640/360/694940094001_5967613902001_5967602148001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:23:26Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "May's Brexit plan prompts backlash and resignations", "description": "British Prime Minister Theresa May thought she had a deal on the process of leaving the European Union, but now she faces dissention and a challenge to her leadership; senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports from London.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5967611280001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/15/640/360/694940094001_5967608823001_5967611280001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:17:26Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump touts accomplishments; bashes Mueller probe", "description": "President Trump renews attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation with a series of vitriolic tweets; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5967600410001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/15/640/360/694940094001_5967607926001_5967600410001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:12:46Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Democratic factions oppose Pelosi's bid for speaker", "description": "Fox News has confirmed at least 17 Democrats have signed onto a letter saying they won't support Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5967606777001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/15/640/360/694940094001_5967608775001_5967606777001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:09:58Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Shoppers splurge ahead of the holiday shopping season", "description": "The government says retail sales jumped 0.8 percent last month, more than expected.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5967605588001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/15/640/360/694940094001_5967608829001_5967605588001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:09:16Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Lawsuits, missed deadline and no declared winners in Florida", "description": "The recount deadline comes and goes in Florida: Are we any closer to learning who won the Sunshine State's Senate and governor's races?

Coleman told a Louisville news conference. Bush was previously indicted in state court on two counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and wanton endangerment. He pleaded not guilty at an arraignment hearing earlier this month.\n\nColeman said Bush faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. He added that Justice Department officials have not decided whether to pursue the death penalty.\n\n\"There is no place for hate-fueled violence in our community or Commonwealth,\" Coleman said. \"Federal, state, and local law enforcement stand united to ensure that Kentuckians can shop, worship, or attend school without the specter of fear.\"\n\n\"The crimes alleged in this indictment are horrific,\" Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker said in a statement. \"We cannot and will not tolerate violence motivated by racism. We will bring the full force of the law against these and any other alleged hate crimes against fellow Americans of any race ... Today we take one step closer to justice for the victims and their families and one step closer to helping this community try to heal.\"\n\nAuthorities say Bush tried to enter a historically black church before heading with his handgun to the Jeffersontown Kroger on the afternoon of Oct. 24. According to investigators, Bush walked into the store, pulled out a handgun and shot 69-year-old Maurice Stallard in the back of the head and kept shooting him multiple times while Stallard was on the ground. Bush then holstered his gun, walked outside and killed 67-year-old Vicki Lee Jones in the store parking lot.\n\nProsecutors say Bush was charged with attempted murder based on a shootout the suspect had in the parking lot with an armed bystander, Dominic Rozier. Rozier told media outlets this week that he and his wife saw Jones get shot in the parking lot, and he drew his gun after Bush pointed a gun at him. The two exchanged gunfire but neither were hit, and Bush fled the parking lot.\n\nAnother witness, Ed Harrell, told the Courier-Journal newspaper that when he asked Bush what was happening, the suspect answered: \"Don't shoot me.

She was forced to fly in mechanics to fix the issue - setting back recount efforts there.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we were very close two nights ago and then our machines went down,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for lack of human effort.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, she said she was in \u201cprayer mode\u201d to get just one of four recounts in on time. The county\u2019s machines went idle Wednesday night because Bucher said her technical manager had been on the scene for 42 hours straight and needed a break.\n\n\u201cYou see that we\u2019re working 24/7,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual request to make of your staff. You know, can you leave your kids behind? Can you stay here and I\u2019ll feed you sub sandwiches and pizza? And you\u2019ll work your brains out and we\u2019re trying to meet a deadline that, really, reasonably shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\nBucher\u2019s chaotic handling of the recount has resulted in some calling for her to step down. It\u2019s a suggestion she has pushed back against.\n\n\u201cThis is our democracy and I am here to count every vote and I will take the time that\u2019s required and you can see I haven\u2019t been home for three days,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find somebody else that has the dedication.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Ken Detzner said earlier this week that if counties fail to meet the 3 p.m. deadline, they should continue counting so that final tallies can be included in official state results.\n\nFlorida law mandates that any election decided by 0.5 percent or less will trigger a recount.\n\nThe undecided races include the state\u2019s Senate race, which pits incumbent Nelson, a Democrat, against outgoing Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, and the gubernatorial race between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nFlorida officially declared a recount Saturday and since then, the state\u2019s 67 county election offices have been racing against time running their ballots through the tallying machine. Some counties only have a few thousand votes but the likes of Miami-Dade has more than 800,000 and Broward clocks in around 700,000.\n\nBoth Miami-Dade and Broward finished their machine recounts ahead of the deadline.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal ruling Thursday morning threw another wrench into Florida\u2019s recount efforts.\n\nJudge Walker gave nearly 5,000 people who had issues with matching signatures an extra two days to correct their mistake. His ruling was part of a suit brought by Nelson's campaign and Democratic Party officials.\n\n\u201cThis is a case about the precious and fundamental right to vote \u2013 the right preservative of all other rights. And it is about the right of a voter to have his or her own vote counted,\u201d Walker wrote in his 34-page ruling.\n\nHe added, \u201cThere are dozens of reasons a signature mismatch may occur, even when the individual signing is in fact the voter. Disenfranchisement of approximately 5,000 voters based on signature mismatch is a substantial burden.\u201d\n\nWalker ruled that election supervisors must require all voters who were notified they have mismatches signatures correct the problem by 5 p.m. Saturday \u2013 which is the same day the results of the manual recount are due.\n\nNelson\u2019s lead attorney, Marc Elias, took to Twitter to praise the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cBig victory in our Florida signature mismatch lawsuit,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cFederal court extends deadline for voters to \u2018cure\u2019 their rejected ballots.\n\nGov. Rick Scott\u2019s lawyers immediately appealed the ruling and said they were \u201cconfident we will prevail in the Eleventh Circuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Nelson\u2019s high-priced Washington lawyers went to court to argue against a process that they previously argued for,\u201d Scott\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Lauren Schenone wrote in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that Marc Elias is currently making THE EXACT OPPOSITE ARGUMENT in a similar case in Arizona. This also follows recent reports of the Democratic party encouraging and instructing to try to vote days after the legal deadline,\u201d she added."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "What's next for Palm Beach after missing recount deadline?", "description": "Election law attorney Brian Silber on the legal fallout and next steps for the Florida recount.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5967570428001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/15/640/360/694940094001_5967576740001_5967570428001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:28:07Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Gregg Re", "title": "Acting AG Whitaker doesn't see need to recuse himself 'legally or factually,' Graham says - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Acting AG Whitaker doesn't see need to recuse himself 'legally or factually,' Graham says Fox News Despite mounting pressure from top Democrats, Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker sees no reason to recuse himself from overseeing Special Counsel Ro\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-ag-whitaker-doesnt-feel-need-to-recuse-himself-legally-or-factually-graham-says", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/14/694940094001_5966892363001_5966878777001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:20:53Z", "content": "Despite mounting pressure from top Democrats, Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker sees no reason to recuse himself from overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, South Carolina Republican Sen.

Lindsey Graham exclusively told Fox News after meeting Whitaker Thursday on Capitol Hill.\n\nPresident Trump last week named Whitaker to replace fired former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, despite -- or perhaps because of -- his previous writings, including an op-ed in which he argued Mueller was \"dangerously close\" to exceceding his statutory authority.\n\n\"He believed he did not have a reason to recuse himself legally or factually,\" Graham told Fox News. \"Nothing I\u2019ve seen would require him to be recused. I think he's got the background and the judgment to be able to fulfill this job.\"\n\n\"When it comes to the Mueller investigation, I am very confident he will handle it professionally,\" Graham continued. \"There's a chain of command. There's a regular order in terms of how you deal with special counsels. And I'm sure you will follow regular order, and will do nothing outside of what the law would require.\u201d\n\nGraham's comments came as tensions flared in the Senate over Whitaker's appointment. On Wednesday, retiring Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake vowed to pull support for all federal judicial nominees -- including 21 pending in the Judiciary Committee and 32 awaiting a vote on the Senate floor -- unless the Senate's GOP leadership permits consideration of legislation to expand protections for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's job.\n\n\"He believed he did not have a reason to recuse himself legally or factually.\" \u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham on Matt Whitaker\n\nReacting to that dramatic move, Graham -- who co-authored the legislation to protect Mueller -- said there was no need to rachet up the stakes.\n\n\"I do not want to hold judges hostage,\" Graham said. \"Having talked to Mr. Whitaker and the president, I have zero concern that Mr. Mueller's job is in jeopardy.\"\n\nHe added: \"I authored the legislation I think it'd be good for the country in perpetuity to make sure that special counsels have some protection. But as to Mr. Mueller, I see no reason to believe that he's going to be dismissed by President Trump or Mr. Whitaker.\"\n\nFLAKE VOWS TO TORPEDO GOP JUDICIAL NOMINEES UNLESS MUELLER PROTECTIONS ADDED\n\nWhitaker did not reply specifically to Fox News inquiries about whether he felt he should recuse himself.\n\n\"It\u2019s been an honor and privilege to work with the men and women of the Department of Justice,\" Whitaker said. \"You know in the first week, I\u2019ve been able to deliver the commission for Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh\u2019s investiture, represent the Department of Justice at the Veterans\u2019 Ceremony at Arlington Cemetery on Sunday -- so I\u2019ve really been having an enjoyable time, but most importantly we\u2019re just going to stick to the mission and keep soldiering forward every day trying to accomplish the mission of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion Wednesday supporting Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nIn a lawsuit seeking an injunction reversing Whitaker's appointment, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh argued that the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, should have assumed the role of attorney general under a department statute. Frosh also argued Whitaker's appointment violated the Constitution's appointments clause, which mandates that the president seek the \"advice and consent\" of the Senate prior to appointing a high-level official like Whitaker.\n\nBut its opinion, the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel countered that the president\u2019s temporary appointment of Whitaker to replace Sessions was consistent with another statute, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (VRA) of 1998, as well as the Constitution.\n\nThe VRA allows the president to replace an outgoing senior-level official like Sessons with another high-ranking \"officer or employee\" at the Justice Department as long as that replacement served in the agency for at least 90 days.\n\nWATCH: FOX NEWS' SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST JUDGE NAP BLASTS DOJ DECISION DEFENDING WHITAKER APPOINTMENT\n\n\u201cThis Office previously had advised that the President could designate a senior Department of Justice Official, such as Mr. Whitaker, as Acting Attorney General,\u201d the OLC said, noting that Whitaker has been serving at the Justice Department \u201cat a sufficiently senior pay level for over a year\" to qualify under the VRA for a temporary appointment to Sessions' former position.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Steven Engel added: \u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the President may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal officer, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate.\"\n\nBut a senior Justice Department official said this week that when reviewing Whitaker\u2019s appointment, the OLC had to research back to 1866 to find a similar instance where a non-Senate confirmed individual sat as acting attorney general. The Justice Department wasn\u2019t created until 1870, though an attorney general existed prior to that.\n\n'EMERGENCY' PROTEST AGAINST SESSIONS' FIRING MAKES ITS WAY TO UNION SQUARE -- HIGH ON ENERGY, IRONY\n\nWhitaker previously served as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff at the Justice Department. The president requested Sessions\u2019 resignation last week, just hours after the polls closed on Election Day. Sessions had been criticized by the president throughout his tenure at the Justice Department due to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, due to his involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016.\n\nDemocrats and 18 state attorneys general have taken issue with Whitaker\u2019s appointment, calling for him to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe, citing in part his \u201chostility\u201d to the investigation given his past criticism in the media.\n\nIn an op-ed Whitaker wrote last year, he argued that \u201cany investigation into President Trump\u2019s finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for Rosenstein\u2026to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel,\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, then Mueller\u2019s investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition. This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family\u2014and by extension, to the country.\u201d\n\nAnd separately, in July 2017, Whitaker told CNN, \"I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nReached for comment Wednesday on Whitaker's stance on recusal, DOJ spokeswoman Kerry Kupec provided a general statement to media outlets that said the new appointee is following all applicable guidelines.\n\n\"Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker had a good meeting with Senator Graham,\" Kupec said. \"Whitaker is following the processes and procedures at the Department of Justice on all matters.\u201d\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman, Jason Donner, and Jake Gibson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Nicole Darrah", "title": "Scot Peterson, Parkland deputy who didn't enter school during shooting, doesn't show for investigative panel - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Scot Peterson, Parkland deputy who didn't enter school during shooting, doesn't show for investigative panel Fox News Scot Peterson, the disgraced Broward County sheriff's deputy who did not confront Nikolas Cruz as he opened fire at Marjory Stoneman\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/scot-peterson-parkland-deputy-who-failed-to-enter-school-during-shooting-no-show-in-front-of-investigative-panel", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/meadow-scot-split.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:16:53Z", "content": "Scot Peterson, the disgraced Broward County sheriff's deputy who did not confront Nikolas Cruz as he opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in February, declined on Thursday to testify before a public safety commission investigating the massacre.

In response to the Times revelations, Open Society Foundations called Facebook's actions \"beyond the pale\" and \"astonishing\" in a letter to Zuckerberg.\n\nThe CEO also said that no one on his team ordered Definers to attack Facebook's competitors and that the company would conduct a thorough review of all its lobbying relationships.\n\n\"The bottom line on this, the intention was not to attack an individual, but demonstrate that this group that was saying it was spontaneous and grassroots, was not that,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It was well funded. I have tremendous respect for George Soros, even though we disagree about the internet. Bottom line is that we\u2019re no longer working with this firm.\"\n\nAlthough Zuckerberg has faced calls to resign and was questioned about it during Thursday's press briefing, he asserted that the company is improving and that many of the problems it faces will take a long time to fix.\n\n\"This stuff is painful.

The law mandates that they cover patients with pre-existing conditions who wait until they are sick to sign up, and provide blanket coverage \u2026 [+5875 chars]", "fulltext": "ObamaCare means different things to different people.\n\nTo insurance companies, it means a barely profitable albatross. The law mandates that they cover patients with pre-existing conditions who wait until they are sick to sign up, and provide blanket coverage for 10 essential benefits.\n\nSmall insurers can\u2019t make ObamaCare profitable and most don\u2019t even try, whereas large insurers try but usually give up. Consequently, according to the Heritage Foundation, choice and competition in the state exchanges continue to shrink.\n\nTo patients, ObamaCare means an empty promise, because health insurance without proper access doesn\u2019t equal actual health care. Patients with ObamaCare policies are faced with shrinking networks of doctors and hospitals, thousands of dollars in yearly deductibles that obstruct basic care, and rising premiums.\n\nNo wonder that even with 80 percent of ObamaCare patients receiving federal subsidies at the exchanges, millions have chosen to forgo insurance and pay the tax penalty instead. Fortunately, the individual mandate tax penalty will finally be eliminated next year.\n\nFor the government, ObamaCare means a huge outpouring of tax dollars just to cover a small portion (roughly 12 million people in 2017) of the insurance market. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, ObamaCare cost the federal government $110 billion in 2016 alone. That doesn\u2019t include the cost of the 15 million new enrollees in Medicaid, for which ObamaCare expanded eligibility.\n\nTo a physician like me, ObamaCare means an ongoing nightmare of hurdles to overcome as patients with high expectations encounter my limited ability to deliver.\n\nNot only do ObamaCare policies pay me less than most other insurances, but when one of my patients refuses an essential procedure \u2013 like a thyroid ultrasound for a nodule I feel on examination, for example \u2013 it puts me in a position of liability and forces me to deliver inadequate care. What if the nodule is cancer and I don\u2019t discover it in time because the patient can\u2019t afford the necessary tests because her deductible hasn\u2019t yet been met?\n\nI also struggle when I try to refer an ObamaCare patient to a top specialist or facility, only to discover that it doesn\u2019t accept his or her insurance.\n\nFinally, so-called comprehensive health insurance is bad for a person\u2019s health because it is by definition illness-centric rather than health-centric. It doesn\u2019t incentivize things like weight-losing exercise or diet or meditation. Rather, ObamaCare and insurance companies like it provide a security blanket over your potential-illness needs, with no real incentive not to get sick (and use the policy) in the first place.\n\nObamaCare is changing but surviving. Premiums for 2019 are flattening out, which is a sign that ObamaCare is stable at least for now. I applaud the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add more insurance options outside of the standard ObamaCare plans.\n\nSo, what should be done?\n\nRepeal and replace has failed, and it is now most certainly off the table with the House of Representatives under Democratic control. ObamaCare is here to stay.\n\nBut the status quo is also off the table. ObamaCare is morphing in a more positive direction under the Trump administration, which has stopped wasting money on advertisements and so-called navigators to help enrollees through the insurance maze.\n\nThe individual mandate tax penalty will be gone at the end of this year, which means that no one will be penalized for not buying a bloated, difficult-to-use insurance policy that he or she doesn\u2019t need. This is a good thing. It has never made sense to me as a physician for a patient to be mandated to buy a product that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care.\n\nFurthermore, greater price transparency, and the addition of cheaper \u201cskinny\u201d plans and association plans, as the president has now allowed for, will provide more options as smaller, more creative insurers get to re-enter the game. Ironically, cheaper, more user-friendly options could ultimately bring the country closer to universal coverage than ObamaCare did.\n\nI believe in what I like to call universal Chevy coverage, meaning that everyone should have at least basic health insurance to cover a catastrophe or unexpected serious illness.\n\nThe standard ObamaCare policies should continue to cover pre-existing conditions, and these policies will continue to have to be subsidized, since the sickest 5 percent of Americans utilize 50 percent of the health care and frequently can\u2019t afford it.\n\nMedicaid needs to be revamped and made more efficient, and I am in favor of work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid patients, though according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, most are already working.\n\nAs of June, four states have waivers approved for work requirements, and another seven states are pending. This is a good thing, and for some, community service or training programs or new work options could be a path out of poverty. Too many of my patients tell me that they can\u2019t afford to take a certain job because they will lose their Medicaid. This needs to change.\n\nWith the individual mandate effectively gone, many expect the over-priced, under-performing, one-size-fits-all ObamaCare to collapse under its own weight. They predict that healthier people will no longer be compelled to pay more and get less while their premiums are diverted to cover the sickest. Even fewer will sign up for these dysfunctional policies than before, and without those premiums, so the critics say, the system will go bankrupt.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t agree with the conclusion that ObamaCare will fail altogether.\n\nSo far, ObamaCare is changing but surviving. Premiums for 2019 are flattening out, which is a sign that ObamaCare is stable at least for now. I applaud the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add more insurance options outside of the standard ObamaCare plans. This will ultimately add more insurees to the pool.\n\nCompetition, price transparency and choice should all help bring prices down going forward.\n\nA leaner ObamaCare combined with these other improvements to the larger health care system is better for America\u2019s health."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Madeline Farber", "title": "Great white sharks tracked off North Carolina coast traveled 1,000 miles from Canada, experts say", "description": "Two great white sharks were located off the coast of North Carolina this week after the massive predators traveled more than a thousand miles from Canada to reach the coastal waters.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/great-white-sharks-tracked-off-north-carolina-coast-traveled-1000-miles-from-canada-experts-say", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/iStock-471311294.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:56:12Z", "content": "Two great white sharks were located off the coast of North Carolina this week after the massive predators traveled more than a thousand miles from Canada to reach the coastal waters, according to officials with the shark tagging and tracking organization Ocea\u2026 [+1475 chars]", "fulltext": "Two great white sharks were located off the coast of North Carolina this week after the massive predators traveled more than a thousand miles from Canada to reach the coastal waters, according to officials with the shark tagging and tracking organization Ocearch.\n\nThe sharks \u2014 Nova and Cabot \u2014 were tagged off the coast of Nova Scotia in September and October, respectively.

They are out there competing with the seaweeds and [other organisms] on the bottom,\" Larry Harris, a zoology professor at UNH, told the Bangor Daily News on Thursday.\n\nMYSTERIOUS 'CREATURE' SPOTTED IN JUPITER'S CLOUDS STUNS NASA, SPACE ENTHUSIASTS\n\nWith an estimated temperature increase of about 3.6\u00b0F in the next few years, the number of invasive species, particularly the Didemnum vexillum and Botrylloides violaceus, could double, according to UNH research released back in February.\n\n\u201cIn the past decade, we\u2019ve seen their populations spread more northeastward to places like Eastport, Maine where there are now much larger colonies than before and these colonies have also spread to natural substrates, like rocks and seaweed,\u201d Jennifer Dijkstra, a research assistant professor in the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering at UNH\u2019s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, said in an online statement at the time.\n\nSea squirts are 2-inch-long organisms that tend to live in clumps, sticking to coral reefs, seaweed and other objects found near the ocean floor, the Chesapeake Bay Program states online. They got their nickname because of the way they feed \u2014 they suck in water through one of their siphons, filter in the food particles and then eject waste back out through another siphon.\n\n\"Like many invasive species, once they\u2019ve settled in an area, it\u2019s tough to get rid of them,\" UNH said, noting they use a \"glue-like substance\" to firmly attach themselves to \"just about any surface.\"\n\nThey've been around since the 1980s but marine scientists are concerned about the potential havoc they could wreak around Maine if their population continues to thrive. In particular, they believe the species could hurt the local oyster business.\n\nMYSTERIOUS 26-FOOT WORM-LIKE SEA CREATURE STUNS DIVERS\n\n\u201cIf they overgrow the nets, they smother the oysters inside the nets,\u201d Harris explained\n\nRhian Waller, an associate professor at Darling Marine Center, agreed sea squirts are becoming more and more problematic.\n\n\u201cThey are becoming more dominant in many ecosystems on the midcoast for sure \u2014 especially on lines, docks, pipes and buoys left in the water for any period of time,\u201d Waller told Bangor Daily News \u201cThey basically spread in an ecosystem.

Investigations are ongoing, but Little has provided details in more than 90 deaths dating to about 1970, Bland said.\n\nLittle was brought to Texas in September, and investigators with law enforcement agencies in several states traveled to speak with him about unsolved homicides.\n\n\"They're able to match up over 30 cases so far,\" Bland said. \"So far we don't have any false information coming from him.\"\n\nIf the number of killings Little claims to have committed proves true, it would make him one of the most prolific killers in U.S. history. Ted Bundy confessed to 30 homicides from about 1974 to 1978. John Wayne Gacy killed at least 33 boys and young men in the 1970s.\n\nArguably one of the deadliest globally was an English general practitioner named Harold Shipman, who an investigative panel determined was responsible for the deaths of 250. He was convicted in 2000 in the deaths of 15.\n\nDuring his 2014 trial in Los Angeles, prosecutors said Little was likely responsible for at least 40 killings since 1980. Authorities at the time were looking for possible links to deaths in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Texas.\n\nBland said Little recently provided details to Texas Ranger James Holland that showed Little was in Odessa, Texas, when Denise Christie Brothers was last seen in 1994. Her body was found about a month later in a vacant lot. Holland eventually elicited a confession from Little and admissions to dozens of other killings from about 1970 to 2005, Bland said.\n\nThe rangers are an elite team of investigators within the Texas Department of Public Safety. DPS did not respond to requests Thursday to speak with Holland.\n\nLittle was being held without bond Thursday in the Ector County jail on a murder charge relating to Brothers' death. Jail records don't indicate whether he has an attorney. He has a court appearance scheduled for Nov. 26.\n\nLittle was brought to Texas for questioning in the case from California, where he was convicted in 2014 in the deaths years earlier of the three women in Los Angeles County. DNA evidence collected from old crime scenes was used to match samples of his stored in a criminal database.\n\nLos Angeles cold-case detectives at the time suspected Little was a serial killer, a transient and former boxer who traveled the country preying on drug addicts, troubled women and others. His criminal history includes offenses committed in 24 states spread over 56 years \u2014 mostly assault, burglary, armed robbery, shoplifting and drug violations.\n\nThose detectives determined that Little often delivered a knockout punch to women and then proceeded to strangle them while masturbating, dumping the bodies and soon after leaving town.\n\nLittle, who often went by the name Samuel McDowell, grew up with his grandmother in Lorain, Ohio. His criminal history shows his first arrest came at age 16 on burglary charges.\n\nFor years he had denied to investigators in different states that he was responsible for any killings. Bland speculates that he finally confessed after the appeals to his life sentence in California were ultimately rejected and he no longer had any reason to hide his role.\n\n\"People for years have been trying to get a confession out of him and James Holland is the one who finally got him to give that information,\" Bland said.\n\n___\n\nTami Abdollah in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Warren on Twitter at https://twitter.com/WarrenJourno and sign up for the AP's weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from Texas and the Midwest at http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv ."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Fox News", "title": "Fox on Tech: Using lasers to find aliens", "description": "Calling all aliens!

The two researchers have published a new paper in The Astrophysical Journal, theorizing that we could build the laser, then combine it with a massive telescope, to make a detectable beacon for interstellar travelers.\n\nDRONE FLEET COULD HELP FIND LOST HIKERS, MIT RESEARCHERS SAY\n\nThe good news is that the technology needed is less science fiction and more science fact. The laser would need to be between 1 to 2 megawatts, a huge amount of energy and a potential hurdle to completion. But this technology isn't new to the military. The Air Force developed a megawatt-level laser for a now-defunct missile defense project, but the design team could easily be re-assembled and re-tasked to the beacon project. \"This would be a challenging project but not an impossible one,\" according to James Clark, an MIT grad student and the paper's lead author. \"The kinds of lasers and telescopes that are being built today can produce a detectable signal, so that an astronomer could take one look at our star and immediately see something unusual about its spectrum.\"\n\nAs for the telescope - it would need to be between 30 and 45 meters in diameter - and there are several already in operation or in the planning phase that fit the bill. In fact, three different telescopes in that size range are under construction right now, and scheduled to come online in the early to mid-2020s - including the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) being built on the Hawaiian peak Mauna Kea.\n\nARE YOU READY FOR A CHIP IMPLANT?\n\nIt could potentially be aimed a couple of close neighbors: the newly-discovered Trappist 1 Star system, which is about 40 million light years away, is a good bet to contain some sort of life. Or if we wanted to look closer, Proxima Centauri, our nearest neighbor, is just 4 light years away. At those distances, the quick flash would be seen just a few years after it was sent, potentially opening up lines of communication should there be an intelligent civilization to receive it. In theory, the beacon would beam infrared radiation, which is long-wavelength light that's invisible to the human eye. The resulting signal could be powerful and distinct enough that it would not be drowned out by the sun's heat signature.\n\nOf course, some scientists do question if we should be in the business of alerting intelligent aliens to our presence - and invite a possible invasion if the interstellar travelers we contact turn out to be more \"Independence Day\" than \"ET\"!"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Chris Ciaccia", "title": "12,000-year-old cave art from the Ice Age found", "description": "Archaeologists have uncovered cave drawings located in eastern France that are more than 12,000-years-old, but were hidden for hundreds of years thanks to graffiti.

(A listing incorrectly says it has 104, but a salesman confirmed with Fox News Autos that it is in fact 4.) It was sitting in a partitioned space in the showroom when the dealership was purchased by new owners last year.\n\nThe car is regularly maintained and is quite possibly the lowest-mileage 2005 GT left.\n\nThe GT was inspired by the automaker\u2019s famous Le Mans racers of the 1960s and built to celebrate Ford\u2019s 100th anniversary. It\u2019s powered by a 550 hp supercharged 5.4-liter V8 and has a top speed of 205 mph. Ford sold 4038 of the bargain supercars over the 2005 and 2006 model years and didn\u2019t make anything like it again until it introduced the all-new GT in 2017.\n\nFOLLOW FOX NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK FOR THE LATEST\n\nPrices for the originals have gotten a boost from the excitement surrounding the new car, which starts at $450,000. Ford initially planned to sell just 1,000 of the new carbon-fiber, turbocharged GTs through 2020, but it proved to be so popular that it\u2019s decided to build around 1,350 through 2022 instead.\n\nBut buying a new GT isn\u2019t as easy as dropping by a dealer and selecting one from the lot. Ford is only approving customers it deems worthy of owning one, and says it\u2019s been getting seven applications for each build slot.\n\nOn the other hand, the 2005 GT can be yours today! In fact, it\u2019s technically on sale.

Free movement: ended. Vast annual payments: stopped. Jurisdiction of the ECJ: over. Out of the CAP, out of the CFP. This is a Brexit that delivers on the priorities of the British people,\" she said.\n\nMuch of the controversy surrounding the deal has focused on a \u201cbackstop\u201d clause that would keep the U.K. in a customs union in case an additional trade deal is not forged. The backstop has been deemed necessary to make sure that there isn\u2019t a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which is remaining in the E.U. Opponents fear that it would be a backdoor way of keeping Britain in the E.U. permanently, dubbed a \u201cHotel California\u201d Brexit -- a reference to the Eagles hit, which describes a hotel you can check out of \u201cany time you like,\u201d but you can never leave.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Raab told May that it would give the E.U. a \u201cveto over our ability to exit.\u201d\n\nMAY SAYS UK CABINET BACKS BREXIT DEAL AMID WIDE OPPOSITION\n\n\u201cNo democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile May announced late Wednesday that Cabinet supported her deal, she admitted the debate was \u201cimpassioned.\u201d The resignations suggest that it is deeply split, which bodes poorly for the deal's chances in Parliament.\n\nIn the Commons on Thursday, May faced criticism from the opposition Labour Party -- where left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn lambasted the \u201chalf-baked\u201d deal.\n\n\u201cThis is not the deal the country was promised, And Parliament cannot and I believe will not accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe voices from her own party offering muted support were drowned out by fierce criticism from backbenchers who expressed concern about the deal, and openly questioned whether May was fit to continue leading the party.\n\nIn a speech that drew gasps from the chamber, Jacob Rees-Mogg MP -- who has become the de facto leader of the \u201chard Brexit\u201d wing of the party -- warned Thursday morning that he might write to Graham Brady MP, the leader of the party\u2019s 1922 committee, to call for May to face a vote of no-confidence. Should Brady receive 48 letters from disgruntled Tory MPs, it would trigger a vote of no-confidence against May as party leader, and consequently as prime minister.\n\n\u201cMy Right Honorable Friend, and she is unquestionably honorable, said that we would leave the customs union. annex 2 says otherwise,\" Rees-Mogg said in the Commons, challenging how May had presented the deal. \"My Right Honorable Friend said that she would maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom, a whole protocol says otherwise. My Right Honorable Friend says that we would be out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice -- Article 174 says otherwise. As what my Right Honorable Friend says and what my Right Honorable Friend does no longer match, should I not write to [Brady?]\u201d\n\nRees-Mogg later sent the letter and said that there were \u201cstreams of talent\u201d within the party who could replace May, listing off a number of possible candidates. He did not put his own name forward, although he is frequently named as a possible candidate for the job. It was not clear how many letters Brady had received by Thursday afternoon, but there was no announcement of a no-confidence vote.\n\nEven if May hangs on, the deal looks unlikely to get approved by Parliament, considering the opposition from both Tory and Labour MPs. Should the deal be voted down, that would fuel calls for May\u2019s resignation, as well as calls from Labour MPs for a general election."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Lucia Suarez Sang", "title": "More than 650 illegal immigrants crossing southern border detained in Arizona over two days - Fox News", "description": "Fox News More than 650 illegal immigrants crossing southern border detained in Arizona over two days Fox News As thousands of troops deployed to the southern border await the arrival of a caravan of migrants heading towards the U.S., border patrol agents in A\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/more-than-650-illegal-immigrants-crossing-southern-border-detained-in-arizona-over-two-days", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/40_0.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:47:41Z", "content": "As thousands of troops deployed to the southern border await the arrival of a caravan of migrants heading towards the U.S., border patrol agents in Arizona have already been busy, detaining more than 650 illegal immigrants in just two days this week.

(AP) \u2014 Cows that can withstand hotter temperatures. Cows born without pesky horns. Pigs that never reach puberty.\n\nA company wants to alter farm animals by adding and subtracting genetic traits in a lab. It sounds like science fiction, but Recombinetics sees opportunity for its technology in the livestock industry.\n\nBut first, it needs to convince regulators that gene-edited animals are no different than conventionally bred ones. To make the technology appealing and to ease any fears that it may be creating Franken-animals, Recombinetics isn't starting with productivity. Instead, it's introducing gene-edited traits as a way to ease animal suffering.\n\n\"It's a better story to tell,\" said Tammy Lee, CEO of the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company.\n\nFor instance, animal welfare advocates have long criticized the way farmers use caustic paste or hot irons to dehorn dairy cows so the animals don't harm each other. Recombinetics snips out the gene for growing horns so the procedure is unnecessary.\n\nLast year, a bull gene-edited by Recombinetics to have the dominant hornless trait sired several offspring. All were born hornless as expected, and are being raised at the University of California, Davis. Once the female offspring starts lactating, its milk will be tested for any abnormalities.\n\nAnother Recombinetics project: castration-free pigs.\n\nWhen male piglets go through puberty, their meat can take on an unpleasant odor, something known as \"boar taint.\" To combat it, farmers castrate pigs, a procedure animal welfare advocates say is commonly performed without painkillers. Editing genes so that pigs never go through puberty would make castration unnecessary.\n\nAlso in development are dairy cows that could withstand higher temperatures, so the animals don't suffer in hotter climates.\n\nRecombinetics and others say gene-editing techniques do what traditional breeding has always done, except much faster and with the precision of \"molecular scissors.\" They are waiting for clarity from government officials, but say meat and milk from gene-edited animals shouldn't be subject to special regulations.\n\nMost U.S. dairy cows already are bred through artificial insemination from \"semen straws,\" which are priced for a bull's pedigree and traits developed through years of traditional breeding. Gene-edited traits would just be higher-priced extras, Recombinetics says. For example, the hornless trait could add $3 to $5 to the price of a semen straw that could cost around $15.\n\nOnce gene-editing is accepted by the public, farmers will be more interested in traits that step up productivity, Lee predicted. As an example, she cited pigs edited to have bigger litters.\n\nCHICKENS AS BIG AS ELEPHANT?\n\nBefore food from gene-edited animals can land on dinner tables, however, Recombinetics has to overcome any public unease about the technology.\n\nBeyond worries about \"playing God,\" it may be an uncomfortable reminder of how modern food production already treats animals, said Paul Thompson, a professor of agriculture at Michigan State University.\n\n\"There's an ethical question that's been debated for at least the last 20 years, of whether you need to change the animal or change the system,\" Thompson said.\n\nSupport for gene editing will also likely depend on how the technology is used: whether it's for animal welfare, productivity or disease resistance. In August, a Pew study found 43 percent of Americans supported genetically engineered animals for more nutritious meat.\n\nThe array of possibilities is why the Humane Society of the United States supports gene-editing to end pig castrations and cow dehorning but doesn't give the technology its blanket approval.\n\n\"If you edit for your chicken to be the size of an elephant, that's not good,\" said Josh Balk, the group's vice president of farm animal protection.\n\nThe image seems preposterous, but it may not be far off from what the words \"gene-edited animals\" conjure for many. In the science-fiction movie \"Rampage\" earlier this year, gene-editing is used to create monsters, including a giant wolf that shoots porcupine spikes from its tail.\n\nSome may also question the need to risk using the technology, if it really just speeds up what could be achieved with conventional breeding.\n\nAdvances in traditional breeding have already stepped up the productivity of cows, chickens and pigs. Today, milk producers can shop for characteristics developed through conventional breeding, like body frames and how efficiently animals convert feed into meat. Semex, a Canadian seller of bull semen, offers already offers a \"Robot Ready\" option for cows \"built for automation,\" with teat lengths and temperaments bred for milking machines.\n\nThe company is working with Recombinetics to develop the gene-edited hornless trait.\n\nNotably, hornless dairy cows also already exist. But Recombinetics says there are so few that breeding them would compromise the valuable traits that have been carefully bred into modern dairy cows.\n\nBut John Burket, who breeds hornless dairy cows in Pennsylvania, thinks the hornless trait could spread quickly if it was prioritized.\n\nBurket isn't opposed to gene-editing, but he said he's waiting to see if the technology delivers.\n\n\"ROBOT READY\" COWS\n\nFor now, a more practical challenge for Recombinetics will be coming up with gene-edited traits farmers are willing to pay for. Semex says it will take at least two years of testing before it can start selling the hornless trait for dairy cows.\n\nConventional breeding comes with a lot more chance, but advances over the years have nevertheless made dairy farms increasingly productive. Paradoxically, that has contributed to a glut of milk, driving down prices and pressuring farmers.\n\nRecombinetics says improving productivity isn't just about producing more milk or meat but targeting inefficiencies like dehorning and pig castrations. Still, Lorraine Lewandrowski, a dairy farmer in upstate New York, is reminded of the skepticism she felt with bovine growth hormone in the 1990s.\n\n\"Do we want another technology that will put even more milk on the market?\" she said.\n\nLewandrowski is also wary of anything that might give the dairy industry a bad image. But she noted the gene-edited hornless trait could save the time spent on dehorning.\n\nJonathan Lamb, an owner of Oakfield Dairy in western New York, said he wouldn't pay much extra for the hornless trait; he's watching costs because of low milk prices. But he thinks gene-editing could offer other improvements.\n\n\"I see that as a first step to other possibilities,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Katherine Lam", "title": "Connecticut hotel owner with 'sex dungeon' arrested after attempting to buy girl, officials say - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Connecticut hotel owner with 'sex dungeon' arrested after attempting to buy girl, officials say Fox News A Connecticut hotel owner who had a \u201csex dungeon\u201d hidden at his business was arrested after he attempted to buy a preteen girl for \u201cslave trainin\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/connecticut-hotel-owner-with-sex-dungeon-arrested-after-attempting-to-buy-girl-officials-say", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/hc-1542228122-37y1h7b3ls-snap-image.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:32:20Z", "content": "A Connecticut hotel owner who had a \u201csex dungeon\u201d hidden at his business was arrested after he attempted to buy a preteen girl for \u201cslave training\u201d and \u201climitless sex\u201d for two days, police said.

Even the design of the suit itself helps to prevent the sniper\u2019s body shape from being detected.\n\nSince snipers are often dispatched in pairs, or alone, isolated from the force, these brave marksmen rely on this ghillie camouflage to stay safe.\n\nWhether in overwatch or reconnaissance observing and reporting, snipers do not have the advantages of safety in numbers or weapons and artillery support that a larger force would have. They also lack the protection provided by, say a forward operating base.\n\nEXCITING NEW MEDICAL 'SILVER BULLETS' WILL SAVE MILITARY LIVES\n\nOften behind enemy lines, the snipers must rely on their stealthy skills and the art of concealment to avoid detection.\n\nThe ghillie camouflage suit is a vital tool to help keep them safe while they do their job. By staying concealed, snipers are able to play an incredibly important role protecting the ground forces in a wide range of ways.\n\nGhillie invisibility\n\nSnipers do master shooting, target detection, range estimation and use stalking-type skills. But mastering the art of camouflage and concealment is also crucial.\n\nThe current version of the ghillie suit Soldiers use is called the FRGS (Flame Resistant Ghillie System). The FRGS made its debut back in 2012, making appearances at Army Sniper School at Fort Benning, the U.S. Marine Corps Scout Sniper School and the Special Operations Target Interdiction Course.\n\nThe new version has been dubbed \u201cImproved Ghillie System\u201d, or \u201cIGS.\u201d IGS will replace the FRGS. Soldiers will wear the IGS over their field uniform. It will include sleeves, cape, veil, leggings and more.\n\nARMY SETS SIGHTS ON BIGGER, BOLDER, HARDER HITTING BULLETS\n\nThe IGS modular approach gives soldiers flexibility and lets them easily adapt the suit to their needs. It is important for snipers to tailor their ghillies to match the local environment. They even harvest their location to attach leaves and other items to help blend in.\n\nThe ghillie suit will usually not cover the face, neck and hands. Snipers use camouflage makeup to conceal these exposed areas.\n\nPODCAST: INSIDE LIFE AS A SEAL TEAM 6 SNIPER\n\nHow will it be enhanced?\n\nSnipers will find the new ghillie is lighter weight and hopefully more comfortable and less cumbersome. Right now, ghillies are heavy and hot. When you combine that with the regions troops deploy in \u2013 such as jungle and desert \u2013 it can get extremely toasty inside the ghillie for the sniper.\n\nAs a result, the new IGS fabric will be more breathable.\n\nIGS will still incorporate some flame-resistance. The Combat Uniform underneath the ghillie delivers the primary protection from fire.\n\nBEE-SIZED BOTS SET TO DOMINATE FUTURE BATTLES FOR CITIES\n\nOverall, it is expected that soldiers will find the IGS more effective.\n\nThe FRGS accessory kit is getting the heave-ho. In practice, Soldiers were not utilizing many of them.\n\nPODCAST: UNSEEN SIDE OF JUNGLE WARFARE\n\nAdvances benefit snipers and all ground troops\n\nEnsuring military snipers have access to the best tools for concealment is important for their safety \u2013 and for the protection of the wider force. Here are just four examples of how snipers protect U.S. forces.\n\nIn addition to the expert marksmanship that stops threats to soldiers from thousands of feet away, snipers also perform other key missions like reconnaissance.\n\nSnipers often infiltrate enemy territory and gather crucial data on enemy location, force size, the weapons they are carrying and more. This sort of data can be vital to protect the force and end up saving lives.\n\nARMY SETS SIGHTS ON NEW CONCEALABLE MACHINE GUN\n\nIn an urban terrain, a sniper may set up on a roof. In a mountainous region, they may perch high up on the edge of a cliff. These are overwatch positions that give the snipers a view of the battlespace. Snipers regularly save the lives of U.S. ground forces by spotting a threat and stopping it before their teammates on the ground are hurt by the enemy combatant.\n\nFor example, one horrible method of attack in Afghanistan and Iraq has been someone approaching an access point to a base pleading for water or medical assistance. Exploiting the kindness of the soldiers, they get close and then detonate a hidden bomb. Snipers in overwatch can spot the bomb, warn the ground force and if the attacker refuses to stop and charge the gate, then the snipers can save those on the ground by stopping the bomber before detonation.\n\nU.S. military snipers are so good that they can remain concealed and in some scenarios suddenly stop an enemy strike team\u2019s ability to function with some well-placed shots.\n\nBy targeting their water supply containers and eliminating hydration in the hot desert, for example, they can force them to retreat. By shooting their spare fuel tanks, they can render an enemy unable to move anywhere except slowly on foot. Shooting their radios can stop the enemy force from communicating and disable a coordinated attack on U.S. forces.\n\nThe potential for expert U.S. military marksmanship to terrify enemy forces should never be underestimated. The sniper can seem invisible and adversaries can\u2019t fight a threat they cannot see. By delivering deadly pinpointed shots at any moment, the impact on an enemy's morale and commitment to attacking U.S. forces is significant.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThis month, lab and field testing begins. IGS will be tested in labs, but also in field environments.\n\nSAPPHIRE GEM-BASED \u2018TRANSPARENT\u2019 ARMOR PROTECTS SOLDIERS FROM SNIPERS\n\nSniper-qualified soldiers at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida will help test how effective the ghillie is at providing visual camouflage during daytime conditions.\n\nArmy Research Laboratory will put the new ghillie up against intensive nighttime testing with night vision goggles. This will help evaluate how the camouflage keeps soldiers concealed in the dark.\n\nARL will put the new ghillie fabric through its paces against fire to assess protection. The robustness of the fabric will be tested to see how much more protection it can offer against tears.\n\nAcoustic testing will also be important. Sound is another tell that an enemy can use to locate snipers. It can expose a sniper\u2019s movements and location. The new IGS will be tested to ensure it will be quiet and assess how much noise it will produce in various field conditions.\n\nWhen will the new camouflage ghillies be available?\n\nAs soon as next spring, Sniper School instructors at Fort Benning may get their hands on them.\n\nMore than 3,000 military snipers will be receiving the new, enhanced sniper ghillies.\n\nThere are about 3,300 snipers in the Army. Once the new IGS is approved, it will be rolled out to all those snipers as well as to the Army snipers at Special Operations Command."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Lukas Mikelionis", "title": "Democrat Mississippi Senate hopeful misled about $750G lobbying contract with African despot - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Democrat Mississippi Senate hopeful misled about $750G lobbying contract with African despot Fox News Mike Espy who is seeking to unseat appointed U.S. Sen.

It is very difficult to work in that context.\u201d\n\nHe said he dropped his three-month contract with the country just a little more than a month on the job and collected just $400,000 of the $750,000 amid the outcry of Washington D.C. lobbyists profiting from a brutal regime.\n\nYet according to a FARA Supplemental Statement filed with the Department of Justice in 2011, not only did Espy collect the full $750,000 figure, he also dropped the contract just 15 days before it was supposed to end, contradicting his comments.\n\nMISSISSIPPI SENATE RACE HEADS TO NOV. 27 RUNOFF\n\n\u201cSecretary Espy worked on agricultural issues for international clients,\u201d Danny Blaton, the Espy campaign communications director, told Fox News. \u201cOver the course of that work, he realized one of those clients didn't pass the smell test, so he terminated the contract, and then reported what he knew to the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nHe did not address Espy\u2019s misleading claims that he didn\u2019t take all the money and worked just a little over a month.\n\nEspy represented the African ruler who lost the 2010 election, but refused to concede to his opponent, unleashing extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape of his political opponents, according to the U.S. State Department.\n\nHe\u2019s currently being tried at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nAt the time of the turmoil, the Ivory Coast government approached Espy to represent him in talks with the Obama administration and the UN.\n\nHe acted as an English-speaking mouthpiece for the regime, making pro-government comments on state television and telling the Daily Telegraph in 2010 that the ruler believes the election was \u201cstolen\u201d and any attempts to remove him from power will be met with force.\n\nIt remains unclear how much he was paid for representation back then, but in 2011 Espy managed to strike a deal for three months with the Ivory Coast government in the midst of ongoing turmoil and violence.\n\nThe contract officially involved lobbying for the Ivory Coast\u2019s Cocoa and Coffee Board \u2013 directly controlled and funded by the government \u2013 concerning its products being blacklisted in the United States.\n\nIn a form submitted to the DOJ, Espy said he also engaged in research and advocacy relating to the Ivory Coast\u2019s child labor laws and Ivory Coast cocoa embargoes.\n\nUnder the Gbagbo regime, the Ivory Coast\u2019s cocoa industry was condemned due to rampant child labor and slaves as young as seven years-old.\n\nSince the ouster of the despotic ruler, the U.S. Department of Labor has found that the government of Ivory Coast made significant progress in eliminating child labor in the country."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Kathleen Joyce", "title": "FBI probing American woman's death on cruise ship", "description": "FBI and local authorities are probing the death of a 52-year-old American woman on board a Princess Cruises ship Tuesday \u2013 and it's reportedly being investigated as a potential murder.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/fbi-probing-american-womans-death-on-cruise-ship", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Royal-Princess-Princes-Cruises.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:47:39Z", "content": "FBI and local authorities are probing the death of a 52-year-old American woman on board a Princess Cruises ship Tuesday \u2013 and it's reportedly being investigated as a potential murder.

The country music and comedy show's last episode aired in 1993, though reruns continued for a few years thereafter.\n\n\"'Hee Haw' won't go away. It brings a smile to too many faces,\" Clark said in 2004, when the show was distributed on VHS and DVD for the first time.\n\nClark played the guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, harmonica and other instruments. His skills brought him gigs as a guest performer with many top orchestras, including the Boston Pops. In 1976 he even headlined a tour of the Soviet Union, breaking boundaries that were usually closed to Americans.\n\nAnd of course, he also was a member of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nHis hits included \"The Tips of My Fingers\" (1963), \"Yesterday When I Was Young\" (1969), \"Come Live With Me\" (1973) and \"Honeymoon Feeling\" (1974). He was also known for his instrumental versions of \"Malaguena,\" on 12-string guitar, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky.\"\n\nHe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009, and emotionally told the crowd how moving it was \"just to be associated yourself with the members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and imagine that your name will be said right along with all the list.\"\n\nIn his 1994 autobiography, \"My Life in Spite of Myself,\" he said \"Yesterday, When I Was Young\" had \"opened a lot of people's eyes not only to what I could do but to the whole fertile and still largely untapped field of country music, from the Glen Campbells and the Kenny Rogerses, right on through to the Garth Brookses and Vince Gills.\"\n\nClark was a guest host on \"The Tonight Show\" several times in the 1960s and 1970s when it was rare for a country performer to land such a role. His fans included not just musicians, but baseball great Mickey Mantle. The Yankees outfielder was moved to tears by \"Yesterday When I Was Young\" and for years made Clark promise to sing it at his memorial \u2014 a request granted after Mantle died in 1995.\n\nBeginning in 1983, Clark operated the Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre in Branson, Missouri, and was one of the first country entertainers to open a theater there. Dozens followed him.\n\nHe was a touring artist as late as the 2000s. Over the years, he played at venues around the world: Carnegie Hall in New York, the Sporting Club in Monte Carlo, the Grand Palace in Brussels and the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow.\n\nClark was born in Meherrin, Virginia, and received his first guitar on his 14th Christmas. He was playing in his father's square dance band at age 15.\n\nIn the 1950s, Clark played in bands in the Washington, D.C., area. In 1960, he got the chance to front the band of country singer Wanda Jackson. He also performed regularly in Las Vegas. He got his first recording contract, with Capitol Records, in 1962.\n\nHe appeared on Jimmy Dean's TV show \"Town and Country Time\" and took over the show when Dean left.\n\nIn 1997 he released \"Roy Clark's Christmas Memories.\"\n\nClark told The Associated Press in 2004 that \"Hee Haw\" was like a family reunion.\n\n\"We became a part of the family. The viewers were sort of part owners of the show. They identified with these clowns, and we had good music.\"\n\nClark said the hour-long program of country music and corny jokes capped off his career.\n\n\"This was the icing on the cake.

He said Jawad is religiously moderate, unlike some other members of the group, and likes to listen to music.\n\n\"He is not a big official with the party. I never heard that he has a security or military post,\" the man said.\n\nAnother person familiar with the group also cast doubt on the \"rising star\" narrative or that he was a high-ranking member of the group.\n\nHezbollah declined a request by The Associated Press to comment on the State Department action. The group generally dismisses sanctions imposed on Hezbollah members as ineffective and part of psychological propaganda against the group. The Israeli Foreign Ministry also declined comment, while a Palestinian senior security official said Hezbollah stopped its activity in the West Bank and Gaza after the second intifada, or uprising, which ended in 2005.\n\nAlthough his rank and role within the group have remained ambiguous, the round-faced Nasrallah is not the reclusive type, as senior Hezbollah commanders tend to be.\n\nHe has appeared publicly on numerous occasions, including at book signing events in 2007, when he published a collection of poems called \"Resistance Letters.\" The book focuses on the role of poetry in resistance with poems that glorify those who died fighting Israel, including his elder brother, Hadi, who died while fighting Israel in south Lebanon in 1997.\n\nIn one poem called \"Shukran,\" or \"Thank you,\" he writes: \"From the heart, thank you to the most beautiful father, thank you for being my inspiration, my father and my commander.\"\n\nIn an interview with a local TV station in that same year, Jawad refused to give details about his role within the group, only saying that he dedicated his life to the resistance. He said he likes music and movies, including comedy films, history and documentary movies.\n\nHe was active on Twitter for a while, before his account was suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration has ramped up pressure on Iran and Hezbollah since withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal last year. On Tuesday, the Department of Treasury also announced it was imposing sanctions on four Hezbollah operatives who were said to have provided financial, material and technological support to Hezbollah in Iraq.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Jennifer Earl", "title": "GoFundMe scam?

The charges carry prison time of up to 5 to 10 years.\n\nD'Amico and McClure surrendered Wednesday night.

Rather, the group met near a Philadelphia casino a month before sharing the fake story.\n\nLess than an hour after the couple set up the page to solicit donations, McClure sent a text message to a friend acknowledging the story was \"completely made up,\" prosecutors said.\n\n\"I had to make something up to make people feel bad,\" McClure said in a text \u2014 one of 60,000 reviewed by prosecutors \u2014 to a friend.\n\nCouple under investigation, September 2018\n\nWhat happened to all that cash? That's the question that surfaced in September 2018, nearly a year after McClure said Bobbitt helped her.\n\nIn a lawsuit against McClure and D'Amico, Bobbitt claimed the couple mismanaged the $400,000 promised to him, spending the money to fund their lavish lifestyle. Instead of giving Bobbitt a consistent \"salary,\" he claimed they deposited the funds into their own bank account and began spending the money right away.\n\n\u201cThey went on shopping sprees,\u201d Bobbitt\u2019s attorney, Jacqueline Promislo, told The New York Post on Sept. 9. \u201c[Bobbitt] tells me they had a Louis Vuitton bag and Chanel sunglasses, a new iPhone 10.\u201d\n\nHOMELESS SAMARITAN WILL GET CASH; COUPLE UNDER INVESTIGATION\n\nThe New Jersey couple vehemently denied the allegations, claiming they simply didn't want to give Bobbitt the money due to his ongoing drug problem. D\u2019Amico said Bobbitt spent $25,000 in less than two weeks in December on drugs, in addition to paying overdue legal bills and sending money to his family. The pair's lawyer said Bobbitt was given about $200,000 already, despite Bobbitt's lawyer's claiming the man had only received $75,000.\n\nIn a joint statement on Sept. 7, GoFundMe and the law firm representing Bobbitt vowed he would get the full amount of the money raised, one way or another.\n\nMeanwhile, McClure and D'Amico's Florence, New Jersey home was searched by police, who said the found a new BMW, jewelry and money.\n\nLawsuit filed, August 2018\n\nDays after McClure and D'Amico appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d show, Bobbitt filed a lawsuit against the couple seeking undisclosed damages.\n\nChristopher C. Fallon, one of Bobbitt\u2019s lawyers, told The Philadelphia Inquirer legal action was taken after D\u2019Amico ignored multiple requests for a full accounting of the money raised by the GoFundMe campaign.\n\nHOMELESS VETERAN WHO HELPED STRANDED WOMAN SAYS HE CAN'T GET GOFUNDME CASH FROM COUPLE\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really left us with no choice but to go forward,\u201d said Fallon, one of two lawyers from Cozen O\u2019Connor in Philadelphia whom Bobbitt retained last week. The attorneys were working pro bono.\n\nIn the NBC interview, D\u2019Amico told Kelly there was well over $150,000 left of the donations. But Bobbitt said that wasn't true.\n\n\"Struggling with addiction,\" April 2018\n\nRoughly five months after Bobbitt's story went viral, the Philadelphia Inquirer followed up with the man to see how he was doing. While he had found a way to get off the streets, Bobbitt's story was not as bright as it appeared months earlier.\n\nInstead of a house, Bobbitt told the newspaper he opted for a camper, which he apparently parked on land the McClure's family owned. His \"dream truck,\" he claimed, was broken. And he still hadn't found a job.\n\nBobbitt said he was still struggling with drugs and returned to rehab.\n\n\"I didn't get involved in drugs overnight,\" Bobbitt said. \"It's going to be a struggle for the rest of my life.\"\n\nNew home, December 2017\n\nIn early December, Bobbitt and McClure's story went national. Media outlets across the country were sharing their story, and Bobbitt \u2014 who said he was a recovering drug addict \u2014 revealed how his life had changed.\n\n\"Three weeks ago \u2026 I was homeless on the streets of Philadelphia,\" Bobbitt told The Philadelphie Inquirer, while a photographer snapped pictures of the pair. \"I really didn't have any hope, didn't know what my future was.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old man told the newspaper donations from more than 14,000 people allowed him to find a home in New Jersey, a cell phone, computer and used truck.\n\n\"We're not angelic people looking for a cause.\" \u2014 Mark D'Amico\n\nMcClure's boyfriend, D'Amico, explained how the money would be distributed to Bobbitt in the coming years.\n\n\"We're not angelic people looking for a cause,\" he told the Inquirer, adding, \"It's like we had a child instantly.\"\n\nHomeless \"hero,\" November 2017\n\nIn early November 2017, McClure, then 27, shared a touching story about her car ran out of gas on I-95 and a homeless man came to her rescue. She said a man named \"Johnny\" walked over to her car, instructed her to keep the doors locked and returned with a red gas can, which he purchased with the last $20 he had on him.\n\n\"Johnny did not ask me for a dollar, and I couldn\u2019t repay him at that moment because I didn\u2019t have any cash, but I have been stopping by his spot for the past few weeks,\" McClure posted on a GoFundMe page. \"I repaid him for the gas, gave him a jacket, gloves, a hat, and warm socks, and I give him a few dollars every time I see him. I wish that I could do more for this selfless man, who went out of his way just to help me that day. He is such a great guy, and talking to him each time I see him makes me want to help him more and more.\"\n\nThe young woman then shared a photo of herself with the man, posing on the side of the road with piles of trash visible in the background. She asked followers to help support him so his life \"can get back to being normal.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, donations started to pour in. Within days, McClure surpassed her initial $100,000 goal.

Their first guidelines, published in 2014, made clear bishops were under no obligation to report crimes to police.\n\nWhile the scandal hasn't yet erupted in Italy on the scale that it has elsewhere, there have been several high-profile cases of abuse and cover-up by bishops that show the Italian church is by no means immune to the problem.\n\nBassetti acknowledged that \"in the past\" the Italian church sought to avoid scandal at all cost by keeping cases quiet. But he said the Italian bishops, at their just-concluded national assembly, had made a \"radical, evangelical choice\" toward transparency.\n\n\"The Gospel says there shouldn't be scandals, but if there are scandals, it's better that they are exposed so that the truth can triumph,\" he told reporters. \"This calls us all to a great transparency.\"\n\nHe said the Italian church is updating its guidelines, but it's not clear to what extent the revised norms will address when bishops cover up abuse or are themselves accused of sexual misconduct, an issue that dominated the just-ended conference of U.S. bishops this week.\n\nPope Francis, who as bishop of Rome has a unique relationship with the Italian conference, has summoned bishops from around the world to a February summit on abuse prevention."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Jennifer Earl", "title": "'Mercury in retrograde': Should we expect 3 weeks of bad luck?", "description": "If you're experiencing a spell of bad luck, many people may ask you the same question: is Mercury in retrograde?", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/mercury-in-retrograde-should-we-expect-3-weeks-of-bad-luck", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/mercury1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:59:00Z", "content": "If you're experiencing a spell of bad luck, many people may ask you the same question: is Mercury in retrograde?

Astrologists believe the planet is to blame for bringing periods of misfortune down to Earth \u2013 and it's happening again on Friday.\n\nMercury is expected to enter retrograde, appearing to turn the opposite direction in relation to other planets within its solar system, for the second time in 2018 on Friday. It will remain in that position until Dec. 6.\n\n\"Normally, the planets move west-to-east through the stars at night. This is referred to as prograde motion,\" a blog post by NASA's Astrophysics Science Division (ASD) explains. \"However, periodically the motion changes and they move east-to-west through the stars. We call this retrograde motion.\"\n\nMYSTERIOUS 'CREATURE' SPOTTED IN JUPITER'S CLOUDS STUNS NASA, SPACE ENTHUSIASTS\n\nWhen planets go through retrograde, they just appear to be moving in the opposite direction when we look up at the sky from Earth.\n\n\"It is not REAL in that the planet does not physically start moving backward in its orbit,\" ASD clarifies. \"It just appears to do so because of the relative positions of the planet and Earth and how they are moving around the Sun.\"\n\nFrom our point of view, it looks like the planet is making a giant \"loop-di-loop or squiggle\" in the sky, The Washington Post described in a post last spring.\n\nSince Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, it circles the big star in the center of the solar system faster than any other planet \u2013 \"every 88 Earth days, traveling through space at nearly 112,000 mph,\" according to Space.com.\n\nMARS CURIOUSITY ROVER'S SURPRISING FINDS FROM THE RED PLANET THROUGH THE YEARS\n\nTherefore, Mercury tends to undergo this effect more frequently than its neighbors, about every four months. And every time it does, astrologers warn people to prepare themselves for weeks' worth of bad first dates, work frustrations and a variety of other problems.\n\nSome believe the idea of the planet turning back represents a suggestion that people should reflect back on their lives. Thus, it's a bad idea to start anything new \u2013 relationships, projects, etc. \u2013 until Mercury is officially out of retrograde, astrology believers say.\n\nThe superstition has grown over the years. Someone even created a website called ismercuryinretrograde.com to track the astrological event and provide an explanation as to why something is \"bumming you out.\"\n\nAstronomers, on the other hand, have repeatedly rejected the theory that Mercury has any impact on your mood or outcome of your day.\n\n\"The idea that the gravity from these very distant bodies affects our lives in some way just doesn't work in the framework of physics,\" Jean-Luc Margot, a planetary astronomer and professor at UCLA, told LiveScience back in 2016.\n\nColumbia University astronomy professor David Helfand agreed, emphasizing that the event is simply an illusion and doesn't have any deeper meaning.\n\n\u201cMagical thinking isn\u2019t going to solve [our problems],\u201d he told the New York Post in 2015. \u201cAstrology has no physical mechanism to explain any physical effect. It doesn\u2019t need to explain anything.\u201d\n\nMany people want to point blame at someone \u2013 or something \u2013 but whether Mercury is in retrograde or not, you're ultimately responsible for your own actions and life, Helfand added."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Tyler McCarthy", "title": "Ronda Rousey called out by Becky Lynch in heated exchange about Holly Holm loss - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Ronda Rousey called out by Becky Lynch in heated exchange about Holly Holm loss Fox News After a nasty sneak attack left WWE superstar Becky Lynch unable to compete in her scheduled bout with Ronda Rousey, the stars turned their battle from physical \u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ronda-rousey-called-out-by-becky-lynch-in-heated-exchange-about-holly-holm-loss", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/RouseyLynch1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:41:38Z", "content": "After a nasty sneak attack left WWE superstar Becky Lynch unable to compete in her scheduled bout with Ronda Rousey, the stars turned their battle from physical to viral with some pretty personal digs.

The wrestler brought up the 2015 loss Rousey had against Holly Holm that resulted in her first loss and a knockout.

The changes for e-cigarettes could kick in within a few months.\n\n'BATKID,' NOW 10, CANCER FREE 5 YEARS AFTER 'SAVING' SAN FRANCISCO\n\nBattery-powered e-cigarettes are more popular among teens than regular smokes and are considered safer. But many versions contain potentially addictive nicotine, and health officials believe they set kids who try them on a path toward regular cigarettes.\n\nGottlieb called for measures to prevent the marketing of e-cigarettes directly to kids and ensure there are added safeguards preventing online sales of e-cigarettes to minors. He also proposed beefing up measures so that convenience stores and some other retailers don't sell e-cigarettes in kid-friendly flavors like cherry and vanilla. They could still be sold in vape shops or other businesses who don't admit minors.\n\nSmoking is the nation's leading cause of preventable illness, causing more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States. The FDA currently bans sales of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to those under 18.\n\nIn 2009, the government banned a number of kid-friendly flavorings in cigarettes. But after an aggressive lobbying effort by tobacco companies, menthol was exempted.\n\nGottlieb's proposal for e-cigarette flavorings also exempts menthol. He said menthol e-cigarettes may be an option for adults who turn to vaping products to quit regular cigarettes and he decided not to push for an end to menthol flavoring in vaping products.\n\nDOC: 2 BOYS KILLED IN NJ OUTBREAK WERE IN 'IRREVERSIBLE SHOCK' WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT HOSPITAL\n\nSmoking has been declining for more than five decades. Some 42 percent of U.S. adults smoked in the early 1960s. Last year, it was down to 14 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nExperts credit anti-smoking campaigns, cigarette taxes and smoking bans for most of the decline in the adult rate. But some say adult smokers switching to e-cigarettes have also helped drive down the rate in recent years.\n\nThe cigarette smoking rate is even lower among high school students -- about 9 percent, according to the latest figures.\n\nBut e-cigarette use jumped 78 percent this year in high school kids and 48 percent among middle school kids, Gottlieb said, citing new survey data.\n\nThe FDA has been taken earlier steps to investigate the marketing of e-cigarettes by a number of companies, including the market leader, Juul Labs Inc. of a San Francisco. Getting out ahead of today's FDA announcement, Juul on Tuesday stopped filling store orders for mango, fruit, creme and cucumber pods and will resume sales only to retailers that scan IDs and take other steps to verify a buyer is at least 21. The company said Juul will continue to sell menthol and mint at stores, and sell all flavors through its website."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Jon Costantino", "title": "The Todd Starnes Show \u2013 November 15th, 2018", "description": "Here's what happened on The Todd Starnes Radio Show: Todd speaks with columnist Monica Crowley about the fallout from the midterm elections and President Trump's relationship with the press.

The report also claims that the company's leadership was not quick enough to combat the growing menace of fake news on its platform.\n\nIn its blog post, Facebook said that both Sandberg and Zuckerberg \"have been deeply involved in the fight against false news.\"\n\nThe social network also fired back over the company's response to Russian election meddling. \"The story asserts that we knew about Russian activity as early as the spring of 2016 but were slow to investigate it at every turn. This is not true,\" it said.\n\nWith regard to its handling of Trump's Muslim ban comments, the tech giant said \"to suggest that the internal debate around this particular case was different from other important free speech issues on Facebook is wrong.\"\n\nHowever, in a statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for the Times did not retract any of the conclusions in the report, saying:\n\n\"Our story is accurate and we stand by it.

CUTTING BACK ON FACEBOOK AND SNAPCHAT WILL MAKE YOU LESS LONELY, DEPRESSED, STUDY SAYS\n\nFacebook cut ties Wednesday evening with Definers Public Affairs amid the ongoing outcry over the Times story, but claimed the newspaper is \"wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook's behalf \u2014 or to spread misinformation.\" Facebook acknowledges that Definers did \"encourage members of the press to look into the funding of Freedom from Facebook,\" an umbrella activist group that has called for the tech firm to be broken up on anti-trust grounds. However, Facebook says that encouragement was to demonstrate that Freedom from Facebook is \"not a spontaneous grassroots campaign, but supported by a well-known critic of our company [George Soros].\"\n\nWhile it's true that Soros, who made his fortune in hedge funds, has given money to one of the ten organizations supporting Freedom from Facebook's efforts and once called the platform a \"menace\" to society, the financier and philanthropist has owned shares of Facebook this year through his investment fund.\n\nMeanwhile, Open Society Foundations President Patrick Gaspard sent an open letter to Facebook's executive leadership, board members and Congressional leaders denouncing the company's efforts to \"spread vile propaganda\" about Soros \u2014 a frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories who saw a pipe bomb delivered to his home last month \u2014 as \"astonishing\" and \"beyond the pale.\" Founded by Soros, Open Society Foundations works in over 100 countries around the world to ensure that governments are accountable to their citizens.\n\n\"These efforts appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy to distract from the very real accountability problems your company continues to grapple with. This is reprehensible, and an offense to the core values Open Society seeks to advance,\" Gaspard wrote, adding that he would like to meet with Facebook's leadership in person to discuss the matter further. \"But at bottom, this is not about George Soros or the foundations. Your methods threaten the very values underpinning our democracy.\"\n\nGOOGLE'S SECRET SEARCH STRATEGY: HOW THE TECH GIANT TAMES THE DATA BEAST\n\nFacebook denied the accusation of spreading anti-Semitic tropes regarding Soros, saying: \"To suggest that this was an anti-Semitic attack is reprehensible and untrue.\"\n\nFreedom from Facebook hit back at the social network.\n\n\u201cIf anyone knows about spreading vile propaganda it\u2019s Facebook and if they are hiring Republican political operatives to launch false attacks against the Freedom From Facebook coalition, clearly they are concerned about us and, judging by their stock price and employee morale, they should be,\u201d Freedom From Facebook co-chair Sarah Miller said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cBut nothing more perfectly summarizes our policy case \u2014 that nothing will change at Facebook unless the FTC and Congress act \u2014 than everything Facebook has done over the past year, as laid out in this New York Times piece.\u201d\n\nA Definers spokesperson told Fox News the company is \"proud\" of its partnership with Facebook and that all of the work it did for the tech giant is \"based publicly-available documents and information.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of its blog post, Facebook says it still has \"a long way to go\" but cites a range of measures it has taken in the two years since the 2016 election to improve safety and security and battle misinformation on the platform.

He said he refused to consider Mexico's offer of asylum in the southern part of the country because it was too close to Honduras and he felt unsafe from his country's gangs.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, meanwhile, visited U.S. troops posted at the border in Texas and said the deployment of military personnel ordered by President Donald Trump provides good training for war, despite criticism that the effort is a waste of taxpayer money and a political stunt. Most of the troops are in Texas, more than 1,500 miles from where the caravan is arriving.\n\nThe first wave of migrants in the caravan, which became a central theme of the recent U.S. election, began arriving in Tijuana in recent days, and their numbers have grown each day. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to still be about 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the border, but has recently been moving hundreds of miles a day by hitching rides on trucks and buses.\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan were resting at a Mexico City stadium where the first group stayed several days last week. By early Wednesday, an additional 1,100 migrants from a third and last caravan also arrived at the stadium.\n\nLike most of those in the third caravan, migrant Javier Pineda is from El Salvador, and hopes to reach the United States.

Some of the Marie Antoinette jewelry hadn't been seen in public for 200 years \u2014 until now.\n\nINCREDIBLE PHOTOS OF THE LAST CZAR AND THE RUSSIAN ROYAL FAMILY SURFACE\n\nThe 100 works were sold for a total of $53.1 million, more than seven times the pre-sale high estimate of $7 million. The sale eclipses the previous record for the sale of royal jewels \u2013 the $50.3 million realized when the Duchess of Windsor\u2019s jewels were auctioned in 1987.\n\nAll told, the 10 Marie Antoinette pieces reaped nearly $43 million.\n\nMarie Antoinette, who was 37 at the time of her death, has become synonymous with the decadence of the French monarchy during the pre-revolutionary era. Historians, however, believe that she never uttered the famous words \u201clet them eat cake.\u201d The quote has long been attributed to the queen, who had purportedly just been informed that her starving subjects had no bread.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.

A Democrat familiar with the effort says they are trying to add more names before the letter is publicly released.\n\nIf all those Democrats vote against Pelosi on the floor, Pelosi would not have the votes for speaker.

But the official election for speaker takes place in January, when the entire House of Representatives votes.\n\nAfter arriving in Washington on Tuesday, several Democrats suggested it will be hard for them to support Pelosi for speaker.\n\nRep.-elect Kendra Horn, D-Okla., who unexpectedly defeated GOP Rep. Steve Russell in a seat which had been Republican for years, told Fox News she will vote for \u201cwhat\u2019s best for Oklahoma\u201d and said supporting Pelosi would be \u201cchallenging\u201d in her state.\n\nReps.-elect Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Joe Neguse, D-Colo., indicated they are undecided regarding who they will support.\n\nPolitico reported that Pelosi and her allies are arguing that it\u2019s important for a woman to be elected speaker.\n\n\u201cI think it would look ridiculous if we win back the House \u2026 we have a pink wave with women who have brought back the House, then you\u2019re going to not elect the leader who led the way? No,\u201d Florida Rep. Lois Frankel told Politico. \u201cThat would be wrong.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, certainly, see a Pelosi speakership as beneficial to them.

The sites are located in nine governorates including the capital Sanaa, Aden, and the eastern governorate of Marib.\n\n\"The war in Yemen has impacted everything and has not spared the lives of Yemenis and their cultural property, including their rich history, unifying culture and collective memory,\" said Radhya al-Mutawakel, who heads Mawatana. \"It is not only a loss for Yemenis, but also for the cultural heritage of all peoples.\"\n\nThe report covers airstrikes and other attacks since mid-2014, when Yemen's Houthi rebels descended from their highlands and occupied most of the northern region. Houthis forced the legitimate government to flee the country and seek military intervention from gulf neighbors. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition backing the government waged an extensive air campaign against Houthis and imposed a land, sea and air embargo. Within a few months, the coalition pushed the Houthis out of the southern region while the north remained in the Houthis' grip.\n\nAmong the sites that have been damaged is the Old City section of the capital Sanaa, which is on the UNESCO list of world heritage sites. It has come under heavy airstrikes several times that have demolished many of the area's ancient buildings.\n\nIn many cases, Houthis turned some of the archaeological sites into army barracks, resulting in the Saudi-led coalition striking the sites, causing heavy damage to the ancient monuments.\n\nOn other occasions, extremist groups operating in the country blew up churches, temples and ancient Sufi shrines, exploiting the state of lawlessness and the breakdown of order in the country after years of the war.\n\nThe Mawatana organization accused all parties to the conflict of having \"a hostile attitude toward history.\" It urged the international community to take responsibility for the protection of the cultural heritage of Yemen saying that parties are acting with impunity because of a lack of accountability. It added there is a need to place archaeological sites and monuments on an \"enhanced protection\" list adopted by the 1999 Hague Convention to prevent attacks against them and protect them from being used as military barracks or sites.\n\nThe report also points to the war's impact on the massive Marib dam, which is nearly 3,000 years old and one of the world's oldest. Built of stone cut from the mountains, Yemenis take pride in the dam because it is a symbol of their ancient civilization. The northern gate of the dam was struck in May 2015 by coalition forces as Houthis took positions near the site.\n\nBaraqish was a religious and commercial hub in the 5th century B.C. It features prominent temples and was a center for Yemen's famed frankincense trade. Houthis took control of the site in mid-August 2015. Mawatana quoted witnesses as saying they turned the site into a place for weapons caches, causing the coalition to target it more than once. The Houthis also booby-trapped the sites, according to the report.\n\nKnown as the Manhattan of the Desert, the ancient site of Shibam in the southern governorate of Hadramawt sustained damage after Islamic State insurgents rammed a bomb-laden car through a checkpoint outside the city and the explosions caused damage to some of the buildings.\n\nOther sites mentioned in the report include the fortress at Kawkaban, the al-Hadi mosque in Saada and the military museum in Aden. Two Taiz landmarks \u2014 the al-Sudi and al-Rumaymeh domes \u2014 were totally destroyed by extremist groups, according to the report. In Dar al-Hajar palace in Lahj, Houthi rebels used artillery and tanks to shell the sites, causing extensive damage."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Adam Shaw", "title": "Trump says Mueller investigators \u2018have gone absolutely nuts,\u2019 are \u2018a disgrace to our Nation\u2019", "description": "President Trump on Thursday ripped into Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, accusing investigators of having \u201cgone absolutely nuts\u201d and saying they are \u201ca disgrace\u201d to the country.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-mueller-investigators-have-gone-absolutely-nuts-are-a-disgrace-to-our-nation", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/14/694940094001_5966668340001_5966668235001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:00:42Z", "content": "President Trump on Thursday ripped into Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, accusing investigators of having \u201cgone absolutely nuts\u201d and saying they are \u201ca disgrace\u201d to the country. \u201cThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a tota\u2026 [+1906 chars]", "fulltext": "President Trump on Thursday ripped into Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, accusing investigators of having \u201cgone absolutely nuts\u201d and saying they are \u201ca disgrace\u201d to the country.\n\n\u201cThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess.

The announcement was published in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe brutal death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who had been critical of the crown prince, has shocked the world and led many analysts and officials to believe it could not have been carried out without the prince's knowledge.\n\nTurkey says an assassination squad was sent from Riyadh for the writer and insists the orders for the killing came from the highest levels of the Saudi government, but not King Salman.\n\nAfter issuing the statement, the spokesman for al-Mojeb's office, Shalan al-Shalan, told a rare press conference Thursday in Riyadh that Khashoggi's killers had set in motion plans for the killing on Sept. 29 \u2014 three days before his slaying in Istanbul. He says the killers drugged and killed the writer inside the consulate, before dismembering the body and handing it over for disposal by an unidentified local collaborator.\n\nProsecutors said the highest-level official incriminated in connection with the killing is former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri, who was fired as pressure from Turkey and the world mounted on Saudi Arabia.\n\nAl-Assiri, a close confidant of Prince Mohammed, is facing charges that include ordering Khashoggi's forced return to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi prosectuors said al-Assiri deemed Khashoggi a threat because of his work as a writer and because he was allegedly backed by groups and countries that are hostile to Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, it appears al-Mojeb has stopped short of accusing al-Assiri of ordering the killing itself \u2014 further distancing the killers from the crown prince's inner circle.\n\nKhashoggi had been living in self-imposed exile abroad for nearly a year before he was killed by Saudi agents at the consulate on Oct. 2. In his writing, he was especially critical of the crown prince, who'd been leading a wide-reaching crackdown on activists and critics inside the kingdom since last year.\n\nThe kingdom also confirmed Turkish claims that a 15-man hit squad was sent to Turkey, and that these agents killed Khashoggi.\n\nThe writer's body has not been found. Khashoggi had gone to the consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. His Turkish fiancee waited outside and first raised the alarm about his disappearance.\n\nThe prosecutor said 21 people are now in custody, with 11 indicted and referred to trial.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to fix the spelling of the first name of the top Saudi prosecutor and to say that he did not hold the press conference but his spokesman."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Thomas Byrne", "title": "AFMW: Emanuel AME Survivors on Finding Forgiveness in the Face of Hate", "description": "Emanuel AME Survivor Mrs. Polly Sheppard and Rose Simmons, daughter of victim Reverend Daniel Simmons, Jr. along with Pastor Dimas Salaberrios and John Shepherd--producers of \"Emanuel\" the Charleston Shooting Documentary stopped by to spend \"A Few Moments Wit\u2026", "url": "https://radio.foxnews.com/2018/11/15/afmw-emanuel-ame-survivors-on-finding-forgiveness-in-the-face-of-hate/", "urlToImage": "https://radio.foxnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Capture-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:05:30Z", "content": "Emanuel AME Survivor Mrs. Polly Sheppard and Rose Simmons, daughter of victim Reverend Daniel Simmons, Jr. along with Pastor Dimas Salaberrios and John Shepherd--producers of \"Emanuel\" the Charleston Shooting Documentary stopped by to spend \"A Few Moments Wit\u2026 [+713 chars]", "fulltext": "Emanuel AME Survivor Mrs. Polly Sheppard and Rose Simmons, daughter of victim Reverend Daniel Simmons, Jr. along with Pastor Dimas Salaberrios and John Shepherd--producers of \"Emanuel\" the Charleston Shooting Documentary stopped by to spend \"A Few Moments With\" FOX News' Crystal I.

The move, which takes effect in 48 hours, leaves Netanyahu with the support of just 61 out of 120 lawmakers.\n\nWith other coalition partners also flexing their muscles and the opposition parties demanding an early election, the days of Netanyahu's current government seem to be numbered.\n\nLieberman's abrupt resignation came in protest to a cease-fire reached with Gaza militants that ended two days of intense fighting. The hard-liner had demanded a far harsher Israeli response to the widest wave of Gaza rocket fire against Israel since a 50-day war in 2014, but was overruled by Netanyahu.\n\nIn his live TV announcement on Wednesday, Lieberman lashed out the government's weakness and termed the cease-fire \"surrender to terrorism.\"\n\nThe move immediately set off furious political jockeying, with insiders predicting it marked the opening salvo of a new political campaign.\n\nParliamentary elections are schedule for a year from now but Israeli governments rarely serve out their full terms. The last time that happened was in 1988. Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election.\n\nNetanyahu's fiercest coalition rival, Education Minister Naftali Bennett of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, was the first to pounce, threatening to leave the coalition too if he wasn't appointed defense minister in Lieberman's place. That, however, appeared unlikely given the bad blood between the two and the overall shaky nature of such a slim coalition.\n\nThe government also faces a looming Supreme Court-dictated deadline to pass a contentious new law mandating the military draft of ultra-Orthodox men. It has deeply divided the coalition and threatened to break it up even before Lieberman bolted.\n\n\"It was very difficult yesterday evening to find anyone in the political establishment who would say that elections are far off. Any date between March and May 2019 appears logical,\" wrote columnist Ben Caspit in the Maariv daily. \"The Netanyahu government is stumbling toward its end.\"\n\nWith such uncertainty, the major players are already positioning themselves.\n\n\"This government has failed to establish deterrence. This is not a right-wing government and there is no point to its existence,\" Bennett's party colleague, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, told Israel's Army Radio. \"Bennett could be a big help to the prime minister as defense minister.\"\n\nNetanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself, but the current timing is not ideal for him. He has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his ruling Likud Party.\n\nA poll aired Wednesday on Israel's top-rated TV newscast after Lieberman's resignation showed 74 percent of Israelis to be displeased with Netanyahu's handling of the recent Gaza crisis.\n\nNetanyahu still appeared to have little competition for the post of prime minister, though support for his Likud party dipped compared to previous polls. If elections were held today, Likud looked to win 29 seats, followed by the centrist Yesh Atid party at 18 and Labor at 11.\n\nThe Midgam poll surveyed 500 Israelis and had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nNetanyahu is also vulnerable to a potential corruption indictment that could rattle the entire political campaign.\n\nPolice have already questioned Netanyahu a dozen times and recommended that he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases. The first involves allegedly taking gifts from billionaires and the second for allegedly discussing legislation that favored a major newspaper in exchange for positive media coverage. Netanyahu has also been grilled about a corruption case involving Israel's telecom giant.\n\nIsrael's attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, is expected to make a decision on charges in the coming months.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily rejected the accusations against him as part of a media-orchestrated witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "SWNS", "title": "Otter filmed running through supermarket in Ireland - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Otter filmed running through supermarket in Ireland Fox News This is the hilarious moment an otter was caught on CCTV running around a supermarket.

Nelson, a Democrat, trails Scott, a Republican, by about 12,500 votes, down from Scott\u2019s 56,000-vote lead on election night, Fox Orlando reported.\n\nThe paper reported that the ruling gives Nelson a chance to chip away at Scott's lead, but would be unlikely to change the race's outcome.\n\nScott's campaign is expected to appeal, the report said.\n\nFlorida officially declared a recount Saturday and since then, the state\u2019s 67 county election offices have been racing against time running their ballots through the tallying machine. Some counties only have a few thousand votes but the likes of Miami-Dade has more than 800,000 and Broward clocks in around 700,000.\n\nElection workers have until 3 p.m. on Thursday to finish their machine recount. It is unclear whether all the counties will meet the deadline as tallying machines overheated earlier this week in Palm Beach County.\n\nThe overheating forced staffers to go back and recount 174,000 early voting ballots because of mismatched results.\n\nBroward County reportedly concluded its machine recount early Thursday morning, NBC 6 reported.\n\nOnce the machine recount is completed, state law requires a hand review of races that are within 0.25 percentage points. Scott is currently leading Nelson by .14 percentage points, essentially guaranteeing another recount that will last through the weekend.\n\nFox News\u2019 confirmed Wednesday that Florida election officials asked federal prosecutors to look into allegations state Democrats sent faulty forms to voters in four counties that could have resulted in mail-in ballots being disqualified, the latest in a series of issues that have emerged the contentious race.\n\nA top attorney in the Department of State wrote a letter to three Florida federal prosecutors asking them to investigate irregularities related to forms in Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Broward counties.\n\nThe claims surround date changes on official forms used to fix mail-in ballots, known as cure affidavits.

There were no loud explosions as the journalists were asked to stay hundreds of meters (yards) away from the site. The military later allowed the journalists to watch soldiers and other workers bulldozing another guard post with excavators.\n\nSouth Korea is dismantling its guard posts mostly with construction equipment because of safety and environment concerns. But it used dynamites for one of the Cheorwon structure because it was located on a high hill where it was difficult to move up excavators, according to Seoul's Defense Ministry.\n\nNorth Korea was demolishing its guard posts with explosives, according to South Korean media.\n\nThose guard posts are inside the 248-kilometer (155-mile) -long, 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) -wide border, called the Demilitarized Zone. Unlike its name, it's the world's most heavily fortified border with an estimated 2 million land mines peppered inside and near the zone. The area is the scene of numerous violence and bloodsheds since the 1945 division of the Korean Peninsula, and civilians need special government approvals to enter the zone.\n\nThe Koreas have agreed to dismantle or disarm 11 of their guard posts each by the end of this month before jointly verifying their works next month. Inside the DMZ, South Korea was known to have run about 60 posts guarded by layers of barbed-wire fences and manned by combat troops with machine guns.

To thank him, McClure, 28, and her boyfriend, Mark D'Amico, 39, created a GoFundMe account to raise funds for Bobbitt. Around 14,000 people donated to the campaign, which brought in more than $400,000 overall.\n\nBut investigators said the three deliberately prevented donors from gaining information \"that would affect their judgment about solicited contribution to that fundraising effort,\" according to the station. Now they will face charges including conspiracy and theft by deception, a source familiar with the case told NBC 10.\n\nThe couple turned themselves in on Wednesday to Burlington County authorities, the source said. It was unlcear if Bobbitt was with them. The Burlington County Prosecutor\u2019s office is expected to make an announcement in the case on Thursday, The New York Post reported, citing multiple reports.\n\nThe story appeared to begin to fall apart after Bobbitt claimed that the couple used the GoFundMe money as \"personal piggy bank,\" and sued the couple in August over the funds.\n\nBobbitt\u2019s attorney, Jacqueline Promislo, told The New York Post in September that the couple started to spend the money right after depositing it into their bank account. Bobbitt accused the two of mismanaging the donations, which the couple initially denied.\n\n\u201cThey went on shopping sprees,\u201d Promislo told the paper. \u201c[Bobbitt] tells me they had a Louis Vuitton bag and Chanel sunglasses, a new iPhone 10.\u201d\n\nBut the couple claimed they withheld the money to help Bobbitt. They said once the money came in, Bobbitt began to give some to relatives and spend it on drugs. He ultimately received roughly $75,000 from the GoFundMe, which he used to purchase a camper and SUV \u2014 both of which he no longer has, reports said.\n\nD\u2019Amico claimed in August that he controls the funds and that he would dispense the money when Bobbitt gets a job and stops using drugs. Police had raided the couple's New Jersey home in September, confiscating a new BMW, jewelry and cash, NBC 10 reported.\n\nMcClure and D'Amico's attorney, Ernest Badway, said in court in Septemeber that about $200,000 had gone to Bobbitt. But Superior Court Judge Paula Dow said Badway indicated he was \"misadvised\" by his clients and that later the court learned there was no money left.\n\nFox News emailed Bobbitt's reported lawyers, Chris Fallon and Jacqueline Promislo, early Thursday and did not get an immediate response. Fox News also reached out to Ernest Badway, who has been the couple's attorney, and he said no comment.\n\nBadway said in September that one or both could be indicted, saying his clients plan to invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, NJ.com reported.\n\nIn September, GoFundMe, along with the law firm (Cozen O'Connor) representing Bobbitt, had said that the Marine veteran will receive the balance of what he was not given of the hundreds of thousands raised for him, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\n\nFox News' Nicole Darrah and Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sri Lankan lawmakers fight in Parliament over PM dispute", "description": "Rival lawmakers exchanged blows in Sri Lanka's Parliament on Thursday as disputed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa claimed the speaker had no authority to remove him from office by voice vote.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/sri-lankan-lawmakers-fight-in-parliament-over-pm-dispute", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-a9068973b71448ecbbc34900375c7b70.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T07:27:25Z", "content": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka Rival lawmakers exchanged blows in Sri Lanka's Parliament on Thursday as disputed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa claimed the speaker had no authority to remove him from office by voice vote.

When Parliament re-convened, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the country had no government and there was no prime minister \u2014 either Rajapaksa or his rival whose ousting in late October by the president started the crisis.\n\nRajapaksa disagreed, saying \"a vote should have been taken. Such important motions should not be passed by a voice vote.\" He added that Jayasuriya has no power to remove or appoint the prime minister and Cabinet members.\n\nHe accused the speaker of being partial and representing the position of his party, the United National Party, which is led by ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.\n\nRajapaksa also called for fresh elections, suggesting that it was the best way to resolve the crisis.\n\nClashes erupted after the opposition asked for a vote on Rajapaksa's statement, with lawmakers supporting him gathering in the middle of the house while some ran toward the speaker shouting slogans condemning his behavior.\n\nMore than three dozen lawmakers fought and some who fell on the floor were kicked by rivals. Some of the lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa threw water bottles, books and trash cans at the speaker. Lawmakers opposed to Rajapaksa surrounded Jayasuriya to protect him. The ensuing commotion went on for about half an hour before Jayasuriya adjourned the house.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a crisis since Oct. 26, when President Maithripala Sirisena suddenly fired Wickremesinghe and replaced him with Rajapaksa. The former president is considered a hero by some of the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nSirisena had also suspended Parliament, apparently to allow Rajapaksa time to gather support among lawmakers. But Wickremesinghe insisted his firing was unconstitutional. He refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned to prove he still has support.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court suspended Sirisena's order to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections until next month.\n\nWickremesinghe said on Wednesday that the no-confidence vote proves that Rajapaksa's administration does not enjoy the support of Parliament and is illegal.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Louis Casiano", "title": "Texas education officials vote to keep Moses in social studies lessons", "description": "Texas education officials approved keeping the biblical figure Moses in the state\u2019s social studies curriculum Wednesday while voting to change language that links Islamic fundamentalism with terrorism.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-education-officials-vote-to-keep-moses-in-social-studies-lessons", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/desk.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T07:18:36Z", "content": "Texas education officials tentatively approved keeping the biblical figure Moses in the state\u2019s social studies curriculum Wednesday while voting to change the language that potentially links Islamic fundamentalism with terrorism.

He argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are \"not anywhere near right.\" He added that he believes that \"very quickly we'll know the real cost. So we'll keep you posted as the real costs come in.\"\n\nIn his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.\n\n\"That's over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa's troops \u2014 revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,\" he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.\n\nThe Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.\n\nIn addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.\n\nCritics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an \"invasion.\" Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.\n\nAsked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.\n\nNielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to \"back up\" Customs and Border Protection. \"Right now that's our role and that's all our role is,\" he said.\n\n\"The eyes of the world right now \u2014 certainly all of the Americans \u2014 are on you,\" Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a \"non-traditional\" mission. \"We're here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,\" he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.\n\nOne soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.\n\nMattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is \"somewhat to be determined.\"\n\n\"When you're in something like this,\" Mattis said, \"it's dynamic, it's unpredictable. We'll have to see.\"\n\nIn an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been \"very good training\" because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands \u2014 such as loading aircraft \u2014 that must be met in wartime.\n\n\"In terms of readiness, it's actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,\" he said.\n\nMattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. \"It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Radio correspondent Sagar Meghani contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "Lawyer In Lockup", "description": "The man who represents adult film actress Stormy Daniels has been arrested on domestic violence charges, you'll hear what Michael Avenatti said as he walked out of the police department.

A gated outdoor courtyard can accommodate hundreds more.\n\nThe city's thriving factories are always looking for workers, and several thousand Haitian migrants who were turned away at the U.S. border have found jobs and settled here in the last two years, but the prospect of thousands more destitute Central Americans has posed new challenges.\n\nDelia Avila, director of Tijuana's family services department, who is helping spearhead the city's response, said migrants who can arrange legal status in Mexico are welcome to stay.\n\n\"Tijuana is a land of migrants. Tijuana is a land that has known what it is to embrace thousands of co-nationals and also people from other countries,\" Avila said.\n\nMexican law enforcement was out in force in a city that is suffering an all-time-high homicide rate. A group of about 50 migrants, mostly women and children, walked through downtown streets Thursday from the city shelter to a breakfast hall under police escort.\n\nAs buses from western and central Mexico trickled in overnight and into the morning, families camped inside the bus terminal and waited for word on where they could find a safe place to sleep. One shelter designed for 45 women and children was housing 100; another designed for 100 had nearly 200.\n\nMany endured the evening chill to sleep at an oceanfront park with a view of San Diego office towers and heavily armed U.S. Border Patrol agents on the other side of a steel-bollard fence.\n\nOscar Zapata, 31, reached the Tijuana bus station at 2 a.m. from Guadalajara with his wife and their three children, ages 4, 5 and 12, and headed to the breakfast hall, where migrants were served free beef and potatoes.\n\nBack home in La Ceiba, Honduras, he was selling pirated CDs and DVDs in the street when two gangs demanded \"protection\" money. He had already seen a colleague gunned down on a street corner because he couldn't pay. He said gangs called him and his wife on their cellphones and showed up at their house, threatening to kidnap his daughter and force her into prostitution if he didn't pay.\n\nWhen he heard about the caravan on the TV news last month, he didn't think twice.\n\n\"It was the opportunity to get out,\" Zapata said.\n\nZapata said he hopes to join a brother in Los Angeles but has not yet decided on his next move. Like many others, he planned to wait in Tijuana for others in the caravan to arrive and gather more information before seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nByron Jose Blandino, a 27-year-old bricklayer from Nicaragua who slept in the converted gymnasium, said he wanted to request asylum but not until he could speak with someone well-versed in U.S. law and asylum procedures.\n\n\"The first thing is to wait,\" Blandino said. \"I do not want to break the laws of any country. If I could enter in a peaceful manner, that would be good.\n\nTo claim asylum in San Diego, migrants enter their names in a tattered notebook held together by duct tape and managed by the migrants in a plaza outside the entry to the main border crossing.\n\nOn Thursday, migrants who registered six weeks ago were getting their names called. The waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 names and stands to become much longer with the caravans.\n\nFrancisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months in Mexico at current processing rates. For that reason, the state has asked Mexican federal authorities to encourage others in caravans to go to other border cities.\n\nRueda reported that about 1,750 migrants from the caravan had now reached Tijuana. Private shelters can house about 700, and the city-owned gym and sports complex has a capacity of 1,000 with the potential to expand to 3,000.\n\n\"This is not a crisis,\" he told reporters, while allowing that \"this is an extraordinary situation.\"\n\nThere are 7,000 jobs available in the state for those who can obtain legal status in Mexico, Rueda said. He touted Tijuana's integration of Haitian migrants over the last two years and the state's relatively low unemployment rate.\n\nThe migrants have met some resistance from local residents, about 100 of whom confronted a similar-size group of Central Americans who were camped out by the U.S. border fence Wednesday night.\n\n\"You're not welcome\" and \"Get out!\" the locals said, marching up to the group.\n\nPolice kept the two sides apart.\n\nVladimir Cruz, a migrant from El Salvador, shook his head and said: \"These people are the racists, because 95 percent of people here support us.\"\n\n\"It is just this little group. ... They are uncomfortable because we're here,\" Cruz said.\n\nPlayas de Tijuana, as the area is known, is an upper-middle-class enclave, and residents appeared worried about crime and sanitation. One protester shouted, \"This isn't about discrimination, it is about safety!\"\n\nThere are real questions about how the city of more than 1.6 million will manage to handle the migrant caravans working their way through Mexico, which may total 10,000 people in all.\n\n\"No city in the world is prepared to receive this number of migrants,\" said Tijuana social development director Mario Osuna, adding that the city hopes Mexico's federal government \"will start legalizing these people immediately\" so they can get jobs and earn a living.\n\nDozens of gay and transgender migrants in the caravan were already lining up Thursday to submit asylum claims, though it was unclear how soon they would be able to do so.\n\nThe caravan has fragmented somewhat in recent days in a final push to the border, with some migrants moving rapidly in buses and others falling behind.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds were stranded for most of the day at a gas station in Navojoa, some 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from Tijuana.\n\n\"We were dropped here at midnight ... in the middle of nowhere, where supposedly some buses were going to come pick us up, but nothing,\" Alejandra Grisel Rodriguez of Honduras told The Associated Press by phone. \"We are without water, without food.\"\n\nAfter about 12 hours seven buses began arriving to collect the migrants, Rodriguez said, but they quickly filled up.\n\n\"We would need at least 40 or 50,\" she said.\n\nJesus Edmundo Valdez, coordinator of firefighters and civil defense in Navojoa, said Wednesday that authorities were providing food, water and medical attention to migrants there.

The fear was justified \u2014 two co-defendants died before the trial was completed.\n\nOn Friday, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan will be judged on additional charges of crimes against humanity, such as murder, extermination, enslavement, torture and persecution on political, racial, and religious grounds; genocide, for the killings of members of the Vietnamese and Cham ethnic groups; and more breaches of the Geneva Conventions, including willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nAs members of the Khmer Rouge leadership under the late Pol Pot, they have been prosecuted under the legal doctrine of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nCases launched against four additional, middle-ranking Khmer Rouge officials have been scuttled or frozen and are unlikely to be revived.\n\nIf the current trial is the last staged by the U.N.-assisted international tribunal \u2014 officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia \u2014 it will have convicted three individuals at a cost of more than $300 million.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 after a bloody five-year civil war. They immediately attempted a radical transformation of Cambodia into a peasant society, emptying cities and forcing the population to work the land.\n\nThey backed up their rule with ruthless elimination of perceived enemies, and were driven from power in early 1979 by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam, which had suffered border attacks from Khmer Rouge forces.\n\nAlthough atrocities were carried out on a massive scale, political realities \u2014 specifically the repeated demands by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen that no more suspects be prosecuted \u2014 appear to preclude further cases being pursued by the tribunal. Hun Sen insists that further prosecutions could cause unrest.\n\nIn addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal can lay claim to only one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nHun Sen himself was a midlevel Khmer Rouge commander before defecting while the group was still in power, and several senior members of his ruling Cambodian People's Party share similar backgrounds. He helped cement his political control by making alliances with other former Khmer Rouge commanders.\n\nThe ground rules under which the tribunal was established in 2005 are complicated, providing for hybrid courts pairing Cambodian judges and prosecutors with international counterparts.\n\nCambodian court officials, known for their loyalty to Hun Sen's government, are in a position to base their judgments on the tribunal's inexact guidelines limiting prosecutions to senior leaders or persons considered \"most responsible\" for atrocities, or simply cease cooperation.\n\nAlthough Nuon Chea had an especially low profile in the already secretive group, his importance can be gauged by his nom de guerre of \"Brother Number Two,\" reflecting his position as Pol Pot's right-hand man.\n\nAccording to a 2001 study by Cambodia scholar Stephen Heder and legal expert Brian D. Tittemore, there was \"substantial and compelling evidence\" that Nuon Chea devised and implemented the Khmer Rouge's execution policies.\n\nKhieu Samphan had at one point been the smiling, polite figurehead who nominally was the head of state in the Khmer Rouge regime. He was able to trade on his reputation as an honest left-wing academic and lawmaker in 1960s Cambodia before repression drove him underground and into the jungle with the then-nascent Khmer Rouge movement.\n\nThe Heder and Tittemore study acknowledged that evidence against Khieu Samphan was not as extensive as against Nuon Chea and others, but nevertheless suggested he \"encouraged lower level (Khmer Rouge) officials to perpetrate executions and, at least in some instances, monitored and contributed to the implementation of Party policies by regional authorities.\"\n\nHeder, who for a time was an investigator for the tribunal, charged in a 1990 paper that Khieu Samphan was promoted up the ranks of the Khmer Rouge \"because he remained steadfastly loyal to his leadership and policies while others who had earlier cooperated with Pol Pot and his Communist Party were detained or killed because they disagreed with or were suspected of disagreeing with what Pol Pot was doing.\"\n\n\"Khieu Samphan's political star rose literally on heaps of corpses,\" Heder wrote.\n\nConfronted in court with such charges, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan showed little remorse. Khieu Samphan denied knowing about matters including forced marriages and violent oppression of minorities, and both men mounted political defenses.\n\nKhieu Samphan described the claim of genocide as \"Vietnamese propaganda,\" a defense he and other former Khmer Rouge leaders have made previously.\n\nCambodians have long been suspicious of Vietnam, their much bigger eastern neighbor, and prejudice against Vietnamese is widespread.\n\nKhieu Samphan also cast blame on the United States for Cambodia's problems. The U.S. heavily bombed the Cambodian countryside during the 1970-75 civil war that led to the Khmer Rouge's seizure of power.\n\n\"I want to bow to the memory of all the innocent victims but also to all those who perished by believing in a better ideal of the brighter future and who died during the five-year war under the American bombardments and (in) the conflict with the Vietnamese invaders,\" Khieu Samphan said. \"Their memory will never be honored by any international tribunal.\"\n\n___\n\nPeck reported from Bangkok."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Samuel Chamberlain", "title": "Judge rules some absentee ballots must be counted in Georgia gubernatorial election", "description": "A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the results of Georgia's gubernatorial race cannot be certified until certain absentee ballots have been counted.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-rules-some-absentee-ballots-must-be-counted-in-georgia-gubernatorial-election", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Abrams20-20Kemp.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T03:03:17Z", "content": "A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the results of Georgia's gubernatorial race cannot be certified until certain absentee ballots have been counted.

However, Jones declined Democratic requests to extend the period during which evidence could be submitted to prove the eligibility of voters who cast provisional ballots. He also declined to order that provisional ballots cast by voters who went to a precinct in the wrong county be counted.\n\nKemp currently has 50.27 percent of the vote, compared to 48.79 percent for Abrams. Abrams' campaign believes she needs a net gain of 17,759 votes to pull Kemp below the 50 percent threshold and force a Dec. 4 runoff. Kemp's campaign said even if every vote that Abrams campaign is arguing for is granted by the courts and counted for her, she cannot overcome his lead or force a runoff.\n\nBoth sides have accused the other of wrongdoing, with Democrats casting doubt on any vote count that ends with Kemp -- Georgia's former secretary of state -- being certified as the winner.\n\n\"We believe that Brian Kemp mismanaged this election to sway it in his favor,\" Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said earlier Wednesday, surrounded by Democratic lawmakers at the Georgia Capitol.\n\nFor their part, Kemp's campaign repeated calls for Abrams to concede, accusing her and her supporters of using \"fake vote totals,\" \"desperate press conferences\" and \"dangerous lawsuits\" to try to steal the election.\n\n\"After all of the theatrics, the math remains the same,\" Kemp campaign spokesman Cody Hall said in an email. \"Abrams lost and Brian Kemp won. This election is over.\"\n\nThe lawsuit Jones ruled on Wednesday was one of several election-related complaints filed before multiple federal judges.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leigh May ordered Gwinnett County election officials Tuesday not to reject absentee ballots just because the voter's birth year is missing or wrong. She also ordered the county to delay certification of its election results until those ballots have been counted.\n\nJones' ruling effectively extended May's order to the other 158 counties in Georgia.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg late Monday ordered state officials not to do their final certification of election results before 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nState law sets a Nov. 20 deadline, but secretary of state's office elections director Chris Harvey testified last week that the state had planned to certify the election results Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for any runoff contests, including those already projected in the races for secretary of state and a Public Service Commission seat.\n\nTotenberg's order left untouched the county certification deadline. Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office, said Wednesday that all counties but Gwinnett have certified their totals.\n\nTotenberg also ordered the secretary of state's office to establish and publicize a hotline or website enabling voters to check whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, why not. And she ordered the secretary of state's office to review or have county election authorities review the eligibility of voters who had to cast provisional ballots because of registration issues.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "ET Online", "title": "Olivia Culpo says she isn't looking to rebound at CMAs after breakup with Danny Amendola - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Olivia Culpo says she isn't looking to rebound at CMAs after breakup with Danny Amendola Fox News Olivia Culpo is looking forward to presenting the award for Vocal Group of the Year at the 2018 CMA Awards, but she made it very clear that she won't be\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-culpo-says-she-isnt-looking-to-rebound-at-cmas-after-breakup-with-danny-amendola", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/Amendola-Culpo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T03:00:23Z", "content": "Olivia Culpo is looking forward to presenting the award for Vocal Group of the Year at the 2018 CMA Awards, but she made it very clear that she won't be looking for love while she's there.

On the eve of this week's meeting, the Vatican issued a surprise order for such action to be delayed until after a global meeting on sex abuse scheduled for February.\n\n\"The decision of the Holy See to constrain us did allow a limited response,\" Bishop Christopher Coyne of Burlington, Vermont said. \"All of us are disappointed that we weren't able to do as much as we wanted.\"\n\nThe U.S. Catholic church has been grappling with sex-abuse scandals for many years, but events this year have taken a heavy toll on the leadership's credibility.\n\nIn August, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, federal prosecutors and attorneys general in several other states have launched investigations.\n\nBishops at this week's meeting appeared to be most angered and embarrassed by the scandal involving disgraced church leader Theodore McCarrick, who allegedly abused and harassed youths and seminarians over many years as he rose to be archbishop of Washington and a member of the College of Cardinals until his removal by Pope Francis in July.\n\nSeveral investigations, including one at the Vatican, are underway to determine who might have known about and covered up McCarrick's alleged misconduct. The U.S. bishops expressed eagerness to learn details of the Vatican probe but defeated a motion Wednesday pressing for access to information uncovered in that process.\n\n\"We have taken no official action to distance ourselves form the shameful behavior of one of our own,\" said Bishop Liam Cary, of Baker, Oregon. \"What do people make of our silence?\"\n\nBishop Michael Olson, of Fort Worth, Texas, noted with regret that McCarrick has not been defrocked and would have been eligible to participate in this week's assembly.\n\n\"He is not welcome,\" Olson said. \"We should say that for his sake, and out of respect for those he has harmed.\"\n\nFor much of Wednesday's session, the bishops discussed the two anti-abuse proposals that initially had been scheduled for votes. One would establish a new code of conduct for individual bishops; the other would create a nine-member special commission, including six lay experts and three members of the clergy, to review complaints against the bishops.\n\nLeaders of the conference said the Vatican intervened to ensure that steps taken by the U.S. bishops would be in harmony with those decided at a Vatican-convened global meeting on sex abuse in February. They also said more time was needed to vet aspects of the U.S. proposals that might conflict with church law.\n\nThe head of the bishops' conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of the Galveston-Houston Archdiocese, said a newly formed sex-abuse task force would work on fine-tuning those and other proposals ahead of the global meeting in Rome in February. One proposed step will be a national mechanism for publishing the names of clergy who face substantiated claims of abuse.\n\n\"I opened this meeting expressing some disappointment \u2014 I end the meeting with hope,\" DiNardo said. \"We leave this place committed to take the strongest possible action at the earliest possible moment.\"\n\nIn other action, the bishops approved a pastoral letter condemning racism, the first time they have spoken as a group on that issue since 1979.\n\n\"Every racist act \u2014 every such comment, every joke, every disparaging look as a reaction to the color of skin, ethnicity or place of origin \u2014 is a failure to acknowledge another person as a brother or sister, created in the image of God,\" the document said.\n\nIt also denounced racial profiling of Hispanics and African-Americans and decried \"the growing fear and harassment\" of people from Muslim countries.\n\nAccording to Catholic News Service, the committee responsible for the pastoral letter rejected a proposed amendment that would have included the Confederate flag as a symbol of hate, along with nooses and swastikas.\n\nThe bishops also voted to endorse a campaign seeking sainthood for Sister Thea Bowman, a Mississippi-born descendant of slaves who became the first black member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration and \u2014 in 1989 \u2014 the first black woman to address a national meeting of the bishops' conference.\n\nAmong the bishops elected to USCCB posts was Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco, who will head the Committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life and Youth. Cordileone, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage, suggested Tuesday that the bishops commission a new study on whether there's a link between clergy sex abuse and the presence of gays in the priesthood. A church-commissioned study in 2004 determined there was not a link.\n\nNot far from the assembly venue, a Minnesota attorney who handles sex abuse cases nationwide and three men who say they were abused by clergy during their boyhoods gathered to announce a lawsuit against the bishops conference, accusing it of hiding the crimes of predator priests.\n\nJeff Anderson, who filed the lawsuit this week in federal court in Minnesota, said the bishops were named because their dioceses kept secret files about clergy whose misconduct might expose the church to more abuse accusations.\n\n\"We are taking the opportunity to do everything we can together to protect kids, to disgorge the secrets,\" Anderson said.\n\nThe federal lawsuit demanding a trial by jury has six plaintiffs; three joined Anderson in Baltimore.\n\nAmong then was Joseph McLean, of Minneapolis. The priest he says abused him decades ago was publicly named as a \"credibly accused\" offender in 2015 by the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis.\n\n\"I am here to protect kids today. I'm here to protect kids tomorrow. And I'm here to protect children who have grown into adults and who haven't had an opportunity to heal from the abuse that they suffered,\" McLean said.\n\n___\n\nCrary reported from New York."}]
