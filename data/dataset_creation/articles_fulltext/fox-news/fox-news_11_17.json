A couple hundred motorcycle riders carrying American flags followed the hearse north to Taylor's hometown of North Ogden in a procession.\n\nOn Friday, a National Guard member stood guard over his casket during an all-night vigil at a mortuary.\n\nTaylor had taken yearlong leave of absence as the mayor of North Ogden to go on his second tour to Afghanistan.

The city opened the complex after other shelters were filled to capacity. Church groups provided portable showers, bathrooms and sinks. The federal government estimates the migrant crowd in Tijuana could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an \"avalanche\" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nWhile many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants' plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at the migrants.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to the many Mexican communities that welcomed the caravan with signs, music and donations of clothing after it entered Mexico nearly a month ago. Countless residents of rural areas pressed fruit and bags of water into the migrants' hands as they passed through southern Mexico, wishing them safe journeys.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, visited the outdoor sports complex Saturday. Rivera expects the migrants will need to be sheltered for eight months or more, and said he is working with Mexico to get more funds to feed and care for them. He expects the migrant numbers in Tijuana to reach 3,400 over the weekend, with another 1,200 migrants having made it to Mexicali, another border city a few hours to the east of Tijuana. An additional 1,500 migrants plan to reach the U.S. border region next week.\n\nRivera said 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision.\n\n\"We want them to return to Honduras,\" Rivera said, adding that each migrant must weigh whether to go home, appeal for asylum in Mexico or wait in line to apply for asylum in the U.S.\n\nThe Mexican Interior Ministry said Friday that 2,697 Central American migrants have requested asylum in Mexico under a program that the country launched on Oct. 26 to more quickly get them credentials needed to live, work and study in southern Mexico.\n\nIvis Mu\u00f1oz, 26, has considered returning to Honduras. The coffee farmer called his father in Atima, Honduras, on Saturday to consult on his next move a few days after being attacked on a beach by locals in Tijuana. His father told him to stick it out.\n\nMunoz has a bullet in his leg. A gang member shot him a year ago in Honduras and threatened to kill him if he sees him again. Munoz said he found out later his girlfriend had been cheating on him with the gang member.\n\nHe's afraid to go home, but he feels unwelcome in Tijuana.\n\nMunoz was asleep on a beach in Tijuana with about two dozen other migrants when rocks came raining down on them around 2 a.m. Wednesday. He heard a man shout in the darkness: \"We don't want you here! Go back to your country!\" Munoz and the others got up and ran for cover, heading toward the residential streets nearby. As the sun rose, they hitched a ride on a passing truck to Tijuana's downtown. Now he is staying at the sports complex.\n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" said Munoz. He fears the U.S. won't grant him asylum, and that he'll get deported if he tries to cross into the country without authorization.\n\nCarlos Padilla, 57, a migrant from Progreso, Honduras, said a Tijuana resident shouted \"migrants are pigs\" as he passed on the street recently. He did not respond. \"We didn't come here to cause problems, we came here with love and with the intention to ask for asylum,\" Padilla said. \"But they treat us like animals here.\"\n\nPadilla said he will likely return to Honduras if the U.S. rejects his asylum request.\n\nThe migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million to handle the influx.\n\nTijuana officials said they converted the municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000; as of Friday night there were 2,397 migrants there.\n\nSome business owners near the shelter complained on Saturday of migrants panhandling and stealing.\n\nFrancisco Lopez, 50, owns a furniture store nearby. He said a group of migrants took food from a small grocery a few doors down, and he worries that crime in the area will rise the longer the migrants stay at the shelter.\n\nOther neighbors expressed empathy.\n\n\"These poor people have left their country and they're in an unfamiliar place,\" said Maria de Jesus Izarraga, 68, who lives two blocks from complex.\n\nAs Izarraga spoke from her home's front door, a man interrupted to ask for money to buy a plate of beans. He said he came with the caravan and had blisters on his feet. She gave him some pesos, and continued speaking: \"I hope this all works out in the best possible way.\"\n\nOutside the complex, lines of migrants snaked along the street to receive donations of clothes and coolers full of bottled water being dropped off by charity groups and others looking to help the migrants.\n\nFelipe Garza, 55, acknowledged that many in his hometown don't want to help as he and other volunteers from his church handed migrants coffee and rolls at the impromptu municipal shelter. \"It's uncomfortable to receive such a big multitude of people, but it's a reality that we have to deal with,\" he said.\n\nGarza surmised that if the Central Americans behave, Tijuana will embrace them just as it did thousands of Haitians in 2016. Those Haitians have since opened restaurants, hair salons and enrolled in local universities.\n\nPolice officer Victor Coronel agrees but wonders how much more the city can take. \"The only thing we can do is hope that President (Donald) Trump opens his heart a little,\" said Coronel.\n\nTrump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in last week's elections, took to Twitter on Friday to aim new criticism at the migrants.\n\n\"Isn't it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country \u2014 yet they are proudly waving ... their country's flag. Can this be possible? Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it,\" Trump said in a pair of tweets.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this story."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "| Fox News", "title": "Georgia certifies election results showing Kemp as victor in governor's race", "description": "Georgia Secretary of State Robyn A.

The military dictatorship that ruled Greece at the time violently put down the uprising, and many Greeks accuse the United States of supporting the 1967-74 regime.\n\nIn the end, most of the trouble happened elsewhere.\n\nPolice said a group of about 300 agitators in the capital erected barricades and threw firebombs and rocks at officers, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.\n\nIn Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, officers faced off with about 200 anarchists threw an intense barrage of firebombs. At least ten people were detained. Another five people were detained in Patras after an unknown number of assailants attacked officers, police said.\n\nAbout 15,000 people participated in the march held earlier to observe the 45th anniversary of the student rebellion. The precise number of deaths in the uprising is unknown. Estimates range from 18-40.\n\nWhile the event went off relatively trouble-free, government ministers and other marchers representing Greece's ruling Syriza party had plastic bottles and coffee cups thrown at them outside the embassy.\n\nAnd in an indication of what would come later, a group that marched past the embassy attacked officers at a subway station across from Athens police headquarters, authorities said. Eight suspects were detained, police said.\n\nTwo more were detained outside the university, also known as the Polytechnic.\n\nMunicipal workers had removed the trash cans that demonstrators often use as makeshift barricades, so desks and other furniture were brought out from the university in their place. Others climbed onto rooftops inside the Polytechnic complex and threw Molotov cocktails and rocks on officers.\n\nPolice brought a water cannon to the scene, but used it to put out fires because firetrucks would not approach the area.\n\n____\n\nCostas Kantouris reported from Thessaloniki.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kantouris on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CostasKantouris"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Hits & Misses: 11/17/2018", "description": "Panel calls out the week's best and worst.", "url": "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5968439006001/", "urlToImage": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/17/640/360/694940094001_5968444900001_5968439006001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T21:11:18Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Charlie Kirk", "title": "Charlie Kirk: Democrats come out the big losers in Florida\u2019s election mess", "description": "Despite desperate efforts by Democrats to overturn the decision of Florida\u2019s voters \u2013 and despite the state\u2019s deeply flawed, mismanaged and corrupt election system \u2013 it\u2019s now clear that Republican Ron DeSantis will be the state\u2019s next governor and Republican \u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/charlie-kirk-democrats-come-out-the-big-losers-in-floridas-election-mess", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/16/694940094001_5968100302001_5968097450001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T20:47:32Z", "content": "Despite desperate efforts by Democrats to overturn the decision of Florida\u2019s voters \u2013 and despite the state\u2019s deeply flawed, mismanaged and corrupt election system \u2013 it\u2019s now clear that Republican Ron DeSantis will be the state\u2019s next governor and Republican \u2026 [+5682 chars]", "fulltext": "Despite desperate efforts by Democrats to overturn the decision of Florida\u2019s voters \u2013 and despite the state\u2019s deeply flawed, mismanaged and corrupt election system \u2013 it\u2019s now clear that Republican Ron DeSantis will be the state\u2019s next governor and Republican Gov. Rick Scott will be its next U.S. senator.\n\nWhile a hand recount is still underway in Scott\u2019s race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, \u201cNelson was left with almost no chance of pulling off a comeback to retain his seat\u201d because Scott was leading by more than 12,000 votes, the Washington Post reported. And Florida\u2019s machine recount of votes showed DeSantis more than 33,000 votes ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum \u2013 a margin too large to mandate a hand recount.\n\nDemocrats who refuse to accept that DeSantis will be governor and that Scott is heading to the Senate are refusing to accept reality. Their complaints against Republicans are absurd and simply the whining of sore losers unable to accept responsibility for their losses.\n\nThe reality in Florida is that the state\u2019s voting system is badly broken. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, who is presiding in one of several lawsuits arising out of the Nov. 6 midterm elections, was right when he recently said: \u201cWe have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this.\u201d\n\nWhy does Florida have so many problems counting votes and determining which votes should count?\n\nThere are three issues involved in determining which votes are valid.\n\nThe first issue is voter fraud. This can involve someone voting who does not have the right to vote, such as a person who is not a U.S. citizen. It can also involve someone voting more than once, such as a person who moves to a new community but is still registered to vote from his or her previous residence. Fraud can also take place when a person pretends to be someone else \u2013 such as a voter who has died \u2013 and votes under that false identity.\n\nThe second issue is election interference or tampering. This is where a person or entity acts improperly to influence voters or the counting of votes. This can involve many things, such as: foreign interference in an election; computer hacking to alter voter databases; tampering with equipment that records votes; and creating front groups to put out false information on social media, in ads, in mailings, in robocalls and in other ways.\n\nThe third issue is voter suppression. This involves efforts to discourage or prevent voters from casting ballots. Democrats accuse Republicans of this because Republicans favor measures to prevent voter fraud, such as requiring voters to present a form of identification when casting ballots. The Democratic claim makes no sense. Requirements for an ID are not voter suppression \u2013 they are just commonsense steps to ensure people don\u2019t vote if they are ineligible, don\u2019t vote using false identities and don\u2019t vote more than once. True voter suppression took place in the past, usually by Democrats in the South, to deny African-Americans the vote. And the votes of women were suppressed before they were granted the right to vote nationwide by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920.\n\nHistorically, Democrats have shown they are willing to do just about anything to win elections. Republicans must quit taking the high road and fight back with everything we have.\n\nDemocrats have long been the party of voter fraud. The line \u201cvote early and often\u201d describes the Democratic Party machine in Chicago (the original line has even been attributed to gangster Al Capone, although nobody knows). Chicago has also been a place where the grateful dead have been more of an election force than a rock band. There, as in other major urban population centers, Democrats have used voter fraud as a way to retain and consolidate power.\n\nToday the voter fraud issue centers around letting non-citizens have access to the ballot box. Despite media claims that there is no evidence of this happening, the truth is that there is plenty of observational evidence from around the country that it is. Letting non-citizens vote jeopardizes our principles as a nation. They vote only for entitlement, not for their own responsibility as citizens.\n\nElection interference and vote tampering certainly appear to have occurred in Broward County in Florida in the recent midterm elections.\n\nBroward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes, a Democrat who has held the position since 2003, has a long history of duplicitous behavior. As NPR \u2013 hardly a tool of the Republican Party \u2013 recently reported: \u201cAccusations of bias and incompetence have followed Snipes for years.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Snipes continues to be allowed to serve because a majority of people living in predominantly Democratic Broward County apparently believe the ends justify the means when it comes to counting votes in order to favor Democrats.\n\nThe intellectual dishonesty of Democrats trying win elections they actually lost in Florida and elsewhere is staggering. Make no mistake, the only thing that these Democrats care about is winning this election in this moment. They don\u2019t care that by doing whatever is needed to win they are undermining our entire system of government.\n\nBanana Republic is a great clothing store but a lousy place to live. This is the kind of behavior we see in such nations.\n\nRepublicans need to understand there is no high road to take here. We need to be as aggressive as we legally can be, and any politician subjected to Democratic tactics designed to improperly win elections cannot ever concede or withdraw.\n\nDemocrats know the mathematics of being able to \u201cflip\u201d just a few votes in every voting location. With over 113,000 voting sites in the United States it doesn\u2019t take much.\n\nWe should all be grateful to the Founding Fathers for our electoral system. We need to be vigilant in protecting it in the face of attacks by Democrats that are stronger than ever."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Adam Shaw", "title": "Cindy McCain says US needs 'a strong leader, not a negative Nancy\u2019", "description": "Cindy McCain, in an interview broadcast Friday, said that she hopes President Trump learns from the midterm elections and realize that \u201cour country needs a strong leader, not a negative Nancy.\u201d", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cindy-mccain-says-us-needs-a-strong-leader-not-a-negative-nancy", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/AP18321606871078.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T20:33:50Z", "content": "Cindy McCain, in an interview broadcast Friday, said that she hopes President Trump learns from the midterm elections and realizes that \u201cour country needs a strong leader, not a negative Nancy.\u201d \"It's very humbling to lose and I hope he learns from it,\" McCai\u2026 [+2428 chars]", "fulltext": "Cindy McCain, in an interview broadcast Friday, said that she hopes President Trump learns from the midterm elections and realizes that \u201cour country needs a strong leader, not a negative Nancy.\u201d\n\n\"It's very humbling to lose and I hope he learns from it,\" McCain, whose late husband, Sen.

In fact, our bitter history is full of biblically-driven religious intolerance and persecution. However, in America\u2019s arguably most divided city \u2013 Washington D.C. \u2013 there is a place that serves as a model for respect and reconciliation: the Museum of the Bible, which opened one year ago, in November, 2017.\n\nHow could such a museum, founded and funded primarily by Evangelical Christians in an era when church-state issues frequently concern the extent of government, play such a role?\n\nOne would assume that such a museum would be an immediate turn-off to the Jewish community and our long memory. After all, Christianity is an offshoot of Judaism that since its inception has claimed that their New Testament has replaced our Old Testament.\n\nDuring the medieval period, Jews were dragged to churches for forced debates with church officials over the proper interpretation of the Bible. Jews were always the losers at these staged debates, with severe repercussions of forced conversion or death. Things didn\u2019t get better in the modern era, which witnessed the terrible culmination of centuries of European Christian anti-Semitism in the Holocaust.\n\nThree weeks ago Saturday, a far-right white supremacist entered a Pittsburgh synagogue and opened fire. He yelled, \u201cAll Jews must die,\u201d and killed 11 people \u2013making it the deadliest attack against Jews in American history.\n\nAs the grandson of Holocaust survivors, when I took my own Israeli children to Washington on a recent visit to the United States, I felt a strong contrast between the Museum of the Bible and the museum we visited almost directly across the street: the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The Holocaust museum reminds us of the power of hate. Museum of the Bible offers hope that ancient rivalries can be overcome.\n\nRather than water down the Christian or Jewish narratives, Museum of the Bible presents both with passion and authenticity. Exhibits such as the \u201cWorld of Jesus of Nazareth\u201d transport visitors to a 1st-century village and \u201cWashington Revelations\u201d highlight biblical references found throughout D.C. The lesson is clear that the Christian Bible, which emerged from an ancient village in Israel, has shaped this modern American city.\n\nWhen it comes to presenting the Jewish Bible, the museum has gone to great lengths to honor Judaism, including amassing one of the greatest collections of Judaica and presenting those artifacts with reverence and respect.\n\nFrom their extensive collection of ancient codices and rare Bibles, the real achievement of Museum of the Bible can best be told through two of its ancient Torah Scrolls.\n\nThe Museum has an 800-year-old Sephardic Torah Scroll written in Spain during the Golden Age of Spanish Jewry before that glorious era ended with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. This extremely rare Torah Scroll from the 13th century must have been carried by Jewish refugees under grueling conditions on their sorrowful march from their homes in Spain. Carrying whatever possessions they could on their backs, including such a heavy parchment, bears witness to the faithful dedication of the Torah\u2019s ancient Sephardic guardians who did everything in their ability to preserve it.\n\nAnother antique Torah Scroll comes from this same time period but from the other side of the Jewish world. The museum also features one of the oldest, most complete Ashkenazi Torah Scrolls from 13th century Germany. This was also a period mixed with great Jewish cultural expansion and severe religious persecution. While boasting some of the most important rabbinic sages whose works are still studied today by Torah students and scholars alike, the Jews of 13th century Eastern Europe were the victims of crusades and massacres. The Museum\u2019s Ashkenazic Torah Scroll, like its Sephardic one, likely saw its fair share of close calls and harrowing moments.\n\nModern Jews are the descendants of these Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews. Both communities survived for centuries under hostile conditions and extreme persecution, while producing great luminaries and Torah sages. The museum\u2019s two Torah Scrolls silently testify to the heroic efforts made by individuals and communities of Jews in order to preserve the physical words of the Torah Scrolls and their spiritual messages for future generations.\n\nBy honoring both the Jewish and Christian narratives and unique claims to the Book of Books under one roof, the Museum of the Bible is demonstrating that we are in a unique moment in history. The Bible, which has for generations been the greatest source of division between Jews and Christians, is now becoming a primary source of unity.\n\nThe Bible says that in the end of days, the world will be at peace and ancient rivalries will be reconciled. All of humanity will come together in common cause and shared values stemming from a newfound appreciation for the Bible. Isaiah 2:3 teaches that all the nations will stream as one towards the mountain of the Lord, \u201cfrom Zion shall come forth Torah and the word of God from Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nThe Bible, which from then until today has been cherished by Jews and Christians, promised a time like the one we are seeing today.\n\nIf a museum can reverse ancient religious rivalries and create a beacon of reconciliation in the heart of Washington D.C., we can have hope for greater unity and respect in politics and all realms of life."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Kathleen Joyce", "title": "Washington man who raped, took lewd photos of dying woman gets less than 3 years in prison - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Washington man who raped, took lewd photos of dying woman gets less than 3 years in prison Fox News A Washington man was sentenced Thursday to less than three years in prison after he raped a high school student as she was dying from a drug overdose \u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/washington-man-who-raped-took-lewd-photos-of-dying-woman-gets-less-than-3-years-in-prison", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Brian-Varela.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T17:02:35Z", "content": "A Washington man was sentenced Thursday to less than three years in prison after he raped a high school student as she was dying from a drug overdose and texting explicit photos of her to friends.

The findings could lead to limb regeneration in mammals somewhere off in the future.\n\nFrogs are capable of regenerating lost limbs on their own, but the stumps grown are smaller and not that impressive. The wearable device, which kick\u2013starts the tissue on the wound, drastically improved the quality of the limb.\n\n\u201cThey are not (yet) full limbs, but very different from the thin, featureless spike that forms in frogs without our intervention,\u201d senior study author Michael Levin of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University told Fox News. \u201cThey had improved shape, size, bone, innervation, and function.\u201d\n\nSTUNNING PICTURES SHOW SEA TURTLE SWIMMING FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER GETTING A PROSTHETIC FLIPPER\n\nThe bioreactor, which is 3D printed from silicon, is filled with a sticky gel made from polymers. The gel contains progesterone, which has been shown to help repair nerves, blood vessels, and bone tissue.\n\nAfter the adult African clawed frogs\u2019 limbs were amputated, the bioreactors were immediately sutured on at the amputation site. For 24 hours, the devices released progesterone on the frogs\u2019 wounds before being taken off. The frogs were then observed over a period of 9\u201310 months. Compared to frogs that weren\u2019t fitted with the bioreactor after amputation, the regrown limbs were improved\u2013 they were paddle\u2013like formations and closer to fully\u2013formed legs. The group who didn\u2019t wear the device regrew only the little thin spike. The device\u2013improved limbs were also thicker, with more developed bones, nerves, and veins.\n\nFROGS AND TOADS 'FALLING' FROM ABOVE IN NORTH CAROLINA AS POPULATIONS EXPLODE\n\nAccording to analysis and RNA sequencing, the bioreactors altered the gene expression in cells at the amputation site\u2013 upregulating genes involved in oxidative stress, serotonergic signaling, and white blood cell activity. At the same time, scarring and immune responses were downregulated, indicating that the progesterone curtailed the body\u2019s reaction to injury. This left the pathway open to improved regeneration.\n\nLevin said that the limb wouldn\u2019t have been improved any more if the device was left on for a longer period, and that 24 hours of exposure was sufficient to kickstart the leg growth process.\n\n\u201cThe trick is to perfect the initiation trigger, which we are doing (improved cocktails for example),\u201d he explained. \u201cOur strategy is not to try to micromanage the process, but to find the right trigger - the body already knows how to make legs, [which] it does it during embryogenesis.\u201d\n\nTOXIC TOAD COULD END UP KILLING THE PREDATORS ON MADAGASCAR\n\nThe team aisworking on limb regeneration in mammals, though aquatic animals are naturally better at regeneration. Mice, for example, have been shown to be able to partially regenerate lost fingertips, but the process is hampered when they walk around on the wound. Water is a lot kinder to the delicate regenerative cells.\n\nLevin also hopes the research will eventually benefit humans.\n\n\u201cThe limb work is an example of this bigger research program\u00ad\u2013 we need to figure out how to coax cells into forming specific complex structures,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce this is figured out, the results will benefit many biomedical needs: birth defects (remodeling), traumatic injury (regeneration), cancer (tumor reprogramming), aging (regenerate senescent tissues), degenerative disease\u2013 all of these will be revolutionized once we know how to control large-scale growth and form. Our lab is pursuing a number of directions, specializing in modulating the electric conversations that allow cells to decide what to build, to try to gain control over this process.\u201d\n\nThe research is published in the journal Cell Reports."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "The Kim Komando Show", "title": "Cheaper home internet, secret Amazon coupons and more: Tech Q&A", "description": "Is there a way to clean out all the cache, search history and call logs from my phone?

Nanoribbons capture electrons released by the microbes during photosynthesis, producing the bioelectricity.\n\n\n\nAccording to the abstract, the mushroom was constructed like this: first, the researchers 3-D printed an electronic ink containing graphene nanoribbons onto the cap of a living mushroom. Then, they printed a bio-ink containing cyanobacteria onto the cap, which intersected with the electronic ink. At these intersections, energy-producing electrons could move through the outer membranes of the bacteria to the conductive network of graphene nanoribbons.\n\n\n\n\"It was...a process by which we could 'seamlessly merge' or integrate three classes of micro/nano materials,\" Dr. Mannoor said.

I was hurt, having been called 'that woman.' But at the same time, there was a part of me that was glad he did that. Because I wanted him to deny it. I did not want him to lose his job. You know, it was impossible to imagine what was about to unfold.\u201d\n\nLewinsky said she was frustrated by how she was being negatively depicted by the press. Lewinsky also shared she was unable to publicly defend herself from the media backlash as the case unfolded.\n\nDOCU-SERIES OPENS OLD WOUNDS FOR BILL CLINTON RAPE ACCUSER JUANITA BROADDRICK\n\n\u201cI was alleged to have been saying I was going to D.C. to get my presidential kneepads, which I never said,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 People started to chip away at my integrity and my character\u2026 I was crushed by the lack of any support in the media\u2026 There didn\u2019t seem to be too much humanity\u2026 It just knifed me. But because I was under legal quarantine, I couldn\u2019t even speak for myself. \u201c\n\nIn January 1998, Lewinsky\u2019s confidant Linda Tripp called the Office of the Independent Counsel (OIC) and revealed she knew about the affair, offering them taped conversations. The OIC then made Tripp set up a meeting with Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton. There, Lewinsky was ambushed by FBI agents and taken to a hotel room where she was held by waiting prosecutors from the OIC until late in the night.\n\nLewinsky was offered immunity if she cooperated with the prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe first time anybody had ever heard my voice was I think when they released the Tripp tapes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were aired in their entirety on C-SPAN\u2026 It was just like a whole other layer of just being burned.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 19, 1998 the House voted to impeach Clinton for lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice. On Feb. 12, 1999 the Senate acquitted Clinton, who would go on to finish his term.\n\nLewinsky said that while she tried to move on after the scandal, she was still ridiculed by the press, making it difficult for her to find work.\n\n\u201cI had a handbag company and I had some other projects,\u201d she said. \u201cBut eventually, that just wasn\u2019t fulfilling me\u2026 It\u2019s a very long period of floundering and feeling unbelievably stuck in the old narrative of Monica Lewinsky that was created. It\u2019s affected my family in a lot of really tough ways over the years\u2026 It was one of the aspects for which I felt really guilty about what happened. Because it also meant they could never escape it either. \u201c\n\nLewinsky would go on to graduate from the London School of Economics in 2007 with a Master\u2019s degree in social psychology. Today, she is a contributing editor for Vanity Fair and an anti-bullying activist.\n\n\u201cThank God at least the last few years I\u2019ve had some opportunities to make positive contributions of it, so when younger generations and their families grow up there\u2019s not just this horrible history,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI never could have imagined the impact that this would have on others, on the presidency, on my life and of course, the country,\u201d Lewinsky added. \u201c\u2026 Though my life has moved on in ways that I am incredibly grateful\u2026 the consequences and the pain that was caused was enormous.\u201d\n\nLewinsky was interviewed over 20 hours for the 6 1/2-hour documentary. More than 50 people associated with the scandal also provided insight. In an essay published by Vanity Fair on Tuesday, Lewinsky admitted to feeling guilt and shame in reliving her time at the White House on camera and had wondered whether participating in the documentary was the right decision for her.\n\nIn June of this year, Clinton faced criticism for announcing in an interview with NBC\u2019s Craig Melvin that he didn\u2019t believe he should have to apologize directly to Lewinsky because he had publicly apologized 20 years ago.\n\nBut Lewinsky thinks Clinton \u201cshould want to apologize\u201d to her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe would be a better man for it\u2026 and we, in turn, a better society.\n\nLewinsky also explained that, even though she has already apologized to Hillary and Chelsea during an interview with Barbara Walters in 1999, she would be grateful for the chance to personally reach out to Hillary, 71.\n\n\u201cAnd if I were to see Hillary Clinton in person today, I know that I would summon up whatever force I needed to again acknowledge her \u2014 sincerely \u2014 how very sorry I am,\u201d Lewinsky wrote. \u201cI know I would do this because I have done it in other difficult situations related to 1998. I have also written letters apologizing to others \u2014 including some who also wronged me gravely. I believe that when we are trapped by our inability to evolve, by our inability to empathize humbly and painfully with others, then we remain victims ourselves.\"\n\n\"The Clinton Affair\" premieres Sunday, Nov. 18 on A&E."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Amy Lieu", "title": "Driver, 28, with history of DWI gets 20 years for crash that killed father of 7 - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Driver, 28, with history of DWI gets 20 years for crash that killed father of 7 Fox News A Louisiana woman was sentenced to 20 years in prison this week after pleading guilty in connection with a fatal drunken driving crash that killed a married Miss\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/driver-28-with-history-of-dwi-gets-20-years-for-crash-that-killed-father-of-7", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/olivia-matte.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:58:02Z", "content": "A Louisiana woman was sentenced to 20 years in prison this week after pleading guilty in connection with a fatal drunken driving crash that killed a married Mississippi man who was the father of seven children.

The longer-running tribunals covering genocide in Rwanda and war crimes in the former Yugoslavia ran up costs of as much as $2 billion \u2014 though both tried many more people than were called to account in Cambodia for crimes committed during the 1975-79 regime of the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.\n\nOn Friday, the tribunal convicted Nuon Chea, 92, and Khieu Samphan, 87, the last surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and sentenced them to life in prison. The only other person who has been convicted is Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nJustice is the primary goal. But international tribunals, trying people accused of crimes on a national scale, also serve to promote human rights and establish a historical record, among other targets.\n\nEven the most bullish observers acknowledge the shortcomings of the Cambodian tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC. The rules hammered out in extensive negotiations between the United Nations and the Cambodian government hobbled its proceedings in ways that were not always foreseeable.\n\nThe ECCC was set up as a hybrid court, meaning every international prosecutor and judge was paired with a Cambodian counterpart. However, what was a political atmosphere encouraging cooperation when the U.N. agreement was signed in 2003 deteriorated, as democratic space has shrunk under Cambodia's long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen.\n\n\"Hybrid courts require domestic and international partners to share the steering wheel. They tend to function well only when the two drivers want to head in the same general direction,\" said John Ciorciari, a professor at the University of Michigan and co-author of a book about the tribunal. \"When they do, mixed tribunals can help fill gaps in otherwise frail domestic systems. When interests clash, these efforts to share sovereignty are prone to crash.\"\n\nThe main case in point: Hun Sen \u2014 himself a former Khmer Rouge commander who defected from the group when it was in power \u2014 declaring no more suspects should be prosecuted, saying without justification that such action could cause unrest.\n\nIt didn't help that the U.N. agreement's vague wording of who could be targeted for prosecution \u2014 senior Khmer Rouge leaders and those most responsible for the atrocities \u2014 proved to be more restrictive than open-ended.\n\n\"All tribunals of this character have political restraints, and so that is not unique to the ECCC,\" said David Scheffer, a law professor at Northwestern University and former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes. Other points he mentioned that delayed the proceedings included the protection of due process rights and the unusual combination of a civil law investigating judicial procedure alongside a common law prosecutorial model.\n\n\"One can always surmise about more being done,\" said Scheffer, who also served as the U.N.'s special expert on assistance to the Khmer Rouge trials. \"But that was the negotiated reality of this particular tribunal.\"\n\nNevertheless, he gave high marks to the tribunal's performance, saying its main contribution has been both domestic and international justice rendered against some of the major figures in the Pol Pot regime.\n\n\"The Cambodian people sought justice and the ECCC delivered a significant measure of it,\" Scheffer said in an email interview. \"The ECCC also established a historical record, albeit not comprehensive, that otherwise never would have been uncovered.\"\n\nAdama Dieng, the U.N. special adviser on the prevention of genocide, also said Friday's convictions showed that \"justice will prevail, and that impunity should never be accepted for genocide and other atrocity crimes.\"\n\nPolitical education is an area where the tribunal has succeeded, said Heather Ryan, who has monitored the trials for the Open Society Justice Initiative, an independent international human rights organization.\n\n\"The court has made a huge contribution to helping the world and Cambodians better understand what occurred during the Khmer Rouge regime,\" said Ryan. \"It has triggered discussions at all levels of Cambodian society about not only the past, but concepts of impunity, justice and accountability relevant to the current political situation in Cambodia.\"\n\nOther observers were less impressed.\n\nTheary Seng, a U.S.-trained lawyer, writer and political analyst based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, who is an outspoken critic of Hun Sen's government, called the tribunal \"a complete failure for international justice\" because it didn't accomplish any of the established goals of reconciliation, symbolic justice and combating impunity.\n\nSeng, whose parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge, pointed out that the hope that at least some of the Cambodian judges, prosecutors and lawyers that the government placed in the tribunal would somehow become champions of judicial fairness and the rule of law has been the opposite of fulfilled: they have all been deeply implicated in government abuse and perversion of the domestic justice system.\n\nShe said her top concern now was for the integrity of the tribunal's documents to be preserved for researchers.\n\nIt is likely that the voluminous documentation used by the tribunal will be handed over to the government or institution controlled by the government, she said.\n\n\"This means that the printed documents could be selectively destroyed and the electronic version could be subtly altered,\" she warned. \"Future researchers writing the history of Cambodia will not know what's what.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sopheng Cheang in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Stephen Sorace", "title": "Inmate claims God, dead mom, gave him 'go ahead' to beat sex-offender cellmate to death: report - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Inmate claims God, dead mom, gave him 'go ahead' to beat sex-offender cellmate to death: report Fox News An inmate who allegedly beat to death his cellmate, an accused child molester, earlier this month in a Texas jail said \u201cGod and his mother\u201d told \u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-inmate-allegedly-said-god-mom-told-him-to-kill-cellmate-accused-of-child-molestation", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/flores-simpson-sbs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:13:22Z", "content": "An inmate who allegedly beat to death his cellmate, an accused child molester, earlier this month in a Texas jail said \u201cGod and his mother\u201d told him to do it because the man was \u201cBin Laden,\u201d authorities said.

Factors include the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, which limited the amount of money cities and counties could spend on new housing, and the job booms in technology and other fields that have attracted residents from out of state faster than new housing can be made available.\n\nAs a result, \u201cThere is no way that the current housing stock can accommodate the people displaced by the fire,\u201d said Casey Hatcher, a spokeswoman for Butte County, where Paradise and surrounding towns ravaged by the Camp Fire are located. \u201cWe recognize that it\u2019s going to be some time before people rebuild, and there is an extremely large housing need.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way that the current housing stock can accommodate the people displaced by the fire.

Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom during a visit to the state Saturday to tour the damage and meet with those affected.

It is virtually certain to be formally adopted by the 193-member world body in December.\n\nAmong those voting against the resolution were Myanmar neighbors China, Cambodia and Laos along with Russia. Bangladesh, which hosts 1.1 million Rohingya refugees, voted in favor.\n\nThe resolution expresses deep concern that violence by Myanmar's military against the Rohingya has forced over 723,000 people to flee to Bangladesh since August 2017.\n\nIt urgently calls on Myanmar's government to end discrimination and provide a path to citizenship for the embattled minority.\n\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya to be \"Bengalis\" from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless, and they are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.\n\nThe latest crisis began with attacks by an underground Rohingya insurgent group on Myanmar security personnel in August 2017 in northern Rakhine State. Myanmar's military responded with a brutal campaign and is accused of mass rape, killings and the burning of thousands of homes.\n\nThe resolution, sponsored by the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the European Union and Canada, reiterates \"deep distress\" at reports that unarmed Rohingya are still being subjected to excessive use of force and rights violations by Myanmar's military and security forces, including killings and rapes.\n\nThe resolution expresses \"grave concern\" at the findings of the U.N. fact-finding mission on Myanmar, which concluded that some top Myanmar military leaders should be prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide against the Rohingya.\n\nIt strongly condemns all rights abuses set out in the commission's report and calls for \"a full and independent investigation\" of human rights abuses against the Rohingya and other minorities.\n\nTurkish Ambassador Feridun Sinirlioglu, speaking on behalf of the OIC, called the commission's findings \"devastating.\"\n\nHe said \"people have been trapped in a vicious cycle of violence and forced displacement\" for years in Myanmar and the events of August 2017 against the Rohingya are \"only the latest episode of this cycle.\"\n\n\"Without a comprehensive strategy, reaching an enduring solution to this crisis is impossible,\" Sinirlioglu said.\n\nHe said the OIC believes the only solution is the voluntary return of the Rohingya to their homes with their basic rights \"guaranteed\" \u2014 but he said this will not be possible \"without holding the perpetrators responsible for their crimes.\"\n\nMyanmar's U.N. ambassador, Hau Do Suan, called the resolution \"politically motivated and one-sided and discriminatory.\" He accused the global media and human rights champions of concentrating on Myanmar and Rakhine state \u2014 where the remaining Rohingya live \u2014 when money could be better spend helping starving people in Yemen and elsewhere.\n\n\"Adoption of this and other ill-intentioned, selective and politically motivated resolutions will not help at all our efforts to solving the issue of Rakhine state, but would rather lead to further polarization and escalation of tensions among different religious communities in the country,\" Hau said. \"It will only aggravate distrust between the people of Myanmar and the international community.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Mariah Haas", "title": "Ashley Graham's love story with husband Justin Ervin leaves Gwyneth Paltrow in tears - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Ashley Graham's love story with husband Justin Ervin leaves Gwyneth Paltrow in tears Fox News Ashley Graham is opening up about how she met her husband of eight years, director Justin Ervin.

The New York Times reported that Pyongyang is expanding its nuclear weapons and missile arsenals.\n\nNow, to be clear, the Kim regime never promised to stop building atomic bombs or advanced missiles. In fact, in a New Year\u2019s Day address this year Kim said he would \u201cmass produce\u201d nuclear warheads and missiles.\n\nThe sad truth, once again, is that we find ourselves at an unfortunate fork in the road when it comes to the challenge of dealing with North Korea.\n\nDespite a long lapse in missile testing from the North, a historic summit in June in Singapore between Kim and President Trump, and what can only be described as a game-changing d\u00e9tente between North and South Korea, Kim\u2019s growing nuclear weapons and missile programs have not been halted or dismantled.\n\nThose programs create the possibility of a military confrontation between the U.S. and North Korea that could spark a second Korean War.\n\nTo be completely fair, there are no innocent parties when it comes to who is to blame for the current impasse.\n\nFor its part, North Korea is demanding economic sanctions relief before it begins the process of getting rid of its nuclear weapons.\n\nThe U.S. is demanding final, fully verified, irreversible denuclearization of the North before any sanctions are lifted.\n\nThis can only mean one thing \u2013 both sides have the exact opposite positions of how to solve the crisis.\n\nOnce hostilities began they could rapidly escalate and lead to a war \u2013 and in the worst-case scenario this could become a nuclear war, killing millions of people.\n\nClearly, the path forward towards a compromise will not be an easy one to travel.\n\nMy worry was that we could stumble into a war with the North by accident. For example, say a North Korean test of a new class of missiles went terribly wrong, crashing into a populated area in South Korea or Japan, and sparked a military response.\n\nOnce hostilities began they could rapidly escalate and lead to a war \u2013 and in the worst-case scenario this could become a nuclear war, killing millions of people.\n\nThe good news is that President Trump can broker a way out of another crisis with North Korea. During the third inter-Korean summit in September, Kim offered to close his Yongbyon nuclear testing facility in exchange for what was called at the time \u201ccorresponding measures.\u201d\n\nMultiple senior South Korean officials close to their president have confirmed to me that this wording is Kim\u2019s way of asking for a peace treaty ending the Korean War, which was halted with an armistice agreement in 1953. The armistice was supposed to bring a temporary halt to fighting until a peace treaty was signed \u2013 but that still hasn\u2019t happened, 65 years later,\n\nA peace treaty \u2013 in which the U.S. and our allies would be trading what amounts to a piece of paper for plutonium \u2013 would be good deal, in my view.\n\nFrom there, while there are no guarantees, we could move along several tracks to try to secure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe two Koreas have already begun moving toward a path to peace.\n\nWhile he gets almost no credit, South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in has delivered what can only be described as a miracle by negotiating a deconfliction agreement that has set up a no-fly zone along the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea.\n\nThe deconfliction agreement includes the removal of landmines and guard posts separating the nations, along with the creation of new lines of communication between the South Korean and North Korean militaries that could be invaluable in a crisis.\n\nThis is an effort Washington should support with no reservations. The \u201cMoon Miracle\u201d is designed to lessen tensions between the Koreas in areas that have nothing to do with nuclear weapons. It focuses on the world\u2019s most heavily armed border and is delivering results.\n\nOn top of this, we need to work to establish a roadmap with North Korea that provides the regime with clear rewards for steps it takes towards denuclearization.\n\nIf the North verifiably destroys all its nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, Washington should place on the table a massive scale-back of U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula as a sweetener \u2013 and perhaps even offer to withdraw all U.S. forces from South Korea \u2013 to show how serious our intent is.\n\nWhile many in Washington expect another showdown with North Korea, we have a clear, viable path forward to avoid a potential conflict.\n\nIf President Trump presses forward in the bold fashion he has proven he can, he might even get the Nobel Peace Prize that I and others have said he would deserve.\n\nI will be rooting for him."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Emilie Ikeda", "title": "Abortion debate intensifies after amendments pass removing abortion protections in 2 states - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Abortion debate intensifies after amendments pass removing abortion protections in 2 states Fox News MONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2013 As a piano and violin music play in the background, a sonogram shows a fetus moving in a mother's stomach as text appears, saying:\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/anti-abortion-advocates-call-midterms-a-ripple-to-start-the-wave-of-pro-life-legislation", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/FS_AP_Pregnant_woman_1.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T01:24:12Z", "content": "MONTGOMERY, Ala.

Analysts say this has motivated local governments to push more anti-abortion legislation, which could, if appealed, provide a challenge to Roe v. Wade.\n\n\u201cWith Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, the threat to Roe v. Wade is no longer a hypothetical,\u201d read a statement by Alabama for Healthy Families, a group that opposed Alabama\u2019s ballot measure.\n\nThe Alabama for Healthy Families argued that the state\u2019s measure was too restrictive and offered no exceptions for cases of rape, incest and when the woman\u2019s life is in danger.\n\n\u201cIf Roe is overturned and with Amendment 2 in effect,\u201d the statement said, \u201cthere will be life or death consequences for Alabamians.\u201d\n\nAlabama\u2019s amendment does not invoke any immediate change other than tweaking the state\u2019s constitutional language. But Fridy said those small changes go a long way in \u201cprotecting the rights of the unborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to ensure that our constitution can never be used as a tool to provide for a right for an abortion,\u201d Fridy continued. \u201cAnd to have the state of Alabama go on record as one that defends life.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia, on the other hand, will see tangible changes as a result of its new amendment. The purple state will no longer be one of 17 states that allow public funds to cover almost all abortions for people on Medicaid, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nSome believe the ballot approvals underscore a growing, local movement against abortion rights \u2013 and they say those sentiments could help sway the Supreme Court to eventually overturn the 1973 ruling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging for the pro-life movement to see life win directly on the ballot \u2013 not just pro-life candidates winning in Senate races across the country,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a spokesperson for the Susan B. Anthony List, a non-profit with a mission to end abortion.\n\nThose in favor of abortion rights agree the anti-abortion movement is growing \u2013 particularly under President Trump. They called it a dangerous movement that will strip women of their basic rights and move the country backward by decades.\n\n\u201cThe threat is very real,\u201d said Heidi Sieck, founder of #VoteProChoice, adding that the recent losses have been \u201csubstantial and terrifying.\u201d\n\nBut, she said, while ballot measure approvals and the Kavanagh appointment are emboldening anti-abortion activists, it is also reawakening the abortion rights movement.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s lives are at stake,\u201d Sieck said, \u201cand people are stepping up to protect that right.\u201d\n\nSieck believes an overturn of Roe v. Wade is practically inevitable with Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nShe blamed his appointment for the increasing pressure from anti-abortion legislators.

But its deeply entrenched troubles, including widespread poverty, corruption and lawlessness, also stand to be scrutinized.\n\n___\n\nTONGUE TWISTER\n\nMore than 1,000 tribes with over 800 different languages are scattered across 22 provinces, including in its capital Port Moresby and faraway mountain hinterlands and islands. Inadequate infrastructure and potholed roads, however, have kept apart diverse tribal groups more than the language barrier. English, which is widely spoken, and a creole English called Tok Pisin, have helped bridge the divide. The isolation has helped preserve ancient traditions in the most remote villages, where belief in black magic and sorcery has persisted in an era of great technological advances.\n\n___\n\nAPEC-CHALLENGED\n\nThe APEC host is the most challenged on many counts in the free-trade club, which includes the world's leading economic heavyweights \u2014 the United States, China and Japan \u2014 and accounts for 60 percent of global gross domestic product and nearly half of world trade. Although it's resource rich, Papua New Guinea is the 21-member bloc's most impoverished and youngest member. It declared independence from its Australian colonizer only in 1975. It was helped by Australia, which remains its biggest aid provider, along with China, the United States and New Zealand to deal with the logistical challenges of hosting a year of APEC meetings, including construction of the main venue.\n\nWhen it joined APEC in 1993, Papua New Guinea had to court the backing of Asian neighbors to gain entry into the prestigious bloc of Pacific Rim nations and explain that it's located in the region, its former prime minister, Julius Chan, said. \"First they don't think that PNG was an Asian country,\" Chan told the Nation newspaper. \"I insisted that we are right in the center of the Asia and the Pacific.\"\n\n___\n\nLAW AND ORDER\n\nCrime and violence in Papua New Guinea are notoriously prevalent based on anecdotal accounts and media reports, and are a national concern. Statistics are at best spotty but a World Bank study several years ago reported that crime levels have stayed consistently high for more than a decade, with robbery and assault the most common. Family and sexual violence were highly prevalent too and homicide rate in at least two areas, including the capital, is among the highest in the world.\n\nConcern over lawlessness has made hosting 20 world leaders and more than 12,000 APEC delegates Papua New Guinea's biggest security worry. \"It is risky for expatriates to travel alone at any time of the day or night,\" a government do's and don'ts primer warned foreign delegates, some of whom were billeted in luxury cruise ships along with visiting journalists because there weren't enough hotels in Port Moresby.\n\nAustralia, the U.S. and New Zealand provided armed personnel, navy ships, jets and surveillance helicopters to help augment security. Still, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence decided to spend nights in Cairns city in neighboring Australia while attending the meetings on behalf of President Donald Trump, who decided not to go."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Paulina Dedaj", "title": "Substitute teacher says he was banned after thanking students who stood for Pledge of Allegiance", "description": "Substitute teacher says he was banned after thanking students who stood for Pledge of Allegiance foxnews.com", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/substitute-teacher-says-he-was-banned-after-thanking-students-who-stood-for-pledge-of-allegiance", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Parkway-South-High-School.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:44:11Z", "content": "A Missouri substitute teacher claims he was banned from working at a high school after a \u201churt\u201d student reported him for thanking those who stood up during the Pledge of Allegiance.

Security Council that he planned to bring the warring parties together \"soon\" in Sweden. He also said the Houthis and the government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, were about to conclude an agreement on exchanging prisoners and detainees.\n\nThe spotlight has fallen on what many viewed as the long forgotten war in Yemen since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Griffiths said he is determined to take advantage of \"the international attention and energy\" to move toward peace.\n\n\"We must seize this positive international momentum on Yemen,\" he told the U.N.'s most powerful body. \"This is an opportunity at a crucial moment to pursue a comprehensive and inclusive political settlement to the conflict.\"\n\nGriffiths said preparatory issues for the meeting are close to being resolved and he has sent the parties his \"vision\" for \"U.N.-led, inclusive Yemeni negotiations to end the war and restart a political transition process.\"\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital of Sanaa by the Iranian-backed Houthis, which toppled the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.\n\nSaudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. The Houthis have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia and targeted vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nCivilians have borne the brunt of the conflict, which has killed over 10,000 people and created what the executive director of the U.N.'s World Food Program said Friday is \"a catastrophe.\"\n\nDavid Beasley, who just returned from a three-day visit to Yemen, told the Security Council that \"we do not need to wait for formal declarations about famine or even a full report to act.\"\n\n\"I believe that because of what I saw and heard this week children are already dying,\" he said.\n\nBeasley warned that \"starvation is on the horizon unless circumstances change \u2014 and change immediately.\"\n\nRight now, he said, his agency is helping about 8 million people a month in Yemen but the situation has become \"extremely dire.\"\n\n\"Of the 28 million Yemenis, we believe that as many as 12 million or more Yemenis \u2014 yes, that's right, almost half of the entire country \u2014 are just one step away from famine,\" Beasley said.\n\nThat number has doubled in the last year and a half and the situation is getting even worse, largely because of the collapse of Yemen's economy and the sharp decline in its currency, he said.\n\nTo avert famine, Beasley said, the international community must combine increased humanitarian funding with \"an all-out effort to restore the Yemeni economy.\"\n\nHe said that will require scaling up assistance to help 12 million Yemenis, which would require about $150 million to $160 million a month. And it would require a cash injection of $200 million a month into Yemen's economy to stabilize its currency and stave off economic collapse, he said.\n\n\"Yemen is on the brink \u2014 so together we must act,\" Beasley said. Otherwise, he warned, \"we will be in the position of deciding which children live and which children die.\"\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, who warned the council on Oct. 23 that the economic crisis and escalating conflict had pushed Yemen closer to famine than ever before, also urged its members to take action now.\n\nIn addition to also urging the parties to negotiate an end to the conflict and the international community to boost aid, he called for a humanitarian cease-fire around key aid facilities, delivery of humanitarian and commercial imports to all Yemeni ports and onward to their final destinations, and funding to pay Yemeni pensioners and civil servants.\n\nBritain's U.N. ambassador, Karen Pierce, said she will circulate a Security Council resolution Monday to address the Yemen crisis and put Lowcock's requests \"into practice.\"\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen told the council: \"This war must end soon, and it won't end on the battlefield.\" He reiterated U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's words: \"The United States seeks a cessation of hostilities in Yemen.\"\n\nLowcock noted that after an upsurge in fighting immediately after his Oct. 23 briefing to the council, there has been \"a welcome de-escalation\" in the last two days.\n\n\"But what we need to know is that this lull is going to be sustained,\" Lowcock said. \"It remains urgent for the parties to agree a cessation of hostilities.\""}]
