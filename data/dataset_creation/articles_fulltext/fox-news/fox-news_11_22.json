Pinellas County Sh\u2026 [+4895 chars]", "fulltext": "The sheriff leading the state commission investigating Florida's high school massacre says he now believes trained, volunteer teachers should have access to guns so they can stop shooters who get past other safeguards.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, chairman of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, said he will ask the panel to recommend state law be changed so teachers who undergo background checks and extensive training will be allowed to have guns on campus as a last line of defense. It's a proposal that both the state teachers union and PTA oppose.\n\nGualtieri told The Associated Press this week he long believed only law enforcement personnel should carry guns at school, but his position \"morphed\" after studying other shootings and watching security video of the Feb. 14 Stoneman Douglas attack, which left 14 students and three staff members dead.\n\nBROWARD SHERIFF'S CAPTAIN WHO ALLEGEDLY TOLD RESPONDERS TO 'STAGE' INSTEAD OF ENTER PARKLAND SCHOOL RESIGNS\n\nHe said it \"gnaws\" at him that suspect Nikolas Cruz stopped firing five times to reload his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, but no teacher or other school employee could use those pauses to shoot Cruz. The athletic director and a coach, both unarmed, died trying to stop Cruz and at least one teacher minutes later would have had a clear shot.\n\nMeanwhile, video shows the Broward County sheriff's deputy assigned to the school drew his gun but stayed outside. By the time other law enforcement arrived, the final fatal shots had been fired.\n\n\"We know from the history of these things that the majority are stopped by school personnel,\" Gualtieri said, pointing to shootings where the gunman was tackled or disarmed by a teacher or campus employee. \"People need to keep an open mind to it as the reality is that if someone else in that school had a gun it could have saved kids' lives.\"\n\nAfter the shooting, Florida law was changed to allow school districts to train and arm employees other than teachers, including administrators, librarians and custodians. Teachers are barred unless they are former or current police officers, current members of the military or Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps instructors. Thirteen of the state's 67 countywide districts adopted the program, mostly in rural parts of the state.\n\nCurrently, teachers in 28 states can carry firearms, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center, a conservative nonprofit organization. District approval is required in most states and restrictions and training requirements vary.\n\nNIKOLAS CRUZ ASKED BROTHER OF STUDENT HE'D JUST SHOT FOR A RIDE AFTER MASSACRE: REPORT\n\nBoth the Florida Education Association, which is the state teachers union, and the Florida PTA oppose arming teachers, saying having more guns on campus will make schools more dangerous, not less.\n\n\"Teachers should not be acting as armed security guards. The majority of our members don't want to be armed \u2014 they know it would be impractical and dangerous,\" union spokeswoman Joni Branch said.\n\nAngie Gallo, the state PTA's legislation chair, said only law enforcement should carry guns on campus.\n\n\"Teachers need to teach,\" Gallo said. \"Their job is not to secure our schools. It is not to shoot at shooters.\"\n\nOther members of Gualtieri's commission, including Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, have expressed support for arming teachers, although it is unclear if a majority agrees.\n\nThe 15 panel members appointed by Gov. Rick Scott and legislative leaders include law enforcement, education and mental health professionals, a legislator and the fathers of two slain students. The panel, which has been meeting periodically since April, must file its initial report to Scott, incoming Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature by Jan. 1. It will consider proposals for adoption at its mid-December meeting.\n\nOther proposed recommendations include preventing outside attacks by limiting and staffing entrances; allowing all school employees to order a lockdown; improving campus communication systems; and tightening laws governing the assessment of students who may pose a threat.

Under that new policy, Trump declared no one could apply for asylum except at an official border entry point. Some ports of entry are already facing huge backups, with people waiting for weeks.\n\nThe U.S. government shut down one port of entry, San Ysidro, in California, for several hours early Monday morning to bolster security amid concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members. Most of the lanes were reopened before the morning rush.\n\nTrump repeated Nielsen's claim, made earlier this week when she visited a San Diego Pacific Coast beach to see newly installed razor wire wrapped around a towering border wall that cuts across the sand, that there were as many as 500 criminals and gang members in the group heading northward.

I have no choice.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday that the White House had given him explicit authority to use military troops to protect Customs and Border Protection personnel at the southwest border, with lethal force if necessary. But he was adamant the military would remain within its legal limits.\n\nThe law prohibits the federal government from using the armed forces in a domestic police role, except in cases and under circumstances authorized explicitly by the Constitution or Congress. Generally, U.S. troops are authorized to use force in self-defense.\n\nTrump said that if U.S. officials \"find that it's uncontrollable, if we find that it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control.

But it has not shown the same tolerance so far toward the Central Americans, who have met official complaints and anti-caravan protests even though most of the people in this city are migrants or the offspring of migrants.\n\nThat's raising questions about how the newest group will integrate if it doesn't don't get into the U.S. or return home.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has made a point of saying the city is not happy with the caravan migrants who began arriving last week, and he compared the Central American group unfavorably with the roughly 3,000 Haitians who ended up staying after their bid to reach the U.S. failed.\n\n\"The Haitians arrived with their papers, with a clear vision,\" Gastelum said in an interview posted on the city's Facebook page. They came \"in an orderly way, they never asked us for food or shelter,\" renting apartments and making their own food. He said the Haitians found jobs and \"inserted themselves in the city's economy\" and had not been involved in any disturbances.\n\nBy contrast, Gastelum said, the caravan of Central Americans \"had arrived all of sudden, with a lot of people \u2014 not all ... but a lot \u2014 were aggressive and cocky.\"\n\nVictor Clark-Alfaro, a professor of Latin American studies at San Diego State University who lives in Tijuana, attributes the backlash to the way the caravan arrived \u2014 suddenly with thousands pouring in. Others point to social media and the hostile rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said it harbored criminals and gang members and was planning an \"invasion.\"\n\nMany also say the actions of a few are tarnishing the image of the roughly 4,000 migrants who are camped in Tijuana. In the past week, city officials have arrested three dozen caravan members for drug possession, public intoxication, disturbing the peace and resisting police, and said they would be deported to their home countries.\n\nIt's also only been months since an earlier caravan of Central Americans arrived, and some of them are still in the city waiting to get asylum in the U.S. That has added to fears here that it could be the start of a never-ending deluge.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego, and there was already a waiting list of 3,000 when the new migrants arrived, so most will have to wait months to even be considered for asylum.\n\nTijuana has a long history as a kind of Ellis Island for U.S.-bound migrants. It receives up to 80,000 a year from across Mexico, Latin America and more recently as far away as India and Africa. The city has large pockets of Chinese and Korean immigrants.\n\nCentral Americans have been coming to the city since the civil wars of the 80s in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.\n\nMany in the newly arrived caravan, however, are destitute people who left their homelands at the spur of the moment and have been utterly dependent on handouts along their journey.\n\nMany of the Haitians, meanwhile, arrived with at least some resources after working in Brazil, though despite what the mayor said, they also stayed at shelters after taking an accidental route to Tijuana from their impoverished Caribbean homeland. The last group of Haitians moved out of the Padre Chava shelter in April.\n\nBrazil and its neighbors took in the Haitians after that country's 2010 earthquake. As construction jobs for the 2016 Summer Olympics ended and Brazil's economy slumped, they crossed 10 countries by plane, boat, bus and on foot to San Diego, where U.S. authorities initially let them in on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThen President Barack Obama shifted course in 2016 and started deporting Haitian arrivals. Many decided to stay in Mexico after the government gave them temporary transit permits and have since applied for Mexican residency. The majority in the Central American caravan so far have refused Mexico's repeated offers of residency or asylum and vowed to cross the border.\n\nMany of the Haitians also have college degrees and have been recruited to work for factories that export to the U.S. Some can be found waiting tables and worshipping at congregations that have even added services in Creole.\n\nThey opened beauty parlors, shops and restaurants, like Kriskapab Baborijinal, a bright blue-and-red cafe that is busy serving Mexicans and Haitians daily dishes of coconut rice, mashed plantains and goat stew.\n\nIn the window is a sign for the Association of the Defense of Haitian Migrants. Philocles Julda, 44, is one of 11 Haitian immigrants who started the group a year ago to give the community a place to help itself with everything from Spanish lessons to paying medical bills.\n\nJulda said he too wanted to get to the U.S. when he first arrived to Tijuana and still wishes he was earning dollars, but said he has been able to make a life here. He works at a factory.\n\n\"I feel for the migrants who are arriving from other countries just like we did,\" he said. \"But you do adapt.\"\n\nAnd work is plentiful in Tijuana, whose economy has been growing and whose factories have thousands of openings.\n\n\"We have been looking for workers for quite a while,\" said Alejandrina Yanez, who works in human resources at a factory that makes warehouse storage racks for Costco, Home Depot and other international companies.\n\nYanez went to the Padre Chava shelter Wednesday to see if any migrants were interested in jobs that pay about $100 a week.\n\nOmin Velasquez, 26, of Tocoa, Honduras, was intrigued. Velasquez came with the caravan but decided not to continue on to the U.S. after seeing the border wall topped with newly-installed rows of razor wire.\n\nHe said it took him some days to decide, but he now feels that there are enough opportunities in Tijuana and support from locals that it's not worth the risk of crossing into the U.S. He has started his paperwork to get a Mexican visa to stay.\n\n\"There is so much work here,\" he said. \"I no longer feel the need to go to the U.S.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Elizabeth Zwirz", "title": "E. coli outbreak possibly linked to romaine lettuce in California, FDA official says", "description": "The commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday said that the multistate E. coli outbreak that was revealed earlier this week is thought to be connected to romaine lettuce grown in California.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/e-coli-outbreak-possibly-linked-to-romaine-lettuce-in-california-fda-official-says", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/21/694940094001_5970027682001_5970033091001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:19:43Z", "content": "The commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Thursday that the multistate E. coli outbreak revealed earlier this week is thought to be connected to romaine lettuce grown in California.

And while she praised German chancellor Angela Merkel for her compassion, she cautioned that countries can\u2019t leave the door open forever.\n\n\u201cI think Europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame,\u201d Clinton said regarding the rise of rightwing populists like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nClinton added: \u201cI admire the very generous and compassionate approaches that were taken particularly by leaders like Angela Merkel, but I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part, and must send a very clear message \u2013 \u2018we are not going to be able to continue provide refuge and support\u2019 \u2013 because if we don\u2019t deal with the migration issue it will continue to roil the body politic.\u201d\n\nMIGRANT CARAVAN GIVEN OPTIONS AS OFFICIALS KICK OFF JOB FAIR IN TIJUANA\n\nCountries like Germany, Greece and Italy \u2013 which have been most affected by the influx of migrants \u2013 have argued that other nations throughout the region need to share in the burden. But the other countries, especially those in central and eastern Europe, have so far refused to help out.\n\nMigration numbers have dropped precipitously from their height in 2015.\n\nClinton was one of three politicians interviewed by the Guardian, along with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, about the rise of rightwing populism and what center-left politicians are struggling to combat it.\n\nThe two former prime ministers both agreed with Clinton\u2019s statement that the immigration issue was directly responsible for fueling the populist trend.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to deal with the legitimate grievances and answer them, which is why today in Europe you cannot possibly stand for election unless you\u2019ve got a strong position on immigration because people are worried about it,\u201d Blair said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to answer those problems.

Blair said that more mainstream politicians will struggle to get heard over the simple, emotional language used by populists and that they need to find a way to cut through the soundbites that make the headlines.\n\nAnd while the three global figures said they believed that populism was near its peak and people were beginning to see its faults, none could pinpoint a reason why populist leaders have been so successful over the past few years.\n\n\u201cThe whole American system was designed so that you would eliminate the threat from a strong, authoritarian king or other leader and maybe people are just tired of it,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want that much responsibility and freedom.

Accordingly, Mr. Comey will resist in Court this abuse of process.\"\n\nThe news of the subpoenas comes on the heels of a busy week in the Mueller investigation that saw Trump provide the special counsel with written answers to questions about his knowledge of Russian interference in the 2016 election, his lawyers said Tuesday, avoiding at least for now a potentially risky sit-down with prosecutors.\n\nThe compromise outcome, nearly a year in the making, offers some benefit to both sides. Trump at least temporarily averts the threat of an in-person interview, which his lawyers have long resisted, while Mueller secures on-the-record statements whose accuracy the president will be expected to stand by for the duration of the investigation.\n\nThe responses may also help stave off a potential subpoena fight over Trump's testimony if Mueller deems them satisfactory. They represent the first time the president is known to have described to investigators his knowledge of key moments under scrutiny by prosecutors.\n\nAlso this week, it was revealed by the New York Times that Trump told his counsel's office last spring that he wanted to prosecute Clinton and former FBI Comey, an idea that prompted White House lawyers to prepare a memo warning of consequences ranging up to possible impeachment.\n\nThen-counsel Don McGahn told the president he had no authority to order such a prosecution, and he had White House lawyers prepare the memo arguing against such a move, The Associated Press confirmed with a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the situation.

Roberts himself reiterated the idea in a speech in Minnesota last month, saying the court preserves its independence \u201cto the best of our abilities, whether times are calm or contentious.\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 speech, he noted that \"partisan rancor\" in Congress \"impedes their ability to carry out their functions.\"\n\n\"I don't want this to spill over and affect us,\" he added. \"That's not the way we do business.\"\n\nRoberts\u2019 statement on Wednesday led to an almost immediate response from Trump over social media.\n\n\u201cSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u2018Obama judges,\u2019 and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cIt would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \u2018independent judiciary,\u2019 but if it is why are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned,\u201d Trump continued in another tweet. \u201cPlease study the numbers, they are shocking.

She told the BBC the government failed to robustly intervene on Hedges' behalf during the early stages of his imprisonment, when he was held in solitary confinement under inhumane conditions.\n\n\"I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and his welfare,\" Tejada said. \"They were stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance.\"\n\nThe verdict, announced Wednesday after a five-minute hearing, caught the British government off guard. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a statement saying he had discussed the case with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed during a visit to the country last week and the verdict \"runs contrary to earlier assurances.\"\n\nHunt said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the verdict, which \"is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nTensions over Hedges' treatment have quickly escalated into a crisis, in part because ties between Britain and the seven emirates of the UAE are considered close and date back 200 years.\n\nThe UAE is strategically located on the east coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and the British military trains with UAE troops.

CubeSats always share rockets; they're too small and inexpensive to warrant their own launch. This Mars Cube One project, or MarCO, built and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, cost $18.5 million.\n\nFLIGHT FORMATION\n\nNASA kept the CubeSats about 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) away from InSight during the 300 million-mile (483 million-kilometer) journey to Mars to prevent any collisions or close calls. The mini satellites were just as far from each other for the same reason. The elbow room in this \"very loose formation,\" as chief engineer Andy Klesh describes it, has varied during the mission and is narrowing as the spacecraft draws ever closer to Mars.\n\nBEST BEHAVIOR\n\nFor the record, EVE has behaved better than WALL-E during the 6 1/2-month voyage to Mars. Each CubeSat has the same type of cold gas propulsion that's used in fire extinguishers to spray foam. In the film, WALL-E uses a fire extinguisher to propel through space. In reality, WALL-E has been leaking fuel almost since liftoff. Flight controllers have worked around the problem. Meanwhile, \"EVE seems to follow her namesake and has been flying beautifully throughout the mission,\" said Klesh.\n\nDRY RUN\n\nIn June, WALL-E and EVE aced a series of radio-relay tests using signals from a big dish antenna near Palo Alto, California. Klesh said that gives engineers confidence in the CubeSats' ability to do the same with InSight's signals on landing day. Last month, the pair sent back photos of Mars from 8 million miles (13 million kilometers) out. Mars was merely a bright pinpoint, but the team said it marked a proud CubeSat first.\n\nALL EARS\n\nIt takes eight minutes and seven seconds for a radio signal to get from Mars to Earth, one way. It should take less than a minute on top of that to get word from InSight, if the mini satellites cooperate. That means NASA could know InSight's fate close to real time. If WALL-E and EVE are mum, confirmation would come directly from the lander or, hours later, from spacecraft circling Mars.\n\nFUTURE GOAL\n\nAs NASA explores new worlds, it would be handy to have listening outposts to beam back descent and landing updates. Spacecraft already in orbit around Mars serve that purpose whenever NASA sends a lander. But where there are no satellites \u2014 think asteroids or dwarf planets on the fringes of our solar system \u2014 CubeSats could step in, with little overhead and low cost.\n\nBEYOND MARS\n\nWhether or not they provide any insight on InSight, WALL-E and EVE will zoom past Mars and remain in an elliptical orbit around the sun. Engineers expect them to keep working for a couple weeks beyond Mars depending on how long the fuel and electronics last."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Polish leader suing Walesa for blaming him for plane crash", "description": "Two of Poland's most famous foes, former President Lech Walesa, and the country's de facto leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, faced off in court Thursday, exchanging wry comments.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/polish-leader-suing-walesa-for-blaming-him-for-plane-crash", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T13:07:27Z", "content": "WARSAW, Poland Two of Poland's most famous foes, former President Lech Walesa, and the country's de facto leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, faced off in court Thursday, exchanging wry comments.

Anger against politicians' apparent indifference, worsening public services and distress over down-spiraling finances and gloomy predictions are building up.\n\nLast Friday, heavy rains caused Beirut's sewage system to burst, turning the city's famous Mediterranean coastal avenue into a river of filthy, foul-smelling black water that engulfed motorists along the otherwise scenic route. On the same day, the military had closed a main artery for drills ahead of the Independence Day parade, paralyzing traffic for hours. Flights from Beirut's international airport were missed and a woman reportedly went into labor on the road. The army later apologized.\n\nDespite a population of over 4.5 million that is among the most educated in the region, Lebanon still has a primitive infrastructure, widespread electricity and water cuts and a longstanding waste crisis that over the past few years saw trash piling in the streets for weeks at a time.\n\n\"There is no independence (to celebrate) because corruption is eating us up,\" said Mohammed al-Rayyes, a shop owner in Beirut's Hamra district. \"The coming days are going to be very difficult.\"\n\nThe tiny Arab country has coped with multiple political and security crises over the past decades and also suffered from the seven-year civil war in neighboring Syria, a conflict that has occasionally spilled over the border and brought more than 1 million refugees into Lebanon, putting even more pressure on its dysfunctional infrastructure.\n\nA soaring debt of $84 billion and unemployment believed to be around 36 percent are compounding concerns that the country will finally cave in.\n\n\"It is a shame because so much time is being wasted,\" Ferid Belhaj, the World Bank's vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, said during a meeting with a group of journalists last week.\n\nFor years, he said, Lebanese officials have been promising to work on solving the electricity crisis, which costs the country about $2 billion a year and has been the main factor in accumulating Lebanon's debt.\n\nOf immediate concern is the future of $11 billion in loans and grants pledged by international donors at a meeting in Paris in April, which Lebanon risks losing if no Cabinet is in place soon to unlock the funds and approve reforms that were set as conditions by the donors and which have been delayed for years. In April, Hariri pledged to reduce the budget deficit by 5 percent over the next five years.\n\nThe crisis has prompted some Lebanese to change their deposits from the local currency, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollars since 1997, to U.S. dollars for fear the Lebanese pound might collapse. Riad Salameh, the Central Bank governor, has been repeatedly reassuring the markets, saying the local currency is stable.\n\nMohamad Shukeir, head of the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, told the local MTV station that 2,200 businesses closed doors so far this year.\n\nAftershocks of rising tension between the United States and Iran are also felt in Beirut, with Tehran ally Hezbollah being blamed by opponents for preventing Western-backed Hariri from forming a national unity government.\n\nHezbollah has demanded that six Sunni lawmakers allied with the Shiite group and opposed to Hariri be included in his Cabinet \u2014 something that Hariri, the country's top Sunni Muslim leader, categorically rejects.\n\nDespite the dangers, political bickering is not likely to end soon and the debt is mounting.\n\n\"The level of debt that we have in Lebanon requires us to act very quickly,\" said economist Kamel Wazne. \"Any delay will expose us to financial collapse.\"\n\nBelhaj of the World Bank said that reforms would act as a buffer to the crisis. But in their absence, \"the crisis can be very nasty.\"\n\n\"If we don't go about these reforms fast, the Lebanon that we know will fizzle away,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Fadi Tawil in Beirut contributed to this story."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "S.

He also scored or assisted on 11 straight points as the Lakers overcame a 99-91 deficit in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut basketball took a backseat to James' homecoming, which was so different than his return in 2010, when betrayed Cleveland fans unleashed their fury on him.\n\nThere were no profane chants this time.

Fortunately, sitcoms throughout the years have gifted viewers with dozens of Thanksgiving-based episodes that will allow you and your loved ones to bond over the tradition that you and some beloved characters are all sharing.\n\nTo help facilitate the post-dinner viewing, below is a list of Thanksgiving sitcom episodes worth throwing on the TV this holiday.\n\n\u201cFriends\u201d Season 3, Episode 9 - \u201cThe One With The Football\u201d\n\nWhat better way to commemorate the gathering of family than with a good old-fashioned sibling rivalry. When the gang finishes watching a football game, they decide to have a fun pick-up game outside. However, Monica and Ross explain that they haven\u2019t played football together since Monica broke her brother\u2019s nose several years ago while competing for the \u201cGeller Cup.\u201d Before long, the entire \u201cFriends\u201d group finds themselves swept up in the competition and taking the game more seriously than even the desire to sit down and have a nice meal. If you\u2019re a family full of stubborn football fans, you\u2019ll relate to this episode.\n\n\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d Season 1, Episode 10 - \u201cThanksgiving\u201d\n\nSome families that gather for Thanksgiving are less-than-traditional. There\u2019s perhaps no better example of a non-traditional family than the gang on \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine.\u201d In its first Thanksgiving episode of the series, Amy tries to make the newly-instated Captain Holt her mentor with a lavish celebration. Jake, however, hates the holiday due to some deep-seated issues with his own family. He asks Holt if he can work a case and lucks out when both he and Holt are called away to investigate money being stolen from the precinct. While they chase the bad guys, Holt manages to teach Jake that family doesn\u2019t have to be a thing that you\u2019re burdened with, but rather something you can choose for yourself. In the end, the precinct bonds over a very non-traditional meal side-by-side with the people they\u2019ve chosen to love.\n\n\u201cCheers\u201d Season 5, Episode 9 - \u201cThanksgiving Orphans\u201d\n\nAfter being forced together by a series of unfortunate circumstances, the regulars at the bar find themselves at Carla\u2019s house where the lack of family and domestic setting drive them over the edge as they grapple with their frustrated shortcomings. Eventually, the lack of proper food leads tempers to a boiling point that can only be vented by way of a good-old-fashioned food fight. While it starts out as confrontational, they find that the food brought them together in the end, even if it wasn\u2019t through eating it.\n\n\u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d Season 3, Episode 9 - \u201cSlapsgiving\u201d\n\nWhen Lily and Marshall try to jump-start a holiday tradition by hosting Thanksgiving, the group can\u2019t help but let their personal turmoil get in the way. While Robin and Ted try to get over their recent breakup, the real threat to Lily\u2019s perfect image of a Thanksgiving comes from her husband\u2019s constant torturing of Barney over the third in their ongoing slap bet. As everyone grinds their particular axes, they eventually learn that holiday traditions can\u2019t be manufactured and simply have to come about organically by way of the people you love. This episode is a standout if for no other reason than it gave fans the catchy song, \u201cYou Just Got Slapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeinfeld\u201d Season 6, Episode 8 - \u201cThe Mom and Pop Store\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re tired of Thanksgiving episodes that simply depict characters gathering around a table to eat in the end, this installment of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d is probably for you. While it lacks a traditional turkey and dinner setting, it focuses entirely on a uniquely New York tradition, the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade. When Elaine lands her boss a chance to hold the Woody the Woodpecker float at the parade, she has her work cut out for her in order to make it work. Meanwhile, Jerry struggles to understand why he wasn\u2019t invited to a friend\u2019s party while George buys Jon Voight\u2019s car. If it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re dealing with an average show about Turkey Day, you\u2019re right, but \u201cThe Mom and Pop Store\u201d works nonetheless."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Ethiopia OKs former opposition figure as election chief", "description": "An opposition figure who recently returned from exile was named Ethiopia's election chief on Thursday as the country prepares for what the reformist prime minister vows will be \"free and fair\" elections in 2020.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/ethiopia-oks-former-opposition-figure-as-election-chief", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:47:16Z", "content": "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia An opposition figure who recently returned from exile was named Ethiopia's election chief on Thursday as the country prepares for what the reformist prime minister vows will be \"free and fair\" elections in 2020.

He used a kayak to paddle to shore, bringing gifts including a football and fish.\n\nHe interacted with some of the tribesmen \u2014 who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants and are known for attacking anyone who comes near with bows and arrows and spears \u2014 until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. The 26-year-old adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to the fishermen's boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day, Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn't known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau's body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nPathak said the seven people have been arrested for helping Chau, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau's and a local tourist guide.\n\n\"It was a case of misdirected adventure,\" Pathak said.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can't be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \"beloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\" The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\"He ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\" the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed on another island while he prepared to travel to North Sentinel. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016. North Sentinel is part of the Andaman Islands and sits at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the island chain, where they broke the news to Chau's friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air on Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday and another trip was planned Thursday.\n\nIndia has a very hands-off approach to the island's people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\"He didn't go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\" Staver said.\n\nChau was carrying a Bible that was hit by an arrow when he was first shot at by the tribesmen on Nov. 15, according to notes Chau left with the fishermen that Staver said he has seen.\n\nStaver said Chau's last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nOne of Chau's friends said the American spent a month at his home in Cape Town, South Africa, before going to India.\n\n\"If he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\" said Casey Prince, 39.\n\nThe two first met about six years ago, when Chau was a manager on the soccer team at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma. Chau and others on the team traveled to South Africa to volunteer at a soccer program Prince founded\n\nPrince described him as easy to like and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tim Sullivan in New Delhi, Gene Johnson and Phuong Le in Seattle, and Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Far right seeks acceptance in Spain, 1 suburb at a time", "description": "Watching from a distance as police surrounded a group of protesters yelling \"Fascists go home!\" Encarna Sanchez hesitated over whether to join a political rally held by Spain's far-right Vox party.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/far-right-seeks-acceptance-in-spain-1-suburb-at-a-time", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-8bfb9cdf2a3d4fdfa62b54239de607a1-1.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:13:47Z", "content": "MURCIA, Spain Watching from a distance as police surrounded a group of protesters yelling \"Fascists go home!\" Encarna Sanchez hesitated over whether to join a political rally held by Spain's far-right Vox party. \"I'm not a racist or a fascist,\" said the 62-ye\u2026 [+6336 chars]", "fulltext": "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nWatching from a distance as police surrounded a group of protesters yelling \"Fascists go home!\" Encarna Sanchez hesitated over whether to join a political rally held by Spain's far-right Vox party.\n\n\"I'm not a racist or a fascist,\" said the 62-year-old housewife who lives in a neighborhood in the southern Spanish city of Murcia that has seen a significant community of migrants move in. \"I'm just here to listen to what Vox has to say about how to make our city safer. No other politicians take an interest in how to defend our home.\"\n\nNeglected, working-class suburbs and rural areas with high unemployment are where the Euroskeptic, anti-feminist and staunchly patriotic party is trying to enlist support that could lift it out of the shadows in a country that has been slow to embrace the extreme right.\n\nThe last far-right Spanish lawmaker lost his seat in parliament in 1982. Academics have attributed their absence since then to painful memories of the country's long right-wing dictatorship and the prominence of the conservative Popular Party across all the political space from center to right. Only more recently has the PP ceded ground to the Citizens party, a new center-right group that surged in popularity as an opposition to regionalist parties in Catalonia and other areas.\n\nBut some saw that barrier falling when Vox garnered a 1.4-percent share of votes in official polls last month, setting the four-year-old party on track to enter the lower house of parliament in general elections due before 2020.\n\n\"Even one seat would be enough to use it as a platform for our message to reach all Spaniards,\" Vox President Santiago Abascal told The Associated Press, outlining a plan to use a regional Andalusian election in 10 days' time and the European Parliament ballot in May next year as stepping stones.\n\n\"There is no such thing as the glass ceiling that many place upon us by saying we are on the fringes or political extremists,\" the 42-year-old Abascal added defiantly. \"We just defend what many families are discussing at the table but has become politically incorrect in the political arena.\"\n\nThe scion of a family targeted by the separatist militant group ETA in his native Basque region, Abascal refuses to waste time fending off criticism that he is a fascist, racist, fear-monger or far-right populist, all of which he dismisses as attempts to stigmatize his movement.\n\nVox politicians are frequently ridiculed by mainstream media for their defense of everything Spanish, from bullfighting to the monarchy, and nostalgia for historical events \u2014 such as the 15th-century ousting of Muslims from the Kingdom of Castile and the colonization of the American continent.\n\nSpeaking in Murcia to a packed auditorium of some 1,500 sympathizers, Abascal went one step further, urging \"rich Arabic countries\" to take in Muslim migrants \"who think like them and want to impose Islamic law.\"\n\n\"We will stand against them coming here to tell us that in our schools we can't eat ham,\" Abascal said, eliciting wide applause from the audience. Outside, police dispersed protesters waving rainbow flags and signs supporting gender equality.\n\nSpain's foreign population, which started growing at the turn of the century, now makes up 10 percent of the 46.7 million residents, with Moroccan, Romanian and British nationals topping the list.\n\nMuch like other populist leaders, Abascal proposes a weaker European Union where migration is controlled \"according to national economic interests and cultural proximity,\" which draws him to rule out \"Muslims who don't blend well with Europe's Judeo-Christian values.\"\n\n\"All the liberal-minded leftists already do it in their mansions. They first look through the peephole before opening the door,\" he said. \"We want to do the same in what is Spanish people's private property: our country.\"\n\nA 100-issue party manifesto begins by stating that the northeastern Catalonia region should lose its self-government after last year's attempt to split from Spain and that separatist parties should be outlawed. Vox also advocates changing laws on domestic violence and restricting abortion.\n\nBut their two flagship issues, a stronger hand on migration and the defense of Spain's unity, could also be Vox's main obstacle as it tries to grab a foothold, said Carmen Gonzalez, a researcher with the Elcano Royal Institute, an official think tank.\n\n\"These are policy proposals that other mainstream parties are already ready to execute,\" says Gonzalez, adding that polls show corruption, inequality and the future of pensions worry Spaniards more than migration does. \"Statistically speaking, the real source of votes in Spain is in the center.\"\n\nReporting about Vox has picked up in the media, however, and the party's propagandists have been skilled enough to magnify that attention using social media and messaging apps to stir debate and reach new constituents.\n\nIn a widely shared video last week, Abascal and a well-known bullfighter rode horses, accompanied an epic soundtrack. Some party leaders also earned fame two years ago by swimming back to Spain to escape arrest in the disputed British overseas territory of Gibraltar after raising a Spanish flag.\n\nOne of those, Vox's secretary general Javier Ortega, acted as a prosecuting lawyer in the judicial probe against the Catalans who organized an illegal independence referendum in October 2017.\n\nThat presence in the public sphere has helped earn Vox more than 16,000 paying members. Last week's rally sold out in Murcia, where Abascal's previous visit drew only enough people to fill the outdoor space of a coffee house.\n\nThe party says it has received separate invitations from the Europe of Nations and Freedom, the smallest group in the European Parliament, and the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, linked to the Republican Party in the United States.\n\nBut the party is finding it difficult to connect with other European peers because some of them have expressed sympathy for Catalan separatists, a no-go zone for Vox.\n\nNotes have been compared with Steve Bannon, but Abascal also doesn't plan for now to join the wide coalition of Euroskeptic movements led by the former White House adviser \u2014 even though U.S. President Donald J. Trump inspired the \"Make Spain great again\" slogan used by Vox in early campaigning.\n\n\"Our references are not international, because the issues that we fight for are national,\" said Abascal, who also is not concerned about voter mood changes over parties like his.\n\n\"Movements like ours,\" he said, \"are going to become permanent in Western societies.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Analysis: Rising US, China rivalry deepening rifts in Asia", "description": "All the usual rituals of international summits were there: the group photos, the gala dinners, the noticeably vibrant shirts leaders force themselves into.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/analysis-rising-us-china-rivalry-deepening-rifts-in-asia", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-20f5750017884cb1827beac88ee6aa8e.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T08:47:25Z", "content": "BANGKOK All the usual rituals of international summits were there: the group photos, the gala dinners, the noticeably vibrant shirts leaders force themselves into.

But eclipsing all of that at Asia's two big meetings was some unusually forthright criticism that exposed deepening divisions rattling the region.\n\nFront and center was the rivalry between the U.S. and China. The two countries are locked in a widening trade war and their representatives used the summits to exchange barbs and maneuver to expand their influence.\n\nCompetition between the great powers is not new to the region. But over decades of war, financial crises and other setbacks, countries across Asia and the Pacific Rim have used these annual meetings to talk through such problems, usually opting to sideline disagreements in a show of unity. Consensus, not conflict, is typically the norm.\n\nThis year is different.\n\nThe clash between the world's two biggest economies is shaking the bedrock of regional amity and leaving some countries worried they will be forced to choose between Beijing and Washington. It also may bode poorly for compromise between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping when they meet this month at the Group of 20 gathering in Argentina.\n\nThe antagonisms kicked off last week at a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, where U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, standing in for Trump, declared that \"empire and aggression have no place\" in the region, a clear reference to Chinese expansion in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe discord carried over to the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea, where leaders failed for the first time in nearly 30 years of such gatherings to endorse a final joint statement. China apparently pushed back hard against U.S. demands for strong language against unfair trade practices.\n\nPence and Chinese leaders sparred at both summits, with the vice president describing China's militarization and expansion in the South China Sea as \"illegal and dangerous.\" He accused Beijing of threatening the sovereignty of many nations and said it \"endangers the prosperity of the world.\"\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang smacked back, urging fellow leaders to send a positive message to markets ruffled by the trade war, which has seen both sides imposing punitive tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's exports and has the potential to unravel supply chains across the globe.\n\nThe acrimony may be somewhat less apparent at the G-20 gathering in Buenos Aeries, which will include leaders from across the globe and the focus will be global, not regional.\n\nBut the strains between the U.S. and China were painful enough in Singapore that the gathering's urbane host, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, appealed for a bit less candor and greater camaraderie, saying it would be easier if everybody was \"on the same side.\"\n\nAcross Asia, countries worry they will have to \"choose one or the other,\" he said. \"I hope it does not happen soon.\"\n\nMost Asian nations are loath to make such a choice because they benefit from the rivalry, whether economically, militarily or both. For most, China is their largest trading partner. But they are wary of China's military might and see the U.S. and its presence in the region as a welcome counterbalance.\n\nChina's footprint was everywhere in the Papuan capital, Port Moresby, from a showpiece boulevard and international convention center built with Chinese help to bus stop shelters sporting \"China Aid\" plaques. A huge billboard showed Xi gazing beneficently beside Papua New Guinea's leader.\n\nAt that meeting, Pence took aim at China's global infrastructure drive, known as the \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" suggesting that Beijing was drowning its partners in debt and infringing on their sovereignty.\n\nHe also announced the U.S. would join ally Australia's plan to develop a naval base in Papua New Guinea. That followed a hush-hush working level meeting in Singapore of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which involves the U.S., Japan, Australia and India and is viewed as a challenge to China's expanding military reach.\n\nXi, the Chinese president, suggested the U.S. was bending the rules of global institutions set up after World War II, such as the World Trade Organization, and using them for \"selfish agendas.\"\n\nThis year's friction wasn't confined to jousting between the U.S. and China.\n\nIn Singapore, Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who usually is not put on the spot by the other leaders, appeared grim and weary after she was sharply criticized by Pence and by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed over the Buddhist majority-nation's treatment of ethnic Muslim Rohingya. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled killings and other violence in Myanmar and are crowded in dire conditions in camps in Bangladesh.\n\nTrue to form, China saw an opportunity and responded to the criticism by having Li reach out and reaffirm Beijing's support for Myanmar's efforts to maintain domestic stability.\n\nAs China and the U.S. maneuver for influence across a region stretching from India to the tip of South America, the biggest worry is that the jousting could escalate into a full-blown confrontation as Chinese and U.S. warships and aircraft prowl the region. A near collision of a Chinese destroyer and the USS Decatur near a disputed reef in the South China Sea in late September added to those concerns.\n\nStill, the jostling for supremacy comes with mixed signals.\n\nThe regional summitry over, two U.S. B-52 bombers on Monday flew over the South China Sea in what U.S. Pacific Air Forces said was a \"routine training mission.\" But on Wednesday, the aircraft carrier USS Reagan docked in Hong Kong in what was viewed as a friendly gesture \u2014 it required Beijing's approval.\n\n___\n\nElaine Kurtenbach is the Asia business editor for AP and has reported from across the region since 1987."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cut off from the world, an Indian island remains a mystery", "description": "For thousands of years, the people of North Sentinel island have been isolated from the rest of the world.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/cut-off-from-the-world-an-indian-island-remains-a-mystery", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/56df27a1-ContentBroker_contentid-71e5ac5d24f7451391189fdf22059bdf.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T08:28:26Z", "content": "NEW DELHI For thousands of years, the people of North Sentinel island have been isolated from the rest of the world.

The amendments would do away with a requirement that a dual national convicted of a terrorism offense would need to be sentenced to at least six years in prison. The conviction itself would be enough to lose Australian citizenship.\n\nThe threshold for the government determining that an Australian was a dual national or entitled to citizenship of another country would also be lowered.\n\nMorrison said there would be \"no need to go around looking for paperwork\" to prove a second nationality.\n\nAustralia also plans to introduce a version of Britain's Temporary Exclusion Orders that were introduced in 2015 and can prevent British fighters from returning home from war zones for up to two years.\n\nUnder the Australian regime, Australian fighters who return home would have to comply with conditions such as reporting to police, curfews and restrictions on what technologies they can use.\n\nMorrison accepted that the Temporary Exclusion Orders legislation might not be passed into law until next year.\n\nMorrison's new drive against extremists has angered some Muslim community leaders.\n\nHe accused senior Muslim leaders on Wednesday of \"continuing down a path of denial\" after they refused an invitation to a meeting scheduled for Thursday to discuss the extremist threat.\n\nSome Australian Muslims were critical when Morrison said after the Somali-born Australian's rampage that \"radical, violent, extremist Islam\" posed the greatest threat to Australia's national security.\n\nThey felt the wider Muslim community had been blamed when Morrison said Islamic leaders \"must be proactive, they must be alert and they must call this out.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Stephen Sorace", "title": "Passenger arrested after alleged anti-Semitic rant during Thanksgiving eve Delta flight: report - Fox News", "description": "Newsweek Passenger arrested after alleged anti-Semitic rant during Thanksgiving eve Delta flight: report Fox News A passenger traveling on Thanksgiving eve allegedly went on a mid-air anti-Semitic tirade aboard a Delta flight from Washingon, D.C., to Atlanta-\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-arrested-after-alleged-anti-semitic-rant-during-delta-flight-report", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T06:50:43Z", "content": "A passenger traveling on Thanksgiving eve allegedly went on a mid-air anti-Semitic tirade aboard a Delta flight from Washingon, D.C., to Atlanta-- asking \"all Jews to raise their hands\"-- and was arrested after the plane landed, a report said.

Police said Wednesday that he had been killed , and authorities were working with anthropologists to try to recover his body from North Sentinel, in the Andaman Islands.\n\n\"Words cannot express the sadness we have experienced about this report,\" his family said in a statement posted on his Instagram account. \"He loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nVisits to the island are heavily restricted, which Chau knew, authorities said. Police arrested seven fishermen accused of helping him reach it, and Chau's family pleaded for their release, saying he acted \"on his own free will.\"\n\nChau, 26, was from southwestern Washington state, where he attended Vancouver Christian High School. He went on to graduate from Oral Roberts University, a Christian college in Oklahoma, in 2014, with a degree in health and exercise science. While there, he worked with the university's missions and outreach department.\n\n\"I have never known a more courageous, selfless, compassionate man and friend,\" said Bobby Parks, the department's former director. \"John lived and gave his life to share the love of Jesus with everyone.\"\n\nChau also worked with Parks' nonprofit, More Than a Game, a soccer program for disadvantaged children, including refugees. Chau traveled to the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq in 2014 to work with Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth, Parks said, and he worked with Burmese refugee children in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for several years.\n\nOn Father's Day last year, Chau noted on Instagram that his father came to the U.S. as a refugee during China's Cultural Revolution. He also documented his extensive travels, posting photos of climbing peaks of the Cascade Range, scuba diving on previous trips to the Andaman Islands and fishing in Southern California.\n\nOne of Chau's friends, Casey Prince, 39, of Cape Town, South Africa, met the adventurer five years ago, when Chau traveled with members of the Oral Roberts soccer team to volunteer at a soccer development and social leadership program that Prince founded, Ubuntu Football Academy.\n\nSince then, Chau had been back to visit Prince and his family or tutor and coach boys in the program about four times. Most recently, he was there from mid-September to mid-October, Prince said.\n\nPrince described Chau as easy to like, kind, joyful and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\n\"He was an explorer at heart,\" Prince said. \"He loved creation and being out in it, I think having probably found and connected with God that way, and deeply so.\"\n\nPrince declined to discuss what Chau had told him about his plans for traveling in India or the islands, saying he wanted to focus on Chau's legacy. But he said Chau accepted the dangers that came with his adventures.\n\n\"If he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\" Prince said.\n\nIn a Q&A for the wilderness adventure website the Outbound Collective, Chau said he first fell in love with the outdoors as a child, when he read books like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"The Sign of the Beaver,\" a tale of a white boy who befriends a Native American boy after being abandoned in a cabin in 18th century Maine.\n\nThe latter book \"inspired my brother and I to paint our faces with wild blackberry juice and tramp through our backyard with bows and spears we created from sticks,\" Chau said. \"Since then, the outdoors have been my home.\"\n\nAlex Burgdorfer, who lives in Eugene, Oregon, said he met Chau last year when the two went through a recertification course for wilderness first responders. The two hit it off because of their mutual interest in travel and hiking and had recently been trying to get together for a hiking trip in the Northwest.\n\n\"He was an inspiration for me,\" he said. \"His energy was pure. He gave you his full attention and his full thoughts.\"\n\nDuring the wilderness first-aid course, Burgdorfer recalled, Chau gave a short talk about treating snake bites in the wilderness, telling the group of his experience getting bitten by a rattlesnake and almost losing his leg.\n\nIt happened during one of the three seasons Chau lived alone in a cabin at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in California, where he would be dispatched to wilderness emergencies. Burgdorfer said Chau had been standing near a river when he was bitten on the left ankle. Chau's Instagram feed displays his grotesquely swollen leg and says he spent several days in a hospital.\n\nChau had worked for the past two years leading backpacking trips to Mount Adams in southwest Washington state for incoming students at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, boss Will Symms said.\n\n\"He was always a great person to hang out and talk to,\" Symms said. \"He loved traveling and showing people the wonder of the things all around.\"\n\n___\n\nFlaccus reported from Portland, Oregon."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Stephen Sorace", "title": "Louisiana couple finds winning $1.8M lotto ticket while cleaning house, weeks before it expires - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Louisiana couple finds winning $1.8M lotto ticket while cleaning house, weeks before it expires Fox News A Louisiana couple cleaning their home ahead of Thanksgiving this week found over one million reasons to be thankful this holiday season\u2014a winnin\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/louisiana-couple-finds-winning-1-8m-lottery-ticket-while-cleaning-house-officials-say", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Lottery-Winners-Ehrenbergs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T05:46:27Z", "content": "A Louisiana couple cleaning their home ahead of Thanksgiving this week found over one million reasons to be thankful this holiday season\u2014a winning lottery ticket worth $1.8 million\u2014two weeks before the prize was due to expire, officials said.

Statues are sometimes damaged by angry protesters or toppled by people just for fun.\n\nAt the workshop, more than a dozen restorers repair stone and marble, clean away graffiti and mold missing appendages.\n\n\"We'd like to have less of this and focus only on preservation of outdoor works, restorations that would be due to age, and not to damage done intentionally,\" said Jorge Grimaz, who coordinates operations at the city's Monuments and Artworks shop.\n\nThe abundance of statuary and monuments, many acquired in France in the 19th and 20th centuries, helps set the Argentine capital and set it apart from other Latin American cities. Pollution and the humidity of the Argentine capital located on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, affects the sculptures. But vandalism is by far their worst enemy.\n\nThe attacks on sculptures have increased as frustration simmers over Argentina's economic crisis.\n\nA copy of Auguste Rodin's \"The Thinker,\" located in the square in front of the Argentine Congress, has suffered the wrath of demonstrators who gather there to protest against politicians. The statue, cast in bronze from the original mold and signed by the French sculptor, was recently elevated on a pedestal to keep it away from the spray paint after a fence failed to safeguard it.\n\n\"We've had a lot of protests lately and the vandalism is on the rise,\" Grimaz said.\n\nEven a statue of Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi has been vandalized \u2014 twice. Last year, the bronze statue was first cut in half at the waist and later chopped off just above the ankles. A tennis racket was torn from the hands of a sculpture of Argentine tennis great Gabriela Sabatini in 2014.\n\nOther Argentine heroes and historical figures have suffered a similar fate.\n\nRevolutionary leader Martin Guemes was robbed of his bronze saber, so restorers at the workshop recently poured polyester resin into a rubber mold inside a plaster box to craft a replacement.\n\nThe shelves behind them held dozens of heads, hands and other appendages awaiting attachment to damaged monuments. The head of Chile's Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda was covered on a stand near the head of former Argentine President Juan Peron.\n\nA monument to South American independence leader Simon Bolivar has been sprayed so many times with graffiti that restorers have to clean it every 15 days.\n\nThe bronze pieces in a reproduction of \"The She-Wolf\" sculpture depicting the mythical founding of Rome, with Romulus and Remus, were stolen and have been replaced by polyester resin that has no resale value.\n\nThe marble horns of two deer in a marble statue of the goddess Diana were broken off by straining dogs that had been leashed to them.\n\nOnly one figure seems to be sacred and off limits to everyone: Mother Teresa. A sculpture of the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Calcutta stands at Lezama park in Buenos Aires.\n\n\"They've never touched it,\" said Grimaz. \"More than 10 years ago have passed and there's not a single work of art in that park that has not been at least stained with graffiti.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "Thanksgiving Special", "description": "Happy Thanksgiving 2018 from all of us at Fox News Radio.

What he did is unforgivable, especially after the corrosive Senate confirmation battle over now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was the subject of bitter and baseless partisan attacks and character assassination by Senate Democrats.\n\nWith everyone looking for ways to remove the high court from the political thicket, Roberts strode arrogantly right into it. Sad day.\n\nRoberts responded Wednesday to comments President Trump made to reporters a day earlier, after a district court judge appointed by President Obama issued an order to stop Trump\u2019s new emergency restrictions on asylum claims by immigrants from taking effect.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar in San Francisco issued the nationwide injunction blocking the president\u2019s restrictions. The restrictions would have made it harder for many of the thousands of Central American migrants now heading toward the U.S. border in caravans to apply for asylum in America.\n\n\u201cThis was an Obama judge, and I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen like this anymore,\" the president said of Tigar. \"Everybody that wants to sue the U.S. \u2013 almost \u2013 they file their case in the 9th Circuit, and it means an automatic loss. No matter what you do, no matter how good your case is. And the 9th Circuit is really something we have to take a look at, because it's not fair.\"\n\n\u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d Roberts shot back Wednesday, as if he were facing Trump in a presidential candidate debate. \u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n\nThe spectacle of the ostensibly nonpolitical chief justice engaged in a dispute with the president of the United States is insulting to the Supreme Court and to our system of justice.\n\nBut President Trump\u2019s criticism of liberal judges in the 9th Circuit who were nominated by President Obama was accurate. These judges previously issued an order blocking the president\u2019s Travel Ban Executive Order that was designed to protect our country from terrorists crossing our borders. As President Trump correctly noted, the Supreme Court later overturned the ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nRoberts\u2019 comments seemed particularly strange because he had never injected himself into a political debate before.\n\nIn fact, Roberts sat quietly through President Obama\u2019s 2010 State of the Union Address when Obama sharply attacked Supreme Court justices sitting in the audience for their ruling in the Citizens United case, which allowed unlimited political campaign contributions by unions and corporations.\n\nPresident Obama falsely claimed in this speech that the Citizens United ruling allowed massive political contributions by foreign corporations. It did no such thing.\n\nAs the justices sat in the House chamber listening to his speech, President Obama embarrassed the court directly and fiercely. Not a peep from Roberts. Only Justice Samuel Alito quietly mouthed to himself \u201cno, no\u201d as Obama railed against foreign campaign contributions.\n\nRoberts has said nothing about Obama\u2019s remarks in the eight years since.\n\nSo why did Roberts attack President Trump on Wednesday? Well, Trump is not a Democrat.\n\nMany believe that Roberts caved to political criticism by President Obama and his Democratic cohorts in a case where Roberts was the decisive vote in a ruling that found ObamaCare was constitutional \u2013 a historic victory for Democrats.\n\nRoberts clearly accepted the claim by Democrats in that case that the Supreme Court could not overturn ObamaCare or the high court would forever harm the republic and subvert the legislative process and the will of the people.\n\nIt is widely believed that Roberts changed his vote at the last minute to stop the Supreme Court from overturning ObamaCare in that landmark case because of pressure from outside forces directed against him.\n\nIndeed, the wording of various dissents in the ObamaCare case \u2013 especially Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s \u2013 made it clear that Roberts\u2019 decision to find that ObamaCare was constitutional was political and nothing more \u2013 not a decision based on the Constitution or on the law.\n\nThe ObamaCare ruling was a legacy opinion for Roberts because he couldn\u2019t take another wave of criticism like what he received from the liberal media, Obama and the Democrats after his ruling in the Citizens United case. Roberts caved in an obvious nod to the attacks on him. It was palpable and most unfortunate.\n\nRoberts\u2019 ObamaCare opinion had a quality of \u201coh by the way\u201d and artificiality to it that was apparent to Supreme Court observers.\n\nSo Roberts\u2019 pro-Democratic bias that we saw Wednesday is nothing new. It is, in fact, a repetition and a return to normal for him.\n\nThe chief justice was institutionally the wrong person to make his point in criticizing President Trump. If the point was to be made at all, it should have been made by the usual suspects: the American Bar Association, any well-known and respected lawyer, or a prominent media commentator or newspaper editorial page.\n\nThe candidates for attacking President Trump are numerous and inoffensive. Perhaps Roberts could have chosen his favorite Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. At any rate, he chose none of these options. One wonders why.\n\nWhy would Roberts insert himself, at this time, in this situation, to attack President Trump? He is a very smart man. This was not an accident or a coincidence."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "The left's hypocrisy over Ivanka Trump's e-mails", "description": "Do Ivanka's e-mails compare to Hillary Clinton's?

Lawmakers are exchanging blows in Parliament. A former finance minister says the country is on the brink of an \"economic anarchy.\"\n\nWelcome to Sri Lanka, where the political crisis is getting worse by the week.\n\nThe trouble started when President Maithripala Sirisena, fed up with disagreements with his prime minister over money, an alleged conspiracy plot and unresolved issues of wartime crimes against civilians, fired Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet and replaced them with a government headed by a popular former strongman, Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nBut lawmakers balked and twice passed a no-confidence motion. Sirisena, however, refuses to accept that his choice of prime minister has been defeated.\n\nJehan Perera, head of the local analyst group National Peace Council, said that the government appointed by the president can't be called legal because Sirisena had not sought a parliamentary vote when he dismissed Wickremesinghe.\n\n\"It can be called illegitimate because provisions for a confidence vote in Parliament are being blocked by the president's own party through their riotous behavior,\" Perera said, referring to a brawl last week that was followed by another pandemonium in the chamber when Rajapaksa loyalists refused to let the speaker conduct proceedings.\n\nWickremesinghe says his dismissal is invalid because he still holds a majority in the 225-member Parliament. The dismissal is also disputed because of a latest constitutional change, which lawyers say has taken away presidential powers to dismiss the prime minister.\n\nDespite all the drama and two rival prime ministers, life hasn't collapsed \u2014 thanks to the efficient bureaucracy that keeps the wheels of administration turning.\n\nEven though there is no Cabinet recognized by Parliament, and despite warnings by Wickremesinghe supporters that state officials should not take orders from an \"illegal government\" of Rajapaksa, bureaucrats continue to work with the president who is the chief executive and the ministers appointed by him, officials said on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nHowever, decisions regarding new projects or purchases involving large sums of money are on hold.\n\nThe absence of a recognized government has delayed the budget for 2019. Mangala Samaraweera, who was finance minister in Wickremesinghe's Cabinet, said that there will be no legal way of spending money in the coming year without a parliament-approved budget.\n\nSri Lanka's Constitution says that control over public finances lies with Parliament and no funds can be released without a warrant signed by the finance minister and approved by the legislature. That means all government payments starting from January can be deemed illegal, Samaraweera says.\n\nSri Lanka is on the brink of an \"economic anarchy and chaos as never experienced before.\"\n\n\"The cavalier and irresponsible actions of the president ... based on personal animosities and precipitating a series of illegal acts, places at risk Sri Lanka's ability to meet its immediate debt obligations,\" he said.\n\nSri Lanka has to repay $1 billion of its foreign loans in early January, which is also in the prerogative of Parliament to approve.\n\nWickremesinghe's lawmakers have presented a motion to the speaker seeking to block funding to the prime minister's office, which if passed, would curtail Rajapaksa's functions.\n\n\"As far as the people are concerned, they are witnessing the normal functioning of the country,\" insisted government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella.\n\nHowever, he conceded that Sri Lanka will have issues on accessing government money if the stalemate is not resolved by the end of the year.

Police said Wednesday that he had been killed , and authorities were working with anthropologists to try to recover his body from North Sentinel, in the Andaman Islands.\n\n\"Words cannot express the sadness we have experienced about this report,\" his family said in a statement posted on his Instagram account. \"He loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nVisits to the island are heavily restricted, which Chau knew, authorities said. Police arrested seven fishermen accused of helping him reach it, and Chau's family pleaded for their release, saying he acted \"on his own free will.\"\n\nChau, 26, was from southwestern Washington state, where he attended Vancouver Christian High School. He went on to graduate from Oral Roberts University, a Christian college in Oklahoma, in 2014, with a degree in health and exercise science. While there, he worked with the university's missions and outreach department.\n\n\"I have never known a more courageous, selfless, compassionate man and friend,\" said Bobby Parks, the department's former director. \"John lived and gave his life to share the love of Jesus with everyone.\"\n\nChau also worked with Parks' nonprofit, More Than a Game, a soccer program for disadvantaged children, including refugees. Chau traveled to the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq in 2014 to work with Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth, Parks said, and he worked with Burmese refugee children in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for several years.\n\nOn Father's Day last year, Chau noted on Instagram that his father came to the U.S. as a refugee during China's Cultural Revolution. He also documented his extensive travels, posting photos of climbing peaks of the Cascade Range, scuba diving on previous trips to the Andaman Islands and fishing in Southern California.\n\nOne of Chau's friends, Casey Prince, 39, of Cape Town, South Africa, met the adventurer five years ago, when Chau traveled with members of the Oral Roberts soccer team to volunteer at a soccer development and social leadership program that Prince founded, Ubuntu Football Academy.\n\nSince then, Chau had been back to visit Prince and his family or tutor and coach boys in the program about four times. Most recently, he was there from mid-September to mid-October, Prince said.\n\nPrince described Chau as easy to like, kind, joyful and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\n\"He was an explorer at heart,\" Prince said. \"He loved creation and being out in it, I think having probably found and connected with God that way, and deeply so.\"\n\nPrince declined to discuss what Chau had told him about his plans for traveling in India or the islands, saying he wanted to focus on Chau's legacy. But he said Chau accepted the dangers that came with his adventures.\n\n\"If he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\" Prince said.\n\nIn a Q&A for the wilderness adventure website the Outbound Collective, Chau said he first fell in love with the outdoors as a child, when he read books like \"Robinson Crusoe\" and \"The Sign of the Beaver,\" a tale of a white boy who befriends a Native American boy after being abandoned in a cabin in 18th century Maine.\n\nThe latter book \"inspired my brother and I to paint our faces with wild blackberry juice and tramp through our backyard with bows and spears we created from sticks,\" Chau said. \"Since then, the outdoors have been my home.\"\n\nAlex Burgdorfer, who lives in Eugene, Oregon, said he met Chau last year when the two went through a recertification course for wilderness first responders. The two hit it off because of their mutual interest in travel and hiking and had recently been trying to get together for a hiking trip in the Northwest.\n\n\"He was an inspiration for me,\" he said. \"His energy was pure. He gave you his full attention and his full thoughts.\"\n\nDuring the wilderness first-aid course, Burgdorfer recalled, Chau gave a short talk about treating snake bites in the wilderness, telling the group of his experience getting bitten by a rattlesnake and almost losing his leg.\n\nIt happened during one of the three seasons Chau lived alone in a cabin at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in California, where he would be dispatched to wilderness emergencies. Burgdorfer said Chau had been standing near a river when he was bitten on the left ankle. Chau's Instagram feed displays his grotesquely swollen leg and says he spent several days in a hospital.\n\nChau had worked for the past two years leading backpacking trips to Mount Adams in southwest Washington state for incoming students at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, boss Will Symms said.\n\n\"He was always a great person to hang out and talk to,\" Symms said. \"He loved traveling and showing people the wonder of the things all around.\"\n\n___\n\nFlaccus reported from Portland, Oregon."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Colombia tries quashing tensions at migrant camp with soccer", "description": "Colombian officials are hoping to quash tensions at a Venezuelan migrant camp with a game both the new arrivals and their hosts share a passion for: soccer.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/colombia-tries-quashing-tensions-at-migrant-camp-with-soccer", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-938fb50338b74a4ea1a60d063900e941-1.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T00:29:59Z", "content": "BOGOTA, Colombia Colombian officials are hoping to quash tensions at a Venezuelan migrant camp with a game both the new arrivals and their hosts share a passion for: soccer.

But after several hundred homeless migrants set up an informal encampment in a park outside a bus terminal in Bogota, officials decided that offering tents and services was a better alternative.\n\nSome neighbors disagreed. As the Venezuelans were arriving at the encampment, people shouted at them from nearby apartment buildings and accused them of bringing in crime and disease.\n\nLiliana Pulido, director of district planning for Bogota's mayoral office, said authorities are now looking for ways to facilitate meaningful encounters between the Venezuelan migrants and Colombian citizens.\n\nPerez said that many migrants at the camp are still unhappy with the food provided by the city, which has been mostly limited to sandwiches and a piece of fruit. But he said that conditions had been improving since Monday's protest.\n\n\"We finally had a hot meal yesterday, with chicken,\" he said.\n\nCity officials have warned that the camp will only function for three months, and they are hoping that in that time, its residents will be able to find work and pay for their own accommodation elsewhere. But many at the camp worry they won't be able to find jobs until they can legalize their status.\n\nColombia is currently home to more than 1 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees who have fled hyperinflation and food shortages at home. Officials suspect that number could potentially multiply in the years ahead."}]
