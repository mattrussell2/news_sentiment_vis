Only her father, Otto Frank, survived.\n\n\"Of course we did not change the hiding place itself \u2014 the annex \u2014 which is the most authentic place where Anne Frank was in hiding and where she wrote the diary,\" Leopold said.\n\nIn a major overhaul spanning two years, the museum got a new entrance and changes to rooms including the darkened space that displays the iconic books that made up Anne's diary.\n\nThe museum also has revamped the way it tells the story of the Frank family, and by extension the Nazi persecution of Jews.\n\n\"What we tried to do is ... use the family history as kind of a window onto a larger history,\" said Tom Brink, the museum's head of publications and presentations.\n\nThat larger history includes the Nazi-occupied Dutch capital during the war \"and, of course, European history because all Europe was affected by the Nazi rule,\" Brink said.\n\nAs well as the physical changes, the museum now has an audio tour which pieces together fragments from the diary, family stories and historical perspective. That allowed curators to keep physical exhibits sparse while still explaining the Franks' story and putting it in historical context.\n\n\"We wanted to preserve the character of the house, which is very much its emptiness,\" said Leopold. \"I think its emptiness is probably the most powerful feature of the Anne Frank House.\"\n\nFor example, a room that served as the office for Anne's father's company used to contain office furnishings. Now it is virtually empty with just a few photos on the wall. One shows a group of Jewish men in Amsterdam kneeling, their hands on their heads, watched over by a Nazi soldier carrying a rifle.\n\nOn another wall is a map drawn up by Amsterdam civil servants for the city's Nazi occupiers with black dots representing the places where Jews lived.\n\nThe museum remained open throughout the renovations. Dutch King Willem-Alexander will formally open the refurbished landmark on Thursday.\n\nAfter the war, Otto Frank had his daughter's diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into more than 70 languages. The building housing the secret annex was turned into a museum in 1960.\n\nTelling Anne's story remains relevant more than 60 years after Anne and her sister both perished in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after contracting typhus.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the head of the European Jewish Congress, Moshe Kantor, warned at a conference in Vienna that \"Jewish communities in Europe are increasingly concerned about their security and pessimistic about their future.\"\n\nLeopold said the museum, which receives 1.2 million visitors annually, has an important role to play in combatting anti-Semitism.\n\n\"We run a museum and we know how powerful the influence of this museum is,\" he said. \"A visit ... really has a huge impact on young people and encourages them to fight discrimination, anti-Semitism, racism in their own communities.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": null, "title": "Sen.

Guided by other land-based scientists watching live feeds, they collected 89 samples and will now start to analyze them, Daniel Wagner, expedition coordinator with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\n\"When they tell you, 'I've never seen that before,' it's a good indication that it's a new species or something that's new to this region,\" he said.\n\nIt will take several years for scientists to establish whether any new species were discovered, but in the meantime, they will ship all the coral branches, pieces of sponge, brittle starfish and rocks they collected to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Wagner said.\n\nScientists aboard the 224-foot (68-meter) Okeanos Explorer also identified some 30 species of fish, including some in areas where previously they hadn't been spotted. These include commercially popular fish such as snappers and groupers, which were seen about 100 meters (330 feet) deeper than reported to exist.\n\n\"That's a great thing,\" Wagner said.\n\nIn addition, they mapped geological features up to 3 miles (5,000 meters) deep, covering an area close to 15,000 square kilometers (5,800 square miles), he said.\n\nThe 19 dives performed by remotely operated vehicles over 145 hours were streamed live and drew a lot of online attention. One especially popular video was that of a catshark embryo attached to a coral branch some 800 feet deep near an uninhabited island off Puerto Rico's west coast.\n\nOverall, the ecosystems appeared healthy, although scientists also saw pieces of trash on a few dives and the occasional fishing line, he added.\n\n\"It's a sad thing, but a healthy reminder that our things go down to the deep sea,\" he said.\n\nThe sites explored were chosen from a list of 80 submitted by scientists worldwide, including the location of a 1918 earthquake that generated a tsunami, killing more than 100 people in Puerto Rico."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Matt Richardson", "title": "LA prosecutor declines felony case against Michael Avenatti", "description": "Michael Avenatti will not be charged with a felony following claims that he physically abused his girlfriend, Los Angeles prosecutors announced Wednesday afternoon.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/la-prosecutor-declines-felony-case-against-michael-avenatti", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:49:33Z", "content": "Michael Avenatti won't face felony charges following claims that he physically abused his girlfriend, Los Angeles prosecutors announced Wednesday afternoon. \u201cA case presented today by #LosAngeles police involving attorney Michael Avenatti has been referred to\u2026 [+1925 chars]", "fulltext": "Michael Avenatti won't face felony charges following claims that he physically abused his girlfriend, Los Angeles prosecutors announced Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cA case presented today by #LosAngeles police involving attorney Michael Avenatti has been referred to the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office for misdemeanor filing consideration,\u201d the Los Angeles district attorney tweeted.\n\nAvenatti is best known as the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels, who says she was paid to keep quiet about an affair with Donald Trump years before he became president.

The federal government estimates the number of migrants could grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks or months. Tijuana residents have not fully embraced members of the caravan. During the weekend, about 500 residents protested the migrants by marching to an outdoor sports complex where the migrants were camped out, with protesters chanting: \u201cGet out!\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here!\u201d\n\nBorder agents have arrested dozens of migrants trying to illegally cross the border. About 5,800 active-duty troops dispatched to the border to deal with the migrant crisis started coming home this week. On Monday, a judge barred the president from enforcing a ban on asylum for those who cross the U.S. border illegally \u2013 a decision the administration said would cause \u201ccountless illegal aliens to pour into our country.\u201d\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Wednesday an appeal will be filed on the decision. Speaking in San Diego, Nielsen said it would be filed as soon as possible. She said the ruling was \u201cdangerous\u201d for the country.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders railed against the California court that issued the ruling. The judge sided with civil rights groups that filed a lawsuit on the new regulations saying immigration law clearly states any migrant can claim asylum no matter how they arrived in the country. Sanders said the administration would take \u201call necessary action\u201d to defend the decision to refuse asylum to people who cross between borders.\n\nSoldiers and contractors have been installing different versions of the sharp wire barriers all along the border \u2014 on the fence, at ports of entry and on the banks of the Rio Grande in Texas, to name a few.\n\n\u201cThis is what it really looks like - no climbers anymore under our administration,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted out, along with a photo of the fortified section in Southern California.\n\nMilitary officials said they have more than 150 miles of wire available to string up at strategic locations.\n\nThe wire is called concertina wire, named after the musical instrument and its expanding and contracting bellows. It resembles barbed wire that\u2019s commonly used to corral cattle, but it comes in flat coils that can expand quickly like its namesake, making it easier to store, transport and install.\n\nIt has been the wire of choice for militaries around the world since World War I.\n\nMade in factories today using galvanized steel, concertina wire consists of sharp flat blades. It\u2019s used to secure businesses, prisons and other government installations.\n\nCritics have blasted Trump\u2019s military deployment at the border as an expensive political stunt \u2014 and question why active duty troops are needed for tasks that contractors could perform.\n\nAccording to figures reported to Congress on Tuesday, the Pentagon estimates the cost of the military\u2019s mission on the U.S.-Mexico border will be about $210 million under current plans. That includes money for active-duty troops and National Guard troops.\n\nWhat\u2019s not clear is how much has been spent on materials like razor wire.\n\nA ton of razor wire can go for several hundred dollars, while a single roll can be bought online for as little as $30.\n\nAn initial 22 miles of concertina wire was shipped to the border when the first troops began to deploy to California, Arizona and Texas a month ago. Military officials said at the time they had more than 150 miles of wire available.\n\nIt\u2019s clear it won\u2019t be strung along every mile as it would take 13 times that amount to span the U.S.-Mexico border. The border stretches about 1,950 miles from the Pacific Ocean to South Texas where the Rio Grande dumps into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIt\u2019s up to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to tell the military where to put the wire. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said the short-term objective has been to get enough wire and other barriers in place as requested by border officials.\n\nA Defense Department spokesman, Army Col.

If all goes well, it will hit the brakes to get to a soft, safe landing on Mars' red plains. The InSight lander, which cost $828 million, is on schedule to land around 3 p.m. ET on Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nBut it's the last few minutes of the spacecraft's journey that has NASA worried.\n\nHOW NASA'S MARS INSIGHT WILL PHONE HOME AFTER ITS DRAMATIC LANDING\n\n\"There's a reason engineers call landing on Mars 'seven minutes of terror,'\" said Rob Grover, InSight's entry, descent and landing (EDL) lead, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement on Wednesday. \"We can't joystick the landing, so we have to rely on the commands we pre-program into the spacecraft. We've spent years testing our plans, learning from other Mars landings and studying all the conditions Mars can throw at us. And we're going to stay vigilant till InSight settles into its home in the Elysium Planitia region.\"\n\nWhile the InSight lander is descending, it will be hit with extreme temperatures, speeds and forces. In an attempt to prevent any damage to the craft, NASA chose a \"vanilla ice cream\" landing site, the Elysium Planitia, which is flat and featureless.\n\n\"If Elysium Planitia were a salad, it would consist of romaine lettuce and kale - no dressing,\" said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a separate statement. \"If it were an ice cream, it would be vanilla.\"\n\nIn addition, the InSight will also autonomously deploy a parachute and ignite its onboard thrusters to help it land safely. Because Mars' atmosphere is significantly thinner than Earth's, everything will need to go right to help it land gently, something that has been difficult to achieve in the past.\n\n\"Previous missions haven't gone more than skin-deep at Mars,\" Sue Smrekar, the InSight mission's deputy principal investigator at JPL, said in the statement. \"InSight scientists can't wait to explore the heart of Mars.\"\n\nOnce it's safely on the surface, that's when the excitement begins, said Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters. \"Once InSight is settled on the Red Planet and its instruments are deployed, it will start collecting valuable information about the structure of Mars' deep interior - information that will help us understand the formation and evolution of all rocky planets, including the one we call home,\" she said.\n\n6 MINUTES OF TERROR: WHAT NASA'S INSIGHT MARS LANDER FACES TO REACH THE RED PLANET\n\nThe last lander to be lost on the Red Planet was the Mars Polar Lander. It launched on Jan. 3, 1999 and NASA last made contact with it on Dec. 3, 1999 after it failed to re-establish communication with Earth as it was descending, likely due to a premature termination of the engine prior to hitting the surface.\n\nProject manager Tom Hoffman says by the time they hear anything, the whole thing will be over. The communication lag between Mars and Earth is eight minutes. If all goes well, the lander will spend the next two years digging into Mars and doing other experiments.\n\n\"Landing on Mars is hard. It takes skill, focus and years of preparation,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Keeping in mind our ambitious goal to eventually send humans to the surface of the Moon and then Mars, I know that our incredible science and engineering team - the only in the world to have successfully landed spacecraft on the Martian surface - will do everything they can to successfully land InSight on the Red Planet.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Researchers, including experts from the University of Washington, have now concluded that the tools were used 80,000 to 170,000 years ago.\n\nKnown as Levallois cores, the artifacts are described as the \u201cmulti-tool\u201d of the prehistoric world.

Technological innovations in East Asia can be homegrown, and don't always walk in from the West,\" said Marwick.\n\nResearchers also pointed to other innovations in the prehistoric and ancient worlds.

Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., on Monday vowed to look into the White House's refusal to fully defend the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare, in court against a lawsuit by 20 states.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argue that because a tax penalty is no longer imposed on those who fail to obtain health insurance, the legal justification that the Supreme Court used to uphold ObamaCare's constitutionality -- Congress' taxing power -- no longer holds.\n\n\u201cIn the next Congress, this committee expects to examine the department\u2019s refusal to defend a duly enacted federal statute, the abrupt resignation of veteran department employees and an apparent determination by this administration to undermine affordable healthcare coverage for millions of Americans,\u201d Nadler said in a statement.\n\nBut Trump's Justice Department, in choosing not to defend a law in court that it believed was unconstitutional, was following in the footsteps of the previous administration. In 2011, the Obama DOJ announced it would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\n\nMeanwhile, House Oversight Committee Democrats said Tuesday they will also investigate Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner\u2019s use of private email accounts for official White House business, re-launching a 2017 probe into whether Trump administration officials are complying with the Presidential Record Act.\n\nCommittee Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who is expected to become chairman at the beginning of the 116th Congress in January, announced that he wants more information about Ivanka's use of a personal email account while conducting official administration business one day after a Washington Post report highlighted White House officials' apparent unease about the issue.\n\n\u201cWe launched a bipartisan investigation last year into White House officials\u2019 use of private email accounts for official business, but the White House never gave us the information we requested,\u201d Cummings said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cWe need those documents to ensure that Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and other officials are complying with federal records laws and there is a complete record of the activities of this Administration.\u201d\n\n\"They weren't classified like Hillary Clinton's, they weren't deleted like Hillary Clinton's.\" \u2014 President Trump\n\nBut there were early signs that Democrats may be overplaying their hand. In a statement to Fox News, Peter Mirijanian, the spokesperson for Trump's ethics lawyer Abbe Lowell, emphasized several key distinctions to the Hillary Clinton email scandal that engulfed the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHOUSE INVESTIGATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY PARTISAN AND LESS EFFECTIVE, EXPERT TELLS FOX NEWS\n\n\"To address misinformation being peddled about Ms. Trump\u2019s personal email, she did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules,\" Mirijanian said.\n\nHe added: \"When concerns were raised in the press 14 months ago, Ms. Trump reviewed and verified her email use with White House Counsel and explained the issue to congressional leaders.\" Mirijanian told the Post that Trump had used a personal account prior to being briefed on ethics rules.\n\nPresident Trump also made that argument in remarks to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, saying the Post's story was \"fake news\" and that his daughter had complied with the law and, unlike Clinton, had not deleted tens of thousands of emails -- after receiving a subpoenea or otherwise.\n\n\"They weren't classified like Hillary Clinton's, they weren't deleted like Hillary Clinton's; she wasn't doing anything to hide her emails,\" Trump said. \"They're all in presidential records. ... There was no servers in the basement, like Hillary Clinton had. You're talking about fake news.\"\n\nWhile Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading the investigation into any potential illegal collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government, House and Senate Democrats have indicated they are eager to explore peripheral issues. For example, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., requested on Tuesday that DOJ watchdog Michael E. Horowitz probe whether there were any \u201cunlawful or improper communications\u201d between new Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and the Trump White House.\n\nTRUMP SUBMITS WRITTEN ANSWERS TO MUELLER, AS RUSSIA PROBE WINDS DOWN\n\nWhitaker previously served as chief of staff to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and had open lines of communications with the administration.\n\nSchumer particularly expressed an interest in whether Whitaker had shared any \u201cconfidential grand jury or investigative information from the Special Counsel investigation or any criminal investigation\" with the Trump White House.\n\nAnd last week, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in an interview with \"Axios on HBO\" that he and his colleagues will employ committee subpoena powers -- which are backed by the legal threat of contempt of Congress -- to conduct the triple-threaded inquiry into Trump's possible use of the \"instruments of state power to punish the press,\" as well as potential money laundering involving the Trump Organization in Russia. (Trump has since derided Schiff as \"little Adam Schitt.\")\n\nSpecifically, Schiff charged that Trump \"was secretly meeting with the postmaster [general] in an effort to browbeat\" her into \"raising postal rates on Amazon,\" whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, separately owns The Washington Post.\n\n\"This appears to be an effort by the president to use the instruments of state power to punish Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post,\" Schiff said in the interview.\n\nSchiff also raised the possibility that the Trump administration's opposition to AT&T's $85 billion takeover of Time Warner on antitrust grounds may have been motivated by the president's animus toward CNN, whose parent company is Time Warner. Trump frequently claims that CNN speads \"fake news\" and that when it does so, it is acting as the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"We don't know, for example, whether the effort to hold up the merger of the parent of CNN was a concern over antitrust, or whether this was an effort merely to punish CNN,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"It is very squarely within our responsibility to find out,\" Schiff said.\n\nBut former GOP Judiciary Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor, told Politico in October that Cummings and Schiff shouldn't get their hopes up.\n\n\u201cIf [North Carolina Rep.] Mark Meadows and [Ohio Rep.] Jim Jordan can\u2019t get documents out of the White House, I don\u2019t know why Elijah Cummings and the Democrats think they\u2019ll do any better,\u201d Chaffetz said.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "Jaimie La Bella, Kris Fried: Talkibg Politics And Sides At The Thanksgiving Table!", "description": "Fox Business producer Jaimie La Bella's and Comedian Kris Fried join Tom Shillue to discuss the most important stories of the day including... it is Thanksgiving Eve and the gang discusses all things Thanksgiving.

This is known as \"like farming,\" a strategy scammers use to gain access to Facebook user's personal information.\n\nSome posts may prompt users to register in order to claim their fake offers, giving them the information they desire. There are also several other ways scammers can use fake posts or pages to dupe users.\n\n\"When the scammer collects enough likes and shares, they will edit the post and add something malicious. That\u2019s often a link to a website that downloads malware to your machine.

Anything that would result in some questioning the culture of safety, we need to fix immediately.\"\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, NASA spokesperson Allard Beutel said: \"We are excited to once again launch American astronauts on American rockets and spacecraft from American soil. We are focused on safe and successful commercial crew missions to the International Space Station. In the coming months, prior to the crew test flights of Crew Dragon and Starliner, NASA will be conducting a cultural assessment study in coordination with our commercial partners to ensure the companies are meeting NASA\u2019s requirements for workplace safety, including the adherence to a drug-free environment. We fully expect our commercial partners to meet all workplace safety requirements in the execution of our missions and the services they provide the American people. As always, NASA will ensure they do so.\u201d\n\nSpaceX and Boeing have not yet responded to a request for comment for this story.\n\nSpaceX's future success has become integral to the future of NASA, especially in light of the recent certification of its Falcon 9 rocket to be designated as a Category 3 Launch vehicle. In a statement, SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell said: \u201cLSP Category 3 certification is a major achievement for the Falcon 9 team and represents another key milestone in our close partnership with NASA. We are honored to have the opportunity to provide cost-effective and reliable launch services to the country\u2019s most critical scientific payloads.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Musk tweeted that SpaceX would be changing the name of its upcoming commercial space vehicle to Starship, which Bridenstine retweeted. Retweets are often seen as a sign of endorsement, though Bridenstine did express any specific endorsement in his retweet.\n\nIn August, NASA announced the nine astronauts that will crew the test flights and first missions of the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, set for next year. Crew for the Starliner test flight are NASA astronauts Eric Boe and Nicole Aunapu-Mann and Boeing astronaut Chris Ferguson. NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley have been selected to take part in the Crew Dragon test flight.\n\nBoeing plans to do an uncrewed flight test of its CST-100 Starliner later this year or early next year. John Mulholland, vice president and program manager for Boeing\u2019s Commercial Crew effort, explained that the earliest the company can \u201cconfidently\u201d do a manned flight test will be in mid-2019. \u201cOur commitment has always been to provide NASA and those crews the highest level of mission assurance,\u201d he said in an August statement.\n\n\u201cSpaceX is targeting November 2018 for Crew Dragon\u2019s first demonstration mission and April 2019 for Crew Dragon\u2019s second demonstration mission, which will carry two NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station,\u201d said Benji Reed, director of Crew Mission Management at SpaceX, in the statement.\n\nELON MUSK'S BIG FALCON ROCKET REVEALED: HOW IT COMPARED TO SPACEX'S OTHER POWERFUL SPACECRAFTS\n\nSeparately, SpaceX has been responsible for bringing supply and cargo to the International Space Station.\n\nFox News' James Rogers contributed to this report.

FIFA's lead ethics prosecutor, Cornel Borbely, was also forced from office in May 2017.\n\nOne year ago, Rajoo passed an integrity check to be appointed as one of two deputy chairmen of the judging panel. He was proposed by the Asian Football Confederation, which is based in Kuala Lumpur along with the Asian International Arbitration Centre, led by Rajoo until Wednesday.\n\nAlthough Rajoo is currently hanging on to his FIFA role, he resigned from his position with the arbitration service on Wednesday, his lawyer, Cheow Wee, told The Associated Press.\n\nRajoo's lawyer said his client had been detained by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission after returning from FIFA business in Zurich the previous evening. A court refused a request for a seven-day remand order against Rajoo, and he was later released unconditionally, Cheow said.\n\n\"The judge agreed with our position that he (Rajoo) has diplomatic immunity and privileges,\" Cheow said. \"He cannot be arrested nor detained, and isn't subjected to our criminal jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe MACC sought Rajoo's remand to protect and continue its investigation into allegations the ethics judge accepted and used his office for financial favors.\n\nThe MACC could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nSince Rajoo joined FIFA, ethics judges have passed several life bans on soccer officials implicated in bribery by a sprawling U.S. Department of Justice investigation.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee has struggled to gain credibility and demonstrate its statutory independence since wholesale changes in personnel in 2017. While Skouris is a former president of the European Court of Justice, FIFA lead prosecutor Maria Claudia Rojas has been criticized in a European lawmaker's report for lacking experience in leading investigations.\n\nIn the May 2017 changes, Infantino also oversaw the removal of the head of FIFA's governance panel, who oversaw integrity checks on senior officials.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee also was tainted by corruption prior to Infantino's perceived purge. In 2016, Uruguayan lawyer Juan Pedro Damiani resigned as an ethics judge after being implicated in the Panama Papers corruption case. He had been a holdover from FIFA judicial bodies during Sepp Blatter's 18-year presidency.\n\n___\n\nNg reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Emily Deciccio", "title": "The Black Friday guide to buying a smart TV", "description": "TV\u2019s have long been an iconic Black Friday purchase.

Unless a deal is reached between the FA and the Premier League, those eligibility requirements could apply to any foreign player after Brexit in March.\n\nPlayers from the top 50 FIFA nations are considered for work permits, with a sliding scale of appearances required \u2014 from 30 percent of games over two years for the 1-10 teams to 75 percent for 31-50 teams. According to FA research seen by The Associated Press, 65 percent of Europeans currently playing in the Premier League would have failed if the criteria were applied to them.\n\nBut for players who don't meet the threshold, clubs can seek an exemption by arguing the case for a work permit in front of a panel. The FA hopes to persuade the Premier League to scrap that system, known as the governing body eligibility endorsement.\n\nUnder the FA's post-Brexit proposals, Premier League clubs would be allowed to sign whoever they want from abroad but only be allowed 13 non-homegrown players in the squad. That number is an average based on the 262 non-homegrown players currently in the 20 teams.\n\n\"Brexit should not be used to weaken playing squads in British football, nor to harm clubs' ability to sign international players,\" the Premier League said in a statement.\n\nMost of the 20 teams do not currently use their full quota of 17 non-homegrown players, a status which means they have not been affiliated to an English or Welsh club for three complete seasons or 36 months before their 21st birthday.\n\nAccording to the FA's research, which was presented to Premier League clubs last week, restricting them to 13 homegrown players last season would have affected only 42 player appearances out of more than 10,000. Only 24 were starts. From Premier League champion Manchester City, only backup goalkeeper Claudio Bravo would have missed out on his three appearances.\n\nThe FA calls this a \"pragmatic\" solution: Clubs could still sign whoever they want from Europe, but the freedom over recruitment is extended worldwide, as long as they abide by new squad limits.\n\n\"The FA believes increasing access, but preventing an increase in current numbers of overseas players, would benefit all of English football,\" the governing body said in a statement.\n\nThe limited opportunities for English talent at home were underscored when Jadon Sancho left Man City last year for Borussia Dortmund in Germany. The 18-year-old winger has since won the Under-17 World Cup and gained regular top-flight experience that saw him fast-tracked into Gareth Southgate's senior England side.\n\n\"I'm just grateful he's seen my progress in the Bundesliga,\" Sancho said. \"My focus was getting minutes as a player and playing first-team football, which is what I've done.\"\n\nFA chief executive Martin Glenn pitched his plans at a meeting of clubs last week but the Premier League remains unconvinced that stronger quotas will have a positive impact on the national team.\n\n\"There is no evidence so to speak to support his proposal,\" said Gold, whose West Ham squad features 16 non-homegrown players. \"We are very supportive of English football. We want it to be successful. But we don't want to be doing things that isn't going to work.\"\n\nThe FA leadership can't even rely on Southgate for support, despite less than a third of the players featuring in the Premier League before the international break being English.\n\n\"Most of the data I have seen suggests quotas on squads would not make a difference because you could still field a team outside the base of British players,\" Southgate said.\n\nLawyers have questioned the merits of the FA's quotas proposal.\n\n\"(It) is completely at odds with the rest of the immigration system which requires employers to only sponsor workers at certain salary levels and to have academic qualifications or skills,\" said Andrew Osborne, head of immigration at London-based law firm Lewis Silkin. \"Non-football employers do not have freedom to recruit who they want subject to a numerical limit.\"\n\nPremier League clubs, like European counterparts, are currently allowed to transfer 16- and 17-year-old players between countries in the region under an exemption from FIFA regulations. But after Brexit, British clubs will only be allowed to sign foreign players over the age of 18, like the rest of the world. Manchester United, a record 20-time English champion, fears European rivals will be handed a competitive advantage.\n\n\"If you have 16-year-olds going to play for them and if we have to wait until 18 there are clearly practical issues there,\" United chief financial officer Cliff Baty has said.\n\nPremier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore endorsed the campaign to remain in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum. That reflected the competition's focus is maintaining the allure to domestic fans and the global television audience, with broadcast rights generating more than $3 billion per season.\n\n\"Access to talented footballers from across Europe has played a key part in the growth of the Premier League, with match attendance and global interest increasing significantly as high quality foreign players have taken their place in the competition with and against the best British and Irish players,\" the league said.\n\nThe government, which wants to end preferential immigration access for workers from the EU, uses the power of the Premier League to project soft power and promote British culture internationally.\n\n\"We have held positive discussions with government about the importance of access to European players for our clubs,\" the league said, \"and the many cultural and economic benefits a globally popular Premier League brings to the U.K.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: 2 convicted for smuggling migrants into Britain", "description": "The Latest on the influx of migrants into Europe (all times local): 5:05 p.m. Two men have been convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison for smuggling Albanian migrants into Britain across the choppy English Channel in a small inflatable boat.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-latest-2-convicted-for-smuggling-migrants-into-britain", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-04e76e6d63874b64aca481f96015cdb2.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:09:50Z", "content": "BUCHAREST, Romania The Latest on the influx of migrants into Europe (all times local): 5:05 p.m. Two men have been convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison for smuggling Albanian migrants into Britain across the choppy English Channel in a small infla\u2026 [+2260 chars]", "fulltext": "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe Latest on the influx of migrants into Europe (all times local):\n\n5:05 p.m.\n\nTwo men have been convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison for smuggling Albanian migrants into Britain across the choppy English Channel in a small inflatable boat.\n\nKent Police said 32-year-old Feim Vata and 24-year-old Xhemal Baco were sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court on Wednesday for conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.\n\nPolice say they used \"extremely unsuitable and overloaded\" boats for the operation.\n\nThe men were arrested on Oct. 20 after Baco was seen picking up six Albanian migrants in France and taking them across the English Channel to Britain.\n\nDet.

And with Democrats regaining the majority in Congress after the midterm elections, she\u2019s hoping to go back to her old job.\n\nWhether or not to vote for Pelosi, 78, is a question reverberating on Capitol Hill \u2013 especially among incoming Democratic lawmakers.\n\nPelosi\u2019s supporters argue her leadership as a skilled strategist and tireless fundraiser is needed to combat Republicans and President Trump. But her detractors say it\u2019s time for a change and a new generation of guidance.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be unusual for Pelosi to take back the role \u2013 plenty of past Speakers served in the position at various nonconsecutive points in their political careers.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what Pelosi needs to do to secure the job \u2013 and the opposition that has already mounted against her.\n\nWhat is the role?\n\nThe Speaker is in charge of three types of duties \u2013 institutional, representative and party leader \u2013 according to the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House.\n\nInstitutional: The Speaker acts as the presiding officer and administration head of the House.\n\nRepresentative: The Speaker acts as an elected member of the House.\n\nParty Leader: The Speaker acts as the leader of the majority party in the House.\n\nThe Speaker is tasked with nominating chairs and members for the Rules Committee and House Administration Committee. He or she also appoints speakers pro tempore and members for joint House and Senate conference committees.\n\nThe Speaker will also act as a liaison to the president and the Senate.\n\nTHE PERILS OF TAKING ON NANCY: LIBERAL ACTIVISTS THREATEN 'BACKLASH' TO DEMS WHO OPPOSE HER\n\nAdditionally, the House Speaker is in line after the vice president to succeed the president if necessary.\n\nDidn\u2019t she do this before?\n\nShe did \u2013 and was the first woman to hold the position when she was elected in 2007.\n\nPelosi has served in Congress since 1987. She was the Speaker from 2007 to 2011. Currently, Pelosi is the House Minority Leader, a position she\u2019s held since 2011.\n\nHow many votes does she need?\n\nArticle 1, Section 2 of the Constitution gives Congress the ability to select their own Speaker. It does not, however, mandate that the Speaker has to be a member of Congress \u2013 although historically that has been the case.\n\nWhen the new Congress convenes in January \u2013 with Democrats in the majority \u2013 members will hold a vote on the next Speaker. Each party will be able to nominate a candidate, and lawmakers will cast their votes by a roll call vote, the Office of the Clerk explains.\n\nTo get the gavel, Pelosi would first need to pick up a majority of the Democratic Caucus in internal leadership elections, then go on to win an \u201cabsolute majority\u201d of votes cast on the House floor.\n\nNANCY PELOSI LAYS OUT VISION FOR DEM-CONTROLLED HOUSE: 'IT'S ABOUT STOPPING THE GOP'\n\nIf just 17 Democrats vote against Pelosi on the floor, she would not have the votes \u2013 at least from her party \u2013 to secure the leadership post.\n\nThe roll call vote is repeated until someone receives a majority.\n\nThe longest election for Speaker lasted two months and took 133 ballots in 1856, according to the U.S. House archives. Then, Rep. Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts emerged victorious.\n\nWho is opposing her?\n\nPelosi faces opposition from several in her own party in her bid for Speaker. Earlier this week, 16 House Democrats circulated a letter calling for \u201cnew leadership\u201d and promising to vote against her.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and to our Caucus. She is a historic figure whose leadership has been instrumental to some of our party\u2019s most important legislative achievements,\u201d the letter from both incumbent and newly elected Democrats read. \u201cHowever, we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change.\u201d\n\nAmong those who signed onto the letter are Reps. Tim Ryan of Ohio, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Linda Sanchez of California. Multiple incoming lawmakers, including Reps.-elect Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Ben McAdams of Utah, also signed the letter.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ JOINS CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS OUTSIDE PELOSI\u2019S OFFICE DURING FIRST DAY ON CAPITOL HILL\n\nThere are other freshmen Democrats who have promised not to back Pelosi but did not sign the letter.\n\nOhio Rep. Marcia Fudge was considering a bid to challenge Pelosi for the job, but she ultimately decided to back her California colleague. Pelosi named Fudge the incoming chairman of a revived elections subcommittee. The panel will delve into voting rights issues that are a priority for Fudge and the new Democratic majority.\n\nHas Trump weighed in?\n\nTrump has tweeted multiple times his supposed support for Pelosi for Speaker.\n\n\u201cIn all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 7. \u201cShe has earned this great honor!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House. She deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win!\u201d Trump said again on Nov. 17.\n\nThe president recently told reporters: \u201cI like her. Can you believe it? She\u2019s tough and she\u2019s smart, but she deserves to be Speaker.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama also praised Pelosi\u2019s \u201cskill, tenacity, toughness [and] vision\u201d in recent days.\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Jason Bonewald", "title": "The Special Relationship", "description": "It's a British invasion...

It is the largest dowry ever paid in the civil war-torn country, the government said.\n\nThe highest bidder was a man three times the 17-year-old's age. At least four other men in Eastern Lakes state competed, said Philips Anyang Ngong, a human rights lawyer who tried to stop the bidding last month. Among the bidders was the state's deputy governor.\n\n\"She has been reduced to a mere commodity,\" Ngong told The Associated Press, calling it \"the biggest test of child abuse, trafficking and auctioning of a human being.\" Everyone involved should be held accountable, he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Nyalong became the man's ninth wife. Photos posted on Facebook show her sitting beside the groom, wearing a lavish dress and staring despondently at the floor. The AP is using only her first name to protect her identity.\n\nSouth Sudan has a deeply rooted cultural practice of paying dowries for brides, usually in the form of cows. It also has a long history of child marriage. Even though that practice is now illegal, 40 percent of girls still marry before age 18, according to the United Nations Population Fund. The practice \"threatens girls' lives\" and limits prospects for their future, said Dr. Mary Otieno, the agency's country representative.\n\nThe bidding war has caused local and international outrage. It took several days for Facebook to remove the post that first pointed out the auction, and after it was taken down other posts \"glorifying\" the situation remained, George Otim, country director for Plan International South Sudan, told the AP.\n\n\"This barbaric use of technology is reminiscent of latter-day slave markets. That a girl could be sold for marriage on the world's biggest social networking site in this day and age is beyond belief,\" he said. The auction was discussed, not carried out, on the site.\n\nFacebook did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nWhile South Sudan's government condemns the practice of child marriage it says it can't regulate communities' cultural norms, especially in remote areas.\n\n\"You can't call it bidding as if it was an auction. It's not bidding. If you see it with European eyes you'll call it an auction,\" government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told the AP. \"You have to see it with an African eye, as it's a tradition that goes back thousands of years. There's no word for it in English.\"\n\nSome local lawmakers and activists disagree. In a statement released this week, the National Alliance for Women Lawyers in South Sudan called upon officials to comply with the government's plan to end child marriage by 2030. Ending the practice includes putting a stop to the auctioning of girls.\n\nSouth Sudan's anti-human trafficking chief called the case reminiscent of others he has seen across the country, in which girls are forced or tricked into marriage after being told they are going to live with relatives and go to school instead.\n\n\"It is clear that some human trafficking practices are hidden in our culture,\" John Mading said.\n\nIn other cases, some girls who grow up in the South Sudanese diaspora are brought back to the country and forced to marry. The AP spoke with several people who know girls who arrived for what they thought was a vacation, only to have their passports taken away and forced into marriage by their families.\n\n\"Some families want children to marry in their countries and in their ethnic communities, but most do it if the kids are misbehaving,\" said Esther Ikere Eluzai, undersecretary for South Sudan's ministry of gender.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Kaitlyn Schallhorn", "title": "Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban ruled unconstitutional by federal judge - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban ruled unconstitutional by federal judge Fox News A federal judge struck down Mississippi's controversial law banning most abortions after 15 weeks about eight months after the Republican governor approved it.

They were sent to hundreds of front-line brothels called \"comfort stations\" to provide sex for the Japanese army that invaded and occupied Asian countries from the early 1930s through the end of World War II.\n\nWartime documents show that Japan's military supervised the brothels, and set the tariffs, service hours and hygiene standards. Government documents say the purpose was to keep soldiers from raping women and triggering anti-Japan sentiment, as well as preventing venereal disease and Chinese espionage.\n\nInitially, some were professionals or from poor Japanese families, historians say. In South Korea, they were often deceived by local agents who recruited them promising factory work. Later in the war, many minors in the Philippines were kidnapped, raped or tricked into working in the brothels, some victims said.\n\n___\n\nJAPAN'S STANCE\n\nJapan's government has repeatedly denied there was any coercion, and more recently has refused to use the term \"sex slave\" for the women in English media and U.N. documents.\n\nJapan has intensified its stance in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's nationalist government, which says there is no official record showing the wartime government's systematic use of coercion. Some ultra-right-wing lawmakers say the South Korean women forced to work in the brothels were all prostitutes, and there is increasing bashing of supporters of the survivors, as well as journalists for writing stories about them.\n\nThe issue flared in 2014 after a former reporter from Japan's left-leaning Asahi newspaper was accused of fabricating his report on the first South Korean survivor who came forward, leading to defamation lawsuits still pending in Japan.\n\nStatues honoring the victims erected in the U.S. and elsewhere by South Korean groups have also upset the Japanese government.\n\n___\n\nTHE WOMEN'S DEMANDS\n\nThe former victims have demanded compensation and an apology from Japan's government. Japan in 1995 set up the semi-government Asian Women's Fund, a scheme to finance compensatory projects for victims from across Asia, including South Koreans.\n\nIn all, the fund paid nearly 5 billion yen ($44.2 million) for medical and welfare projects for all the recognized women from across Asia, including 61 South Koreans. But many others in South Korea rejected the fund because of pressure from their support group's policy to keep demanding official compensation.\n\nEstimates by historians for the total number of victims range from 20,000 to 200,000. In South Korea, about 240 women came forward and registered with the government as victims, and only 27 of them are still alive.\n\n___\n\nTHE 2015 DEAL\n\nUnder the agreement reached in December 2015, Japan pledged to fund a Seoul-based foundation to help support the victims. However, Japan said it didn't consider the 1 billion yen it provided to the fund as compensation, insisting that all wartime compensation issues were settled in a 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties between the countries and was accompanied by more than $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea, in exchange, vowed to refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and will try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a statue of a girl representing victims of sexual slavery that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul.\n\nThe deal initially described by Seoul and Tokyo as \"final and irreversible\" turned out to be anything but. Many victims refused payment. Anti-Japan activists rallied furiously, accusing the government of former conservative President Park Geun-hye of \"selling away\" the honor and dignity of the aging victims. College students began camping out in the street across the embassy to protect the statue from potential attempts to remove it. A 64-year-old Buddhist monk died after setting himself on fire to protest the deal in January 2017.\n\nJapan expressed anger that South Korea didn't taken specific steps to remove the statue and similar monuments in other places in the country, insisting there has been a clear understanding to do so.\n\nLiberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who won office in May last year following Park's removal from office over a corruption scandal, said in December 2017 that the 2015 agreement was seriously flawed because Park's government failed to properly communicate with the victims before reaching the deal.\n\n___\n\nHISTORICAL ISSUES\n\nThe legacy of sexual slavery is hardly the only issue of contention between South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe countries are at odds over a ruling by Seoul's Supreme Court last month that a major Japanese steelmaker should compensate four South Koreans for forced labor during Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II.\n\nSeoul has also expressed resentment about Tokyo's territorial claims over the disputed eastern islands occupied by South Korea. Japan last month refused to send a warship to an international fleet review hosted by South Korea after Seoul requested the removal of the Japanese navy's \"rising sun\" flag, which many South Koreans see as a symbol of Japan's wartime aggression.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo's bitter disputes over history have complicated Washington's efforts to strengthen trilateral cooperation to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat and China's growing influence in the region. Japan has also expressed wariness over South Korea's outreach to rival North Korea in past months, stressing the need to maintain pressure until the North takes concrete steps toward relinquishing its nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\n\"The Moon government is trying to maintain a two-track approach \u2014 cooperating with Tokyo on security and economic issues, but firmly responding to issues surrounding history and territorial claims,\" said Bong Young-shik, an analyst at Seoul's Yonsei University.\n\n___\n\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "American believed killed by isolated tribe on Indian island", "description": "An American is believed to have been killed by an isolated Indian island tribe known to fire at outsiders with bows and arrows, police said Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-believed-killed-by-isolated-tribe-on-indian-island", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-85734dd1ed0c4b47ef0f6a7067000545.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:07:34Z", "content": "NEW DELHI An American is believed to have been killed by an isolated Indian island tribe known to fire at outsiders with bows and arrows, police said Wednesday.

The killing of senior members of the group has had no discernable impact on its operations or ideology.\n\nHamas has staged near-weekly border protests since March in an effort to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the Islamic militant group seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade has ravaged Gaza's economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand rejected by militant group, which is pledged to Israel's destruction.\n\nDemonstrators each week have approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops.

We set a precedent that female genital mutilation will not be tolerated here \u2026 I hope other states will follow suit.\u201d\n\nThe case in Michigan prompted state officials to pass a state law officially banning FGM. The law carries a penalty of 15 years in prison for assisting or performing the procedure, but applies only to future instances. Nagarwala and other members of the sect were charged under an old federal law passed by Congress.\n\nThe federal law was passed in 1996 under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.

Serbia recently abolished the deal under pressure from the EU.\n\nMigration remains a source of division within the EU, although the numbers of people moving to the West have dropped dramatically since the mass influx in 2015 when about 1 million migrants entered Europe. Anti-migrant sentiments have been on the rise and countries like Austria and Hungary have announced they will not support next month a U.N.-backed global pact for orderly and safe migration.\n\nJami, though, is undeterred by narrowing options for migrants, and seems certain she will eventually succeed.

If you like to see some of the great things in this country and maybe can't get to this on your bucket list, this will be as close as you get. And you gave us great access. You also started this off helping us out on the Statue of Liberty.\n\nYou and I saw for the first time together, when you first took this job. So, that's what we'll be talking about on the 27th. But first thing's first, the fires in California. What could - what did you take away that we didn't get on camera?\n\nZINKE: Well, I'll tell you I've seen a lot of devastation fires before, nothing like this. You know, in a town of about 20,000, probably 80 percent was destroyed. And the scenario was like this Brian, is that it was literally a flamethrower of embers.\n\nAnd spot fires were ahead of it. You had a 50 mile an hour wind. And no one really thought that the damage would be this severe. And by the time a lot of people thought about evacuating it was too late.\n\nYou saw the pictures of people driving through flames. In one case, the fire and local firemen are in town and they had fires in the front, rear, all around. They had to go to a commercial parking lot with a building, harbor people inside the building and defend the space.\n\nKILMEADE: Wow.\n\nZINKE: I mean, that's how desperate it was. But I tell you the firemen did a great job. There could've been so much more loss of life. The sheriffs were out there evacuating. So the - our first responders did a - did a good job. But lesson learned and takeaway, it's time to manage our forests. It's just unacceptable, the amount of dead and dying timber, the density of trees.\n\nAnd yes it can be managed doing prescribed burns using best science, prescribe burns late in the season, remove the dead and dying trees. Get defendable spaces. This can be done. We're - we're going to spend billions of dollars - billions, Brian, this year fighting forest fires, repairing damage.\n\nAnd it is better to invest now and restore the health of our forests. But I'd rather spend the money on ...\n\nKILMEADE: Right.\n\nZINKE: ... trails, on visitor centers. As you point out, the parks. Magnificent stories, but the parks are, you know, being loved (ph) to death. I'd rather invest the money on public access, and boat ramps, and get America out there to enjoy the outdoors rather than be fearful from it.\n\nKILMEADE: I want you to hear what the President said when he goes (ph) out there. And I think the President's got to do more of this, going into areas that didn't vote for him that maybe will protest against him, but they're in trouble. And I think - I think it was great that she showed up, but here's what he said.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got some blowback because your - one of your tweets which (you said) ...\n\nTRUMP: Only because ...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... there's poor forest management.\n\nTRUMP: ... only because I tell the truth. Look, the President of Finland was with me recently. He said we are a nation living in a forest, meaning Finland. We have very combustible trees and wood. We don't have forest fires like this. It's got to be raked (ph).\n\nIn fact, it was very interesting. I was watching the firemen the other day and they were raking areas - they were raking areas. Where the fire was right over there, and they're raking trees, little trees like this that are - not trees, little bushes that you could see are totally dry, weeds. And they're raking them, they're on fire. That should've been all raked out.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKILMEADE: So - and he got blowback from that. And the Finnish President said, you know, we don't rake. What do you think he's referring to, did the President make a mistake there?\n\nZINKE: No, the - you look at the amount of combustible fuels on the forest floor. I mean, it is - it is unacceptable. So the term raking is just cleaning up the forest floor. And we're doing it right now. I signed a secretary order. You look at Yosemite, gathering the dead and dying timber.\n\nWe're doing prescribed burns late in the season. But this should've been done, you know, years ago. And this is not just, you know, the last administration or - or - actually, this has been years of just letting the forest go, or - or trying to harvest even a sustainable yield, and being sued in court.\n\nSo we're asking - both, Secretary Perdue and I are asking for more authority to use best science and best practices. And cleaning up the woods isn't clear cutting. It's thinning the trees where you need it, restoring the health, the diversity of types of species, again, removing the dead and dying trees.\n\nBut we should have these prescribed burns late in the season rather than these hundred thousand acre fires ...\n\nKILMEADE: Yes.\n\nZINKE: ... that devastate communities, put our firefighters at risk. We lost a lot of firefighters too. But this - this Paradise Fire, you know, the casualties could be in the hundreds. And - and you go through these neighborhoods and a lot of it can be mitigated.\n\nBut I tell you it's better to spend the investment upfront and restore active forest management, and again, using best science and best practices. We have great foresters, let's just get it done.\n\nKILMEADE: Right. Mr. Secretary, I - I know one thing it seems that it seems that surely (ph) they're getting it done. It seems you've been targeted a lot by different groups. Fifteen separate investigations into you, nine of which have been dispatched.\n\nThe President says he's thinking about rotation three to five different secretaries who may do all, may do none. Where - where do you stand right now?\n\nZINKE: Well, first of all, they're - they're allegations which are fictitious, false. And - and when you're effective they start targeting. I always say it's better to charge up a hill under fire than cower in a foxhole. And - and what they're trying to do is distract from the accomplishments.\n\nAnd look at how much the accomplishments of this presidency has been in interior, our energy sector. We're the largest oil - oil and gas producer on the face of the plant. And yet, our safety record also breaks records. The first time in 60 years we're exploring natural gas. On the conservation side, we've opened up millions of acres to public access, increased hunting and fishing opportunity. We've opened up 38 wildlife refuges to hunting and fishing. We've established wildlife corridors and I have withdrawn mineral - withdrawn mineral rights...\n\nKILMEADE: Yes.\n\nZINKE: ... of - in areas that should be protected, so both on the conservation and the energy side which is my job as interior. We've done things, as a matter of fact Former Secretary Hodel, he was a Secretary of Interior under Reagan. His quote was, \"President Trump and Zinke, they're actually doing things we talked about doing but couldn't get done.\" And so when you do get things done you're going to take criticism especially for those that resist or obstruct.\n\nKILMEADE: Now what about, Congressman, what about this whole thing - excuse me, Mr. Secretary, the whole Haliburton land situation and there's a report in \"The Washington Post\"...\n\nZINKE: That's nuts.\n\nKILMEADE: Tell me about it. Can you define it for us? All we get is the investigation, we don't get your side of it.\n\nZINKE: This is - Brian, only the left can twist a proposed shared parking lot to increase public access to a children's sledding hill into an elicit oil and gas land deal with big oil. There's nothing to do with Haliburton. It's a sledding park in Whitefish and if you go into Whitefish and look at it. What could possibly be wrong with a children's sledding park? I have no financial interest in developments. Everyone knows that it's an absolutely rouse but this is what - they called for allegations of me wearing my socks. As a matter of fact when you and I are at Mt. Rushmore I had a pair of socks that had the president's face on them. That called for investigation.\n\nBut every investigation always leads to the same conclusion that I follow all rules, procedures, regulations and most importantly law. But it's just a distraction from all the good things this president is doing. And I probably (get is), the president is probably the first ranking criticism on fake news probably in the second or third position but he fights for freedom every day.\n\nKILMEADE: Yes, I know. Did you express that and define that to the president and said let him know your side of the story?\n\nZINKE: Oh absolutely. The president supports me. You know I love working with the president. He's a business guy. If people ask me what's it like to work for the president? I say he's business -- he follows the numbers; he's engaged.\n\nKILMEADE: Right.\n\nZINKE: If you do your job, he's a great boss. If you don't do your job believe me, he'll call at 2:00 in the morning but he's a CEO. He likes metrics. He likes to see things get done. In this country, you know the swamp, as you start draining the swamp...\n\nKILMEADE: Right.\n\nZINKE: ... the swamp it exposes the surface and they fight back. That's exactly why the president got elected because the swamp, as you know, is not a nice place and our country deserves better.\n\nKILMEADE: Yes I want you...\n\nZINKE: Our borders need to be protected.\n\nKILMEADE: Well you're a Congressman - before that you were serving in the military - a Navy Seal. And I just thought you were uniquely qualified to answer this rift as blown up between Admiral McRaven who's been very critical of this president and this president. Chris Wallace brought up an old quote and here's what the president said about Admiral McRaven who is very critical of him.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: Bill McRaven, retired Admiral, Navy Seal, 37 years, former head of U.S. Special Operations...\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hillary Clinton fan.\n\nWALLACE: ... Special Operations...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Hillary Clinton fan.\n\nWALLACE: ... who led the operations, command of the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama Bin Laden says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime.\n\nTRUMP: OK, he's a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer.\n\nWALLACE: He was a Navy Seal.\n\nTRUMP: It would have been nicer if we would have gotten Osama Bin Laden a lot sooner than that. Wouldn't it have been nice?\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\nKILMEADE: So where do you stand with this? The Admiral against the president.\n\nZINKE: Well the Admiral I think has said some things that are inappropriate but I - I've known Bill McRaven for awhile. You know I like Bill McRaven. He's served his country and I disagreed with Senator McCain on a lot of issues too but I respected his service and so in the day I think the Admiral - you know the president's DNA - he's the nicest guy in the world until attacked. But you take a swing at him and he's going to swing back. It's in his DNA. And so when people say inappropriate, unkind remarks about the president, you know the president is going to respond.\n\nKILMEADE: Should he have - should he have said not responded because the Admiral has been in the military so long?\n\nZINKE: Well I think - you know anyone that says a remark - again an inappropriate comment he's going to come back. This is - this is what the president's DNA is...\n\nKILMEADE: Got you.\n\nZINKE: ... but again he's - he doesn't -- he doesn't start a fight. I've never seen him actually start a fight but he's willing to finish it and he strongly says what he believes. You know an people, well what about the tweets? He's probably the most transparent president we've ever had because if you're wondering what's on the president's mind, just follow his tweets.\n\nKILMEADE: Got you.\n\nZINKE: He calls it like he sees it.\n\nKILMEADE: And Mr. Secretary, last question. I'm already over time. How long do you expect to be Secretary of the Interior?\n\nZINKE: Oh, you know I enjoy the job and I - I kind of laugh at the criticism. They have me taking over your show, if you listen...\n\nKILMEADE: Yes they have you as a \"Fox News\" Contributor leaving in 2018 becoming a \"Fox News\" contributor.\n\nZINKE: Well I like the best one, I think the president is going to nominate me for the commander of Space Command.\n\nKILMEADE: That would be great.\n\nZINKE: That was a good one. I enjoy the job. It's certainly work if you enjoy working with the president.\n\nKILMEADE: OK.\n\nZINKE: Interior I'm passionate about and there's a lot more to do. I mean we have to restore and rebuild our park system. We're in the middle of a reorganization interior to be better stewards for the next century.\n\nKILMEADE: Got you.\n\nZINKE: There's a lot of work interiors do but yes, I look forward to go on to the next park. And remember, visit our park during the holidays because we have 417 park units and every park tells a different story.\n\nKILMEADE: Got you.\n\nZINKE: Our park system I think is the envy of the world. Go out and find a park today.\n\nKILMEADE: Congressman Ryan Zinke, now Secretary Ryan Zinke, Navy Seal Ryan Zinke. Have a great Thanksgiving. Thanks so much.\n\nZINKE: You as well and back to your family and God bless America."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "Diana Butler Bass \u2013 Grateful", "description": "No matter our religious beliefs, we can all celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday.

In total, the coalition has acknowledged 104 civilian deaths from the hard-fought campaign.\n\n\"With bodies still being recovered from the wreckage and mass graves more than a year later, this is just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Milena Marin, senior adviser on Amnesty's Crisis Response team.\n\n\"There is a mountain of evidence left to sift through, and the scale of the civilian devastation is simply too large for us to do this alone.\"\n\nSome 2,500 bodies have been pulled from the rubble and uncovered in mass graves, and searches are still underway. Amnesty suspects hundreds of civilians died in the campaign.\n\nRaqqa was the capital of the Islamic State group's self-styled caliphate, which once encompassed a third of Syria and Iraq. In recent years the group has been driven from virtually all the territory it once controlled, and holds just a few small, remote pockets in Syria.\n\n___\n\nhttps://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/strike-tracker"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Australian drug smuggler banned from Indonesia after release", "description": "Indonesia said an Australian woman freed Wednesday after serving nearly 14 years in prison for smuggling heroin to the tourist island of Bali will be deported and banned from the country for life.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/australian-drug-smuggler-banned-from-indonesia-after-release", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-a74569ae58454712ab652eb04092b212-1.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:30:34Z", "content": "BANGLI, Indonesia Indonesia said an Australian woman freed Wednesday after serving nearly 14 years in prison for smuggling heroin to the tourist island of Bali will be deported and banned from the country for life.

She still can remember those moments well.\"\n\nThe story is as old as war itself: Children left behind by the soldiers who fathered them.\n\nKaine is among more than 6,000 children fathered by soldiers in a West African peacekeeping mission that came to Liberia in 1990 and left eight years later, according to a center set up to register and support them. A smaller number of children were fathered by members of a separate U.N. mission that emerged as Liberia struggled to emerge from a vicious civil war.\n\nMany of the Liberian children, now grown, have never met their fathers. Others were abandoned by their mothers and grew up as orphans. As they enter adulthood two decades after the peacekeepers' departure, they are the focus of new attention in a world coming to terms with sexual exploitation and abuse by soldiers sent to protect vulnerable communities.\n\nUnlike many of the Liberian children left behind, Kaine says his father looked out for him, asking if he could bring the boy and his mother home to where he lived.\n\n\"Family pressure and fears made my mother remain,\" he said pensively.\n\nEven the few details Kaine has about his father are inconclusive: The T-shirt worn by his father, Lt. Cpl. Taiwo-Oyetunji, still clearly bears the seal of the West African regional body ECOWAS, under whose umbrella the ECOMOG peacekeepers arrived. It's a shirt from Niger, though his father's ID says he is of the Yoruba tribe, from Nigeria. Kaine became emotional upon seeing an identity card with him pictured in his uniformed father's arms.\n\nThe young man recently made his way to a support center in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, that was set up to help the thousands of children left behind by peacekeepers.\n\nThe United Nations-ECOMOG Children Organization, or UNECO, encouraged soldiers to register themselves and their children. They say they registered more than 6,000 children and eventually set up an orphanage on Monrovia's outskirts.\n\nMany of the West African soldiers cooperated, while others had to be found to register, said Ciah Cole, who set up the center with her husband, the Rev. Abraham Cole. Still, it was not possible to register all of them and much of the material was lost over the years, severing any chance for the children to track their fathers down.\n\nLiberia was in turmoil for 14 years amid back-to-back civil wars that left an estimated 250,000 people dead and forced more than half a million to flee to neighboring countries. The first civil war, which began in 1989 and became one of Africa's bloodiest conflicts, led to a regional peacekeeping force that at one point reached 15,000 troops. A U.N peacekeeping mission later emerged, only to leave Liberia earlier this year.\n\nWhile many women were raped during the fighting, the thousands of peacekeepers' children were largely the product of relationships Liberian women sought out as a shelter from hunger and hardship. At the time, peacekeepers had some of the best access to food in Monrovia.\n\n\"People were starving. There was nowhere to turn and women had to look for different ways to survive,\" Cole said.\n\nThe relationships went against the code of ethics for both ECOWAS and the U.N., which forbid sexual contact with people under the peacekeepers' protection because the potential for exploitation and abuse was high. In the early 2000s, the U.N. refugee agency reported that peacekeepers and humanitarian workers in Liberia had demanded sex in exchange for food, medicines, shelter and education.\n\nEnforcing bans on such relationships remains a major challenge, according to an Associated Press investigation last year that uncovered roughly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers in various countries over a 12-year period.\n\nIn Liberia, the thousands of children who resulted from those relationships have now been largely absorbed by society. Nearly 40 of them still live at the UNECO center, which is painted in the peacekeepers' camouflage colors. Over the years, the center has helped to raise many of the children with little financial support.\n\n\"When there is no father, no mother, you are handicapped,\" said 24-year-old Nana Addo, who was placed in the center by his mother in 1995. He has lost hope of ever seeing his Ghanaian father \"but if he's still alive and I see him, I will be happy.\"\n\nThe problem is larger than reported, but resources are scarce, said Cole.\n\n\"Many of the mothers are hiding, refusing to identify themselves because they say it is shameful and disgraceful that those solders had children by them but could not return to see what's happening to the children they left behind.\"\n\nShe called on governments that contributed peacekeepers to Liberia to assist the children, and urged Liberia's government to set an example.\n\nWhile a far smaller number of the children were fathered by members of the U.N. mission that arrived years later, the U.N. says it made outreach efforts so Liberian women could register any complaints of sexual exploitation and abuse and receive assistance.\n\nSpokespeople at ECOWAS headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria declined to comment to The Associated Press, saying they did not have the information needed to respond.\n\nSome former ECOWAS soldiers, however, remember relationships with Liberian women well.\n\nMamadou Dalaba, a former Guinean soldier, said many colleagues impregnated local women and left without telling them once the war was over.\n\nAnother who served in Guinea's first contingent of soldiers in 1990 said many men had children with Liberian girlfriends in Monrovia. The men looked after the children as long as they could before returning home, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nFor the Liberians left behind, those broken bonds still hurt more than two decades later.\n\nKaine, the young man who clings to his father's T-shirt and ID card, says he was fortunate to grow up with his mother. He wants to become a mechanic but says he had to leave school this semester due to lack of support. \"The country has become too tough,\" he said, shaking his head.\n\nHe, too, sent out an appeal to all the peacekeepers who left Liberian children behind to come back and support them.\n\n\"In today's Liberia, depending on the government to help people like me is like relying on a broken stick to stand and walk,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nPetesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.

He interacted with some of the tribespeople, giving them gifts he had prepared such as a football and fish. But the tribespeople became angry and shot an arrow at him which apparently hit a book he was carrying, Pathak said.\n\nThe American's kayak became damaged, so he swam to the fishermen's boat, which was waiting at a prearranged location. There he spent the night and wrote out his experiences on pages of paper which he gave to the fishermen, Pathak said.\n\nIn one of the notes handed over, according to the New York Times, Chau wrote about Jesus bestowing him with the strength to visit some of the most forbidden places on Earth.\n\nChau then set off for the island again the following day. Sources who spoke to AFP though said once he set foot on shore, he was \u201cattacked by arrows but he continued walking.\n\n\u201cThe fishermen saw the tribals tying a rope around his neck and dragging his body,\u201d one source added.\n\nFollowing Chau's death, the fishermen left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they informed Chau's friend, who notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nHe said the family got in touch with Indian police and U.S. consular officials.\n\n\"It was a case of misdirected adventure,\" he added.\n\nThe body, according to Reuters, has not yet been recovered as of Wednesday, and those who took him to the island are said to have been arrested.\n\n\"The investigation in this matter is on,\" senior police officer Deepak Yadav said, announcing that the seven fishermen have been taken into custody.\n\nIt is not the first time someone has been attacked while trying to visit the island.\n\nIn 2006, two fishermen whose boat strayed into the waters around the island were killed \u2013 and their bodies have never been found, Reuters reports.\n\nAn Indian Coast Guard helicopter that had tried to land in the area to find the pair was forced to turn around after coming under fire by arrows, the news agency says.\n\nTwo years earlier, an Indian Navy helicopter that flew to the island to check up on its residents in the wake of the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami also was met with a greeting of arrows.\n\n\"So we knew that they were safe,\" one of the pilots told the BBC.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate in Chennai, in the capital of Tamil Nadu state, said it was aware of reports of Chau\u2019s death but declined to comment further.\n\nThe International Christian Concern, a U.S.-based nonprofit that aims to fight persecution against Christians, called the death concerning.\n\n\u201cWe here at International Christian Concern are extremely concerned by the reports of an American missionary being murdered in India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands,\" its regional manager, William Stark, said in a statement. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to both John\u2019s family and friends.\"\n\nShiv Viswanathan, a social scientist at the Jindal Global Law School, said the island is a protected area and not open to tourists.\n\n\u201cThe exact population of the tribe is not known, but it is declining,\u201d Viswanathan said. \u201cThe government has to protect them.\u201d\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the most recent killing should prompt Indian authorities to continue to protect the lands of the Sentinelese and other Andaman tribes.\n\n\"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survives.

But critics say those efforts leave the migrants trapped in Libya.\n\n\"This is the worst possible conclusion to the desperate plea of the people on board the Nivin to avoid inhuman detention in Libya,\" said Judith Sunderland, of HRW.\n\n\"The situation is the result of efforts by Italy and the European Union to obstruct rescue operations by non-governmental organizations and empower the Libyan coast guard even when Europe knows that Libya is not a safe place.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch has urged Libyan authorities to \"immediately allow United Nations and non-governmental personnel to visit the people removed from the cargo ship, find alternatives to their detention, and investigate the possible use of unlawful force.\"\n\nThe U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Libya, Maria Ribeiro, said in a statement Tuesday that the \"humanitarian community is saddened by the turn of events.\"\n\n\"Their reluctance to leave the relative safety of the ship that rescued them from peril at sea is an understandable human reaction. ... It is regrettable that mediation efforts undertaken did not lead to a peaceful resolution,\" Ribeiro said.\n\nThe migrants had been in the Misrata port since earlier this month, with the captain and crew of the ship taking refuge on the upper decks.\n\nWith just one rescue ship patrolling the Mediterranean, and European ports refusing to take in rescued migrants, commercial ships have become increasingly leery of rescuing people at sea. Repeatedly in recent months, they have found themselves caught in the middle between governments hostile to new migrants and an obligation under international maritime law to save.\n\nThe United Nations migration agency says more than 850 migrants have died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean since the start of 2018, down from some 2,100 deaths during the same period in 2017. The agency estimates that more than 40,000 have reached Europe since January, compared to around 80,000 over the same period in 2017."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "The Best Black Friday Deals with Matt Granite", "description": "Hi, I'm Gerri Willis from the Fox Business Network and host of the podcast, Rich is Not a Four-Letter Word.

There, on the other side, the fight is raging to capture one of the militants' last enclaves.\n\nIraqi troops and Shiite militiamen outside Qaim watch over a giant earth barricade topped with barbed wire that runs along the long, featureless desert border, trying to prevent IS infiltration. Iraqi artillery and U.S.-led coalition warplanes bombard IS positions inside Syria, while Iraqi militiamen along with allied Iranian troops cross the border to back Syrian government forces there.\n\nThe battle on the doorstep means life in Qaim is still on hold, with residents waiting for their town to be rebuilt. There is still no central electricity, and running water works only intermittently. On the outskirts lie the wreckage of houses, their walls blasted open and roofs collapsed from bombardment during the assault a year ago by militias and U.S.-backed Iraqi troops who retook Qaim from IS.\n\nThe dusty, quiet streets are dotted with security checkpoints, manned by the military and the government-sanctioned, Iranian-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, who are viewed with deep suspicion by many in this Sunni Muslim town. Many checkpoints fly both Iraqi national flags and the militias' banners proclaiming Shiite slogans.\n\nOn the main commercial road, militiamen and Iranian fighters shop in the markets. One fruit seller, Nabil Mashhad, said that since he doesn't speak Farsi, he shows the Iranians the prices on his cellphone's calculator.\n\n\"The situation is bad,\" Mashhad said. \"Where are the services? The schools? There's no life. We're working just trying to get by.\"\n\nThe fight next door underscores the tenacity of the Islamic State group, a year after it was driven out of almost all the territory it once held, which at its height encompassed nearly a third of both Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe IS enclave across the border is the last area with a significant population that it holds, a 30-kilometer (20-mile) stretch of towns on the east bank of the Euphrates River.\n\nThe militants are surrounded. On one side are the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by American warplanes, who have been waging an offensive since mid-September. On the west bank of the river is the Syrian military, backed by Russian airpower along with Iranian troops and Iraqi militiamen.\n\nIS has fought back ferociously. Last month, it attacked under cover of a sandstorm and captured a number of villages from the SDF. During the fighting, the militants drove explosives-packed cars through tunnels to emerge at their opponent's lines and at one point lured SDF fighters into an ambush by sending a woman to cry for help, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that monitors Syria's war.\n\nThe extremist group is estimated to have several thousand fighters, including many Iraqis, in the enclave. The Iraqi military believes senior IS leadership are among them, possibly top leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. IS holds one other pocket in Syria, but that is a largely uninhabited desert expanse surrounded by government-held territory.\n\n\"We never thought or said this fight would be easy. These are some of ISIS's most determined fighters, and they've had a lot of time to prepare,\" the deputy commander of the U.S.-led coalition, British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, told The Associated Press.\n\nRetaking the enclave has also been slowed by the rivalries among the various forces besieging it, said Iraqi Gen. Qassim Mohamed, commander of Iraqi forces in the Qaim area. Each must move carefully to avoid friction with the other.\n\nMeanwhile, IS has turned to insurgent tactics inside Iraq. Last week, it claimed an attack on the home of a tribal leader that killed nine members of the security forces in Anbar, the province that includes Qaim. There has been an uptick in bombings and kidnappings elsewhere in the country, though not all are claimed by IS.\n\nA reminder of the group's presence came last week when the U.S. military announced that American and Iraqi forces killed more than 50 militants in October in the Makhmour Mountains of north-central Iraq.\n\n\"The security situation is under control,\" Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi told a televised press conference. \"It's natural that Daesh is trying to recover its strength,\" he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group. \"Our forces monitor them, repel them and are in control of all the crossings.\"\n\nIn Qaim, the border crossing is sealed by a concrete wall with a metal gate. Militiamen cross into Syria using a gap in the earth berm south of the town.\n\nThe town was once a thriving stopover on the highway between Damascus and Baghdad. Long before a hard border materialized in the latter half of the 20th century, tribes sent their grooms and brides across the frontier to marry, extending the branches of their families on both sides.\n\nWhen IS overran the town in 2014, it linked the group's holdings in both countries and connected them to key highways leading to multiple parts of Iraq.\n\nMany of Qaim's 120,000 residents fled IS. A third of them still have not returned.\n\nSecurity forces issue passes to allow residents to move in and out, a measure against infiltrators. But to apply for an ID, residents must be vetted by both the army and the militias, raising uncomfortable questions about who is in control.\n\nAmong Iraq's Sunnis, the Shiite militias are widely resented, and relations between the two communities have been poisoned ever since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\nQaim resident Talal Obeid said he had been hesitant about returning home because of reports of militia abuses.\n\n\"We are more scared of the yellow flags than the black ones,\" he said, referring to the yellow banners of the Kataeb Hezbollah militia and the black flags of IS.\n\n\"I worry if they stay, there will be friction and provocations.\"\n\n___\n\nIssa reported from Baghdad."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rains could help firefight but complicate search for remains - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Rains could help firefight but complicate search for remains Fox News SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 Rain in the forecast starting Wednesday could aid crews fighting California's deadly wildfires while raising the risk of flash floods and complicating efforts \u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/rains-could-help-firefight-but-complicate-search-for-remains", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-d28f88f4e8a84896b4c6ddf2ba84b446.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T06:17:15Z", "content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif.

A Chinese flag flutters above the settlement, and a billboard at the entrance says, \"Welcome to the Hotan Unity New Village.\"\n\nThis is a Communist Party showcase for its efforts to tame Xinjiang province, the heartland of China's often restive Uighur Muslim minority and an unforgiving terrain. The free or low-cost houses are assigned alternately to Uighurs and Han Chinese, who work side-by-side in greenhouses and send their children to school together. It is the future the party envisions for Xinjiang after a massive security crackdown that has sent by some estimates more than a million Muslims to internment camps, and many of their children to orphanages.\n\nBut a closer look at what the party calls \"ethnic unity\" reveals what isn't there: mosques for Muslim worshippers, or traditional Uighur brick homes, often adorned with pointed arches and carved decorations. In their place are colorful murals of what authorities consider to be scenes of unity, such as a Uighur man and his family holding a Chinese flag.\n\nIn the village's new public square, Uighur children banter with Han Chinese children in fluent Mandarin, the language of the Han majority, rather than in their native tongue. Young Uighur women wear Western clothing without the headscarves that are part of traditional Muslim dress.\n\nWhile these are voluntary settlements with economic benefits, experts and Uighur activists believe they are part of an aggressive government campaign to erode the identities of the Central Asian groups who called the region home long before waves of Han migrants arrived in recent decades.\n\n\"'Ethnic unity' is a euphemism for taming, breaking the Uighur people,\" says Joanne Smith Finley, an expert in Uighur identity at Newcastle University in the U.K. \"This is putting flowery bright wallpaper over a damp wall, a rotting wall.\"\n\nConstruction of the village began in 2014 with a planned investment of 1.7 billion yuan ($247 million). The goal was to build 5,000 homes and 10,000 greenhouses, according to local reports, to turn a large swath of desert into farmland and create a shared prosperity among Uighurs and Han Chinese.\n\nAround the same time, the Communist Party came forth with a new strategy focused on ethnic mingling. Subsequently, at least one county offered financial incentives for Uighur-Han intermarriages, while others have launched programs encouraging Uighur families to move into Han Chinese residential areas.\n\nChina is building several such mixed settlements in Xinjiang. A similar village is under construction as a tourist attraction near Kuqa, around 600 kilometers (372 miles) from Hotan. A concrete yurt known as the \"solidarity farmhouse\" already has been completed, and a giant sculpture of a pomegranate is prominently placed at the center of the village to symbolize unity.\n\nIn Hotan, there are signs that the government's experiment is making inroads. Uighur farmers toil alongside Han Chinese to farm crops in what was once barren desert land, and both groups live in modern houses equipped with gas, electricity and water. A billboard displays a picture of President Xi Jinping and a group of Uighur elders joining hands and, according to the caption, \"linking hearts.\"\n\nYet there are also signs of enduring mistrust. As elsewhere in Xinjiang, high walls around homes are topped with barbed wire, and police officers stand guard from behind fences at the entrance of the village. Adults don't mix socially \u2014 at night, a group of Han Chinese dance in the square while the Uighur residents chat among themselves on the sidelines.\n\nA Uighur farmer who moved to the village last September says authorities provided him with free housing and utilities, two greenhouses, a small orchard with grapevines and a barn with sheep, chickens, and pigeons. But the crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang has made it risky for ordinary Muslims to discuss their religious practices, and when speaking to reporters in front of government observers, he insists he was never a Muslim. Another Uighur farmer in his early seventies, Muzitohtahon, says he is no longer a Muslim.\n\nUighur and Han villagers do seem united by at least one factor \u2014 their desire to escape poverty. Rural areas in Xinjiang, including Hotan, rank among the poorest in China, with many families lacking even the most basic utilities and food. The financial incentives are also a key draw for Han Chinese from other impoverished regions of China.\n\nLast May, 58-year-old Xiao Erying, who is Han Chinese, moved to this village from her hometown in the southern province of Hunan, over 4,000 kilometers away. \"It is better than our hometown,\" she says, as she rakes sheep, chicken and cow manure inside her greenhouse.\n\nFor 60,000 yuan ($8,700), her family bought a two-bedroom home with a small orchard and two greenhouses. The two grandchildren she lives with are given free tuition, school lunches, and even a free set of clothes. Xiao admits she doesn't speak Uighur and cannot communicate with her Uighur neighbors, but she says the layout encourages interaction.\n\nIn a greenhouse a few dozen meters away, Uighur Abudu Mijiti has just begun planting chili with his wife. He moved to the village three years ago to make a more stable living. Two of his three children go to the local school and are fluent in Chinese, he says, as a government minder looks on.\n\n\"For us, it's good, it helps learning our national language,\" he says. \"And because our next-door neighbor is Chinese, as we go in and out, it helps improve ethnic unity.\"\n\nOn the surface, the picture presented at the Hotan Unity New Village reflects the government's vision of an \"idealized place,\" says David O'Brien, an expert at the University of Nottingham.\n\n\"Every single part of it is the official narrative,\" O'Brien says. \"The narrative is, water will flow to the desert. The narrative is, if you come here great opportunity awaits you. The narrative that people will be secular, they will learn Mandarin.\"\n\nYet the settlement remains only partly inhabited. The city says there are 534 households in the compound, but most of the houses are empty. A drive through reveals rows of empty greenhouses and house after house with a sign that says \"sealed off\" patched onto padlocked or chained gates.\n\nUnder the sweltering desert sun, one Han Chinese farmer tending to her plot of Chinese chives complains that water is scarce and her previous batch of chives had to be thrown out. Even when the crops work out, the chives sell for less than one yuan (14 cents) per kilogram.\n\n\"Not even enough for food,\" she grumbles. \"You cannot feed yourself just working on greenhouses.\"\n\nIn the absence of government minders, the woman goes on.\n\n\"Ordinary people are not able to eat meat. The officials can, but not the ordinary people,\" says the woman, who declines to give her name out of fear of retaliation.\n\nAs dusk approaches and temperatures fall, residents slowly make their way out onto the streets to enjoy the evening breeze. On the Uighur side of the street, a young Uighur woman rests on an electric bike after a day's work, looking at her cell phone.\n\nAsked what she thinks of unity, she looks up.\n\n\"Unity?\" she asks. Silently and slowly, she shakes her head, and returns to her phone."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Edmund DeMarche", "title": "Tech CEO, wife, 2 kids found dead after arson fire rips through New Jersey mansion: report - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Tech CEO, wife, 2 kids found dead after arson fire rips through New Jersey mansion: report Fox News Authorities in New Jersey on Tuesday responded to reports of a fire at a sprawling mansion and found the remains of two adults and two children before\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/tech-ceo-wife-2-kids-found-dead-after-arson-fire-rips-through-new-jersey-mansion-report", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/20/694940094001_5969614402001_5969608805001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T05:36:56Z", "content": "Authorities in New Jersey on Tuesday responded to reports of a fire at a sprawling mansion and found the remains of two adults and two children before determining that the fire was intentionally started.

The Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign, also known as BDS, has claimed a number of successes in recent years, leading Israel to identify it as a major threat.\n\nIsraeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called on Airbnb to reverse what he called a \"discriminatory decision\" and \"disgraceful surrender\" to the boycott movement, vowing that Israel would retaliate.\n\n\"If you have a policy of discrimination against Israelis you cannot earn money in Israel,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nHe also said the government would encourage hosts in West Bank settlements to sue the company to make it \"pay\" for its decision. Levin added that Israel would impose other restrictions on Airbnb's operations in the country, without elaborating.\n\nAirbnb announced on Monday that it would delist some 200 properties in the coming days and cease its operations in Israeli settlements \"that are at the core of the dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians.\" The company declined to comment on the Israeli threats.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Today over 400,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, in addition to some 200,000 Israelis in east Jerusalem.\n\nMost of the international community considers settlements illegal and an impediment to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Israel sees the territory as disputed and says the fate of the settlements must be resolved in peace negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\nThe boycott movement, which calls for sanctions against settlement products and companies doing business in the West Bank, has made inroads in recent years, helping to tarnish Israel's international image and prompting it to take retaliatory measures.\n\nIsrael has enacted a law banning any foreigner who \"knowingly issues a public call for boycotting Israel\" from entering the country. It has identified activist groups from around the world whose members can be denied entry upon arrival.\n\nBDS supporters say that in urging businesses, artists and universities to sever ties with Israel, they are using nonviolent means to resist unjust policies toward Palestinians. Israel says the movement masks its motives to delegitimize or destroy the Jewish state.\n\nThe Palestinian-led movement claims responsibility for pressuring some large companies to stop or alter operations in Israel or the West Bank, including carbonated drink maker SodaStream, French construction company Veolia and international mobile phone giant Orange.\n\nAirbnb's decision coincided with the publication of a Human Rights Watch report Tuesday investigating tourist rental listings in settlements by Airbnb and Booking.com.\n\nEntitled \"Bed-and-Breakfast on Stolen Land,\" the report says that Israeli settlements' discrimination against Palestinians uniquely violates humanitarian law and Airbnb's nondiscrimination policy. Most Palestinians must obtain a permit to enter the settlements or Israel proper and typically do so as laborers.\n\nOmar Shakir, Human Rights Watch's Israel-Palestine director, said that with its threatened sanctions, Israel was prioritizing its support for settlements over a thriving tourism industry in Israel proper that relies on services like Airbnb. If applied, the sanctions could affect lodging costs for thousands of tourists expected to arrive in Tel Aviv next year for the Eurovision song contest.\n\nShakir said the government's response \"reflects the degree to which the government is willing to go, putting the whole country's interests at stake over its illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch, along with Palestinian officials and other rights groups, have for years pressured Airbnb to pull out of Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nSenior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat called Airbnb's decision an \"initial positive step,\" and urged the company to extend its decision to Israeli listings in east Jerusalem. The BDS movement echoed that sentiment in a statement on its website.\n\nFor settler hosts, who see their homes as an integral part of Israel, the decision triggered outrage and confusion.\n\nTsofiya Jacob has rented out her apartment in the Kfar Adumim settlement using Airbnb for the past year and a half to a regular rotation of European and American tourists. She advertises her rental on Airbnb as an \"escape from daily tumult\" in Israel, and doesn't mention that the property, complete with a Jacuzzi and desert views, is located in the West Bank.\n\n\"I see this (community) as part of home, part of Israel,\" Jacob said. \"I understand the sensitivities but despite that, in my opinion, we are here.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Benjamin Brown", "title": "FedEx driver will not be charged after fatally punching man who called him racial slurs: report", "description": "A FedEx driver will not face charges in connection to the September death of a Portland man whom he fatally punched after the stranger called him racial slurs, Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office announced Monday.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/fedex-driver-will-not-be-charged-for-fatally-punching-portland-man-who-called-him-racial-slurs", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/f2c27373-fedex-GETTY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T05:23:36Z", "content": "A FedEx driver will not face charges in connection to the September death of a Portland man he fatally punched after the stranger called him racial slurs, Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office announced Monday.

He argued that the crime scene was corrupted and that DNA evidence was suspect.\n\n\"This case is far from conclusive, and the jury's deadlock proves this,\" the Legal Aid Society, which helped provide defense for Lewis, said in a statement. \"The death of Karina Vetrano is tragic and our hearts go out to her family, but the rush to criminalize our client is not the answer nor is it justice.\"\n\nProsecutors said they'll move to retry Lewis, who is expected back in court on Jan. 20.

Lee Nam-hoon, an official from the gender equality ministry, said Seoul's Foreign Ministry plans to consult with Tokyo on what to do with the 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) Japan funded to the foundation that was formally launched in July 2016.\n\n\"After considering gathering diverse opinions over the 'Reconciliation and Healing Foundation' based on victim-centric principles, we have decided to push for the dissolution of the foundation,\" Gender Equality Minister Jin Sun Mee said in a statement. She said the ministry will continue to push policies to \"restore the honor and dignity\" of the sexual slavery victims.\n\nHistorians say tens of thousands of women from around Asia, many of them Korean, were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sex to Japanese soldiers.\n\nLiberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has been a harsh critic of the 2015 deal reached under his conservative predecessor, told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a meeting in September that the foundation was failing to function properly because of strong opposition by the victims and public.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are already at odds over a ruling by Seoul's Supreme Court last month that a major Japanese steelmaker should compensate four South Koreans for forced labor during Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II. Abe said Tokyo will respond \"resolutely\" to the ruling, which he described as a violation of a 1965 treaty between Seoul and Tokyo that restored diplomatic ties and was accompanied by more than $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nAt the time of the sex slave deal, Seoul said there were 46 surviving South Korean victims. But 19 of them since died. Twelve victims who rejected payment from the foundation sued the Seoul government over the deal in August 2016, saying it didn't go far enough to establish Japan's responsibility.\n\nLee, the ministry official, said the foundation had used 4.4 billion won ($3.8 million) in cash payments to 34 victims who were alive at the time of the 2015 deal and to relatives of 58 victims who were dead by then. Only 27 of the 240 South Korean women who registered with the government as victims of Japan's wartime sexual slavery are currently alive, Lee said.\n\nMany in South Korea believed the Seoul government settled for far too less in the sex slave deal and that Japan still hasn't acknowledged legal responsibility for atrocities during its colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.\n\nUnder the 2015 agreement, which was then described by both governments as \"irreversible,\" Japan pledged to fund the foundation to help support the victims. However, Japan said it didn't consider the 1 billion yen it provided to the fund as compensation, saying such issues were settled in a 1965 treaty. South Korea, in exchange, vowed to refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and will try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a statue of a girl representing victims of sexual slavery that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Bangladesh frees photographer facing charges of propaganda", "description": "An acclaimed photographer has been released from a jail in Bangladesh more than three months after he was arrested on charges of spreading false information about a street protest and propaganda against the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/bangladesh-frees-photographer-facing-charges-of-propaganda", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T03:07:16Z", "content": "DHAKA,Bangladesh An acclaimed photographer has been released from a jail in Bangladesh more than three months after he was arrested on charges of spreading false information about a street protest and propaganda against the government of Prime Minister Sheikh\u2026 [+1731 chars]", "fulltext": "An acclaimed photographer has been released from a jail in Bangladesh more than three months after he was arrested on charges of spreading false information about a street protest and propaganda against the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nPrison official Mahbubul Islam said photographer Shahidul Alam was released late Tuesday following an all-day wait after his family and lawyers provided the proper documents from the High Court that granted him permanent bail on Nov. 15.\n\nAfter his release Alam briefly told reporters that he expected a free-speech environment in the country. \"We expect that in independent Bangladesh, people will be able to speak freely,\" he said.\n\nAlam founded Drik Gallery and Pathshala South Asian Media Institute, which groomed many Bangladeshi photographers now working at home and abroad.

The strategy was aimed at independent voters who account for nearly four in 10 voters in the largely suburban district, and designed to overcome his built-in disadvantage in a district where registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by nearly 3-to-1.\n\nHe is an attorney who graduated from Columbia Law School and practiced in New York before returning to his home state of Utah. He has been a political figure in the state for a decade. He was elected as one of the few Democrats in the GOP-dominated state Legislature in 2008 and successfully ran for the Salt Lake County mayor's seat four years later.\n\nHe became known for working with the state's Republican leaders on issues like homelessness, where he backed a narrow Medicaid expansion to cover treatment and once went undercover as a homeless person when the issue reached crisis mode downtown.\n\nThough solidly conservative, Utah voters have long been uncomfortable with Trump's brash style and his comments about women and immigrants. That anxiety is especially pronounced in the suburbs of blue-leaning Salt Lake City, and McAdams' mayoral position gave him solid name recognition with voters.\n\nWATCH: COULD REPUBLICANS HELP PELOSI BECOME HOUSE SPEAKER?\n\nMcAdams said during the campaign he would not support California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker and insisting he'd be able to work with the president. He sharply criticized Love's support for the GOP-backed tax overhaul and said she had not been available enough to her constituents at town halls.\n\nHe has already signed a letter along with 15 other Democrats vowing to oppose Pelosi.\n\nLove pushed back hard, saying the tax overhaul has been good for people in Utah and defending her approach of meeting with voters in smaller groups, on the phone or online.\n\nThis is the second time Love was locked in a tight, drawn-out race for this House seat. In her first bid for Congress in 2012, Love lost to incumbent Democrat Jim Matheson by 768 votes. She went on to defeat Democrat Doug Owens in 2014 and again in 2016.\n\nFox News' Stephen Sorace and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Nicole Darrah", "title": "University of Maryland student dies from Adenovirus, 5 others sick, school says", "description": "A student at the University of Maryland has died after suffering from a strain of the Adenovirus, school health officials said.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/university-of-maryland-student-dies-from-adenovirus-5-others-sick-school-says", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/16/694940094001_5968106791001_5968101473001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:35:53Z", "content": "A student at the University of Maryland has died after suffering from a strain of the Adenovirus, school health officials said.
