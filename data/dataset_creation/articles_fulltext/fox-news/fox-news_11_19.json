McRaven has repeatedly criticized Trump over the president's description of journalists as \"the enemy of the American people,\" writing in February 2017 that those comments represented \"perhaps the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Sunday, McRaven stood by his criticism of the president.\n\n\"When you undermine the people's right to a free press and freedom of speech and expression, then you threaten the Constitution and all for which it stands,\" said McRaven, who also noted that he \"did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else\" in the 2016 election.\n\n\"I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for. I admire all Presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the Nation together in challenging times.\"\n\nFormer CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell criticized Trump's remarks about McRaven on Twitter Sunday, writing \"Correction needed to [Trump's] comment today that McRaven should have found bin Laden sooner. CIA did the 'finding.' McRaven\u2019s special operators did the 'getting.' They moved within days of President Obama giving the order.\"\n\nRobert O'Neill, who fired the shot that killed bin Laden in 2011, wrote Sunday that McRaven \"was born to lead this mission. I'll follow him anywhere. If only people heard the real speech he gave the Team ...\" On Monday, O'Neill added: \"The mission to get bin Laden was bipartisan. We all wanted to get him as soon as we could.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has his own fraught relationship with Trump, tweeted: \"I don\u2019t know if Adm. William McRaven shares my political views or not. But I do know that few Americans have sacrificed or risked more than he has to protect America & the freedoms we enjoy. His military career exemplified honor & excellence. I am grateful for his service.\"\n\nTexas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the nephew of former President George W. Bush, wrote: \"Having served in Afghanistan with Adm. McRaven, I have personally witnessed his patriotism & love of country. He is an American hero & has always served our country with honor. I\u2019m grateful for his service and sacrifices for our freedom.\"\n\nMcRaven also criticized Trump earlier this year when the president revoked former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance. In a letter published by The Washington Post, McRaven wrote that \"I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency.\"\n\n\"Through your actions,\" McRaven added, \"you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\"\n\nTrump returned to the subject of the bin Laden raid in a tweet Monday morning but did not name McRaven specifically.\n\n\"Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did,\" Trump said. \"I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center.

The manager was fired last week for refusing to make food for five black customers unless they paid in advance, saying they had failed to pay at the restaurant before. Tweets later emerged showing that at least one member of the customers had boasted about stealing and \"dining and dashing\" from restaurants in the past -- including Chipotle.\n\nSchalow sent the following statement: \"We have spent the last few days reviewing the evidence available to us regarding the incident in St. Paul, MN. Based on our review, we have offered our manager her job back. While our normal protocol was not followed serving these customers, we publicly apologize to our manager for being put in this position. We will work to continue to ensure that we support a respectful workplace for our employees and our customers alike.\n\nOur policy is to treat our customers and employees fairly and with respect at all times and under any circumstances. We will work with all our restaurant teams to ensure they are prepared to handle situations of this kind and know they have our full support. We are committed to doing the right thing and acting in a manner consistent with a thoughtful, fact-driven approach.\"\n\nOriginal story below:\n\nThe restaurant chain Chipotle announced Saturday that it had terminated one of its managers for suggesting in a viral video that five black customers were planning to order food without paying -- but on Sunday, the company acknowledged to Fox News that it was considering re-hiring the manager because her suspicions may have been well-founded.\n\nIn a series of video clips seen more than 3 million times on Twitter, a Chipotle customer in St. Paul, Minn., identifed as 21-year-old Masud Ali, and several friends are told by a manager: \"You gotta pay, because you\u2019ve never had money when you come in here.\u201d An employee adds, \"We're not gonna make food unless you guys actually have money.\"\n\nAs Ali and his friends complain about \"stereotypes,\" the videos show employees at the store claiming that the group had previously ordered food on two occasions without paying. The store manager also calls the police in the videos, which were recorded and uploaded by Ali.\n\nIn one video clip, the manager smiles and tries to ignore the men while they produce what appears to be cash, as proof that they can pay for their food. One of the employees visible in the kitchen is black.\n\n\"It sounded really racist \u2014 the way she said it was racist,\u201d Ali told Minnesota's Star Tribune newspaper on Friday. \u201cShe asked for proof of income as if I\u2019m getting a loan.\u201d On Twitter, Ali asked Chipotle: \"Can a group of young well-established African-American get a bite to eat after a long workout session?\u201d\n\nAli also posted the restaurant's phone number and address to social media. Within hours and under a deluge of criticism, Chipotle issued a statement implying that the manager had acted out of bias and announcing her termination.\n\nBut on Sunday, as tweets emerged showing that Ali had apparently made a habit of stealing from restaurants, Chipotle walked back its decision.\n\n\"Our actions were based on the facts known to us immediately after the incident, including video footage, social media posts and conversations with the customer, manager, and our employees,\" Chipotle Chief Communications Officer Laurie Schalow told Fox News on Sunday. \"We now have additional information which needs to be investigated further. We want to do the right thing, so after further investigation we will re-train and re-hire if the facts warrant it.\"\n\nDespite reports on Twitter late Sunday that the manager had received her job back, Chipotle confirmed to Fox News that \"nothing has changed from this morning. We are still investigating a few things.\"\n\n\"After further investigation we will re-train and re-hire if the facts warrant it.\" \u2014 Chipotle Chief Communications Officer Laurie Schalow\n\nIn a previous statement on Saturday, the company had said: \u201cWe are committed to treating all of our customers fairly and with respect. ... Regarding what happened at the St. Paul restaurant, the manager thought these gentlemen were the same customers from Tuesday night who weren\u2019t able to pay for their meal. Regardless, this is not how we treat our customers and as a result, the manager has been terminated and the restaurant is being re-trained to ensure something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent interviews, though, Chipotle representatives admitted that the manager might have been right in claiming that individuals in the group had ordered food just days before without paying once their order was completed. (As a matter of policy, Chipotle only provides food to customers upon payment, but store employees finish making orders before payment is requested at the register.)\n\n\u201cWe are not able to confirm that with 100 percent certainty,\u201d Schalow acknowledged in a statement to The Twin Cities Pioneer Press. \u201cWe asked Masud if he was in our restaurant on Tuesday and he said no.\u201d\n\nAnd almost immediately, it emerged that Ali had apparently spoken favorably of \"dining and dashing\" -- the practice of ordering food and not paying for it -- several times on Twitter in the past.\n\n\"aye man i think chopotle catchin up to us fam. should we change locations and yoooooo what should we do about the other thang,\" read a since-deleted post on Ali's account from 2016.\n\nIn 2015, he wrote that \"we finna goto Applebees and eat as much as we can and tip the nice lady 20cents and walk the f--- out.\"\n\nWhen another Twitter user objected, he replied that \"we're just borrowing the food for a couple hours\" as opposed to dining and dashing.\n\nLater that year, he opined that \"Dine and dash is forever interesting\" and discussed stealing Tabasco bottles from Chipotle.\n\nAnother post read: \u201cGuys we\u2019re borrowing food... that\u2019s it. And if the lady tries to stop you at the door don\u2019t hesitate to truck the sh-- out of that bi---.\u201d Ali has since deleted all of these posts.\n\n\"We finna goto Applebees and eat as much as we can and tip the nice lady 20cents and walk the f--- out.\" \u2014 Masud Ali\n\nAs those tweets surfaced over the weekend, Chipotle's media representatives, including Schalow, initially said that they had seen the tweets and would stand by their decision to fire the manager -- seemingly contradicting Schalow's statement to Fox News on Sunday.\n\nAccording to author Matt Palumbo, Schalow had previously claimed that the store's manager was justifiably terminated because she broke protocol by requiring payment before making the customers' food, regardless of her suspicions about the customers' intention to pay.\n\nPalumbo called Schalow's suggestion that Chipotle had not been aware of Ali's tweets when it fired the manager an \"absolute lie.\" (For her part, Schalow has reportedly said that other information -- and not simply Ali's tweets --was behind Chipotle's desire to reconsider the manager's fate.)\n\n\"The correct action to take would have been to make their food and not hand it over to them until they paid for it,\" Schalow had asserted as part of her justification for firing the manager, according to Palumbo.\n\nAli did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nThe episode follows several other high-profile incidents of alleged racism that have rocked the service industry. In May, Starbucks closed 8,000 of its stores for anti-bias training after two black men were arrested for trespassing in one of its Philadelphia shops. The store manager, who stopped working at Starbucks shortly after the episode, had called the police because the men remained seated in the shop without ordering anything, and refused to order something when asked.\n\nEarlier this year, a fired Chipotle manager who was accused of stealing $626 ended up winning nearly $8 million from the company in a wrongful termination suit."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "| Fox News", "title": "Fourth arrest in case of illegal immigrant who ICE says killed 3 after \u2018sanctuary\u2019 release", "description": "Prosecutors announced a fourth arrest Monday in the case of an illegal immigrant charged with killing three people in Missouri after being released from a New Jersey jail.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/fourth-arrest-in-case-of-illegal-immigrant-who-ice-says-killed-3-after-sanctuary-release", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/nyadia-burden.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:07:45Z", "content": "Prosecutors announced a fourth arrest Monday in the case of an illegal immigrant charged with killing three people in Missouri after being released from a New Jersey jail.

Built to symbolize an ancestor\u2019s spirit, the statue is believed to date back to approximately the year 1200.\n\nAround 900 statues, or moai, are dotted around Easter Island.\n\nEASTER ISLAND DISCOVERY: EXPERTS UNRAVEL MYSTERY OF ANCIENT STATUES\n\nHoa Hakananai'a was taken along with a smaller statue known as Hava, which was also given to Queen Victoria as a gift and is also in the Bristish Museum to this day.\n\nThe Rapa Nui want the museum to return the pieces.\n\n\"The British taking the moai from our island is like me going into your house and taking your grandfather to display in my living room,\" Anakena Manutomatoma, an island native who serves on Rapa Nui\u2019s development commission, told the BBC.\n\nEASTER ISLAND MYSTERY SOLVED: HOW HUGE STONE 'HATS' WERE PLACED ON FAMOUS ANCIENT STATUES\n\nRapa Nui sculptor Benedicto Tuki has offered to make an exact replica of the statue to take the moai\u2019s place in the British Museum.\n\nIn August, Rapa Nui mayor Pedro Edmunds sent a letter to the British Museum requesting the return of Hoa Hakananai'a, according to the BBC. A delegation from Rapa Nui is expected to arrive in London Monday to propose exchanging the moai for Tuki\u2019s replica.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is great value in presenting objects from across the world, alongside the stories of other cultures at the British Museum,\u201d said a spokesperson for the British Museum, in a statement emailed to Fox News. \u201cHoa Hakananai\u2019a is free to view in our Wellcome Trust Gallery and is among the most popular and most photographed exhibits with our 6 million visitors each year.\u201d\n\nEASTER ISLAND'S ANCIENT CIVILIZATION WAS NOT DESTROYED BY WARFARE, EXPERTS SAY\n\nOne of the world\u2019s leading lenders of artifacts, the British Museum has over 8 million items in its collection.\n\n\u201cWe are keen to work collaboratively with partners and communities across the globe and welcome any specific proposals and discussions around future joint project and research work. The British Museum has been in touch with representatives from Rapa Nui and will be pleased to host a delegation to visit to the Museum,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe very much look forward to this meeting and having an opportunity to have a discussion directly with the Rapa Nui community. The subject of the talks would involve taking the delegation to see Hoa Hakananai\u2019a and then discussing any future proposals they have.\u201d\n\nRapa Nui, which is located more than 2,000 miles off the coast of Chile, continues to be a source of fascination for historians. Researchers, for example, recently shed new light on why the ancient statues are placed along the island\u2019s coast.\n\nPART OF EASTER ISLAND MYSTERY SOLVED\n\nEarlier this year, experts also worked out how ancient islanders were able to place massive stone hats on the statues.\n\nIn 2016, research conducted on artifacts from the island questioned the theory that the ancient civilization there was destroyed by warfare.\n\nExperts studied hundreds of ancient items found on the shores of Easter Island. Previously, the artifacts were thought to be spear points, but analysis reveals that they were likely general purpose tools.\n\nEASTER ISLAND'S DEMISE MAY HAVE SURPRISING NEW EXPLANATION\n\nCarved from obsidian, or volcanic glass, thousands of the triangular objects, known as mata'a, litter the surface of the island.\n\nSome scientists have estimated that, at its height, Easter Island\u2019s population may have been as high as 20,000, but fell over centuries after the island\u2019s trees and palms were cut down to build canoes and transport its famous giant statues. One theory suggests that the deforestation led to soil erosion, impacting the island\u2019s ability to support wildlife and farming, and the collapse of its civilization.\n\nWhen the Dutch arrived at the island in 1722, its population was 3,000 or less. Only 111 inhabitants were living on Easter Island by 1877.\n\nHowever, other experts have questioned whether Easter Island ever supported a large population, citing instead the arrival of Europeans, who brought diseases and took islanders away as slaves.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Julius Young", "title": "Heather Locklear placed on psychiatric hold after paramedics called to her home - Fox News", "description": "Fox News Heather Locklear placed on psychiatric hold after paramedics called to her home Fox News Heather Locklear has been placed on another psychiatric hold after suffering a mental meltdown Sunday at her home, Fox News has learned.

Basic things like people showing up to their committee hearings, doing basic oversight, basic things like people actually reading the bills that they're voting on before they vote on it. I do think that until we find a way to fix the process that which Congress operates it's really not going to matter how many good people we get there. The process is going to continue to crush good, energetic, idealistic, next generation members who want to achieve good policy outcomes. (1:10)\n\nOn what he thinks can be done: The easiest and the most obvious would be to change the schedule. Really in the 90's we started this process of flying back and forth every weekend. That's crowded up a lot of time necessary to do basic oversight and legislative work. If you talk to people that were there at times when Congress was more functional they say the real negative consequences has been the loss of personal relationships they are able to development and in politics, as in every other endeavor in your life, you need personal relationships to get anything done. I think keeping us there for three weeks and then allowing people to go back to their district for one week would fix a lot of that. (3:12)\n\nOn the reaction to his piece: It's been a mix. The whippersnapper reaction those people aren't really coming up to me and talking to me. There's been a lot of colleagues who have come up to me and said I think this is a useful contribution to the debate. I think you're trying to get to some of the right things, but I disagree with your proposals. There's some members of leadership that said that. (5:30)\n\nOn how to make a fundraising better: The campaign finance component is probably the most difficult. I think even if you change the schedule as I advocated for if people were trapped in D.C. but still spent all their time raising money you wouldn't really have improved the discourse or reinvigorated the legislative process.

We look forward to continuing to cover the White House,\u201d CNN said in a statement.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also implemented a series of rules that will govern White House press conferences going forward.\n\nAccording to Sanders, the new rules are:\n\nA journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists.\n\nAt the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor.\n\nYielding the floor\u201d includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner.\n\nFailure to abide by any of rules may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist\u2019s hard pass.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful that a more elaborate and comprehensive set of rules might need to be devised,\" Sanders said.\n\nAcosta was spotted at the White House moments after CNN issued its statement. It was widely believed earlier Monday that the White House would again attempt to ban Acosta from the White House after legal threats were exchanged in a series of emails and court filings.\n\nAcosta\u2019s \"hard pass,\" which provides expedited access to the White House grounds, was suspended earlier this month after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a Nov. 7 press conference. Acosta then refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide and there was brief contact between the two. His hard pass was revoked later that day and CNN argued that it violated the network and Acosta\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly temporarily restored Acosta\u2019s credential. Later in the day, the White House sent the CNN reporter a letter informing him that a \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d was made that his credential would be revoked, once again, after the temporary 14-day order expires.\n\nThe attorney for CNN and Acosta claimed in a Monday court filing that the White House was attempting to punish Acosta based on \u201cretroactive\u201d application of rules that aren\u2019t written and requested a hearing for the week of Nov. 26. The request for an emergency hearing is now a moot point, as the White House will not seek to keep Acosta from covering President Trump.\n\n\u201cThe White House\u2019s interaction with the press is, and generally should be, subject to a natural give-and-take. President Trump believes strongly in the First Amendment, and a free press and is the most accessible President in modern history. It would be a great loss for all if, instead of relying on the professionalism of White House journalists, we were compelled to devise a lengthy and detailed code of conduct for White House events,\u201d Sanders said to conclude her statement.\n\nLast week, Fox News announced that it would support CNN\u2019s effort to restore Acosta\u2019s White House credential and filed an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.\n\nFollowing the temporary decision, Trump told Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace that he will kick Acosta out of press conferences if he \"misbehaves\" going forward.\n\nAcosta has emerged as a hero of the #Resistance after making a habit of shouting and interrupting when Trump and members of his administration are available to the media. The CNN reporter has also gotten into combative arguments with other members of the administration, including former Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller.\n\n\u201cThanks to everybody for their support. As I said last Friday... let's get back to work,\u201d Acosta tweeted.\n\nFox News\u2019 John Roberts contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Cristina Johnson", "title": "National Spokesperson For The RNC Kayleigh McEnany Talks Midterms", "description": "National Spokesperson for the RNC Kayleigh McEnany joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to discuss the aftermath of the midterms.

We gained two seats going back over eight decades the party holding the White House has only gained 8 seats in aggregate so it's a pretty big accomplishment to have gained two seats. We're very pleased with that. Of course, we're not pleased to have lost the House. It was well below President Obama's first midterm. He lost 63 seats. So, we're glad it wasn't quite that high, but nevertheless we want to walk with this and understand what we need to do better going into 2020. (1:24)\n\nOn people saying tax bill disadvantaged them: Much of this comes down to messaging because of course your state and local tax deductions. If your state just lowers the taxation in the state, California of course being one of the highest taxed states, then you no longer have to worry about having a state and local tax deduction because the problem lies with the state. That is the root of the problem after all. So we need to explain that. We need to explain it simply. (2:41)\n\nOn lessons to take away from Midwest results: One of the things I would point out as to why you're noticing those trends is that there is a difference between the Trump voter and the Republican voter. Our party historically has not done great among blue-collar workers. That changed with President Trump. He was the reason we won in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. It was a very unique appeal to this group of voters, but that doesn't always translate to the Republican voter. It's really important though that we now tie our party as the party of blue-collar workers. (6:29)\n\nOn suburban voters: We need to make a direct appeal to this community who has typically been a Republican voting community or group of voters. I think healthcare is where we're going to need to make some very convincing arguments. Second to that, I would also say this president is very committed to not just using these two years as laying duck years of divided government, but really engaging in bipartisan outreach to the left. (8:55)\n\nOn the President's tweets: When you get into that ballot box, when you go there to vote is it the President's tweets that are going to make up your mind or is it what has been done for over the last four years and what will be done for me in the next four years?

The figure of Leda being impregnated by the god in swan form was a fairly common home decoration theme in Pompeii and Herculaneum, another town destroyed in A.D. 79 by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius near present-day Naples.\n\nGRUESOME POMPEII DISCOVERY: ANCIENT CITY REVEALS GRISLY SECRET\n\nFollowing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, Pompeii was quickly buried by volcanic ash, killing about 2,000 of the city\u2019s residents, according to History.com.\n\nLeda is an important figure in Greek mythology. \u201cThe scene \u2013 full of sensuality \u2013 depicts the union of Jupiter, transformed into a swan, and Leda, wife of King Tyndareus,\u201d explains the Pompeii archaeological site, in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cFrom her embraces, first with Jupiter and then Tyndareus, would be born the twins Castor and Pollux from an egg (the Dioscuri), Helen \u2013 the future wife of King Menelaus of Sparta and cause of the Trojan War \u2013 and Clytemnestra, later bride (and assassin) of King Agamemnon of Argos and brother to Menelaus.\u201d\n\nIn Greek mythology, Leda\u2019s children were fathered by the god Zeus, the Greek version of Jupiter.\n\nPOMPEII DISCOVERY REWRITES VESUVIUS ERUPTION'S HISTORY\n\nPompeii archaeological park director Massimo Osanna praised this fresco as exceptional, since it was painted to make it appear Leda was looking at whoever saw the fresco upon entering the bedroom.\n\n\"Leda watches the spectator with a sensuality that's absolutely pronounced,\" Osanna told Italian news agency ANSA.\n\nThe fresco's details include a depiction of Leda protecting the swan with her cloak as the bird sits on her lap.\n\nMOUNT VESUVIUS CAUSED VICTIMS' HEADS TO EXPLODE, BLOOD TO BOIL: STUDY\n\nOsanna noted the fresco's context of the Greek \"myth of love, with an explicit sensuality in a bedroom where, obviously beside sleep, there could be other activities.\"\n\nThe fresco, with its colors still remarkably vivid, was discovered Friday during ongoing work to consolidate the ancient city's structures after rains and wear-and-tear in past years caused some ruins to collapse, the tourist site's officials said.\n\nThe site of the ancient city remained untouched for over 1,500 years until its rediscovery in the 18th century. During the 19th century, archaeologists used plaster to take casts from the vacuums that surrounded skeletons found in the compacted layer of ash. Left behind by the decay of organic remains, the vacuums offer an eerie snapshot of the victims\u2019 final moments. National Geographic notes the plaster casts\u2019 lifelike poses show some victims, for example, crawling, or seated with head in hands.\n\nDRAMATIC VOLCANO DEATH: HUGE FLYING STONE CRUSHED MAN IN POMPEII, ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER\n\nThe fresco is just the latest fascinating find at Pompeii. A scrawled piece of text on a wall in Pompeii, for example, is rewriting the history of the famous ancient eruption. The newly discovered charcoal inscription suggests that the eruption occurred in October of the year 79, two months later than previously thought.\n\nIn addition, archaeologists recently uncovered the undisturbed skeletons of a small group of people who took shelter from the devastating eruption of Mount Vesuvius. And earlier this year, images of a man\u2019s skeleton, apparently crushed by a rock during the eruption, went viral after their discovery.\n\nArchaeologists also recently unearthed the final resting place of an ancient racehorse among the ruins of Pompeii.\n\nEXTRAORDINARY POMPEII DISCOVERY: RACEHORSE REMAINS FOUND AMONG ANCIENT CITY'S RUINS\n\nA new study recently revealed that when Mount Vesuvius erupted, the intense heat caused victims\u2019 skulls to explode and their blood to boil.\n\nFox News\u2019 Chris Ciaccia and The Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers"}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Alexandria Hein", "title": "Vietnam War veteran goes for last motorcycle ride", "description": "A Vietnam War veteran was gifted one last motorcycle ride thanks to the work of his hospice care team and a retired police officer.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/vietnam-war-veteran-goes-for-last-motorcycle-ride", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/motorcycle_ride.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:24:17Z", "content": "A Vietnam War veteran could enjoy one last motorcycle ride thanks to his hospice care team and a retired police officer.

The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.\n\nSaudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians.

He also called for a humanitarian cease-fire around key aid facilities, delivery of humanitarian and commercial imports to all Yemeni ports and onward to their final destinations, and funding to pay Yemeni pensioners and civil servants.\n\nDavid Beasley, head of the U.N. World Food Program, visited Yemen last week and told the Security Council on Friday that as many as 12 million of the 28 million Yemenis \"are just one step away from famine.\"\n\nTo avert that, Beasley said, the international community must combine increased humanitarian funding with \"an all-out effort to restore the Yemeni economy,\" which has collapsed.\n\nThe draft resolution calls on Yemen's government with support of the international community \"to deliver a larger and faster injection of foreign currency into the economy\" and to expedite credit for traders and payments to pensioners and civil servants.

The Northeast Maglev team's own fact sheet shows that 51 million people live in the Northeast Corridor region, responsible for 20 percent of the country's jobs \u2014 numbers that are both expected to increase.\n\nThe first stretch of the project could cost between $10 to $12 billion, the Post reports.

Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx.\n\nTijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \"We are fleeing violence,\" said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \"How can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\"\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S.\n\nEdwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \"the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it.

Mason has not yet been charged.\n\nAuthorities had responded to a domestic violence call involving Mason at the home just after 9 a.m. Saturday, FOX8 reported. After stabbing Fraser, Mason fled the scene and crashed his car into a police cruiser before being arrested, officials told Cleveland.com. An officer sustained non-life threatening injuries in the crash and had to be taken to a hospital.\n\nThe 51-year-old previously pleaded guilty to charges of domestic violence and attempted felonious assault for attacking his then-wife in 2014. In that incident, police said Mason viciously choked, punched 20 times, slammed and even bit his wife in front of his two daughters, according to FOX8.\n\nFraser was so severely injured in the assault she needed reconstructive surgery on her face. She filed for divorce two days after the incident, Cleveland.com reported.\n\nMason was sentenced to two years in prison, but was only behind bars from Sept. 2015 to June 2016 before being released.

In 2011, Cleveland eliminated a box on its job applications to be checked by those convicted of crimes. He was terminated from the job on Saturday after he was taken into custody, FOX8 reported.\n\nHis estranged wife was a 6th grade teacher at Woodbury Elementary School in Shaker Heights, and news of her death drew an outpouring of grief from the community. The superintendent of the Shaker Heights City School District, Dr. Stephen Wilkins, called the killing a \"difficult time\" for the community.\n\n\"Aisha was a devoted mother and a longtime committed teacher to Woodbury students,\" Wilkins said in a statement. \"She touched so many of our children\u2019s lives and will be deeply missed.

Here are some highlights:\n\nOn CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta:\n\nTrump said CNN\u2019s White House correspondent was \u201cunbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee\u201d during a recent press briefing.\n\nAlthough a judge recently ordered that Acosta\u2019s revoked White House press pass be returned, if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" the president warned.\n\nOn acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker:\n\nTrump told Wallace he was unaware of Whitaker\u2019s past remarks about the Mueller investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia when he appointed Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice.\n\n\"I did not know that,\" Trump said, when asked if he was aware prior to appointing him that Whitaker had argued Mueller was coming close to exceeding his authority. \"I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\u201d\n\nOn GOP election wins in Florida:\n\n\"Look at Florida,\" Trump said. \"I went down to Florida. [GOP Senate candidate] Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot. I don\u2019t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end. And if I didn\u2019t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK? In my opinion he would have lost. They would have taken that election away from him. Rick Scott won Florida.\u201d\n\n\"Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot. ... if I didn\u2019t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK? In my opinion he would have lost.\u201d \u2014 President Trump\n\nOn North Korea:\n\nTrump told Wallace that former President Barack Obama had offered him some important guidance in the White House shortly after his 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI think North Korea\u2019s been very tough because you know we were very close. When I took that over -- President Obama right in those two chairs, we sat and talked and he said that\u2019s by far the biggest problem that this country has,\" Trump said. \"And I think we had real decision as to which way to go on North Korea and certainly at least so far I\u2019m very happy with the way we went.\"\n\nOn Saudi Arabia:\n\n\"You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia,\" Trump said. \"But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\u201d\n\nOn Pakistan:\n\n\u201cWe give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year . ... [bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we\u2019re supporting Pakistan, we\u2019re giving them $1.3 billion a year -- which we don\u2019t give them anymore, by the way. I ended it because they don\u2019t do anything for us, they don\u2019t do a damn thing for us.\u201d\n\nFinally \u2026\n\nTrump sounded a note of regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day.\n\n\"I should have done that,\" Trump said. \"I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know. ... I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this story."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Israel avoids early elections as coalition is kept intact", "description": "Israel avoided early elections after a key coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government said on Monday that he would not withdraw his party, keeping the coalition intact despite a crisis triggered by a violent flare-up with Gaza militan\u2026", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-avoids-early-elections-as-coalition-is-kept-intact", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/ContentBroker_contentid-184c48d2a4bf4ad08d76abe13c4e8ad7.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:47:23Z", "content": "JERUSALEM Israel avoided early elections after a key coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government said on Monday that he would not withdraw his party, keeping the coalition intact despite a crisis triggered by a violent flare-up with Ga\u2026 [+3414 chars]", "fulltext": "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nIsrael avoided early elections after a key coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government said on Monday that he would not withdraw his party, keeping the coalition intact despite a crisis triggered by a violent flare-up with Gaza militants.\n\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett said his hard-line, pro-settler Jewish Home party would give Netanyahu another chance to address the security challenges facing Israel, listing off threats from Gaza and Lebanon, among others, which he wanted dealt with more firmly.\n\n\"I tell the prime minister here: we are withdrawing right now all of our political demands and will stand to help you in this great mission of getting Israel to win again,\" he said.\n\n\"If the government would really start leading toward the right path, acting like a real right-wing government, it's worth trying,\" he added. \"The ball is in the prime minister's court.\"\n\nBennett had earlier threatened to resign and his about-face eased the most serious coalition crisis Israel's government has faced since it was formed in 2015. He acknowledged that the turnaround could hurt him politically, but said he felt it was in the country's interests to give Netanyahu one last chance.\n\nWhile the move put off early elections for now, it keeps the governing coalition on shaky ground with only a slim 61-seat majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament.\n\nThe sudden coalition crisis was triggered by a botched undercover Israeli raid in Gaza last week that led to the most violent fighting between Israel and Gaza militants since a 2014 war.\n\nIsrael's hard-line Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response to the massive wave of rocket fire, resigned in protest of a cease-fire that ended the fighting. Bennett threatened to bolt the government if he wasn't named defense minister, a post Netanyahu said Sunday he was taking over himself.\n\nNetanyahu has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party.\n\nBut in an impassioned speech Sunday announcing his new role as defense minister, Netanyahu sought to brandish his security credentials in the face of the criticism while pinning blame on his coalition partners for trying to force early elections during a sensitive time for Israel's security.\n\nHe repeated the claim Monday, saying it would be \"irresponsible\" to dissolve the government and call early elections amid a tense security situation.\n\nNetanyahu would have entered any campaign weakened by the recent Gaza flare-up but heartened by the lack of any real challenger to his leadership.\n\nMost opinion polls, including those after the crisis began, show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would grant him a place in Israeli history as the country's longest serving leader.\n\nAccording to polls, the political map would not change much from the current one, where one of Israel's most hard-line governments faces a fragmented opposition unable to pose a serious challenge.\n\nBut Netanyahu may find a challenge to his rule from other corners, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention.\n\nPolice have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another. The country has been eagerly awaiting the attorney general's decision on whether to press charges.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily dismissed the accusations against him, characterizing them as part of a media-orchestrated witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: German politician criticized over migration pact", "description": "The Latest on issues relating to migrants in Europe (all times local): 12:10 p.m.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-latest-german-politician-criticized-over-migration-pact", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:27:37Z", "content": "ISTANBUL The Latest on issues relating to migrants in Europe (all times local): 12:10 p.m. A contender for the leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right party is drawing criticism for suggesting a U.N. global migration pact should be put to\u2026 [+1433 chars]", "fulltext": "The Latest on issues relating to migrants in Europe (all times local):\n\n12:10 p.m.\n\nA contender for the leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right party is drawing criticism for suggesting a U.N. global migration pact should be put to party members and Germany could delay approving it.\n\nHealth Minister Jens Spahn said Sunday that politicians haven't done enough to discuss the non-binding pact, due for approval at a Dec. 11-12 meeting in Morocco.

The rebels say they had been excluded from that government and took power to rectify historic grievances against central authority.\n\nThe rebel leader, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a statement to journalists that the Iran-backed rebels ordered the cessation of rocket and drone attacks on the Saudis and forces loyal to coalition member the United Arab Emirates at the request of U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths.\n\n\"We are ready to freeze and stop military operations on all fronts in order to achieve peace,\" al-Houthi said, mentioning the rockets specifically as part of a longer statement in which he blamed the United States for being the main driver for what he called \"the aggression\" against Yemen.\n\nYemen's civil war began in the wake of its Arab Spring uprising, when the Houthis swept down from their northern stronghold and took the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, with the help of troops loyal to Yemen's former strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The government fled the following year, and Saudi Arabia, citing fears that its nemesis Iran was using the Shiite leanings of the revolt to make inroads on the Arabian Peninsula, began launching airstrikes against the rebels.\n\nRiyadh formed a coalition of Sunni Arab states, including the UAE, Kuwait, Egypt and Sudan, and launched ground assaults on several fronts but failed to take the capital. After some major setbacks, it began outsourcing the ground fighting to local troops, including a group trained by the UAE in the south.\n\nThe latest Saudi-led offensive, which began last summer, has been focused on capturing the key rebel-held port city of Hodeida, through which almost all of Yemen's food and desperately needed humanitarian aid flows.\n\nGriffiths, the U.N. envoy, announced on Friday that both sides had agreed to attend talks in Sweden \"soon\" aimed at ending the conflict.

That majority will allow Democrats to act and pass a wide range of initiatives next session. The question is will the Senate, which remains under Republican control, support any of them?\n\nThat question clearly looms large for Donald Trump. If the House impeached Trump would the Senate do the same? It is clearly a concern for the president, considering the series of moves he has made since firing former FBI Director James Comey. And his actions have only accelerated the weeks before and after the midterm election in an effort to protect him from impeachment.\n\nLong before the November 6 election, Trump has been focused on confirming judges. Eighty-four judges have been confirmed as a result, including two Supreme Court justices \u2013 the most recent and controversial choice being Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nTrump\u2019s appointment of conservative justices who are indebted to him for their new posts is an insurance policy that they will rule in his favor if Mueller\u2019s investigation should reach their court. Clearly, Kavanaugh is the ultimate goal-line stand in this respect. If any cases about the Mueller investigation reach the Supreme Court, it is clear Trump expects Kavanaugh to side with him. This is why many people believe Kavanaugh should recuse himself from any Mueller case before the Court \u2013 especially after his confirmation hearing left many unresolved questions, pointedly asked by Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and others, about his involvement in and knowledge about the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump did little on this from following Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, until he fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions less than 12 hours after all the polls closed on November 6, thus setting in motion a series of moves to protect him from the Mueller investigation and impeachment.\n\nTrump long complained about the fact that Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation and wasn\u2019t protecting him as a result. With reports of possible indictments coming, Trump took the first chance to fire Sessions \u2013 even going so far as to insist that he leave that very day. Within minutes of Sessions\u2019 firing, Trump installed Matt Whitaker, an unknown Iowa lawyer and Republican activist who had become Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, and is now the Acting Attorney General.\n\nLast but not least is the nuclear option: Fire Mueller. This option is the equivalent of mutually assured destruction in warfare.\n\nWhitaker, without Senate confirmation and with fewer qualifications, is clearly there to do one job: Protect Trump from the Mueller investigation. With hours of cable news appearances available as evidence that he would do just that, it is clear Whitaker opposes the investigation and has offered many ways to end it. For that reason alone he should recuse himself. Yet Whitaker has refused to do so and that suits Trump just fine.\n\nWhile Trump couldn\u2019t make any moves during the fall campaign without risking political backlash, he did spend weeks campaigning trying to win Republican Senate seats. And he didn\u2019t stop once the election was over. With the Florida Senate seat in a recount (it was decided Sunday in favor of Republican Rick Scott), Trump used his Twitter account to campaign for Scott just as he did during his visits to Florida \u2013 as if it were a life or death mission.\n\nWell, it just might be that. If there is a move to impeach Trump based on the Mueller investigation in the House, controlled by Democrats, then he needs to make sure there are enough votes in the Senate to reject it. Trump is clearly betting that the more Republicans there are in the Senate the less likely it is that he will be removed from office.\n\nThat is what saved Bill Clinton. The House voted to impeach Clinton but it was the Senate that acquitted him 55-45 in 1999. However, that would require virtually every Republican to reject the findings of the Mueller investigation. That may also explain why Trump is planning at least one campaign trip to Mississippi to make sure the controversial Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith wins her runoff election against Democrat and former Congressman Mike Espy.\n\nTrump is also now hedging his bets with the House by supporting Nancy Pelosi for Speaker. Or so he thinks. Trump clearly believes he can flatter his way into Nancy Pelosi\u2019s heart by promoting her as Speaker, even offering to round up Republican votes for her to make she sure wins the post.\n\nPelosi will be Speaker, as I wrote last week, without any votes from Republicans, let alone with help from Trump. Nor will she be persuaded not to impeach Trump based on his overtures. No, Pelosi will decide based on the facts and the evidence \u2013 as she and everyone else should.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more\u2026\n\nTrump is not only lobbying to make Pelosi Speaker, he\u2019s also lobbying for Republicans \u2013 Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio \u2013 to lead the GOP on the Judiciary Committee that will address the Mueller investigation and any impeachment hearings. Graham and Jordan have emerged as two of Trump\u2019s most fierce defenders. Placing them in leadership positions on the Judiciary Committee to derail hearings, squash evidence, and launch investigations of Democrats is exactly what Trump wants from them. They appear more than willing to oblige.\n\nLast but not least is the nuclear option: Fire Mueller. This option is the equivalent of mutually assured destruction in warfare. Trump would fire Mueller out of desperation \u2013 a last choice left on the table in an effort to postpone his fate in the investigation. But, postponing is not stopping. Firing Mueller would insure that Trump would set in motion a crisis that would engulf him, his administration, and likely accelerate his demise.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Trump won\u2019t do it. And doing so won\u2019t end the investigation or its findings from coming to light either. How that ends, no one knows.\n\nUltimately, all these measures and more won\u2019t be enough to save Trump if the investigation and the facts prove there was wrongdoing by the president and his associates. But don\u2019t underestimate the lengths Trump will go to save himself. And that means everything we have been through these last two years is nothing compared to what we are likely to go through in the days to come."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "William Sanchez", "title": "The Line Between Good And Evil", "description": "President Trump was interviewed by Chris Wallace on the Fox News Channel this weekend, and the two men discussed the death of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi along with America's response.

Britain has historically had a quick response to come to the aid of those suffering human rights abuses,\u201d Wilson Chowdhry, Chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA) told Fox News. \u201cBut a Christian mother of five who has been exonerated has not been offered asylum.\u201d\n\nUnrest began last month after Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court overturned the charges and acquitted the 53-year-old farmworker. Immediately, protestors flooded the streets led by leaders of extremist Islamist parties, who had long been screaming for Bibi to be taken to the gallows.\n\nAs fears for Bibi's safety grew, her husband Ashiq Masih urgently requested the U.K. \u2013 as well as several other governments, including the United States \u2013 to grant the mother and her family safe haven. However, the U.K. high commissioner in Islamabad is said to have cautioned that he would not be able to protect his staff if the request was approved. Thus, the asylum case did not move forward.\n\nWilliam Stark, International Christian Concern\u2019s Regional Manager for South Asia acknowledged that while there is \"a real threat to the embassies of the governments involved in helping Asia and those involved in the case,\" he was \"surprised\" the U.K. would take a back seat.\n\nThe Bibi case continues to trigger both debate and safety concerns for U.K. officials. Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Office permanent secretary, declined to give evidence on the matter in a public setting due to its \"sensitive\" nature after Conservative lawmaker Tom Tugendhat, the foreign affairs select committee chair, asked McDonald whether staff should be withdrawn, security increased or British policy was to be \u201cdictated by the mob.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been many advocates for Asia in the UK,\u201d continued Chowdhry, who has since created a petition calling on Western governments to take action, pointing out that a number of Muslim leaders have since been pushing to help Bibi, too. Several British imams last week joined the request from former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has been championing the woman's case.\n\nIn his letter of resignation to British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, the Conservative Party's now-former vice chairman Rehman Chishti emphasized that one of his reasons for stepping down was the \"manner in which the Government has dealt with the case regarding Asia Bibi.\"\n\n\"This is a case that I have worked on passionately since 2012 ... to ensure that justice is done which was handed down by the Pakistan Supreme Court only recently,\" he wrote. \"What I found shocking, is that the British Government is failing to put into practice the core values that our country stands for; religious freedom, justice, morally doing the right thing, and that when we see injustice where an individual\u2019s life is in clear danger and they have been persecuted for their faith, we do all we can to help them.\"\n\nIn Chishti\u2019s view, \u201cthe government should not wait to see if another country offers sanctuary, we should have had the conviction to lead on this matter and offer sanctuary ourselves straight away.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmid the turmoil, the Pakistani government has moved Bibi and her family from the jail they had been using as a safe house to an undisclosed secure location.\n\n\u201cMany speculate that Asia and her family have been moved to a military facility near Islamabad, but this has not been confirmed. It seems that the government is currently negotiating when Asia will leave Pakistan and where she will be granted asylum,\u201d said Stark. \u201cThe lives of Asia and her family are absolutely in danger. If released to the public, it is very likely that religious fanatics would attempt to kill Asia and her family. Even within the secure facility provided by the government, Asia\u2019s life could be in danger.\u201d\n\nChowdhry said what is most disturbing about the ongoing situation is videos that have emerged showing children play-acting at hanging Bibi.\n\nAsia Bibi, an impoverished minority Christian, was sentenced to death in 2010 after Muslim neighbors accused her of drinking from a contaminated a water jug, an offense viewed as blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThe charges against Bibi were always based on mob mania against blasphemy. There was never anything to the charges as the Supreme Court noted,\u201d contended David Curry, president and CEO of Christian persecution watchdog, Open Doors USA. \u201cThe protests are not surprising, but it is disappointing the Pakistani government hasn\u2019t moved swiftly to get her to safety. It is not clear to me why any free society wouldn\u2019t see fit to accept her. She has been the victim of a terrible injustice.\u201d\n\nAsia\u2019s blasphemy case has remained one of the most rousing religious issues in Pakistan for nearly a decade and has led to at least two high profile political assassinations. Salman Taseer, then governor of Punjab, was assassinated by his elite bodyguard who was influenced by religious fanatics.\n\n\u201cA similar assassination could be possible if Asia remains in Pakistan too long,\u201d Stark warned.\n\nAmong Pakistan\u2019s leadership, the matter also remains contentious. One Pakistan official conveyed some frustration at the situation as an example of the government purporting to do the right thing but being drawn into the fanatic rule.\n\nINFAMOUS PAKISTANI CLERIC KEEPS 'MARTYR' BIN LADEN LIBRARY, VOWS WORLDWIDE SHARIA\n\nPAKISTAN OPEN TO AFRIDI TALKS WITH US, FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS\n\nIn a call with Antonio Tajani, the President of the European Parliament on the matter last week, newly-installed Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan reportedly doubled-down on the government\u2019s resolve to respect the judgment of the Supreme Court and insisted that Bibi and her family are entitled to all rights. He is also reported to have expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about the issue of blasphemy abroad and accentuated the need for European countries to \u201cavoid such provocative incidents.\u201d\n\nAdnan Khan, Chairman of the U.S-based Council of Pakistan insisted that \u2013 contrary to reports \u2013 the Pakistan government has indeed \u201ccome down very hard on all protesters and the Islamist parties\u201d and resolved that no new charges would be brought against Bibi.\n\nAccording to the 2018 Open Doors World Watch List, Pakistan was the fifth most difficult country to live in as a Christian, trailing only Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan and North Korea.\n\nPakistan's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. However, in a statement earlier this month, the ministry denied reports that Bibi was banned from departing Pakistan and insisted she \u201cis free to leave the country.\u201d\n\nEven if Bibi could sneak out unscathed, to date she has nowhere to officially go. However, several sources tell Fox News that multiple countries, including the U.S., are working to ensure her safe exit from Pakistan.\n\n\u201cWe have been liaising with diplomats from a number of countries. In regards to the U.S., as we understand it America is working with many countries to ensure Asia Bibi\u2019s safety and the family\u2019s ultimate asylum in the West,\u201d Chowdhry added. \u201cBut in the meantime, Asia Bibi is under the auspices of a Pakistani security detail \u2013 we hope that an international security detail can assume these responsibilities.\u201d\n\nA State Department spokesperson could not comment on the matter but referred to a press conference in which officials reiterated their position that \u201creligious freedom is universal,\u201d and that the Bibi case has been closely followed.\n\nOnly the worse may be yet to come.\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely that we will see additional protests when it is announced that Asia has been allowed to leave Pakistan and seek asylum,\u201d Stark added. \u201cBut the important thing now is to keep the pressure on Pakistan to allow Asia and her family to seek asylum outside of the country. The Pakistani government will be under significant pressure from domestic extremists to reverse Asia\u2019s acquittal and execute her.\""}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Nicole Darrah", "title": "Brenda Snipes, embattled Broward County election official, to resign, report says", "description": "Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Florida's Broward County, has submitted her resignation, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported Sunday.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/brenda-snipes-broward-county-elections-supervisor-submits-resignation", "urlToImage": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/15/694940094001_5967305708001_5967308275001-vs.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T02:10:27Z", "content": "Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Florida's Broward County, has submitted her resignation, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported Sunday.

Snipes, a Democrat, has been elected to the role four times since.\n\nBut even Bush lost his patience with Snipes, calling for her resignation on Twitter last week after the recount turned into a fiasco.\n\n\"There is no question that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process,\" Bush tweeted. \"Supervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts.\"\n\nBRENDA SNIPES, BROWARD ELECTIONS OFFICIAL AT CENTER OF BALLOT STORM, HAS HISTORY OF CONTROVERSY\n\nSnipes was a notorious figure in Florida politics long before this year's election drama.\n\nEarlier this year, a state judge ruled that Snipes broke election law by destroying ballots in a 2016 congressional primary race involving Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz without waiting the required 22 months. Also in 2016, a medical marijuana amendment didn't appear on some Broward ballots, and again that year results from primary elections were posted on the office's website before polls had closed.\n\nA week after the 2012 election, about 1,000 uncounted ballots were suddenly discovered. And in 2004, about 58,000 mail-in ballots were not delivered, requiring workers to hurry to replace them.\n\nAFTER DRAMATIC RECOUNTS, MOST FLORIDA OFFICES BELONG TO REPUBLICANS\n\nJust last week, a Broward County judge found that Snipes had violated Florida open records laws by failing to quickly provide voting records to attorneys for Scott's Senate campaign.\n\nMore than 8.1 million votes were cast in Florida in the midterm elections. The state is scheduled to certify results in the Senate race \u2014 which incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson conceded to Republican Gov. Rick Scott on Sunday \u2014 on Nov. 20.\n\nFox News' Barnini Chakraborty and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Frank Miles", "title": "After dramatic recounts, most Florida offices belong to Republicans - Fox News", "description": "Fox News After dramatic recounts, most Florida offices belong to Republicans Fox News Florida's dramatic and controversial election season finally came to an end this weekend after races for U.S. Senate and governor went to Republican Gov.

Rick Scott and former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, respectively. The results mean that the Sunshine State has two Republican senators for the first time since Reconstruction and all but one of Florida's state offices are held by the GOP.\n\nThree-term Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson conceded to Scott on Sunday, drawing the hotly contested Senate race to a close after 12 days of legal wrangling. On Saturday, Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded to DeSantis in their own contentious race for the Florida governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nNelson gave up the fight on a day when Florida\u2019s 67 counties had to submit their official results after a sometimes bumpy recount. Those results showed the Democrat trailing Scott by approximately 10,000 votes. DeSantis' margin over Gillum was a comparatively comfortable 32,463 votes out of more than 8 million cast, according to the Florida Secretary of State's Office.\n\nScott will join Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in the upper chamber of Congress. When he is sworn in next year, it will mark the first time since 1875 that both senators from Florida have been Republicans.\n\nBoth races went to recounts, leaving the outcome in the balance for more than a week and giving residents and authorities unwelcome flashbacks.\n\nFlorida\u2019s history of election woes dates back to 2000, when it took more than five weeks for the state to declare George W. Bush the winner over Vice Presiden Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency. Back then, punch-card ballots were punch lines. Photos of election workers using magnifying glasses to search for hanging chads and pregnant chads symbolized the painstaking process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only state that has problems year after year,\u201d the 58-year-old Mark Toepfer said, shaking his head. \u201cWhy is it like this? Is it the people in charge? Are our machines not like other states\u2019 machines? Fraud? Incompetence? It\u2019s hard to say.\u201d\n\nAdd to this a litany of other voting problems: Palm Beach County\u2019s tallying machines went on the fritz during the recount due to age and overwork. The electricity went out in Hillsborough County during a machine recount and resulted in an 846-vote deficit. Broward County missed the state deadline to turn in recount results by two minutes.\n\nAs a judge recently put it, Florida is \u201cthe laughingstock of the world\u201d when it comes to voting.\n\n\u201cWe have we have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this,\u201d U.S. District Judge Mark Walker said in court on Thursday.\n\nThe melodrama wasn't limited to the gubernatorial and senatorial races. The race for state agriculture commissioner required a manual recount as well.\n\nResults posted Sunday showed Democrat Nikki Fried defeating Republican Matt Caldwell by 6,753 votes out of 8 million cast.\n\nIf the results are certified Tuesday, Fried will succeed Republican Adam Putnam, who was barred from seeking a third term and ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.\n\nWith Nelson's defeat, Fried would be the only Florida Democrat to hold a statewide office. Despite Fried's status as the lone holdout in a GOP-dominated state, her victory could have nationwide implications.\n\nUnder Florida law, the state's agriculture commissioner is the issuer and manager of concealed weapons licenses and conservative Republicans with A+ ratings from the NRA have held the office for a very long time. Following the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Democrats who back more restrictive gun laws seized the opportunity and spent a lot of money on trying to take this office. And they succeeded.\n\nTraditionally, those seeking to be agriculture commissioner have an extensive background in agriculture. Caldwell and Putnam both fit this mold, coming from a long line of family farmers.\n\nBy contrast, Fried is a Miami lawyer with no background in agriculture. She fought foreclosures during the housing crisis and made gun control and medical marijuana her top campaign issues. She promised to end the National Rifle Association\u2019s influence over the state\u2019s concealed carry program and has been quoted as wanting to \u201creform\u201d it, though it\u2019s unclear how or by what legal means.\n\nPrior to the Parkland shooting this past February, it would be laughable to think a politician such as Fried could become agriculture commissioner in Florida.\n\nThere were no such dramatics in the race to be the state's attorney general, which was won by Republican Ashley Moody, a former judge and federal prosecutor from the Tampa area. Moody defeated Democratic state Sen. Sean Shaw, who had never before prosecuted a case. Moody will succeed Republican Pam Bondi, who was barred from seeking re-election because of term limits.\n\n\u201cThe preparation for this role really began a long time ago, beginning with my father, a judge who taught me that the strength and resilience of our society hinges on a fair judicial system,\u201d the Republican told TCPalm. \u201cNot only a fair judicial system but one that is perceived as fair. And I will work towards that end every day as the attorney general.\u201d\n\nRounding out a triumphant evening for Florida Republicans, Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis won a full term by defeating Democratic state Sen. Jeremy Ring.\n\nPatronis was appointed by Scott in June 2017 to fill the remainder of Republican Jeff Atwater's term after Atwater accepted a job at Florida Atlantic University. The 46-year-old Patronis served eight years in the Florida Legislature before Scott appointed him to the state board that regulates utilities.\n\nFox News\u2019 Eben Brown and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "fox-news", "name": "Fox News"}, "author": "Nicole Darrah", "title": "North Carolina teacher killed by Mexican drug dealer, official says", "description": "A North Carolina teacher who disappeared last month during a vacation to Mexico was killed by a drug dealer, state officials confirmed.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-carolina-teacher-killed-by-mexican-drug-dealer-official-says", "urlToImage": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/Patrick-Braxton-Andrew.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T01:32:39Z", "content": "A North Carolina teacher who disappeared last month during a vacation to Mexico was killed by a drug dealer, state officials confirmed.

The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty wiped out the would-be touchdown and Harvard ultimately had to settle for a fourth-quarter field goal that put them up 31-27 at the time.\n\nOn the Crimson\u2019s next possession, Darrington again broke loose for 27 yards to the Yale 6-yard line. Two plays later, he took it in from the 4 to give Harvard a 38-27 lead. The sophomore back finished with 91 yards on nine carries with two touchdowns.\n\nHarvard's 45-27 win meant Darrington's penalty will go down as a footnote instead of an all-time gaffe in the series between the two Ivy League rivals.\n\nThat didn't matter to Crimson coach Tim Murphy, who improved his record against Yale to 18-7.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is: He was wrong,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cHe was wrong. It\u2019s that simple. It was the right call; he was wrong.

The 72 total points were the most ever in The Game between two of the nation\u2019s oldest and most prestigious academic powerhouses, surpassing the 33-31 Yale victory in 1993.\n\nHarvard's victory ended a two-game losing streak in the matchup against Yale.

I've been fully briefed on it. There's no reason for me to hear it\"\n\nThe president added that he knew \"everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it\" before calling Khashoggi's death \"very violent, very vicious and terrible.\"\n\nThe interview was broadcast one day after Trump vowed that his administration would \"be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday.\" It was unclear whether the document would be made public.\n\nThe Washington Post and other outlets have reported that the CIA had concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's death. A U.S. government official told Fox News on Saturday that no final assessment or conclusion relating to the crown prince's involvement had been reached, nor had a so-called \"smoking gun\" been found.\n\nTrump told \"Fox News Sunday\" that the crown prince, known informally as \"MbS,\" had told him \"maybe five times\" that he had no involvement in Khashoggi's death. When Wallace asked what Trump would do if he determines that the crown prince has lied to him, Trump said: \"Will anybody really know?\"\n\n\"He did have, certainly, people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved,\" the president added. \"You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But at the same time, we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\"\n\nThis past week, the administration penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing. However, lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nIntelligence officials have been providing information to Trump for weeks about the death, and he was briefed again by phone Saturday by CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he flew to California to survey damage from wildfires in that state. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders provided no details of his call but said the president has confidence in the CIA.\n\n\"The United States government is determined to hold all those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate. There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"The U.S. government has taken decisive measures against the individuals responsible, including visa and sanctions actions. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable who planned, led and were connected to the murder. And, we will do that while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nBefore his call on Air Force One, Trump told reporters that when it came to the crown prince, \"as of this moment we were told that he did not play a role. We're going to have to find out what they have to say.\" That echoed remarks by national security adviser John Bolton, who said earlier this week that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing do not think it implicates the crown prince.\n\nTrump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nTurkish :and Saudi authorities say Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}]
