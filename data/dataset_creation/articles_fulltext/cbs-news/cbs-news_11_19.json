But this season, two players have died of injuries sustained on the field. With a growing concern about concussions, more players are deciding the sideline themselves.\n\nHigh school senior Connor Ditka, No. 71, plays for the third-ranked high school football team in all of Pennsylvania. The sport hasn't been easy on his body.\n\n\"I've broken my left arm, broken both radius and ulna. I broke a bone, the scaphoid in my hand. I had two stress fractures in my back,\" he said.\n\nConnor and his younger brother Timmy, 16, have been playing football since the seventh grade. It's in their DNA. Their dad played, and their great uncle is NFL Hall of Famer Mike Ditka.\n\nDitka family\n\n\"We love football in this family. In fact, we had to convert [their mother] Sam because she was not a football fan, but if you marry into this family you have to be,\" said Anthony Ditka, the teens' father.\n\nBut this past summer, Timmy took a different route. Like an increasing number of American boys, he quit football. Timmy's decision was prompted by a serious injury on the field when he was just 12 years old.\n\n\"I get a phone call from the trainer saying, 'Your son has sustained a concussion on the field,'\" said Sam Ditka.\n\n\"I remember falling, hitting my head and being super dizzy,\" Timmy said. \"It was a delay in my thought process. Sometimes my eyes wouldn't follow as fast where I was trying to look.\"\n\n\"He was out for about eight weeks. We sat down and talked about it and he seemed really emphatic about wanting to get back to it,\" Sam said.\n\nWith a doctor's clearance and the promise that he'd stop if he got another concussion, Timmy got back in the game. But this year, he stopped for good, focusing instead on a less punishing sport.\n\nDitka family\n\n\"I had gone to nationals with my volleyball team. As my dad and I were in the airport on our way back, I looked at him and I said, 'I think when we get home I'm going to quit football. I just don't want to take that risk,'\" Timmy said.\n\nThese days Timmy isn't the only one choosing to watch from the sidelines. Nationally the number of boys playing high school football has dropped by roughly 72,000 since 2009, a 6.5-percent decrease, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.\n\nArt Walker has been the head football coach at North Allegheny for 14 years. He said the size of his team \u2014 roughly 80 players \u2014 is down 25 players compared to six years ago.\n\n\"My son is a sophomore and he's the smallest member of our football team out of 82 kids. He's the smallest one there is. I'm comfortable because of how my coaches teach them how my coaches coach them and not put players in dangerous situations that they don't have to be in,\" Walker said.\n\nGoing into the conference semifinal game, Connor's team was undefeated. He said he wishes he could have his brother playing with him.\n\n\"I would have liked to have gone at least one year playing with him. It was a decision that was completely his own,\" Connor said.\n\nBut when he sees how aggressive it can be, Timmy said he thinks to himself, \"I'm happy that i'm not hurt.\"\n\nConnor's team lost, ending their season, and he was injured in one of the final plays. The next morning, X-rays confirmed a broken hand, a reminder of the toll football can take.\n\n\"I did not ever think twice,\" Connor said. \"I always wanted to just get back as soon as possible. I wouldn't miss it for anything.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Meg Oliver", "title": "Frantic search underway for Camp Fire victims' remains before rain washes away DNA", "description": "Search teams are combing through twisted metal, trying to find mattresses or bathtubs where people might have taken cover", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-camp-fire-search-intensifies-for-victims-before-rain-washes-away-dna/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/3ffa5785-f0f9-4a8e-8859-2c36db3712af/thumbnail/1200x630/01587eb83a4aa479fbc0cb8fba2176b5/gettyimages-1063402066.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:35:59Z", "content": "PARADISE, Calif. \u2014 Rain is expected on Wednesday in Northern California, bringing relief but also the potential for mudslides.

But even though they're planning to spend more, they're still seeking a bargain. Almost nine of 10 say they're looking for deals on holiday gifts, the retail coupon site said in a study.\n\nAs consumers plan their shopping strategies for Friday, they may want to educate themselves on retail trends to make sure they aren't missing out on a deal -- or overpaying for their gifts. Contrary to popular opinion, the best values aren't always available on Black Friday. But at the same time, waiting too long raises the risks of encountering out-of-stock products.\n\n\"The timing of the calendar plays a role in when and where consumers do the bulk of their holiday spending,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry adviser of NPD Group, in a statement. \"It's up to retailers to make the most of the days on the calendar by delivering the promotional value, product offerings, and shopping experience that the consumer desires.\"\n\nBut consumers also need to do their research. Here are five surprises experts say shoppers should be aware of when making their plans for Black Friday.\n\nBest place to buy Amazon devices may not be Amazon\n\nIf you're looking for an Amazon Echo or another Amazon device, the best option may not be Amazon itself. That's because Kohl's is offering many of the devices for the same Black Friday price as Amazon, with the addition of $15 back in Kohl's Cash when consumers spend at least $50. Kohl's Cash is a coupon that lets you spend its face value on store merchandise.\n\nFor instance, the Echo will be sold for $69 at both Amazon and Kohl's Black Friday sales, but Kohl's will also provide a $15 Kohl's Cash coupon.\n\nThere are some caveats, said Sarah Hollenbeck, shopping and retail expert at Blackfriday.com.\n\n\"One thing to keep in mind with the Kohl's Cash is that the deal is valid only through Dec. 5, so shoppers should make sure they have plans to spend it quickly,\" she said.\n\nThe other issue to keep in mind is that Amazon is offering an Amazon Smart Plug -- a device that works with Amazon's voice assistant Alexa to add voice control to outlets -- for $5 when shoppers buy an Echo device. The smart plug normally retails for about $25.\n\n\"If you're in the market for a smart plug, that could be a better \"extra\" with your Echo purchase than soon-to-expire Kohl's cash,\" Hollenbeck noted.\n\nFor some products, it pays to wait until after Black Friday\n\nSome products get cheaper closer to Christmas day, which means you may not find a great bargain on Black Friday. Toys are a prime category where it pays to wait until the week before Christmas, when prices may be slashed by as much as 50 percent, according to NerdWallet.\n\nOther categories where patience pays are Christmas decorations, bedding (bargains can be found in January) and winter clothing, NerdWallet said.\n\nIn-store pickup and shipping: Do your research\n\nEveryone wants a deal on shipping -- whether that's free shipping or arranging for in-store pickup, which can avoid the hassle of competing with crowds for doorbuster or other sales. But it's important to understand that in-store pickups have some limits.\n\nAt Macy's, for instance, in-store pickup may apply only to what's in stock in a particular location, rather than the retailer's entire inventory. In-store pickup is also cheaper for retailers than offering free shipping.\n\nAnd speaking of free shipping, not every retailer is offering it this year, which means shoppers should do their research before clicking on \"ship to me.\" Macy's offers free shipping for orders over $99 -- but otherwise charges $10.95 for delivery in the continental U.S.\n\nBeware of out-of-stock products\n\nWith a jump in demand, some stores may sell out of inventory. For instance, stores may report being out-of-stock on some electronics like computers, tablets and TVs starting on Thanksgiving Day, according to an analysis from Adobe. Appliances like kitchen mixers could potentially go out of stock on Nov. 25, while apparel is at risk of selling out on Cyber Monday, which is a popular day for clothing sales, it added.\n\nDon't forget \"experiential\" gift deals\n\nConsumers increasingly want \"experiential\" gifts, like bottles of wine, food or event tickets, according to NPD, which found that four of 10 consumer said they would give these types of gifts this year.\n\nThat means consumers shouldn't overlook deals from subscription services like Amazon's Audible or travel deals. For instance, what's termed \"Travel Deal Tuesday\" -- Nov. 27th -- is one of the best days of the year to buy airline tickets, according to analysis site Hopper.\n\nIt's forecasting that tickets to London will be available at a 41 percent discount from their typical price. Airlines such as Icelander and Cathay Pacific are also planning to offer deals on the 27th, Hopper said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Child with special needs comforted by Winnie the Pooh at Disney World", "description": "An 18-month-old boy with special needs was comforted by Winnie the Pooh at Disney World and the boy's mom said the moment melted her heart", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/child-with-special-needs-comforted-by-winnie-the-pooh-at-disney-world/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/5c6dff7d-089f-4b2c-bfb3-88bd9342a625/thumbnail/1200x630/a850ceb6e78c7e32252bbc4127fb6bec/winniethepooh-1715828-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:08:37Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Kathy Kristof", "title": "Bumped from a flight?

The airline could be forced to pay you a small fortune for the transgression, said Johnny Quach, chief product officer of AirHelp, a company that claims compensation for disrupted travelers. \"Americans being denied boarding is one of our bigger markets. The payouts are quite high,\" he said.\n\nInvoluntarily bumped\n\nSpecifically, If you're denied boarding on a domestic U.S. flight because the airline overbooked the plane and wasn't able to convince enough passengers to \"volunteer\" to take another flight, you can be eligible for compensation of up to $1,350. The exact amount depends on the value of your ticket and ultimate delay in arrival to your final destination.\n\nFor instance, if the flight you're rebooked on arrives within two hours of the previous flight's planned arrival, you can be compensated up to 200 percent of the cost of your one-way ticket to a maximum of $675. If the new flight gets you to the destination more than two hours after the planned arrival, you could be entitled to up to four times the cost of your one-way ticket, or $1,350, whichever is less.\n\nLuggage delayed, damaged or lost\n\nIf the airline also loses your bags \u2014 perhaps because they got to the destination on the original flight, unlike you \u2014 the airline could owe you even more.\n\nAccording to the Montreal Convention, which governs flights in 120 participating countries including the U.S., passengers whose luggage is lost, damaged or delayed can be due as much as 1,131 in \"special drawing rights.\" This airline-only currency trades just like other country currencies. On Nov. 19, the value of one SDR was $1.38 U.S. dollars. So the maximum value of a lost, delayed or damaged bag would be $1,560.\n\nIf the items in your bag are worth more, you could potentially get higher compensation. However, you would have had to notify the airline when you checked your bags, and the airline could have imposed a fee for additional baggage insurance.\n\nWhat if the bag was just delayed? You can ask the airline to compensate you for the items you had to replace while you were waiting.\n\nFlight delays\n\nWhether you're due compensation simply because your flight gets delayed depends on where you're going to and coming from, and the reason for the delay.\n\nIf a delayed results from the weather, no compensation is due. Airlines aren't required to compensate passengers for flight delays and cancellations that are outside of the airline's control.\n\nIf a flight is delayed because of an airline mess-up, what you're due depends on your destination and your airline. Most carriers publish their \"conditions of carriage\" online. If you check American Airlines' conditions, for instance, they note that the airline will try to get you to your destination as soon as possible, even if that means booking you on a competing airline.\n\nIf the airline has no other flight for you, and you're going to be waiting past midnight, it says it will pay to put you up in a hotel.\n\nIf you can't wait for the next flight and need to find another way to get to your destination, the airline will generally refund that portion of your ticket, and it may compensate for your additional costs, such as the cost of booking passage on a train or renting a car.\n\nInternational flights\n\nHowever, if your flight starts in the European Union or is on an EU carrier, the rules are governed by law called EU-261. This law demands compensation for both bumped and delayed passengers, if they're delayed longer than three hours. The exact compensation varies based on the length of the flight and the duration of the delay. Shorter delays are due up to 250 euros (about $287 at current conversion rates). Longer delays can generate compensation of up to 600 euros ($690).\n\nNotably, EU-261 allows passengers to claim compensation up to three years after the flight. So if you didn't know your rights when you were delayed in the past, you may still have a chance to get payment, Quach added.\n\nClaiming compensation\n\nHow do you claim compensation? You have two options \u2014 go it alone or hire someone.\n\nThose who choose the do-it-yourself option should start with the airline's customer service line. The representative should be able to explain what documents are necessary and direct you to the specific area on the airline's website to submit a claim.\n\nSeveral services, including ClaimCompass and AirHelp, will file a claim for you. These services typically don't charge anything to initiate a claim. However, if they're able to secure a refund, they'll take a portion of it as their fee. AirHelp, for example, charges 25 percent of the refund amount for standard claims. But if it needs to file an appeal for a denied claim, it could charge up to 50 percent of the refunded amount.\n\nWhy would the service need to file an appeal? A lot of claims are unjustly denied, partly because the airlines don't keep good records of why flights were delayed or canceled, Quach said. AirHelp uses computerized records to track weather patterns and other airline delays from the same airports. If your airline was the only one delayed from a particular region, chances are good that the delay was within the airline's control, and AirHelp would likely appeal a denial."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Honey-filled pacifiers linked to cases of botulism", "description": "Four infants in Texas were treated for botulism after being given a honey-containing pacifiers purchased in Mexico", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/officials-warn-honey-filled-pacifiers-infant-botulism/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/13821ad9-9f09-4015-be0c-b2c8ac17f76e/thumbnail/1200x630/f7fca6a4d7d9e10b67f9c38882a73adc/pacifier-getty-istock.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:02:49Z", "content": "TEXAS \u2014 After four infants in Texas were treated for botulism, the Texas Department of State Health Services is warning parents and other adults not to give babies pacifiers containing honey.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics have long advised that children under 12 months old should not consume honey.\n\nDoctors say by the time children reach their first birthday, they've developed enough other types of bacteria in their digestive tract to prevent the botulism bacteria from growing and producing toxin.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Texas Department of State Health Services, honey-filled pacifiers are not commonly sold in the United States, but might be available in some specialty stores and online retailers. Although most of the products are not designed for the honey to be consumed, some have reportedly had a small hole allowing the child to eat the honey, or the pacifier could accidentally rupture or leak.\n\nParents should also avoid pacifiers containing any other food substance, because they could also pose a risk of botulism, the health department said.\n\nBotulism is rare, with just 205 cases reported cross the U.S. in 2016, according to the CDC; 150 of those cases were in infants under 10 months old."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Doctor and runner reunite after he saved her life during New York Marathon", "description": "A runner had a heart attack at mile 16 of the New York Marathon, just as a doctor fatefully ran by.

It's here that insurers, environmentalists and venture capital firms are joining forces to create a \"Forest Resilience Bond\" aimed at solving a multibillion-dollar problem plaguing the wildfire-ravaged state.\n\nNearly 100 people have died and 1,000 are unaccounted for from the two most recent mega-fires, both of which remain active. And in what the Association of International Fire Chiefs now calls \"a year-round fire season\" for this and other tinderbox states, more destructive blazes are all but a certainty.\n\nOne major factor behind the fires: an overabundance of dry brush from a seven-year drought and millions of dead trees from an influx of bark beetles \u2013 none of which is cleared away until a campfire spark or downed power line ignites these fuel-rich forests. Meanwhile, the money budgeted for forestry conservation or to hire more firefighters often pays instead for paramilitary equipment, such as airplanes and helicopters.\n\nFunding for forests\n\nEnter Blue Forest Conservation. The startup, launched by University of California, Berkeley business school graduates and backed by the World Resources Institute, works to raise money to save the forest through a public-private partnership. To do so, it created the first \"Forest Resilience Bond.\"\n\n\"There are 58 million acres of forest at high risk of wildfire in the U.S.,\" said Linc Walworth, vice president of investments for CSAA Insurance Group, one of the bond's backers. \"If the concept works, there will be lots of opportunity for forest restoration bonds, and they could become a permanent source of financing for our forests.\"\n\nA $4 million bond is small relative to the massive economic losses caused by infernos such as the \"Camp Fire\" in Northern California and the \"Woolsey Fire\" around Los Angeles, but it could be seed money for what is to come. Blue Forest's goal is to shift the financial burden of preventing fires from the state's overtaxed fire and forestry services to private industry. The California fire agency has already exhausted its $443 million budget and needs another $234 million to continue the fight.\n\nThe bond works by tapping private capital to maximize forest restoration without stressing the already overtaxed state budget. CSAA, along with an investment firm and two foundations, will fund the investment. The National Forest Foundation will use the bond to hire private contractors to \"thin\" the forests by cutting down trees, perform \"controlled burns\" and trim brush that could fuel fires in the 15,000-acre Tahoe Forest above the Yuba River.\n\nThe money will be repaid over five years by the Yuba Water Agency, a public utility, and though a grant from California. The utility benefits from cleaner water. Its hillsides, ravaged by fire erosion, are also prone to flooding because scorched soil lets water flow downhill unimpeded. The state benefits because the work will be done in less than half the time it would take the state forest service to do it.\n\nForest resilience bonds could also amount to a good deal for investors. CSAA will provide $1 million, while The Rockefeller Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and a unit of Calvert Investments (a fund known for so-called responsible investing), will contribute the rest. They will realize a 4 percent return on their investment, better than the 3 percent from an average bond.\n\nGetting insurers on board\n\nAs an American Automobile Association insurer, in theory CSAA will get an additional bonus: fewer payouts on property claims from fire damage.\n\nInsurers will have to pay an estimated $13 billion this year to repair and replace homes and businesses burned in the California fires. As a result, Walworth said it makes sense for big property insurers to get involved once they see that the small pilot program works. \"If a market develops for these types of bonds, we think other insurers will see the benefit in making similar investments,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017, California set a state record, with more than 9,000 fires torching 1.4 million acres, burning down 10,000 homes and killing 47 people. This year will be much worse, topping all previous statewide disaster costs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who visited the fire-ravaged state on Saturday, has been critical of its forest management, even threatening to withhold federal funds. \"They should take a lesson from Finland, where they do a lot of raking and cleaning\u2026 and they don't have this problem,\" he said in visiting Paradise, California, a town devastated by the Camp Fire.\n\nSo does it make sense for big insurers like Allstate, Geico and State Farm, which have billions invested in California, to help underwrite bonds or other investments meant to fund the protection of forests? As of year-end 2017, the property casualty insurance industry's \"policyholders' surplus\" \u2013 the amount of money available to pay claims \u2013 reached an all-time high of $752.5 billion, up more than $50 billion from the year earlier and at its strongest level in history.\n\n\"The industry is extremely well capitalized and financially able to pay very large-scale losses in 2018 and beyond,\" according to a statement by the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the industry.\n\nOr, as Blue Forest suggests, it could join forces with other private investors and \u2013 just possibly \u2013 cut those losses."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "William Harwood", "title": "NASA selects landing site for Mars 2020 rover", "description": "NASA's Mars 2020 rover will land on an ancient lakebed near a broad delta in Jezero Crater to search for traces of life", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-selects-landing-site-for-mars-2020-rover-jezero-crater/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/c8e080bb-601b-40c9-bd54-ad87b615f1fb/thumbnail/1200x630/fa05a97b1a04bb2362a1f524a05b7cca/mars2020.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:13:37Z", "content": "After years of analysis and debate, NASA announced Monday that the agency's next Mars rover will land near an ancient river delta where water once flowed into a 30-mile-wide, 1,600-foot-deep crater.

The technologies that we prove here feed forward into a program that gets ever more exciting.\"\n\nNASA\n\nThe landing site announcement came one week before NASA's non-roving InSight lander, launched last May, touches down on Mars next Monday to study the planet's interior structure by placing an ultra-sensitive seismometer on the surface and hammering temperature sensors into the crust.\n\nModeled after NASA's hugely successful Curiosity rover, which landed in Gale Crater in August 2012, the Mars 2020 rover will weigh roughly the same, about one ton, feature the same nuclear power pack and use the same dramatic \"sky crane\" entry, descent and landing system in which a rocket-powered carrier lowers the rover to the surface on a tether.\n\nThe 2020 rover originally was projected to cost around $1.9 billion, some $600 million less than Curiosity. It now is expected to cost roughly the same.\n\nBut the new rover features different instruments and a major upgrade known as terrain relative navigation. As it descends toward the martian surface, the system will assess the surface below and actively guide the spacecraft to avoid hazardous cliffs, boulders or \"sand traps\" that could prove difficult to drive through.\n\nThe Jezero Crater landing site features all three.\n\nSe\u00e1n Doran based on NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter imagery\n\n\"This selection is dependent upon additional and extensive analysis of ... terrain relative navigation, or TRN,\" Zurbuchen said. \"It is the first time we use this system integrated with the entry, descent and landing process. We're really excited about it. TRN will enable the sky crane descent stage, the rocket powered system that carries the rover down to the surface, to avoid hazardous areas.\"\n\nAn independent review board will assess the landing system and report to NASA in the fall of 2019, \"not because we have any doubt about using TRN,\" Zurbuchen said, \"but to be absolutely sure we're ready to go with this exciting technology.\"\n\nPlanetary scientists began debating possible landing sites for the Mars 2020 rover five years ago, whittling down a list of more than 60 candidate sites to just four. After a final round of discussions last month, Zurbuchen selected Jezero, a 30-mile-wide, 1,600-foot-deep crater at 18 degrees north latitude.\n\nBased on imagery and other data collected by Mars orbiters, scientists believe the crater was filled with an 820-foot-deep lake between 3.5 billion and 3.9 billion years ago. The lake was fed by a river that flowed into and then out of the crater, leaving a distinct delta fanning out across the terrain.\n\n\"Lakes on Earth are both very habitable and inevitably inhabited, so that's the first attraction,\" said Ken Farley, Mars 2020 project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"The second attraction is a delta is extremely good at preserving biosignatures, any evidence of life that might have existed in the lake water or at the interface between the sediment and the lake water.\"\n\nThe delta also could preserve evidence of microbial life that originated outside the crater and was carried in by the river that fed the lake.\n\n\"So the delta is a good place for evidence of life to be deposited and then preserved for the billions of years that have elapsed since this lake was present,\" Farley said.\n\nBut he cautioned the spacecraft will not look for signs of present life \"because currently, the surface of Mars is too cold, it's too dry and it has too much radiation for life as we know it to survive.\"\n\n\"But it wasn't always that way,\" he said. \"For reasons that are not yet known, prior to about three-and-a-half billion years ago, Mars' climate was very different, there was clearly flowing water on the surface of the planet.

Obeidallah, a comedian and Daily Beast columnist, told The Associated Press that he received death threats after the article's publication.\n\nObeidallah's attorneys are asking for the court's authorization to subpoena financial records from three banks that Greg Anglin used to funnel donated money to his son.\n\nAndrew Anglin hasn't formally responded to Obeidallah's lawsuit, which says Anglin libeled him, invaded his privacy and intentionally inflicted \"emotional distress.\"\n\nObeidallah's attorneys from Muslim Advocates, a national legal and educational organization based in Oakland, California, are trying to secure a default judgment against Andrew Anglin and his company, Moonbase Holdings LLC. The records for the Anglins' bank accounts are necessary for calculating \"appropriate damages\" if the court enters a judgment in Obeidallah's favor, his lawyers wrote.\n\nAnglin's site takes its name from Der St\u00fcrmer, a newspaper that published Nazi propaganda. The site includes sections called \"Jewish Problem\" and \"Race War.\"\n\nOne of Obeidallah's lawyers asked Greg Anglin about the content of his son's website and why he helped him get its domain name registered in 2013.\n\n\"I have a difficult time as a dad sometimes knowing what to support and what not to support. I don't take responsibility for somebody else's actions,\" said Greg Anglin, according to a transcript of the deposition.\n\nAndrew Anglin has received other financial support beyond the cash and checks that readers mailed to his father's Worthington, Ohio, office and an Ohio post office box. He has solicited donations in bitcoin. He also used a crowdfunding website to raise more than $152,000 in donations to help pay for his legal expenses.\n\nDuring his deposition, Greg Anglin said he collected the mailed donations from 2013 to December 2017 and usually deposited the funds into a bank account in his son's name. If the money was foreign currency, he would deposit the money in his own account at another bank and then wrote a check for the same amount and deposit it in his son's account.\n\nGreg Anglin also said he borrowed just over $60,000 in readers' donations for a \"real estate rehab\" project but has paid back that entire amount to his son from a personal account at a third bank.\n\nObeidallah's attorneys didn't name the banks where Greg Anglin deposited readers' donations, citing the \"controversial nature\" of his son's site.\n\nGreg Anglin said he knew the money was coming from The Daily Stormer's readers but didn't know how his son used it.\n\nAndrew Anglin used his father's credit card to register the site's domain name because he didn't have his own credit card in 2013. But his father said he didn't know he would be listed as the site's registrant.\n\n\"When I realized I was the registrant, we had a very direct conversation where I told him I was very disappointed in him that he allowed that to happen, and that I wanted it removed immediately,\" he said.\n\nAnglin said he spoke to his son over the phone a few days before his deposition, but he said he didn't know where his son was calling from or where he has been living in recent years.\n\n\"He's a private person, and I'm a talkative guy. And so he prefers and I prefer to not know where he is,\" Greg Anglin said.\n\nThe suit was filed two days after domain name registration companies Google and GoDaddy yanked the site's web address, effectively making it unreachable. The companies acted after Anglin's publication of a post mocking the 32-year-old woman killed in a deadly attack at a white nationalist rally in Virginia.\n\nAndrew Anglin also retained lawyers to defend him against a separate lawsuit filed against him by Montana real estate agent Tanya Gersh, who says Anglin orchestrated an anti-Semitic online trolling campaign against her family. Last Wednesday, a federal judge in Montana ruled the First Amendment doesn't shield Anglin from Gersh's claims, allowing the case to proceed."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Tech stocks drag down markets", "description": "Apple, Facebook and Nvidia are leading stock markets down after an uncertain month", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dow-drops-nearly-500-points-led-by-tech-stocks/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/07/11/fb0d55bd-5266-49ce-9293-1b74ba7d216b/thumbnail/1200x630/d78beb609f78252d3d1af15d55743572/ap-18191534086354.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:46:55Z", "content": "Technology stocks are leading a slump on Wall Street, led by big drops in Apple and Facebook.

The final results of a clinical trial are in, and show that it is possible for some people with a peanut allergy to protect themselves by carefully building up a tolerance to peanuts over time.\n\nThe study, funded by Aimmune Therapeutics, included 551 participants, all of whom had a peanut allergy. Participants ranged in age from 4 to 55 years, though the majority were children ages 4 to 17. The researchers gave a quarter of the participants a placebo, while three-quarters received oral doses of small amounts of peanut protein powder, starting with just half a milligram a day; the amounts increased gradually until reaching the \"maintenance dose\" of 300 milligrams, equivalent of one peanut a day.\n\nAfter nine to 12 months of treatment, two-thirds of those who received it were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day. Half the patients were able to tolerate the equivalent of four peanuts daily. In contrast, only 4 percent of those in the placebo group were able to have the equivalent of two peanuts without having an allergic reaction.\n\n\"This is not a quick fix, and it doesn't mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,\" Dr. Jay Lieberman, co-author of the study and vice chair of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Food Allergy Committee, said in a statement. \"But it is definitely a breakthrough.\"\n\nThe results of the study were presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nNut and other food allergies have risen sharply in the United States in recent years, prompting urgent research efforts to explore potential ways to prevent and treat the problem. According to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE), the prevalence of peanut or tree nut allergy appears to have more than tripled in U.S. children between 1997 and 2008.\n\nFARE estimates that about 40 percent of children with food allergies have experienced a severe allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis \u2014 a potentially life-threatening swelling of the throat, lips and tongue with trouble breathing and swallowing. Patients may also suffer vomiting and hives or skin rash.\n\nOnce anaphylaxis begins, the drug epinephrine \u2014 often from an auto-injector like the EpiPen \u2014 is the only effective treatment. Failure to treat a severe allergic reaction quickly enough can turn fatal.\n\nThe Aimmune Therapeutics treatment doesn't completely cure a peanut allergy \u2014 people who are allergic would still need to avoid eating them. But it would allow them to better tolerate accidental exposure to small amounts, relieving of some of the anxiety about trace amounts hidden in packaged foods or cross-contamination from a classmate who recently ate a peanut butter sandwich.\n\nCurrently, there are no approved treatments to reduce the severity of a peanut allergy. Daniel C. Adelman, Aimmune's chief medical officer and the study's senior author, told The New York Times that the company plans to apply for FDA approval by the end of the year. If the treatment is approved, it would be available by prescription.\n\nPeople with peanut allergies would have to continue taking it long-term to stay protected against accidental consumption.\n\nHowever, as demonstrated in the study, the treatment will not work for everyone. In an accompanying editorial also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Michael R. Perkin, Ph.D., of the Population Health Research Institute at St. George's, University of London, points out that \"desensitization was not easy on the patients.\"\n\nNearly 12 percent of participants in the active-drug group needed to withdraw from the study due to side effects, compared to about 2 percent in the placebo group.\n\nPerkin also raises concerns about potential longer-term side effects of continued consumption of an allergen to which the body has produced antibodies, which are currently unknown. \"Surveillance and follow-up will be crucial,\" he writes."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Kate Gibson", "title": "Nearly 50 tons of beef recalled over E. coli risk", "description": "JBS USA issues second big meat recall in as many months; last one linked to salmonella outbreak that sickened hundreds", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ground-beef-recall-swift-beef-jbs-beef-e-coli/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/05/19/bb702909-6729-4c01-a96a-f4fd68b5b40b/thumbnail/1200x630/cc02832756c9bfa0368d23e44df17070/ground-beef.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:21:56Z", "content": "The weekend recall of nearly 100,000 pounds of ground beef possibly tainted with E. coli is the second large meat recall in as many months by JBS USA, a unit of the world's largest meat processor.

Congresswoman-elect Mikie Sherrill, D-New Jersey, fervently argued with her opponent over how much she does not support Pelosi.\n\nCongresswoman-elect Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, on Friday said she would not sign this letter but does not intend to support Pelosi, according to CNN.\n\n\"I've been very clear about my position and that remains the same,\" she said. \"I will be voting but I will not be voting for her.\"\n\nOther new members the group hopes to woo are Elissa Slotkin from Michigan, Jason Crow from Colorado, and Jared Golden from Maine.\n\nAbsent from the letter Monday was an official endorsement of a challenger to Pelosi for speaker.\n\nOn top of the dozens of high-profile Democratic groups who have thrown their support behind Pelosi, on Friday, 61 returning and new women representatives signed a letter of support applauding Pelosi's \"battle-tested record.\"\n\n\"Now that we are faced with unprecedented threats to our democracy, women, minorities, and even the most basic American values by President Trump, we need your effective leadership more than ever to advance our efforts to help hard-working families get ahead,\" the letter read.\n\nIf no one challenges Pelosi, the top three leadership spots will go unopposed, since Rep. Diana DeGette on Monday stepped away from challenging Rep. Jim Clyburn for the third position.\n\nHere is the full letter:"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Christopher Brito", "title": "Trump rips Navy SEAL, says bin Laden should've been caught sooner", "description": "\"Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that?

Two of those runners came together at mile 16 that day and changed each others' lives forever.\n\nKristie Elfering, 41, an experienced ultramarathon runner from Minnesota, had run countless long-distance races but was excited to hop off the trails of her home state and onto the busy streets of New York for the city's legendary marathon.\n\nElfering said people kept asking her if she felt safe running in New York and she would always say \"yes.\" Little did she know how safe she would be.\n\nKristie Elfering/Ken Anderson\n\nAfter running over the Queensborough Bridge into Manhattan, Elfering felt something wasn't quite right. \"I just remember thinking, 'I'm a little warm, but we're coming off the bridge,'\" Elfering told CBS News. \"I remember seeing the people, like, 'Oh, we're back in and they're going to cheer me on.' Then I don't remember anything.\"\n\nElfering fell to the ground \u2014 she was having a heart attack. Her friend and running partner, Victoria, who had traveled to New York to run the race with her, panicked.\n\nThat's when Dr. Ted Strange fatefully ran by.\n\nStrange, 60, a father from Staten Island, New York, has been a geriatric physician for decades, but said nothing prepared him for the high-stress medical rescue he encountered during the marathon.\n\n\"Twenty-five marathons and I have never listened to anything except the music of the crowd,\" he told CBS News. \"If I were to be wearing headphones, I would not have heard what I needed to hear.\"\n\nWhat he heard was someone calling for help during the race. It was Victoria, standing over Elfering, who had collapsed onto the ground.\n\nDodging oncoming runners, the doctor made his way over to the pair.\n\nHe tried to wake up Elfering and quickly realized she hadn't just fainted \u2014 it was much more serious. \"She didn't have a pulse,\" he said. \"I just said, 'I'm starting CPR, I need a defibrillator.'\"\n\nParamedics and members of the FDNY ran from the sidelines and helped. It took the team four tries with the defibrillator to resuscitate her.\n\nFinally, they were able to get a heartbeat and put Elfering in an ambulance. Victoria rode with her to nearby New York Presbyterian Hospital. Her first responder, Dr. Strange, was left on the marathon course \u2014 shaken.\n\n\"I was left standing at 58th and 1st saying, 'Oh my God,'\" he said, getting choked up by the memory. \"And a police officer said, 'What can I do for you, doc?' And I said, 'I don't know what you can do for me.'\" He paused in disbelief at what had just happened. Then, with encouragement from the crowd around him, he ran 10 blocks further to his waiting family.\n\nAt 68th Street, he collapsed into his wife's arms. \"I just had to give somebody CPR in the field,\" he said, crying.\n\n\"You had to give somebody CPR? It's OK, it's OK. Did they live?\" his wife said, holding his head in her hands. But at that point, he didn't know the answer.\n\nEventually, Strange was able to collect himself, and a fellow runner passing by encouraged him to rejoin the race. He jumped back in and says he ran the last 10 miles of the marathon in a daze.\n\nStrange Family\n\n\"My wife and daughter were there. They knew at the finish line I didn't care about the medal. I just wanted to know that the patient I was taking care of was OK,\" Strange told CBS News. \"Because that's what I would always do. And I couldn't find out. And that's the first time I couldn't find out.\"\n\nHe went home that night, exhausted from the race and worried about Elfering. Fortunately, one of Elfering's nurses knew Dr. Strange from a mutual friend. When Elfering told the nurse the story, she put two and two together and realized the connection.\n\nShe was able to connect the doctor and patient, who spoke on the phone. Strange was relived to know Elfering was alive, but both wanted more closure.\n\nElfering was visited by a high-ranking NYPD official, Chief of Counterterrorism James R. Waters, and thanked him for the NYPD and FDNY personnel who helped during the race. She was able to thank the staff at New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell, who nursed her back to health.\n\nBut she wanted to thank Dr. Strange in person, too.\n\nAbout one week after the marathon, she was able to do that. CBS News was there to capture the moment they saw each other again for the first time.\n\n\"Is it you?\" Strange asked in disbelief.\n\n\"It's me!\" Elfering said.\n\nThe two cried tears of joy, knowing that if fate hadn't brought them together that day, the outcome for Elfering could've been much worse.\n\nElfering explained that she now wears a portable defibrillator. She has experienced cardiac episodes since the race.\n\nStrange said even though Elfering was extremely healthy and was used to running very long distances, heart problems can be genetic. He advised everyone \u2014 no matter how healthy they are \u2014 get their hearts checked by a doctor.\n\nElfering also got to meet Strange's family. \"That's for letting me borrow him!\" she joked.\n\nSeveral people who heard the story have called him a hero, but Strange downplayed that, saying, \"I'm no hero \u2013 maybe a good Samaritan.\"\n\n\"I might call you a hero. I might call you my hero!\" Elfering told the doctor.\n\nShe hopes to begin running again in the coming months, and wants to return to New York for next year's marathon. \"I've never not finished a race before.\" she said. Elfering hopes if she returns, she can run the race with Dr. Strange.\n\n\"If she's here, I'll make sure we do that,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Graham Kates", "title": "3 more countries join committee targeting Zuckerberg", "description": "Elected officials from eight countries are now part of an unprecedented effort to probe disinformation and election meddling across the globe", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/3-more-parliaments-join-international-grand-committee-targeting-facebook-mark-zuckerberg/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/01/e63d3c15-4b91-46b4-99a0-2b1ba369c86b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/b7876da4d75bd5c9dab153a5019c6c53/zuckerberg-gettyimages-953377496.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:50:47Z", "content": "An international coalition of elected officials investigating disinformation and election meddling has grown to include politicians from eight countries, according to a letter they sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, reiterating calls for him to address the\u2026 [+2430 chars]", "fulltext": "An international coalition of elected officials investigating disinformation and election meddling has grown to include politicians from eight countries, according to a letter they sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, reiterating calls for him to address their \"international grand committee.\"\n\nLegislators from Brazil, Latvia and Singapore said in the letter that they will join officials from Britain, Canada, Australia, Ireland and Argentina in conducting the unprecedented hearing on Nov. 27.\n\nZuckerberg initially turned down an invitation by Damian Collins, a member of Britain's Parliament, and Bob Zimmer, a Canadian lawmaker.

Renault, which owns more than 40 percent of Nissan, said it would defend its interests within the alliance after Ghosn's arrest. Ghosn also serves as Renault's CEO.\n\nGhosn (pronounced \"go-an\") is a household name in Japan, where he's considered a business superstar and even earned a manga comic book about his life. He was treated with the same adulation as rock stars or sports celebrities, perhaps partly because he was unusual in Japan as a non-Japanese chief of a major company.\n\nYet the executive isn't as well known in the U.S., at least outside of business circles. Born in Brazil to Lebanese immigrants, Ghosn speaks several languages. He studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris and then joined Michelin, where he climbed the ladder to become the CEO of its North American operations before moving onto Renault and Nissan.\n\nHis nickname is \"Le Cost Killer\"\n\nGhosn earned the nickname from his work at Renault, which he joined in 1996. He oversaw the company's South American division, which he returned to profitability through restructuring.\n\nHe's credited with reviving Nissan\n\nGhosn next applied his restructuring efforts to Nissan, which was near bankruptcy, after Renault took a 43 percent stake in the Japanese automaker in 1999. He cut 20,000 jobs at the automaker, with 12,000 of those in Japan.\n\nNissan was losing $1,000 for every car it sold in the U.S., Ghosn wrote in a 2002 Harvard Business Review article about his efforts. He said he initially faced \"flak as the foreigner in charge,\" but that he won over employees because he showed them respect.\n\nHe backed the development of electric cars\n\nGhosn was an early supporter of electric cars like Nissan's Leaf. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, which started work on the electronic car development efforts in 2008, recently said it planned to produce 12 new electric cars within five years.\n\n\"We are probably the only carmaker who's starting to make money selling electric cars,\" Ghosn told CNBC earlier this year.\n\nIt's not the first time his pay has come under scrutiny\n\nGhosn's pay has come under scrutiny before, with the French government last year objecting to his $9 million package as CEO as Renault.\n\nA union official at carmaker Renault is welcoming the Japanese investigation into Ghosn's pay. Ali Kaya, who heads the CGT union at a Renault factory in Flins outside Paris, said \"the most shocking thing is that these people were not arrested well before this.\"\n\nHe lamented that the public has grown inured to \"astronomical sums\" paid to Ghosn and other executives. The powerful, hard-left CGT has long campaigned to cap executive pay.\n\nHe's suspected of underreporting his income by $44 million\n\nTokyo prosecutors said Ghosn is suspected of understating his salary by 5 billion yen, or about $44 million, according to Japan's Kyodo News. That would violate the country's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which could result in either up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to 10 million yen ($90,000) or both.\n\n--With reporting by The Associated Press."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Colorado man to be sentenced in killings of daughters, pregnant wife", "description": "Christopher Watts pleaded guilty to three charges of murder in the deaths of his wife, Shanann Watts, and their young daughters", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-watts-sentencing-hearing-in-killings-of-young-daughters-pregnant-wife-shanann-watts-live-updates-today-2018-11-19/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/08/20/fcefdf66-c533-416f-b8ac-b96c17055077/thumbnail/1200x630/3346d1104b0aede0753d5419741e9d08/180820-chris-watts-horizontal.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:45:14Z", "content": "DENVER -- A Colorado man is set to be sentenced Monday after pleading guilty to murdering his pregnant wife and their two young daughters and dumping their bodies on an oil work site.

Christopher Watts pleaded guilty on Nov. 6 to three charges of murder in the deaths of his wife, Shanann Watts, and their young daughters Bella and Celeste.\n\nHe also pleaded guilty to two counts of murdering a child, one count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy in the death of the child's unborn son and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body.\n\nCBS Denver\n\nCalling the crime the most \"inhumane and vicious\" he had seen in his career, a judge sentenced Watts to consecutive terms of life without parole for each of the killings and to another consecutive sentence of 48 years in the killing of the unborn child, whom the couple called Nico. Watts received additional 12-year sentences on evidence tampering counts.\n\nProsecutors have said they agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for Watts' guilty plea, after seeking approval from Shanann Watts' family. First-degree murder charges in Colorado require a minimum sentence of life without a chance at parole for adults.\n\nMembers of Shanann Watts' family gave emotional testimony during the hearing Monday. Shanann Watts' father called Chris Watts an \"evil monster.\"\n\n\"How dare you take the lives of my daughter, Bella, Celeste and Nico,\" Frank Rzucek said. \"I trusted you to take care of them, not kill them.\"\n\nShanann Watts' mother Sandy Rzucek told Christopher Watts her daughter loved him \"with all of her heart\" and that her granddaughters \"adored you and also trusted you.\" She referenced a video of Bella, shared widely on social media after the killings, showing the child singing a song about how her father is her hero.\n\n\"I have no idea who gave you the right to take their lives,\" Sandy Rzucek said. \"But I know God and his mighty angels were there at that moment to bring them home to paradise.\"\n\nRzucek said she asked the district attorney not to pursue the death penalty \"because that's not my right. Your life is between you and God. Now and I pray that he has mercy for you.\"\n\nChristopher Watts, who appeared emotional during the testimony, elected not to speak. He is represented by the Office of the Colorado State Public Defender. A lawyer for Watts gave a brief statement on his behalf: \"Although he understands words are hollow at this point, he is truly sorry for all of this.\"\n\nJudge Marcelo Kopcow ruled Thursday that Christopher Watts' parents are considered victims of the crime because they are the girls' grandparents. Victims are allowed to give a statement or provide written comments during sentencing hearings in Colorado. Christopher Watts' mother cried as she spoke, saying that she is \"united in grief\" with Shanann Watts' family over the killings. She turned to Christopher Watts and told him that she loved him, sobbing.\n\nThrough a lawyer, Christopher Watts' family encouraged him to make a full confession. Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke said it's likely he will never give a truthful account of what happened and why he carried out the killings.\n\nRourke said Watts strangled his wife to death with his hands in an \"uncontrolled, vengeful manner\" after an argument.\n\n\"The horror that she felt as the man she loved wrapped his hands around her throat and choked the life out of her must have been unimaginable,\" Rourke said.\n\nHe then smothered the girls, 3 and 4, Rourke said. Defensive wounds on Bella Watts' body showed that the child fought for her life, Rourke said.\n\nAfterwards, Watts transported the bodies in a truck to the oil work site, on property owned by the company Christopher Watts worked for until his arrest. He disposed of the remains separately, Rourke said: \"He ensured they would not be together \u2014 even in death.\"\n\nThe girls' bodies were found submerged in two different oil tanks, and Shanann Watts' body was found buried nearby in a shallow grave.\n\nA friend asked police to check on Shanann Watts on Aug. 13 when she could not reach her and grew concerned that the 34-year-old who was pregnant with a third child missed a doctor's appointment. Local police initially handled the search and soon sought support from Colorado investigators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Christopher Watts spoke to local television reporters from the front porch of the family's home in Frederick; a small town on the plains north of Denver where drilling rigs and oil wells surround booming subdivisions. Watts pleaded for his family to return home, telling reporters their house felt empty without four-year-old Bella and three-year-old Celeste watching cartoons or running to greet him at the door.\n\nWithin days, the 33-year-old was arrested and charged with killing his family.\n\nAccording to court records, Watts admitted to police that he killed his wife. Watts told investigators that he strangled her in \"a rage\" when he discovered she had strangled their two daughters after he sought a separation.\n\nProsecutors have since called Watts' account \"a flat-out lie.\"\n\nPolice also learned that Christopher Watts was having an affair with a coworker. Watts had denied that before being arrested.\n\nWatts' girlfriend said last week he had misled her from day one, telling her his divorce was almost final. \"He's a liar,\" Nichol Kessinger told the Denver Post. \"He lied about everything.\"\n\nAfter the killings, Rourke said, Christopher Watts texted frequently with the girlfriend, called a realtor and also took steps to cover his tracks by telling staff at the girls' school that they would no longer be enrolled there.\n\nThe killings captured the attention of media across the country and became the focus of true crime blogs and online video channels, aided by dozens of family photos and videos that Shanann Watts shared on social media showing the smiling couple spending time with their children and each other.\n\nCourts records, though, showed the couple's lifestyle caused financial strain at times. They filed for bankruptcy in June 2015, six months after Christopher Watts was hired as an operator for the large oil and gas driller Anadarko Petroleum at an annual salary of about $61,500. At the time, Shanann Watts was working in a children's hospital call center for $18 per hour.\n\nThey reported total earnings of $90,000 in 2014 but $70,000 in unsecured claims along with a mortgage of nearly $3,000. The claims included thousands of dollars in credit card debt, some student loans and medical bills."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Caitlin O'Kane", "title": "Mystery man pays off all layaway items at a Walmart", "description": "Costumers at a Vermont Walmart received a surprise that reflects \"the true magic of Christmas\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-man-pays-off-all-layaway-items-at-walmart-in-derby-vermont/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/784193da-1f28-4ceb-8195-c6dcd5bcb563/thumbnail/1200x630/655e2f2f903e1dc2fcb5562905326e3c/still1117-000019.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:28:41Z", "content": "A mystery shopper paid of customers' layaway items at a Walmart in Derby, Vermont, CBS Burlington affiliate WCAX reports.

All three senators sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee and are arguing that Whitaker's appointment violates the Constitution's Appointment Clause \"advice and consent\" role.\n\nThey believe that Whitaker's appointment violates the Constitution because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nOn a conference call, Blumenthal said that with Whitaker's appointment, \"the president has made an end run around the Constitution,\" and that this appointment \"so flagrantly defies\" the Constitution that any viewer of \"Schoolhouse Rock\" would recognize it.\n\nThe complaint asks a judge to declare the appointment unconstitutional and to prevent him from serving as head of the Justice Department.\n\nThe Justice Department says that Whitaker's appointment is lawful and comports with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. As it has said in response to other challenges to Whitaker's appointment, the Justice Department stated, \"There are over 160 instances in American history in which non-Senate confirmed persons performed, on a temporary basis, the duties of a Senate-confirmed position. To suggest otherwise is to ignore centuries of practice and precedent.\"\n\nMoreover, the Justice Department maintains that Whitaker has served long enough at the department and is sufficiently senior enough not to require Senate confirmation to serve as acting attorney general. It is arguing that the position, which oversees all federal law enforcement (FBI, DEA, ATF and federal prisons), as well as the Russia investigation, is not that of a principal officer because Whitaker is only in the job temporarily, no longer than 210 days.\n\nShould Whitaker eventually be found to be illegitimately holding this office, it would be possible for legal challenges to be filed against almost every single action undertaken by the Justice Department during his time in office (DEA raids, FBI arrests, Justice Department charges filed).\n\nWhitaker was Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff and was elevated to the top job after Sessions was ousted by Mr. Trump on Nov. 7.\n\nMaryland's attorney general has also filed a suit over Whitaker's appointment, declaring it illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nBlumenthal told CBS News' Elizabeth Campbell he wouldn't presume the court's timing, but hopes the suit can be resolved as soon as possible.\n\n\"We are left with no recourse but to seek a court order,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nHere is the filing:"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Soul Train Music Awards co-hosts Tichina Arnold & Tisha Campbell", "description": "Tichina Arnold and Tisha Campbell co-host the 31st annual Soul Train Music Awards.

Unfortunately, that generous impulse also puts people at risk for potential scams.\n\nFortune magazine's senior editor at large Leigh Gallagher visited \"CBS This Morning\" with some tips on how to avoid fraud when giving, and how to target your charity to have the greatest impact.\n\nAfter a natural disaster\n\nIn the aftermath of disasters, such as the wildfires that have destroyed communities in California, people want to give, but how do they know to give to the right place?\n\n\"There's an incredible urge [to help]; this is called episodic giving,\" Gallagher said. \"It doesn't impact other giving, it strikes at the heart strings for obvious reasons, and it's so easy to give online these days.\"\n\nBut she cautions, \"You have to be really careful, especially after natural disasters, that's exactly when you see fraud strike. There's a lot of opportunists out there who'll be springing up with charities that sound legitimate but aren't.\"\n\nBefore donating to a charity:\n\n\n\nMake sure it is a registered public 501(c)(3) nonprofit\n\n\n\nKnow the organization's mission, goals, and past success\n\n\n\nGallagher recommends looking up a charity you are thinking of donating to on Charity Navigator, Charity Watch, the Better Business Bureau's Give.org or other ratings agency, to find out if they are legitimate. \"Sometimes you might need their employee identification number (EIN), but you should be able to get that,\" she said.\n\nQuestions to ask a charity should include, \"What is your mission?\"\n\n\"If they can't answer that, that's a real red flag,\" Gallagher said. \"Why are you doing this? What's your history?\n\n\"You should also ask yourself, what means the most to me? This is your money.\"\n\nGiving cash is best\n\nNothing is better than cash, especially in the aftermath of a disaster. Donating clothes or other goods is impractical, no matter how well-intentioned.\n\n\"Sometimes the distribution channels in the case of a natural disaster are totally upended. So your stuff might not be able to get there,\" said Gallagher. Also, \"It may not be exactly what's needed \u2013 you may have men's clothes, they may need women's clothes.\n\n\"What these charities need most above everything else is cash. Your clothes are great for the local Goodwill. There's lots of things you can do with that. But your money is what they need. Even $5 or $10. We know the internet can magnify giving, so every little bit counts.\"\n\nMaking an impact\n\nGallagher suggests dividing your charitable giving into \"buckets\" targeting:\n\nGlobal causes\n\n\n\nLocal causes\n\n\n\nRandom favors\n\n\n\nAnd to make the strongest impact she said, \"Really think about what means a lot to you. In addition to disaster giving, we do think that regular giving is going to be up \u2013 the economy's doing well, there's a sense of people giving gifts with purpose, people are giving donations as gifts.\"\n\nDividing your charitable giving into \"buckets\" means you will decide what you're going to give throughout the year based on, \"I'm going to give this much to something that changes the world, and then this much in my local community because that really impacts the people around you, and then you have to reserve some for the people in your office who are running marathons and everything.

Out!\" referring to the migrant caravan that arrived in the border city last week.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road -- and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nSome Tijuana residents supported the migrants, but others accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \"invasion.\" And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group.\n\n\"We don't want them in Tijuana,\" protesters shouted.\n\nJuana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don't have criminal records.\n\nA block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keyla Zamarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don't represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: \"Childhood has no borders.\"\n\nMost of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats.\n\nBut the journey has been hard, and many have turned around.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. \"We want them to return to Honduras,\" said Rivera.\n\nThe migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an \"avalanche\" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx.\n\nTijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \"We are fleeing violence,\" said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \"How can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\"\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S.\n\nEdwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \"the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain.

But a BBC documentary crew in Antarctica made a rare decision to intervene when several Emperor penguin mothers and their chicks became trapped in a ravine and cut off from the colony.\n\nOn Sunday's episode of the \"Dynasties\" series, mother penguins can be seen leaving chicks behind when they can't make it up a slope. Some chicks died from the extreme cold as temperatures dipped to as low as minus 76 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAfter a storm, the crew returned to the area and decided to build a stepped ramp that helped the remaining penguins climb to safety.\n\n'We opted to intervene passively,\" said the show's director, Will Lawson. \"Once we'd dug that little ramp, which took very little time, we left it to the birds. We were elated when they decided to use it.\"\n\nThe show's creator, world renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough, is known for his strong preference to let nature take its course. But in this case, he says he would have intervened.\n\n\"It's very rare for the film crew to intervene,\" he said in the narration of a video clip published by Country Living. \"But they realize that they might be able to save at least some of these birds, simply by digging a few steps in the ice.\"\n\nThat was just INCREDIBLE!!!

It wasn't dangerous. You weren't touching the animals and it was just felt by doing this... they had the opportunity to not have to keep slipping down the slope.\"\n\nSo far, the public's response to the crew's intervention has been mostly positive.\n\nSo glad the crew decided to act and save the penguins in the ravine.

For while the event may be in its 10th year, and the honorary Oscar itself in its 60th, there was still room for a few firsts. Levy became the first member of the public relations branch of the film academy to win an honorary Oscar, while Kennedy became the first woman to win the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Memorial award \u2013 an honor that she shared with her husband and partner Marshall.\n\nThe Thalberg award is given to creative producers in recognition of their high-quality body of work, and is infrequently given out. The last Thalberg award recipient was Francis Ford Coppola in 2010.\n\n\"I'm incredibly honored to be the first woman to receive this award,\" Kennedy said to a standing ovation. \"I'm not the first to deserve it and I'm 100 percent sure I won't be the last.\"\n\nSpielberg told the audience about hiring Kennedy to be his secretary years ago, but quickly realized that she had more to offer than just taking notes.\n\n\"The breaker of glass ceilings wherever she sets her sights,\" Spielberg said of Kennedy, who now runs Lucasfilm. \"She went from taking notes to taking over.\"\n\nThe director did, however, make his Amblin Entertainment co-founders blush by telling a story about discovering that the two were in a relationship when he caught them \"making out on my couch.\" Kennedy and Marshall have been married now for 32 years and have two daughters.\n\nAll the honorees accepted their awards with graciousness and little bit of humor.\n\nSchifrin, who composed the themes to \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Dirty Harry,\" had to have a little humor in accepting his award from Eastwood. Eastwood, who said he couldn't read the teleprompter, called Schifrin up to the stage early because he wanted to ask him some questions.\n\nOn stage, Schifrin and Eastwood talked about jazz and how many movies they'd worked on together.\n\n\"You're sabotaging my speech,\" Schifrin said in good humor when Eastwood lingered. But Schifrin took hold of his moment of glory after going home from the Oscars empty handed six times in his long career.\n\n\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin, 86, said. \"It is mission accomplished.\"\n\nAnd Levy, who has been Spielberg's publicist for over 40 years, since \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" said his job has always been a little hard for people outside the business to understand. \"At least now they know I got an Oscar for it,\" he laughed."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "El Chapo trial: Prosecutors bring in former cartel members", "description": "Week 2 of the El Chapo trial begins after prosecutors began shedding new light on cartel operations.

Several hoist ropes hold up an elevator car, so if one fails, the others are able to carry the weight.\n\nVisiting from Mexico, Jaime Montemayor didn't expect his trip to Chicago to include getting stuck in an elevator.\n\n\"At the beginning I believed we were going to die,\" Montemayor said. \"We were going down and then I felt that we were falling down and then I heard a noise\u2013clack clack clack clack clack clack.\"\n\nHis wife, Mana Castillo, said the elevator was moving fast and suddenly a material that looked like dust started filtrating into the elevator.She said they found out later that they had careened from the 95th floor down to the 11th floor.\n\nNone of the people in the elevator was hospitalized.\n\nSome of the elevator passengers said security officers staffed at the Hancock didn't immediately call firefighters.\n\nSomeone who answered the phone at the Hancock security office Friday declined to comment and hung up the phone.\n\nWhen rescuers scrambled to find the stuck elevator early Friday morning, there were no openings between floors because of the building's blind-shaft style layout.\n\nThe rescue crew had to hammer out a concrete wall in the garage area of the 11th floor. Today, cables were dangling next to the cracked door where the people trapped in the elevator were pulled to safety.\n\n\"It was a precarious situation where we had the cable break on top of the elevator (and) we couldn't do an elevator-to-elevator rescue we had to breach a wall,\" said Chicago Battalion Fire Chief Patrick Maloney.\n\nThe City of Chicago requires annual inspections of all of its 22,000 elevators. The elevator that failed Friday morning passed its most recent inspection in July of this year.\n\nCity inspectors visited the Hancock in 2014 and 2017 for an elevator complaint inspection and a citation was issued for failure to maintain electric elevator equipment.\n\nBoth of those issues were resolved, records show."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Photos show sub \"imploded\" on seafloor, but Argentina can't reach it", "description": "Government says cash-strapped Argentina lacks technology to recover ARA San Juan after disaster with 44 crew on board", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/argentina-unable-recover-submarine-ara-san-juan-photos-imploded-atlantic/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/71952c90-3242-43c5-8c9c-9ec1009df01c/thumbnail/1200x630/f5317af193529e03f0f605472e4a735d/argentina-san-juan-submarine.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:56:31Z", "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Hours after announcing the discovery of an Argentine submarine lost deep in the Atlantic a year ago with 44 crew members aboard, the government said Saturday that it is unable to recover the vessel, drawing anger from missing sailor\u2026 [+5610 chars]", "fulltext": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Hours after announcing the discovery of an Argentine submarine lost deep in the Atlantic a year ago with 44 crew members aboard, the government said Saturday that it is unable to recover the vessel, drawing anger from missing sailors' relatives who demanded that it be raised.\n\nDefense Minister Oscar Aguad said at a press conference that the country lacks \"modern technology\" capable of \"verifying the seabed\" to extract the ARA San Juan, which was found 2,975 feet deep in waters off the Valdes Peninsula in Argentine Patagonia, roughly 373 miles from the port city of Comodoro Rivadavia.\n\nEarlier in the morning, the navy said a \"positive identification\" had been made by a remote-operated submersible from the American company Ocean Infinity. The company, commissioned by the Argentine government, began searching for the missing vessel Sept. 7.\n\nIt remained unclear what the next steps could be.\n\nConferencia #AraSanJuan: Una secci\u00f3n mayor, comprendida por el casco resistente -de acero especial de 33 mm. de espesor-, se encuentra en una sola pieza a 907 m.

Argentina is currently facing a currency crisis and double-digit inflation that has led the government to announce sweeping measures to balance the budget and concretize a financing deal with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAny move to recuperate the vessel would also be a logistically large and challenging undertaking based on the submarine's distance from the coast, its depth, and the kind of seabed upon which it is resting.\n\nConferencia #AraSanJuan: Asimismo, se identificaron otras partes del submarino de menores dimensiones y formas, coincidentes con la secci\u00f3n de proa, la popa y la vela.

The San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.\n\nOn the anniversary Thursday, Argentina President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \"absolute and non-negotiable commitment\" to find \"the truth.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Aguad said that the vessel was found to be in an area that investigators had deemed \"most likely.\"\n\nOfficials showed images of the submarine, which was located on a seabed with its hull totally deformed. Parts of its propellers were buried and debris was scattered up to 230 feet away.\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15, 2017, that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nSome hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \"concentration of hydrogen\" triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.\n\nArgentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but a few navy units have continued providing logistical support to Ocean Infinity.\n\nOn Saturday, Plunkett tweeted: \"Our thoughts are with the many families affected by this terrible tragedy. We sincerely hope that locating the resting place of the ARA San Juan will be of some comfort to them at what must be a profoundly difficult time.\"\n\nHe also said: \"This was an extremely challenging project and today's successful outcome, following the earlier search operations, firmly endorses our technology.\"\n\nThe company unsuccessfully searched for the Malaysia Airlines plane that disappeared in 2014 over the Indian Ocean."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump says sit-down interview with Mueller unlikely", "description": "President Trump said in an interview with Fox News that he \"would not get involved\" if acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker moves to restrict Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

I'm not taking that risk,\" said Mark Patterson, a recently retired patent attorney from Nashville, Tennessee. \"There's a huge fear of folks my age that they're going to run out of money and they're going to need to rely on the government for help.\"\n\nBy the time the market bottomed out during the financial crisis in 2009, an estimated $2.7 trillion had been wiped out of Americans' retirement accounts, according to the Urban Institute. Older Americans in particular have had a tough time recovering their losses. The Pew Research Center estimates the net worth of the median baby foomer household in 2016 was still nearly 18 percent shy of where it sat in 2007.\n\nIn the two years since Donald Trump's election, 62 percent of Americans -- and 76 percent of those 65 and over -- don't believe their financial situation has improved despite the run-up in the stock markets, according to a recent Bankrate survey. Nearly one in five respondents said their finances have actually gotten worse.\n\n\"More comfortable with volatility\"\n\n\n\nPaul Kelash, vice president of consumer insights at Allianz Life Insurance, said the market fluctuations throughout 2018 look less like the prelude to a retirement savings crisis and more like a return to normalcy after a remarkably steady bull market run.\n\nAnd he hasn't seen much evidence of Americans drastically altering their retirement plans. \"We get the feeling that folks are getting more comfortable with volatility,\" he said.\n\nPatterson, the recently retired patent attorney, gradually began stepping away from his law practice in 2016 -- a decision he said was motivated in part by the stress of his job, his relatively stable finances and a \"re-evaluation of priorities\" after losing his wife of 35 years in 2013.\n\nNow, 68, Patterson said he still has some \"discretionary spending\" money invested in stocks and riskier assets. But he said he's reluctant to put too much money into a stock market that soared throughout 2017, a decision he said was driven in part by memories of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"I can retire in 2018 and not be sweating bullets because I put together a budget and I protected it,\" Patterson said. \"The thing that the crash in 2008 taught me is that, even though my portfolio was well set up, that was a black swan type of event. Even if you had a balanced portfolio, everything went down.\"\n\nIndeed, memories of the recession continue to take a financial and psychological toll on many of those who were affected.\n\n\"There is no evidence that retirement wealth has improved in the last few years,\" said Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist, professor and director of the Retirement Equity Lab at The New School. For workers 50 to 65, indications are that wealth has actually fallen, she said.\n\nGhilarducci noted that workers and their employers stopped or cut back on 401(k) and retirement account contributions immediately after the financial crisis.

It's what you can do when you can pay for everything else.\"\n\nAccounts remain depleted\n\n\n\nAnd with a limited number of working years ahead of them -- and, in some cases, their peak earning years largely behind them -- many older Americans haven't managed to replenish their depleted retirement and savings accounts.\n\nMark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief and senior economic analyst at Bankrate, noted that the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts to boost interest rates benefit savers with money in the bank but also make it more difficult for those with debt to pay back what they owe. The \"rising economic tide\" has been a boon for many, he said, \"but it doesn't lift all boats.\"\n\nHe believes the tendency is to \"overgeneralize\" Americans' retirement situations and their day-to-day reactions to the economy.\n\n\"There can be a little bit of a disconnect,\" he said, \"between the improvement in the economic data and the actual experience of many Americans.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Saudi royals wait for Trump's next move after journalist's murder", "description": "With CIA appearing likely to tell Trump the Saudi Crown Prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi's assassination, the men who really know could soon be executed", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-donald-trump-cia-evidence-jamal-khashoggi-killing-turkey-2018-11-19/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/07/9005ef84-6358-442b-9ec8-c2a6b51beced/thumbnail/1200x630/ff3cc59eea976ea92f4482ace3ca3149/salman.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:25:40Z", "content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- The leaders of Saudi Arabia seemed on Monday to be waiting for President Trump to make the next move.

On Saturday the U.S. leader again stressed the importance of the Saudi relationship, calling the Islamic kingdom a \"truly spectacular ally.\"\n\nThe CIA has assessed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, based mainly on an understanding of how the kingdom operates and the proximity of several participants in the killing to the heir-in-waiting, as well as the organizations involved.\n\nTurkey has said it shared evidence with its partners, including the U.S., that shows it was a pre-meditated murder. The Turkish president has said it was a execution ordered from the \"highest level\" of the Saudi government.\n\nA U.S. official told CBS News last week that U.S. intelligence agencies have \"high confidence\" in their assessment that bin Salman ordered the killing -- based on an understanding of how Saudi Arabia's government operates. No U.S. official has told CBS News that there is direct evidence linking bin Salman to the killing, however.\n\nThe Saudi government has admitted that the Washington Post contributor was killed after walking into the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\nRiyadh insists the order from up top was to try and bring Khashoggi -- a sharp critic of the fast-rising crown prince -- back home, and that the man in charge of the operation, former deputy intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri, made the decision to kill him instead. Al-Assiri is known to have been a close advisor to the crown prince.\n\nAsked over the weekend whether he himself had listened to the evidence provided by the Turks, President Trump said he didn't need to hear the \"suffering tape, it's a terrible tape.\"\n\n\"I've been fully briefed on it, there's no reason for me to hear it,\" Mr. Trump said in the interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\" ''I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it.\"\n\nMr. Trump said the U.S. government would be \"having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday\" on the Khashoggi killing, which he said would include \"who did it.\"\n\nHe didn't specify whether the report would come from the White House or the U.S. intelligence community, nor whether its findings would be made public.\n\nA CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reported from the Saudi capital on Monday, Mr. Trump is under pressure from Congress, and if he now comes out and confirms that U.S. intelligence believes Crown Prince Salman was behind the killing, it could be catastrophic for the Saudi regime.\n\nSaudi Arabia first claimed it didn't know what had happened to Khashoggi, then it finally admitted he'd died in the Istanbul consulate, but said he'd been killed in a fist fight.\n\nThen, just last week, there was a new explanation from the prosecutor in Riyadh, who said a team had been sent to Turkey to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia, by force if necessary, but that one of the team's leaders decided to kill him with a lethal injection instead.\n\nWilliams and her team were at a news conference last Thursday when the Saudi Foreign Minister said point-blank that the kingdom's own investigation had exonerated the crown prince of any involvement.\n\nThe chief prosecutor in Saudi Arabia indicted 11 people over the killing last week, and five of them could face the death penalty.\n\nWilliams noted on Monday that those men presumably know the truth -- including, perhaps, who ultimately gave the order to kill Khashoggi, and what happened to his body.\n\nThe fear is they could be put to death without a chance to tell the rest of the world what happened."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Eye Opener at 8: PG&E criticized amid California fires", "description": "A look back at what we've been covering on \"CBS This Morning.\" <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/newsletters/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Subscribe to get the Eye Opener delivered straight to your inbox.</u></a>", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/eye-opener-at-8-pg-e-criticized-amid-california-fires/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/9d1f160a-53fc-4d0d-873e-187eb8a0a1da/thumbnail/1200x630/504c0dc83e5844b4ee14eaebbb73e9bd/ctm-eyeopener8-1715410-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:24:56Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "T-Mobile escalating \"arms race\" against robocalls", "description": "The FCC is demanding telecommunications companies lay out their plans to meet new standards to combat robocalls and scammers.

President Clinton was impeached, but was acquitted in a Senate trial to remove him from office, and eventually regained his footing on the public stage.\n\nLewinsky, meanwhile, reveals she considered suicide.\n\n\"I just was mortified [about] what this was going to do to my family,\" she said.\n\nElura Nanos, an attorney and columnist who's written about Lewinsky for the website Law & Crime, said, \"What she's doing now is just taking back her own identity.\"\n\nWhile President Clinton has largely avoided discussing the affair, Nanos said the public's perception of Lewinsky is changing in the #MeToo era.\n\n\"Monica Lewinsky has recast herself as someone who was done harm by Clinton, by his presidency, by the press, by the public. To some degree, she has flipped that script,\" said Nanos. \"But Bill Clinton is still a very powerful man. And as a result, she still does not have the full ability to rid herself of everything that went into vilifying her for decades.\"\n\nSomething Lewinsky hopes she can change is how we talk about her episode with President Clinton.

He was one of the first openly gay American athletes to qualify for the Winter Games where he won a bronze medal in the team event.\n\nIn our series Note to Self, Rippon stepped onto the rink at Skylands Ice World in New Jersey to reflect on the path he carved in life, on and off the ice.\n\nHi Adam,\n\nIt's me, Adam, but from the future.\n\nYou are going through a really tough time right now. You've just missed qualifying for the Olympic team for the second time in a row. You feel confused and you feel like a failure. It might not make sense right now, but this is truly one of the most important moments in your life.\n\nTake a moment and be proud of yourself.\n\nDo you remember being 13 and taking the Greyhound Bus from Scranton to Philadelphia every Monday morning so you could get to practice? You stayed with so many different families who made you feel like you were home when you were not. It was scary and you missed your own family very much but your mom always told you it wasn't a sacrifice if you got to do what you love. You lived in your coach's basement for a few months because you couldn't afford to live anywhere else. Not that long ago, you had so little money that sometimes you had to choose whether you paid for groceries or paid for ice time.\n\nYou work so hard, but you are even harder on yourself. Now, listen, this part is important: Stand up, walk to a mirror, look yourself straight in the eye and tell yourself: you are a winner. You won't see one looking back at you yet, but do this every day and you'll really start to learn what being a winner is. Being a winner is a mindset.\n\nYou've come out to your friends and family a few years ago and it made you feel so free, like you've grown wings. Do you remember growing up in Pennsylvania, thinking that being gay was something you would never tell anyone? When you publicly come out in the next year, you will let go of what other people think of you. You will hope to give someone else what you didn't feel growing up: permission to be themselves. You will be saying: \"You are worthy.\"\n\nOh, and when you wax your eyebrows, start talking about how great they look. It'll be a hit.\n\nOver the next few years, you'll get into the best shape of your life, mentally and physically, and you will feel so in control. You're not a teenager anymore and you've embraced that you aren't going to be as thin or light as some of your competitors. You worked on perfecting yourself instead of trying to change yourself.\n\nYou will become a national champion at 26 and your path to the Olympics will seem clearer than ever. But exactly one year before the 2018 Olympic team selection, you will break your foot. You'll fear everything you've worked for was in vain, but don't be discouraged. You are strong, you are brave, you can take on anything.\n\nYou, Adam, will make the Olympic team and skate on Olympic ice, it'll be a moment you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll be crazy, wild, emotional and very exciting. The world will see your character and they will embrace you for just being yourself.\n\nYou are a man now. You've challenged yourself and taken risks. You make people around you laugh, and help them like who they are. You've become the role model that you wished you'd had as a kid. You will look in the mirror and you will see someone you like. You will look in the mirror and finally see a winner looking back at you.\n\nNow go out and conquer the world."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Holly Rosenkrantz", "title": "Trump: I won't stop acting attorney general if he tries to limit Russia probe", "description": "President also says his written answers to Robert Mueller's questions will probably be all he will provide him", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-he-wont-stop-matthew-whitaker-if-he-tries-to-limit-the-russia-investigation/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/17/d8eab2b6-ff51-41f5-8cec-4772bd44feef/thumbnail/1200x630/bef9f04d0cb5117503d5eea8e1742ee1/trumpwh2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:29:05Z", "content": "President Trump said he will not stop his acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker if he decides to limit Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

It alerts customers to problem calls they won't want to pick up.\n\n\"Although the caller is going to use a phone number close to mine, I'm still going to know it's a scam,\" Castle told correspondent Anna Werner. \"I knew the phone number, I could see it was a scam, so I can send it away.\"\n\nCastle believes T-Mobile is ahead of its competitors, and the robocallers. \"Every time we make an improvement, the scammers make a change. So, it's an arms race to see who can trick who,\" he said.\n\nAnd the arms race is escalating: \"The scammers are trying new technologies, new ways to scam people. So, we're upping our technology to keep up with them.\"\n\nCustomers can use the Scam ID feature to screen unfamiliar calls, or block them completely.\n\nAnd this week, T-Mobile is launching a new app, Name ID, that will allow users to choose the type of call they want to block \u2013 everything from nuisance calls, to political or charity calls, even prison calls.\n\n\"With this new app, customers have better control over what they would like to see, and what they don't want to see,\" said Castle.\n\nBut the FCC is also pushing companies to meet new standards known by the acronym SHAKEN/STIR. (SHAKEN = Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs. STIR = Secure Telephone Identity Revisited.) They would allow carriers to verify calls with a digital fingerprint, to show that the person making the call and the person receiving the call are who they say they are, not a scammer trying to \"spoof\" or imitate a phone number.\n\nCastle said, \"The standard is essentially, two operators have certificates or tokens that they exchange with each other in each call, and more or less it just says I am who I am.\"\n\nT-Mobile says it's ready, and other major carriers say they're working on it. But others apparently are not: in letters the FCC asked them why not, and gave all 14 companies until today to detail their plans to the agency.\n\nAs FCC chairman Ajit Pai told \"CBS This Morning\" in March, \"For those things that are within our authority, we're pursuing them very aggressively.\"\n\nBut in order for that plan to work, all carriers have to get on board. And industry expert Aaron Foss said, even if that happens, \"scammers are going to go where they can find victims.\"\n\nFoss founded Nomorobo, a robocall-blocking app for phones. He says those new SHAKEN/STIR standards are good, up to a point.\n\n\"But what it doesn't do is, it doesn't say if that call is legal,\" said Foss. \"It doesn't say anything about the content. It just says that that number is allowed to be called. So, it will stop what is called 'neighbor spoofing,' but it's absolutely not going to solve the whole robocall problem.\"\n\nWhich is why Foss says Nomorobo takes an \"editorial\" approach to robocalls \u2013 blocking them entirely.\n\n\"A lot of the other competitors are labeling it or saying things like 'spam likely,' 'scam likely,' 'telemarketer.' We know that consumers just don't want the phone to even ring, and that's what we're doing,\" said Foss.\n\nNomorobo and T-Mobile's Name ID app both have a small monthly fee.\n\nCBS News reached out to all 14 phone carriers that received a letter from the FCC. The majority responded and said they will tell the FCC today what they are preparing to do to adopt the new call authentication system in 2019.\n\nWhether the carriers will all be able to deploy the system in 2019 remains to be seen."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Mexican ex-cartel boss dies after heart attack in jail", "description": "Hector Manuel Beltran Leyva's family-run cartel was once a leading player in drug trafficking, controlling the U.S. border in Sonora", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hector-manuel-beltran-leyva-mexican-cartel-boss-el-h-dies-heart-attack-prison/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/02/acf642c4-b04c-400b-9cbb-b355ccf1bcbf/thumbnail/1200x630/d19ffb214f969f09fb2a55116604d47c/456489992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:13:22Z", "content": "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican drug boss Hector Manuel Beltran Leyva, once one of Mexico's most-wanted men, died Sunday after suffering a heart attack in jail.
