Ricardo Rossello released a letter Tuesday in which he asked the U.S. government to cover all costs linked to debris removal and emergency protective measures, declare the entire island a distressed area for tax break purposes and provide a tourism tax credit, among other things. While he called Congress \"an instrumental partner,\" he also demanded equal treatment for the people of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens.\n\n\"Significant emergency response work remains to be done on the island,\" he wrote in the letter dated Monday. \"Time is of the essence, and continued action by Congress now is critical.\"\n\nRossello said the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency is no longer fully funding things such as temporary generators, the demolition of buildings and tree removal. He said this is a major concern because \"numerous\" critical facilities still rely on generators, millions of cubic yards of debris still have to be cleared and more than 15,000 properties have to be cleaned or demolished.\n\nHe said his administration appealed FEMA's decision to withdraw funds while the island struggles to restructure a portion of its more than $70 billion public debt amid a 12-year recession.\n\n\"The current fiscal situation ... means that the withdrawal of full federal support for recovery efforts will significantly hinder the ability of Puerto Ricans to rebuild their homes, businesses, and infrastructure,\" Rossello wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for FEMA did not immediately return a request for comment, nor did the office for U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was among the letter's recipients.\n\nRossello also requested additional disaster appropriation of $600 million for a federal food assistance program that serves more than 1 million people on the island of 3.3 million inhabitants. He said that previous receipt of additional funding from Congress is helping almost 153,000 other Puerto Ricans participating in the program, but the money is expected to run out early next year.\n\nThe governor also is seeking two more years of Medicaid funding for a total of $3.18 billion, noting that additional funds previously approved for coverage will also dry up in 2019. In addition, Rossello requested a 25 percent tax credit for certain investments related to tourism projects in the next five years.\n\n\"Congress must not delay action on Puerto Rico's requests,\" he wrote.\n\nThe letter was released on the same day that a federal judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process for Puerto Rico agencies approved a key disclosure statement that is part of a tentative deal reached with certain creditors. A hearing on the deal is scheduled for January. If approved, it would help the government save $17.5 billion."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "\"CBS Evening News\" headlines for Tuesday, November 20, 2018", "description": "Here's a look at the top stories making headlines on the \"CBS Evening News\" with Jeff Glor.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/cbs-evening-news-headlines-for-tuesday-november-20-2018/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/12/12/77e5d36d-5915-46ce-b496-218c87d98c5d/thumbnail/1200x630/15dcb72c6fdec4125306ed9638345480/cbsnews-1600x900.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:50:38Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "CDC issues warning not to eat romaine lettuce amid E. coli outbreak", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning people not to eat romaine lettuce amid a new outbreak of E. coli.

Wagstaffe said his office is still investigating whether the officers committed a crime by using excessive force and said a charging decision was still pending. He said he expects to release the videos within the next several weeks, and wouldn't comment on the video's content.\n\nIn the Facebook post, Ebele Okobi said the videos contradict a statement from the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office saying a deputy first approached her brother because he was \"running in and out of traffic,\" and her brother \"immediately assaulted an officer.\"\n\nRather, she said, the videos show her brother \u2014 a father and graduate of Morehouse College \u2014 walking along a sidewalk carrying bags when a deputy pulled up alongside him in his patrol vehicle, and said he needs to question him.\n\nShe said her brother gave an inaudible answer in the video, then walked to the intersection, checked for traffic and crossed the street. She said the deputy then called in a \"Code 3,\" meaning to send back-up for an emergency.\n\nThe deputy sped up to cut off her brother as another police car sped up in front of him. One deputy came out of her car and rushed into Chinedu Okobi, as he twisted to the side and moved his hands up.\n\nEbele Okobi said deputies grabbed her brother and ripped off his jacket. As he tried to run, another deputy hit him with a Taser and he fell to the street, crying. Ebele Okobi said her brother was still holding his hands in air.\n\n\"He is not fighting, just crying in pain. I will never forget the visual of his hands, waving above his head, open, begging,\" Ebele Okobi wrote in the Facebook post.\n\nEbele Okobi said the deputies continue to Taser her brother and one struck him with a baton. Her brother at some point tried to run across the street, Ebele Okobi said, and the deputies chased him, Tasered him, pepper sprayed him and jumped on top of him.\n\nShe described audio of one of the deputies saying, \"Stay on top of him, stay on top of him.\" Someone asked if her brother was still breathing, and someone else shouted, \"I see blood!\"\n\nShe said her brother died on the sidewalk, and said no one attempted CPR or other life-saving procedures.\n\nShe disputed the police version of events: \"My brother never attacked any of the deputies. He did not assault anyone. My baby brother, as big as he was, didn't even defend himself.\"\n\nWagstaffe, who is investigating the death, told CBS News last month deputies initially approached Okobi because they were worried about his safety. He said Okobi resisted officers, and when they couldn't gain control of him using their hands, two deputies deployed their Tasers. Okobi was Tasered between three and four times, Wagstaffe said.\n\nIn the Facebook post, Ebele Okobi called on Wagstaffe and the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office to \"correct the record\" in regard to an earlier statement her brother had assaulted deputies and was running in and out of traffic. She said that statement led her to believe her brother, who dealt with mental illness, could have been suffering from a mental-health crisis. Now, she said she believes the sheriff's initial account to be a lie.\n\n\"I knew that my brother didn't 'attack' or 'assault' deputies, but because of his mental illness, I believed it was possible that he might have been in crisis and acting erratically,\" Ebele Okobi said in the Facebook post. \"None of that would have justified him being killed, but there isn't even a reason, at all, that my brother was stopped. My brother's medical history has nothing at all to do with why he was stopped and killed.\"\n\nWagstaffe said his office never said Chinedu Okobi assaulted officers, and said that information was released through the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office. The sheriff's office did not return a call and an email from CBS News requesting comment.\n\nThe office identified the four deputies and one sergeant involved to the San Francisco Chronicle as John DeMartini, Alyssa Lorenzatti, Joshua Wang, Bryan Watt and David Weidner. A spokeswoman told the paper all had been placed on administrative leave but have since returned to the job.\n\nEbele Okobi also called on Wagstaffe to publicly release the videos.\n\n\"If people saw what my family saw, they would see what a miscarriage of justice it was,\" Okobi told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"They would see why we're so appalled that police officers could do this.\"\n\nWagstaffe said he would likely release the videos by mid-December, ahead of the completion of the investigation. He said he's awaiting interviews with several witnesses, and the completion of an autopsy report that will determine Chinedu Okobi's cause of death before he releases them.\n\nHe said he wanted to make sure the family viewed the videos before the public.\n\n\"I care about this family and what they're going through,\" Wagstaffe said.

Rand Paul, an ally of the president but ardent critic of America's relationship with the Saudis, wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe lawmaker from Kentucky accused National Security Adviser and foreign policy hawk John Bolton of writing the statement and criticized American assistance to the Saudi-led coalition waging a bloody war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\n\"We should, at the very least, NOT reward Saudi Arabia with our sophisticated armaments that they in turn use to bomb civilians,\" Paul added.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has largely embraced the administration's doctrine across the world, wrote on Twitter that \"our foreign policy must be about promoting our national interests.\" The junior senator from Florida stressed that defending human rights is vital to America's national security because human rights violations fuel \"mass migration,\" foster extremism and benefit governments hostile to the U.S.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the U.S. can't overlook Khashoggi's high-profile killing and alleged dismemberment, and suggested that there was bipartisan support among lawmakers to sanction individuals involved in the assassination, including members of the royal family.\n\n\"While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the Crown Prince \u2013 in multiple ways \u2013 has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic,\" Graham added.\n\nConstant Trump critics Sen.

He said U.S. intelligence agencies are still probing Khashoggi's murder. \"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" President Trump said in a statement, referring to the possibility that the Saudi Crown Prince ordered the journalist's brutal killing.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats \u2014 who will have control of important House committees that could potentially investigate Khashoggi's assassination and the U.S.-Saudi alliance \u2014 were more scathing in their criticism and directly referenced the president.\n\n\"The President's failure to hold Saudi Arabia responsible in any meaningful way for the death of Jamal Khashoggi is just one more example of this White House's retreat from American leadership on issues like human rights and protecting the free press,\" the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement.\n\nAlthough he said the government should always consider the U.S.' close cooperation with the oil-rich kingdom, Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., accused President Trump of damaging America's \"standing as a champion of human rights.\"\n\n\"To suggest 'maybe he did and maybe he didn't' or that we are incapable of finding out the truth, or that knowing the truth our silence can be bought with arms sales, undermines respect for the Office of the Presidency,\" Schiff said.\n\nAfter labeling President Trump's response a \"betrayal of long-established American values of respect for human rights,\" Fred Ryan, the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post, the newspaper for which Khashoggi penned opinion pieces, called on the administration to make the intelligence evidence on the murder public and urged Congress to act in the wake of \"failure of leadership\" from the White House.\n\n\"President Trump is correct in saying the world is a very dangerous place,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"His surrender to this state-ordered murder will only make it more so.

DNA evidence points to Michael Sumpter as the man who killed Jane Britton, who was sexually assaulted and bludgeoned to death in her Cambridge apartment in January 1969, Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan said.\n\nBritton's slaying is the third killing that Sumpter has been linked to since his death at age 54.\n\nInvestigators have said he is also responsible for the slayings of two other women in the Boston area in the 1970s. He died of cancer shortly after being paroled from a 15- to 20-year sentence for raping a woman in her Boston apartment in 1975, Ryan's office said.\n\nInvestigators gathered a DNA sample from a male relative of Sumpter to help close Britton's case, Ryan said. It's the oldest case her office has been able to solve, she told reporters.\n\nMiddlesex County DA\n\n\"I am confident that the mystery of who killed Jane Britton has finally been solved and this case is officially closed,\" Ryan said in a statement.\n\nBritton was studying anthropology at Harvard, and her father was at the time a vice president at Radcliffe College, a women's school in Cambridge that later merged with Harvard. Her body was found on her blood-stained mattress by her boyfriend who went to check on her when she didn't show up for a test that morning, prosecutors said. The night before her body was found, she had gone to dinner with classmates and went ice skating with her boyfriend in Cambridge.\n\nToxicology testing revealed that the alcohol she drank that evening didn't have time to metabolize in her bloodstream before she died, suggesting she was killed shortly after returning to her apartment.\n\nNeighbors told police they heard someone on the fire escape that connected to Britton's fourth-floor apartment on the night she was killed, according to the district attorney's office. Ryan said she believes Sumpter entered the woman's apartment through a window.\n\nOver the years, according to a District Attorney statement, investigators followed up on numerous leads regarding people with suspected ties to Britton. But over time, memories faded and witnesses died, making the case more of a challenge for investigators.\n\nThe break in the case came in October of 2017 when, for the first time, the Massachusetts State Police crime lab was able to obtain a male DNA profile through additional testing from evidence collected from the crime scene, according to the district attorney's office. In July, the crime lab notified investigators of a match between the profile and Sumpter's DNA, which was on file in a state database.\n\nThough Sumpter was already deceased, investigators were able to confirm the match by collecting a DNA sample from his brother. Sumpter's brother was excluded as a possible match, according to the DA's office.\n\nBritton's brother thanked officials for keeping active the investigation into the crime that \"shattered Jane's promising young life\" and his family.\n\n\"The DNA evidence match may be all we ever have as a conclusion. Learning to understand and forgive remains a challenge,\" the Rev. Boyd Britton, vicar at an Anglican church in Santa Barbara, California, said in a statement.\n\nSumpter was also linked by DNA in 2012 to the sexual assault and killing of 24-year-old Mary Lee McClain in her Beacon Hill apartment. Two years earlier, authorities said DNA suggested he was also responsible for the rape and slaying of 23-year-old Ellen Rutchick in the city's Back Bay neighborhood. DNA has also linked him to a rape in Boston in 1985, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors say they don't believe he knew any of his victims. Sumter had tis to Cambridge and had lived there as a young child, the district attorney said. In 1967, less than two years before Britton's murder, he was working on Arrow Street in Cambridge, about a mile from Britton's apartment.\n\nRelatives of Sumpter couldn't immediately be found through public records."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Major chickenpox outbreak in anti-vax hot spot", "description": "Thirty-six children in North Carolina have been diagnosed at a private school where many families claim religious exemption from vaccines", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-carolina-chickenpox-outbreak-in-anti-vaccine-hot-spot-asheville-waldorf-school/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/09/02/87ae430a-27d8-4ac7-b891-b4b27e121c57/thumbnail/1200x630/ce2505b2f684b6169954292dbc574c89/ap-414597619601.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:48:04Z", "content": "North Carolina is experiencing its worst chickenpox outbreak in decades as 36 children have been diagnosed at a private school where many families claim religious exemption from vaccines.

In fact, even while knowing of its conclusions, the department repeatedly argued that state and other federal authorities do not have jurisdiction over Navient's business practices.\n\n\"The existence of this audit makes the Department of Education's position all the more disturbing,\" said Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense Network, who worked for the Department of Education under President Barack Obama.\n\nWarren vs. DeVos\n\nThe AP received a copy of the audit and other documents from the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who has been a vocal critic of Navient, has publicly supported the lawsuits against the company and has questioned the policies of the Department of Education, currently run by President Donald Trump's Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. Warren is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2020.\n\nNavient disputed the audit's conclusions in its response to the DoE and has denied the allegations in the lawsuits. One point the company makes in its defense is that its contract with the department doesn't require its customer-service representatives to mention all options available to the borrower.\n\nHowever, the five states suing Navient -- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington, California and Mississippi -- said the behavior breaks their laws regarding consumer protection. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said in its own lawsuit the practices are unfair, deceptive and abusive, and break federal consumer protection laws.\n\nOf the five states that filed lawsuits against Navient, only Illinois and Pennsylvania were even aware of the audit, and they said they didn't receive their copies from the Department of Education. The CFPB declined to comment on whether it had a copy of the report.\n\nLimited oversight\n\nThe DoE said withholding the report was intentional, repeating the argument it has made in court and in public that it has jurisdiction only over student loan servicing issues, through its Federal Student Aid division, or FSA, which oversees student loans.\n\n\"FSA performed the review as part of its own contract oversight, not for the benefit of other agencies,\" said Liz Hill, a Department of Education spokeswoman.\n\nWhen student borrowers run into difficulties making payments, they can be offered forbearance, which allows them to delay payments for a set period of time. But under a forbearance plan, in most instances, the loan continues to accumulate interest and becomes a more expensive option in the long run.\n\nThe CFPB alleges in its lawsuit against Navient that between 2010 and 2015 Navient's behavior added nearly $4 billion in interest to student borrowers' loans through the overuse of forbearance. Navient disputes that figure.\n\n\"Tragic and infuriating\"\n\nA 2017 study by the Government Accountability Office estimated that a typical borrower of a $30,000 student loan who places their loan into forbearance for three years -- the maximum allowed for economic-hardship -- would pay an additional $6,742 in interest on that loan.\n\n\"This finding is both tragic and infuriating, and the findings appear to validate the allegations that Navient boosted its profits by unfairly steering student borrowers into forbearance when that was often the worst financial option for them,\" Warren said in a letter to Navient last week.\n\nAs part of their inquiry, DoE auditors listened in on about 2,400 randomly selected calls to borrowers from 2014 to 2017 out of a batch of 219,000. On nearly 10 percent of the calls examined, the Navient representative did not mention other options, including one type of plan that estimates the size of a monthly payment the borrower can afford based on income.\n\nAuditors wrote that many customer-service representatives failed to ask questions to determine if such a plan, known as an income-driven repayment plan, might be more beneficial to the borrower.\n\nNo public record exists that shows how many struggling borrowers serviced by Navient may have been affected by these practices. In its most recent annual report, Navient said it services 6 million student loan borrowers, of which 12.7 percent are more than 30 days past due. That would be roughly 762,000 customers who are struggling in some fashion to pay their student loans.\n\nIf one of every 10 of those customers were pushed into forbearance instead of an income-driven repayment plan, as the department's audit found, that would be 76,200 of Navient's borrowers.\n\nNo new requirements\n\nThe DoE report contains recommendations for how Navient could fix its practices but makes no mention of firm requirements or sanctions.\n\nThe DoE's Federal Student Aid division decided to do a review of Navient's forbearance practices after the CFPB filed its lawsuit against the company in January 2017, department spokeswoman Hill said, to see if any compliance issues came up.\n\nShe said DoE officials came to the conclusion that Navient was not improperly steering borrowers. \"Nothing in the report indicates forbearances were applied inappropriately,\" Hill said. \"The observations noted focused on suggested improvements regarding how to best counsel\" a small minority of borrowers.\n\nIn response to questions over the 2017 audit, Navient pointed to the fact that nine of every 10 borrowers on the calls were offered all their options and that this audit is just one piece of a broader story.\n\n\"This [audit], when viewed as a whole, as well as dozens of other audits and reviews, show that Navient overwhelmingly performs in accordance with program rules while consistently helping borrowers choose the right options for their circumstances,\" said Paul Hartwick, a company spokesman.\n\nNavient, which split off from Sallie Mae, is a publicly traded company. In calls and presentations with investors, Navient has said a company priority is to lower its operational costs.\n\nAs a student loan servicing company, Navient has one primary operating cost: its employees, including the hundreds of customer-service agents who man Navient's phones every day. The fewer customer-service agents Navient employs, the more money Navient puts in its pocket. Doing calls to determine whether a borrower should be in an income-driven repayment plan takes longer, student loan industry experts say.\n\nSticking to a contract\n\n\n\nIn fact, that is exactly what Navient said in its response to the Department of Education's audit.\n\n\"We [are not] aware of any requirement that borrowers receive all of their repayment options ... on each and every call,\" the company said, adding that if the DoE chose to require all servicers to discuss income-driven repayment plans with all borrowers, it needs to redo its contract with Navient.\n\nSeth Frotman, who was the highest-ranking government official in charge of student loans until he quit in August in protest over how the Trump-controlled Department of Education and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were handling the issue of student loans, said Navient's response was outrageous.\n\n\"In short,\" said Frotman, \"Navient, when confronted with evidence of its bad practices, is telling the government, 'Pay us more money or take a hike.' And It looks like the Department of Education took a hike.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Rain in forecast for areas affected by Camp Fire", "description": "Rain is on the way to Northern California, near the areas most affected by the Camp Fire.

He has also been one of the most vocal critics of the church's handling of its sex abuse scandal.\n\nBut this summer, Rev. Manuel La Rosa-Lopez, a priest whom DiNardo had promoted, was arrested for allegedly molesting two children. DiNardo, the archbishop of Galveston-Houston since 2006, has vowed to release by January a list of all the priests in Houston who have been, in the church's judgment, \"credibly accused\" of sexually abusing a child.\n\nNow, a CBS News investigation has uncovered a lack of action by DiNardo in handling sex abuse allegations in his own archdiocese.\n\nJohn LaBonte said Rev.

Attorneys for DiNardo's archdiocese argued that the statute of limitations had passed and the case was thrown out of court.\n\nToday, Brinkman is a priest at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn a statement, Brinkman denied any involvement: \"I cannot tell you that these events did not take place... but I was not the person who did them to him.\" The archdiocese said the victim \"provided a physical description that does not match Father Brinkman.\"\n\nPatrick Semansky / AP\n\nCBS News spent three months asking for a formal interview with DiNardo. He never made himself available, so we caught up with him in the hallway during the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Baltimore last week, and asked if he was aware there were two priests with credible sexual abuse allegations in active ministry.\n\n\"It depends what names you're talking about,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was told the allegations are against Keller and Brinkman, DiNardo replied: \"That's not a credible one. And Terry [Brinkman] was never credible.\"\n\nAs for his list of credibly accused priests he said he will release in January, DiNardo said, \"We're working on the list.\"\n\nCBS News has spoken with more than 20 people with knowledge of allegations made against priests in the archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. Not one has been contacted by church authorities or investigators.\n\nWhen DiNardo releases his list of credibly accused priests, LaBonte will be watching for one name in particular: John Keller. But he said he doesn't think he will see Keller's name there, which is why he said he wants DiNardo to do all he can.\n\n\"Don't leave any stones unturned. Put effort into it. Fix the problem,\" LaBonte said.\n\nLast month, the Department of Justice in Washington requested DiNardo and every one of the 264 Catholic dioceses across the country to preserve their private, internal documents as a federal investigation into the Catholic Church appears to be getting underway.\n\nIn his statement to CBS News, DiNardo said \"the Church of today is radically different than the Church of the 1970s and 1980s,\" adding he recognizes the need to \"squarely and transparently\" address \"any and all\" abuse allegations.\n\n\"I want to assure my brothers and sisters in Christ that we are cooperating, and will cooperate, fully with any investigation involving possible abuse,\" DiNardo said. \"While the Church as a whole has made important strides especially since 2002 in addressing this evil, we still have important work to do. We can, and will, do better.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Andrea Park", "title": "\"Sex and the City\" insiders on Kim Cattrall drama", "description": "Executive producer Michael Patrick King said it was about pay parity", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sex-and-the-city-cast-and-crew-open-up-on-kim-cattrall-drama/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/02/04/9fe1ad62-6428-43ee-9862-c6e2485c80a0/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e781bd3e46ba542ad146157d2e16b0ad/ap-885468074494.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:55:09Z", "content": "Cast and crew members from \"Sex and the City\" are opening up about why Kim Cattrall has spoken out against the franchise.

He said Parker was paid accordingly.\n\n\"The show doesn't exist if Sarah Jessica wasn't the blonde star of the show, that's number one,\" he said. \"Kim was not at the height of her career, Kristin was under her in terms of notability, Cynthia was a theater actress and their contracts reflected that status.\"\n\nKing said that while Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis were understanding of the pay differences, Cattrall never got over the disparity.\n\n\"As the show progressed, the characters, everybody grew, it became a family,\" King said. \"Kristin, Cynthia, and Sarah Jessica became one group, and Kim never joined mentally.

But Parker explained, \"The studio said, 'We can't meet those asks of hers. We're not able to do it; the economics don't make sense for us.' So then it's over.

I would've had stomachaches every day.\"\n\nIn February, Cattrall made headlines when she lashed out at Parker on social media. Parker expressed her condolences over the death of Cattrall's brother, Chris, and Cattrall responded, \"Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now. Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven't already) You are not my family. You are not my friend.

It was a professional experience, but it became personal because it was years and years of our lives, so I'm hoping that that sort of eclipses anything that's been recently spoken,\" Parker said.\n\nLast year, Cattrall told Piers Morgan on ITV of her cast mates, \"We've never been friends.

Those detained include Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, who had campaigned for the right to drive before the decades-long ban was lifted in June.\n\nAmnesty said that according to three testimonies it obtained, some of the activists were repeatedly tortured by electrocution and flogging, leaving some unable to walk or stand properly. In one instance, an activist was hung from the ceiling. Another testimony said one of the detained women was subjected to sexual harassment by interrogators wearing face masks.\n\nThe kingdom is at the center of an international firestorm after the brutal killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had written critically about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's crackdown on dissent, including the arrests of the women activists. Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered by Saudi agents in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\n\"Only a few weeks after the ruthless killing of Jamal Khashoggi, these shocking reports of torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment, if verified, expose further outrageous human rights violations by the Saudi authorities,\" said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty's Middle East research director.\n\nSome of the imprisoned activists were unable to walk or stand properly, had uncontrolled shaking of the hands and marks on their bodies. One of the activists reportedly attempted to take her own life repeatedly inside the prison, Amnesty said.\n\nAl-Hathloul, an activist in her late 20s, was held in solitary confinement for around three months after her May arrest, a person close to her told The Associated Press.\n\nShe was forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia earlier this year from the United Arab Emirates, where she was pursuing a master's degree in Abu Dhabi. Her husband was pressured into divorcing her after he too was forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia from Jordan, where he was working, according to the individual, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.\n\nSome of the men detained in that sweep include Mohammad al-Rabae, a writer and activist, and Ibrahim al-Modeimigh, a human rights lawyer who defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in 2014 and held for more than 70 days for attempting to drive from the UAE to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlso imprisoned is Samar Badawi, whose brother Raif Badawi is serving 10 years in prison and was publicly flogged in 2015 on charges related to blog posts that were critical of the kingdom's ultraconservative clerics. Others detained include Nassima al-Sada, a rights activist from the Eastern Province, and Hatoon al-Fassi, an esteemed professor of Gulf history who was recently announced as the recipient of the Academic Freedom Award by the Arizona-based Middle East Studies Association.\n\nNearly all the women detained are mothers or grandmothers and well-known in their fields of work. A few of those initially detained were in their 70s and have since been released.\n\nSome of the women detained were at the forefront of calls to lift guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can marry, obtain a passport or travel.\n\nDana Ahmed, a researcher at Amnesty, told the AP that Saudi authorities have yet to charge any of them.

Cindy Hyde-Smith expressed regret over saying that she would attend a \"public hanging\" if invited by a supporter, saying during the debate with Democrat Mike Espy Tuesday night that she apologized to \"anyone who was offended by my comments.\"\n\nShe and Espy met for the only debate before the special election on Nov. 27 in the contentious race to be elected the next U.S. senator from Mississippi. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant to fill the remainder of Sen. Thad Cochran's term after he retired this year, has been embroiled in controversy after refusing to back down from racially-tinged gaffes.\n\nA video of Hyde-Smith posted to Twitter earlier this month showed her praising a supporter, saying: \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" These comments were interpreted as insensitive because Mississippi had the most lynchings between 1882 and 1968 of any other state, with 581 lynchings. Espy, a former Clinton official and congressman, is black.\n\nLater, another video posted by the same person on Twitter, the publisher of a liberal-leaning news site, showed Hyde-Smith discussing \"liberal folks\" and making it \"just a little more difficult\" for them to vote.\n\nAt the debate on Tuesday, Hyde-Smith said that her comments had been turned into \"a political weapon to be used against me.\"\n\n\"For anyone who was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements,\" she said. \"I also recognize that this comment was twisted and was turned into a weapon to be used against me. a political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That's the kind of politics Mississippians are sick and tired of.\"\n\nEspy retorted: \"No one twisted it. It came out of your mouth. It has caused our state harm. It has rejuvenated stereotypes that we don't need.\"\n\nHyde-Smith initially refused to further explain her \"public hanging\" comments beyond an initial statement saying the reaction was overblown, and her campaign has said that the comments about creating barriers to voting were made in jest. However, the controversy is already having consequences: Walmart, the nation's largest retail chain, has asked the Hyde-Smith campaign to refund a total of $4,000 in campaign donations.\n\nMississippi has a sizable black population, which comprises nearly 40 percent of the population as a whole. Espy, who if elected would be the first black person to represent Mississippi in the Senate since Reconstruction, might be able to inspire black voters to turn out in a special election. Black voters buoyed Democrat Doug Jones to victory in his Senate race in neighboring Alabama last year.\n\nStill, Hyde-Smith is the favorite to win in the race. President Trump is visiting Mississippi on Monday to rally on her behalf and encourage Republicans to vote. Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Hyde-Smith is a \"spectacular woman\" who \"feels very badly\" about the comments she made.\n\nMost of the debate on Tuesday was spent discussing protection for patients with preexisting conditions.\n\nHyde-Smith said the legislation she is cosponsoring with Sen. Thom Tillis to protect patients with preexisting conditions shows her commitment to the issue. Espy pointed out that the legislation would require the insurance companies to cover the patient with a preexisting condition but does not require the company to provide the treatment for the condition itself. Hyde-Smith said Espy denied an employee a promotion because he had a daughter with a preexisting condition. which Espy denied.\n\nPreexisting conditions was the dominant issues but the debaters also covered illegal immigration, education shortages, and infrastructure reform.\n\nEspy presented himself as a moderate and said he had a policy of \"Mississippi first\" that would tie him to the voter, not the party or president. Hyde-Smith aligned herself with the president on each issue and encouraged viewers to claim their tickets to the two Trump rallies on Monday."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Trump heads to Mar-a-Lago for Thanksgiving holiday -- live updates - CBS News", "description": "CBS News Trump heads to Mar-a-Lago for Thanksgiving holiday -- live updates CBS News President Trump and the first lady are departing for Mar-a-Lago this afternoon after participating in the turkey pardoning ceremony at the White House.

In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nMr. Trump told reporters on the White House lawn that Khashoggi's murder was a \"shame,\" but \"it is what it is.\" \"We're not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to an arms deal with the Saudis.\n\nHe also said, \"If we abandon Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake.\"\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Mr. Trump pardoned the two turkeys \"Peas\" and \"Carrots.\" The president made some political jokes while publicly pardoning Peas.\n\nThis will be Mr. Trump's first visit to Mar-a-Lago since April, when he hosted Japanese President Shinzo Abe. The president visited the \"Winter White House\" several times at the beginning of the year, going to Mar-a-Lago eight times between January and April. This will be Mr. Trump's 18th stay at Mar-a-Lago since taking office.\n\nAlthough this is a relatively quiet week in Washington, as Congress is not in session, the remainder of the year will feature a few political battles. House Democrats will choose their caucus leader, and Mr. Trump has said that he will stump for Rep. Nancy Pelosi to become speaker of the House next term as she faces opposition from some Democrats.\n\nA partial government shutdown is set to occur unless Congress passes and Mr. Trump signs spending bills for the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies by Dec. 7. Mr. Trump said last week that unless Congress provides greater funding for a border wall, that this would be a \"very good time to do a shutdown.\" Increasing funding for a border wall remains a challenge in the lame-duck Congress, especially since Democrats may not be feeling too uncooperative.\n\nMar-a-Lago, which has an initiation fee of $200,000, often provides members the opportunity to interact with the president in a less restrictive setting. Mr. Trump has also tapped four club members for ambassadorship positions, according to the Palm Beach Post. Most recently, Mr. Trump tapped club member Lana Marks, a couture handbag designer raised in South Africa, for the post of ambassador to South Africa.\n\nMr. Trump travels to Mississippi Monday to campaign for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith who's in a Senate runoff race next week with Democrat Mike Espy.\n\nKathryn Watson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Meet the robots looking for fuel after Fukushima's Daiichi nuclear disaster", "description": "Seven years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami caused a massive nuclear meltdown in the Daiichi Power Plant, Lesley Stahl reports on the unprecedented cleanup effort.

The CIA's assessment appeared to be largely based on the control held by bin Salman.

Seven years after the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan led to a massive meltdown in the Daiichi Power Plant, Lesley Stahl reports on a clean-up effort that looks like a science fiction film. Her story on how one-of-a-kind robots are being designed for the decades-long task will be broadcast on 60 Minutes, Sunday, Nov. 25 at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT on CBS.\n\nThe earthquake struck March 11, 2011, causing several huge tsunami waves that swamped Daiichi, cutting power to the seaside facility's cooling pumps. Three reactors melted down, creating up to 3,000 tons of deadly radioactive fuel and debris that lays in the plant's ruins. Finding it and containing it safely will be a historic task says nuclear engineer Lake Barrett. \"This is a unique situation here. It's never happened in human history. It's a challenge we've never had before,\" he tells Stahl. Barrett oversaw the cleanup of the Three Mile Island partial meltdown in 1979, the worst nuclear accident at a power plant in the U.S. He is also a consultant on the Daiichi project.\n\nDaiichi can't be encased in concrete, like Chernobyl, says Barrett, because the potential for another earthquake or tsunami that could compromise the structure is too high. Humans can't get near the material; it will remain deadly for thousands of years. Authorities hope specially designed robots will find, remove and secure the toxic material in special containment vessels. But it could take 50 years and cost an estimated $200 billion.\n\nThere are four-legged robots, some that climb stairs and even robots that can swim into reactors flooded with water. They're equipped with 3-D scanners, sensors and cameras that map the terrain, measure radiation levels and look for the deadly material.\n\nThe Japanese government set up a research facility nearby to develop and test the robots. Some have been deployed in what amounts to experimentation at this early stage, says Barrett. One robot is called the Scorpion for its ability to raise its camera-carrying tail. It struck debris and became stuck only ten feet into its $100 million mission. Says Barrett, \"You learn more from failure sometimes than you do from success.\"\n\nOther early versions of robots died quick deaths, too, their cameras and operating systems fried by the intense radiation. It's a slow and steady project, says Barrett, that he is confident will get done, but not in his lifetime, nor those of many others involved. The task has been compared to putting a man on the Moon. \"It's even a bigger project in my view. But there's a will here to clean this up as there was a will to put a man on the moon,\" says Barrett."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Technology for making your Thanksgiving travel less painful", "description": "This holiday weekend is predicted to be the busiest for Thanksgiving travel since 2005", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thanksgiving-travel-tips-apps-to-download/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/20/fca94fa8-9dae-4488-be58-7da2667b7930/thumbnail/1200x630/ae3499d6a47cefc91010342d6a72d442/1120-ctm-thanksgivingtravel-vancleave-1716287-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:07:39Z", "content": "This holiday weekend is predicted to be the busiest for Thanksgiving travel since 2005.

An industry group projects a record 30.6 million passengers will fly between November 16 and 27. Sunday could set a record with TSA potentially screening more than 3 million travelers.\n\nMark Ellwood, a contributing editor at Conde Nast Traveler, joined \"CBS This Morning\" to discuss some tips to get both fliers and drivers through the holiday madness.\n\nLong drive? Download these apps\n\nTo save money at the pump, Ellwood recommends downloading Gas Buddy, an app with 60 million users that crowdsources gas prices. Another one that can help you plan your pit stops is iExit, which uses your location to tell you what's at the upcoming exits while you're on the highway. Lastly, the widely used navigation app, Waze, is indispensable when trying to figure out the fastest way to get from A to B. Waze relies on a huge network of drivers to help recommend the best route.\n\nDitch a digital map for a real one\n\nEllwood is a \"big fan of the analog map.\" He suggests grabbing one to help reduce arguing in the car \u2013 and to generate conversation. \"You kind of look at the features. It's a conversation starter\u2026.I think that will calm people down.\"\n\nDon't scream it, tweet it\n\nTaking to Twitter can, surprisingly, be a win-win for a frustrated passenger and the airline that's causing their pain. Ellwood suggests tweeting politely at the carrier you're flying with and telling them you have a problem. Follow the airline too so they can direct message you and privately help with the matter.\n\n\"Then they can publicly say 'We're so glad we helped you.' They basically get a PR Win. They show that they helped you and it's very quick,\" Ellwood said.\n\nInterlining\n\nInterlining is an airline industry term Ellwood thinks everyone should know. In simple terms, it refers to when airlines work together.\n\n\"It involves an awful lot of things, but one of the things it can mean is if your flight is canceled, another airline could accommodate you. So you could end up on another carrier, but getting to your destination quicker. It won't apply it all circumstances. But it's worth, again, politely asking, are there any interlining agreements that could help,\" Ellwood said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Ashley Welch", "title": "Thanksgiving road trip survival tips", "description": "Expert advice to help make the drive to your holiday gathering as safe and stress-free as possible", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/thanksgiving-road-trip-survival-tips/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/11/22/4533b5a5-355b-4112-b1e2-00e3778f01c7/thumbnail/1200x630/37e817220f2df4fbd17d258e490ff137/istock-846743196.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:03:43Z", "content": "Getty Images/iStockphoto If you have a long ride ahead of you, plan ahead and pack healthy snacks to keep you alert and energized on the road. \"Choose portable options that will fit simply into an insulated bag, like fresh produce such as grapes, whole apples\u2026 [+645 chars]", "fulltext": "A soldier says a stranger's Christmas card got him through Vietnam.

The blaze erupted on November 8 and experts say it likely won't be fully contained until the end of the month.\n\n\"The other issue is the exposed population. The way the wind's been blowing, it's been blowing it right across through Sacramento and right to the San Francisco Bay where we have literally millions of people,\" Avol said.\n\nHe also notes that the smoke contains toxins beyond just traces of burning wood from the wildfire. \"It's also homes and buildings and the plastics and the asphalt shingles and furniture and everything else that was in the homes that's now up in the air combusted. So there's lots of chemicals in the air,\" Avol said.\n\nAlthough the Woolsey Fire in the southern part of the state hasn't been as widespread, its smoke enveloped a large part of Los Angeles and the health risks there would be similar.\n\nFor people who need to spend time outside, experts recommend wearing a N95 face mask. \"Just putting a rag over your face really won't accomplish much,\" Avol said.\n\nStaying inside, closing windows, and running air conditioners and your car's ventilation system on recirculate will also help to somewhat reduce exposure."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS Radio News", "title": "REPORTERS NOTEBOOK: BAD YEAR", "description": "Think YOU'RE having a bad year?

She also sports long red hair in the photo. Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood was behind the getup.\n\nRose's version of Batwoman will be different in that her iteration will be an out lesbian. Rose is slated star in her own \"Batwoman\" series, which could hit the CW in the 2019-2020 TV season. If the project makes it to series, Batwoman will be the first gay lead character in a live-action superhero TV show.\n\nProducers Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schecter and showrunner Caroline Dries describe the character as complex: \"Armed with a passion for social justice and a flair for speaking her mind, Kate Kane soars onto the streets of Gotham as Batwoman, an out lesbian and highly trained street fighter primed to snuff out the failing city's criminal resurgence. But don't call her a hero yet. In a city desperate for a savior, Kate must overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be Gotham's symbol of hope.\"\n\nIn August, Rose wrote online that she was happy her character would be open about her sexual orientation, saying, \"The Bat is out of the bag and I am beyond thrilled and honored. I'm also an emotional wreck.. because this is a childhood dream. This is something I would have died to have seen on TV when I was a young member of the LGBT community who never felt represented on tv and felt alone and different.\"\n\nBut soon, Rose was slammed by trolls who said she was \"not gay enough\" because she has identified as gender-fluid, and that she was not Jewish (Kane is a Jewish character). Rose consequently left Twitter.\n\nThe three-night DC crossover event kicks off with \"The Flash\" on Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, followed by \"Arrow\" on Dec. 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT and \"Supergirl\" on Dec. 11 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "How you can be a conscious shopper and help curb fashion's carbon footprint", "description": "Fashion accounts for 8.1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 85 percent of unwanted clothing end up in landfills", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eileen-fisher-patagonia-fashion-brands-try-to-curb-carbon-footprint/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/20/273720c4-b6f4-4dc2-9853-f0352718de89/thumbnail/1200x630/e2c26240c217b98dad9ac7669de95b77/1120-ctm-sustainablefashion-quijano-1716367-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:03:06Z", "content": "Clothing is a popular item on many holiday shopping lists.

But some fashion companies want shoppers to buy fewer clothes in order to cut pollution.\n\nAt a tiny factory in Irvington, New York, Eileen Fisher's small but mighty team of socially conscious employees are trying to make a dent in fashion's carbon footprint with their Renew program.\n\n\n\n\"We get between four and 6,000 pieces a week,\" Fisher told CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano.\n\nThe program buys back worn Eileen Fisher pieces and sorts them to determine if they can be resold, resewn or remade.\n\n\n\n\"We see it as an important long-term investment for us. It's a bit hard to rationalize that cost but we do it because... we think it's the right thing to do and because we believe there's going to be no business done on a dead planet. So we better do the best we can,\" Fisher said.\n\nThe average person buys 60 percent more clothing today than 18 years ago, according to McKinsey & Company. Researchers also estimate the fashion industry will use 25 percent of the world's carbon budget by 2050, the estimated amount of carbon dioxide emissions the planet can have without the worst effects of climate change.\n\nFashion accounts for 8.1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 85 percent of unwanted clothing ends up in landfills, piling up to more than 12 million tons annually.\n\n\"It's daunting. It's -- yeah, some days I try not to get depressed. Some days I say, 'Oh, my God. It feels like we're moving deck chairs on the Titanic,'\" Fisher said. \"I'm just like, 'Oh, how many years do we have? Twelve before catastrophe strikes us.' \u2026 We're only a drop in the bucket\u2026 and we're trying to be a role model for other companies.\"\n\nOther companies have tapped into the sustainable market too, like Patagonia whose Worn Wear program encourages customers to patch up old clothing rather than buy new. Even Ikea is testing a program to buy back their old furniture and H&M offers a recycling program where customers get 15 percent off when they bring in used items.\n\n\n\nBut sustainability expert Maxine Bedat says coupons just encourage more consumption, and only about one out of every 1,000 pieces sold is ever recycled.\n\n\n\n\"The last figures that have come in are showing that there are 150 billion new pieces of clothing that are made every single year,\" Bedat said. \"If you look even at the global population, that's a disposable wardrobe for every man, woman, and child on the planet, every single year.\"\n\nShe said consumers need to be more conscious shoppers.\n\n\n\n\"You don't have to be wealthy to make these sustainable choices,\" Quijano said.\n\n\n\n\"Exactly, you can learn a lot from the clothes just from looking at the tags and looking at the inside of the garment,\" Bedat said. \"I think that's the takeaway. It's not about, you know, getting a PhD in sustainability. It's about finding the clothes that we really love and only using our hard-earned money to purchase things that we're really gonna want to wear in the future.\"\n\nEileen Fisher's Renew program, has sold nearly $3 million worth of garments that would otherwise have ended up in landfills. Finding ways to reuse versus throwing away unwanted clothing could actually save taxpayer money. In New York City alone, it costs $85 million a year to collect and dispose of unwanted clothing."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Fallout from cease-fire between Hamas and Israel", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu retained a slim majority in parliament following dissension over his response to the conflict with Hamas in Gaza.

The contribution was reported several days after Hyde-Smith was caught on camera joking alongside one of her longtime supporters that if he ever invited her to attend a public hanging, she'd sit in the front row.\n\nHyde-Smith and her campaign later clarified that the comment was a bad joke. But talk of public hangings in a state with a deep history of them earned a strong rebuke from her Democratic opponent, Mike Espy, who is African-American, other Mississippi Democrats and national civil rights groups.\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy are set to appear at a televised debate on Tuesday ahead of a Nov. 27 runoff election. Neither candidate earned at least 50 percent of the vote on Election Day. Espy is a deep underdog in the contest, given that Mississippi has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1982. CBS News rates this race \"leans Republican.\"\n\nMessing, co-star of NBC's \"Will and Grace\" and an active Twitter user known for touting her liberal views, called out the retail giant for making the donation on Monday, linking to a blog that had flagged the contribution. The Popular Information blog first noticed on Monday that Walmart's PAC for Responsible Government had donated the $2,000.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Walmart replied to Messing via Twitter: \"Completely understand your concern.

They had received a report from environmentalists that villagers surrounded the dead whale and were beginning to butcher the rotting carcass, park chief Heri Santoso said.\n\nSantoso said researchers from wildlife conservation group WWF and the park's conservation academy found about 13 pounds of plastic waste in the animal's stomach, including four plastic bottles, 25 plastic bags, a nylon sack and more than 1,000 other assorted pieces of plastic.\n\n\"Although we have not been able to deduce the cause of death, the facts that we see are truly awful,\" said Dwi Suprapti, a marine species conservation coordinator at WWF Indonesia.\n\nShe said it was not possible to determine if the plastic had caused the whale's death because of the animal's advanced state of decay.\n\nIndonesia, an archipelago of 260 million people, is the world's second-largest plastic polluter after China, according to a study published in the journal Science in January.

The jurors were shown a photo of the pistol decorated with Guzman's initials as the witness described the brutal way the cartel dealt with various violent threats and personal slights.\n\nAccording to Zambada, he was told by his older brother, Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, that a 2004 meeting between Guzman and a competitor named Rodolfo Fuentes ended poorly when Fuentes didn't shake his hand. The brother claimed afterward that Guzman made it clear he wanted Fuentes dead, and ended up ordering his killing.\n\nAlso assassinated were a corrupt police commander in 2008 for telling people \"that he was going to finish off my brother and Chapo,\" and another drug dealer who was struck down by \"a hail of bullets from AK-47\" that nearly took off his head, the witness said.\n\nZambada described being told by one of his paid informants within law enforcement that authorities were close to capturing Guzman. It was suggested that the cartel should give a $250,000 bribe to a ranking officer, after which, \"The operation was aborted. There was no problem,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice via REUTERS\n\nThe defense has argued that cooperators like Zambada are framing Guzman to win favor from the court in their own criminal cases. On cross-examination Monday, the defense sought to suggest Zambada was minimizing his own role in the cartel and exaggerating that of Guzman as a mythical kingpin known for escaping Mexican prisons, when really they say he was in hiding most of his life of crime and not calling the shots.\n\nDefense attorney William Purpura asked Zambada how it was possible Guzman outranked him when there was evidence Guzman needed to go through him to get his supplies of cocaine. For emphasis, the lawyer pulled down Zambada's mugshot from a lower portion of a cartel organizational chart on display in the courtroom and held it above one of Guzman.\n\n\"How does that look?\" the lawyer asked. \"Fine,\" the witness said with a smirk before quickly qualifying the answer by adding, \"I'm below him.\"\n\nGuzman, who was captured in 2014 and extradited to New York City early last year, has pleaded not guilty to drug-trafficking charges.

He says the U.S. has only provided a \"miniscule\" $20 billion in aid.\n\nJanjua went so far as to say that \"no other country had paid a heavier price than Pakistan in the fight against terrorism,\" adding that the U.S. leadership acknowledged on multiple occasions that Pakistan's cooperation helped in \"decimating\" al Qaeda.\n\n\"Peace remains elusive\" in Afghanistan\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is trying, thus far in vain, to push a peace deal between the Afghan government and the Afghan Taliban to end the war which began with the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nAs the latest round of U.S.-Taliban talks in Qatar failed to bring any breakthroughs, a new U.S. assessment said on Monday that military and political signs point toward continued stalemate in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. and Afghan governments have made \"little clear progress\" recently in compelling the Taliban to negotiate a peace deal, according to the report by the Pentagon inspector general.\n\n\"Progress toward peace remains elusive,\" Glenn A. Fine, the acting inspector general, wrote in an introduction to a comprehensive review of military, political and humanitarian conditions in Afghanistan during the July-September period. These were the final three months of the 17th year of a war that began in October 2001.\n\nTrump\u2019s false assertions add insult to the injury Pak has suffered in US WoT in terms of lives lost & destabilised & economic costs. He needs to be informed abt historical facts. Pak has suffered enough fighting US's war. Now we will do what is best for our people & our interests \u2014 Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) November 19, 2018\n\nThe Afghan Taliban has historic ties to the Pakistani government, and many analysts believe Pakistan's security forces still hold more sway over the extremist group than anyone or anything else.\n\nThe Pentagon report offered little support for the Trump administration's assertions that its revised war strategy, announced in August 2017, is bringing the Afghan government and the Taliban insurgency closer to peace and reconciliation. When he visited Kabul in July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strategy \"is indeed working.\"\n\nWith that backdrop, Pakistan's foreign secretary noted in her statement on Tuesday that \"Pakistan and the U.S. were working in close coordination with other regional stake holders in order to end the prolonged conflict\" in Afghanistan.\n\n\"At this critical juncture, baseless allegations about a closed chapter of history could seriously undermine this vital cooperation,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "CTM Spotify Playlist: November 20, 2018", "description": "Keep up with the music we play on \"CBS This Morning\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-this-morning-spotify-playlist-november-20-2018/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/08/07/705947bf-8245-41cc-9fea-53ba0ae33fdd/thumbnail/1200x630/6fdff0f884bbeee1d117ac48a837f20c/gettyimages-911520450.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:16:32Z", "content": "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts. \"Home\" \u2013 Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros \"\u2026 [+518 chars]", "fulltext": "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts.\n\n\"Home\" \u2013 Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros\n\n\"Mary Jane\" \u2013 Rick James\n\n\"Pass The Dutchie\" \u2013 Musical Youth\n\n\"Learn to Fly\" \u2013 Foo Fighters\n\n\"True Lies\" \u2013 Kenny Wayne Shepherd\n\n\"Poker Face\" \u2013 Lady Gaga\n\n\"Beloved\" \u2013 Mumford & Sons\n\n\"Battle Cry\" \u2013 Imagine Dragons\n\n\"Travels\" \u2013 The Smashing Pumpkins\n\n\"Zak and Sara\" \u2013 Ben Folds\n\n\"In Between Days\" \u2013 The Cure\n\n\"Smooth\" \u2013 Santana, Rob Thomas\n\n\"Supermodel (You Better Work)\" \u2013 RuPaul\n\n\"Roam\" \u2013 The B-52's\n\n\"Teachers\" \u2013 Young the Giant\n\n\"I'm Just a Bill\" \u2013 The Little Singers\n\n\"Never Let You Go\" \u2013 Third Eye Blind\n\n\"Crystal Ball\" - Keane"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Fashion companies try to curb carbon footprint", "description": "Clothing is a popular item on many holiday shopping lists, but some fashion companies want shoppers to buy fewer clothes in order to cut pollution.

But some days, an unlikely teacher comes to show students how the government works.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana is known for his sharp questions, his colorful quips and his willingness to work across party lines, but what many don't know is he's also made a name for himself in the classroom as Mr. Kennedy. The senator occasionally teaches at McKinley Magnet in his home state of Louisiana, which allows him to interact with a younger generation who, as \"CBS This Morning\" co-host John Dickerson found out, is often disillusioned by politics.\n\nOutside the classroom, Kennedy told Dickerson that more than a decade of substitute teaching has taught him not every child is lucky enough to go to a school like McKinley.\n\n\"I remember one little girl wrote, 'I wish my daddy would stop coming over to the house and taking momma's money and hittin' her,'\" Kennedy said. \"That's what you're facing. That's what kids are facing. That's what teachers are facing\u2026.but on the other hand, you have classes like this, and these kids were whip-smart.\"\n\nAs Dickerson witnessed at McKinley, students still had questions 90 minutes into Kennedy's class -- not exactly the norm for a middle school classroom.\n\n\"As a country, we can't teach kids how to read and write when we got 18 years to do it. And that's -- that's a disgrace,\" Kennedy said. \"For the most part, I think teachers do a great job, but they take the kids as they find 'em, and it's -- it's a hell of a lot harder to be a kid today, I can tell you.\"\n\nCBS News\n\n\n\nKennedy also surpassed the expectations of eighth graders Sophia Schafer, Dylan Harms, Malayasia Moses and Tra Alston. Sophia felt Kennedy did better than what she would have expected from a senator. Beyond the lesson plan, he made them feel a bit better about politics today.\n\n\"I do feel like it's a lot because many people have different opinions. And, to me, politics is opinions, just different point of views,\" Tra said. Added Dylan, \"Just because somebody has one opinion doesn't mean that they can't be your friend and that they're not nice people. And that's what we learned today with this talk with Senator Kennedy. He's a really nice guy.\"\n\nFor Malayasia, politics is a passion. She doesn't feel like our political system is working as it should.\n\n\"Our president is using a lot of racist rhetoric\u2026as if he's trying to scare a part of America and it does scare me sometimes\u2026it's definitely not normal. But I think that we've accepted it as normal,\" Malayasia said. \"That's probably why I want to be involved in it, because of how much it's affected me and how I feel, every day really. So that's why sometimes I feel like I want to make a difference in politics.\"\n\nDickerson questioned Kennedy about the fact that Malayasia was scared about her country because of President Trump, to which he said. \"I don't think anybody in America ought to be scared.\"\n\n\"Clearly, the president, this is the way he's made. He grows anxious when he has an unexpressed thought. He likes to think out loud and I have suggested to him before that his tweeting a little bit less will not cause brain damage. But he's gonna do what he's gonna do,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\n\nKennedy acknowledged that the president of the United States should be held to a higher standard, but said, \"I guess what I'm saying is, he thinks he's meeting it.\"\n\n\"And I understand the president makes people angry, but it's an academic discussion. It's a problem we're not gonna solve. It's an issue we're not gonna agree on. So let's go to work and try to do something for the American people.\"\n\nIn the classroom, Kennedy talked about a system constrained by its founders, but after nearly two years in the Senate, he admits reality is different.\n\n\"There's some jerks. There's some big egos. There are a few that think they're one of the Founding Fathers\u2026in both parties,\" Kennedy said. \"Some of my colleagues say, 'Well I can't vote on that. I can't take a vote on that\u2026.Why are you here? Grow some guts, you know. People can get mad at you, but they can't eat you and they can't kill you.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nIt's those kinds of turns of phrase that have made Kennedy a popular interview on Capitol Hill. But underneath the jokes, Kennedy has hope the next Congress can come together on issues like infrastructure and government spending.\n\n\"Everybody wants to go to heaven. Nobody's quite ready to make the trip and that's the way it is with the budget, but I can tell you how the American people look at this\u2026.They say, 'How did some of you people make it through the birth canal?'\" Kennedy said.\n\nAt McKinley, Kennedy's students hope their senator takes a lesson on good citizenship back to Washington.\n\n\"I think we should all remember that we're all human beings. We all have feelings\u2026.Maybe we should stop shouting at each other and maybe, you know, talk to each other,\" Sophia Schaefer said.\n\nFor Malayasia Moses, being a citizen means wanting the best for your country.\n\n\"Help the people that don't have as many advantages as you have. And I think basically being a citizen means to be a brother or sister to your neighbor.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Crews under pressure to find wildfire victims' remains before storm", "description": "Some fire-ravaged parts of Northern California could get half an inch of rain per hour, which could trigger mudslides", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/california-fires-latest-2018-11-20-camp-woolsey-paradise-recovery-search-rescue-live-updates/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/20/d23f324f-8837-4773-9dcf-71ee704f8c11/thumbnail/1200x630/375e41f8708b95012102a08244c4ddd8/california-wildfires-1062499906.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:03:57Z", "content": "Several companies around the country are brewing up some help for survivors of Northern California's devastating Camp Fire, reports CBS Sacramento.

It was unclear whether they had defense attorneys.\n\n6ix9ine has been one of the most ascendant and controversial names in hip-hop in recent months. His album \"Day69: Graduation Day\" was among the top records on iTunes following its February release.\n\nHe is also known for the multiplatinum hit \"Fefe\" with Nicki Minaj, which peaked at No. 3 on the pop charts, and \"Stoopid,\" featuring the incarcerated rapper Bobby Shmurda.\n\nBut 6ix9ine also has had a series of run-ins with law enforcement and has publicly identified himself as a member of a violent New York gang, 9 Trey Bloods.\n\nIn a superseding indictment unsealed Monday in Manhattan federal court, 6ix9ine was charged in connection with what prosecutors described as \"Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods,\" which they said carried out acts of murder, robbery and narcotics trafficking in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn since at least 2013.\n\nThe indictment said each gang member was required to carry out at least two acts of racketeering conspiracy. Those acts could include murder, robbery, extortion and drug distribution, the court papers said.\n\nIn April, according to the indictment, 6ix9ine and others participated in a gunpoint robbery of the gang's rivals.\n\nThen in mid-July, the court papers said, the rapper joined three others and agreed to shoot an individual who had shown disrespect to gang members.

Most of the women who will join Congress in January are Democrats, and the poll finds Democrats are especially enthusiastic about more women in Congress.\n\nFar more Americans say things in Congress will work better, not worse, with the addition of more women in its ranks. More diversity of people in politics is the top choice (46 percent) as the reason why things will work better, followed by women being better at negotiating (26 percent), and women raising issues you care about (21 percent).\n\nViews on women in Congress divide more along partisan lines than gender. Democratic women (71 percent) are far more likely than Republican women (71 percent) to be excited about more women members and to think Congress will work better.\n\nThe number of Republican women in the House will actually decrease next year, but just 20 percent of Republicans think their party should make more effort to recruit women candidates. More than half of Republicans say this issue doesn't matter much to them, and another quarter say the party is already making efforts to recruit women. Republican women and Republican men hold similar views with roughly half of each saying this issue doesn't matter that much to them.\n\nOverall, Democrats (46 percent) are actually more likely than Republicans (20 percent) to say the GOP should do more to recruit women candidates.\n\nIn the wake of the Democrats winning control of the House, positive views of the party have risen. Forty-nine percent of Americans now have a favorable view of the Democratic party, a jump of 11 points since before the election, and the party's highest favorable rating since late 2012, shortly after Barack Obama was reelected. This spike in favorability is largely among Democrats. Ninety-one percent of Democrats have a favorable view of their party, up from 75 percent in October. Independents' views have also grown more positive too.\n\nOpinions of the Republican party are mostly unchanged from before the election.\n\nThis poll was conducted by telephone November 15-18, 2018 among a random sample of 1,103 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cellphones.\n\nThe poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.\n\nInterviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers.

With as many as 14 million at risk of starvation amid a gruelling war between Yemeni rebels and a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, the Saudis and their partners have delayed a British plan to forge a peace deal.\n\nThe Saudis, backed by ally Kuwait, have stalled plans by the U.K. to start forging a ceasefire agreement which would allow desperately needed humanitarian aid into the country.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is actively lobbying against the U.N. resolution,\" a Security Council diplomat involved in the negotiations told CBS News on Monday.\n\nAs Britain put its proposal to other Security Council members on Monday, clashes resumed on the ground between the Saudi-led forces and Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are backed by Saudi Arabia's arch enemy Iran.\n\nThe U.K.'s Ambassador to the U.N., Karen Pierce, circulated a U.N. draft resolution earlier Monday to the 10 elected members of the Security Council, after the five permanent members (U.S., Britain, France, Russia, and China) negotiated the draft.\n\nThe clock is ticking to get aid to the beleaguered civilian population in Yemen. If no resolution is agreed by Wednesday, it will be further delayed because the Security Council has a trip to China coming up after the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.\n\nWhat would the resolution do?\n\nThe draft resolution, obtained by CBS News, calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities for areas around the port of Hodeida -- a vital port held by the rebels, where fighting reignited on Monday -- effective on the day it is approved. It sets a two-week deadline for the warring sides to remove barriers to the delivery of humanitarian aid. The Saudi coalition has fought for months to try and retake the key port from the Houthi rebels.\n\nThe draft, \"calls on the parties to introduce a cessation of hostilities in Hodeida governorate, to cease all attacks on densely populated civilian areas across Yemen and to cease all missile and UAV attacks against regional countries and maritime areas.\" The rebels had said on Sunday that they would halt all rocket and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, but hours later they fired a ballistic missile across the border, saying it was a response to a new Saudi airstrike.\n\nGetty\n\nThe deadlines imposed by the draft resolution are intended to quickly alleviate the severe hunger in Yemen by having all parties to the conflict, \"facilitate the unhindered flow of commercial and humanitarian food, water, fuel, medicine and other essential imports across the country, including by fully removing within two weeks of the adoption of this resolution, any bureaucratic impediments that could restrict such flow.\"\n\nThe Saudi and Western-backed government of Yemen would then open, \"all Yemen's supply routes and ports, including Hodeida and Saleef ports,\" and ensure the \"safe and secure operation of Sana'a airport.\"\n\nThe U.S., Saudi Arabia and the war in Yemen\n\nIn addition to its political support for the coalition the U.S. is the single biggest supplier of weapons to Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration's support for the ultra-conservative Islamic kingdom is also strategic, as it is seen as a counterweight to Iran's heavy-handed influence in the region.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen escalated in 2015 when the Saudi coalition, led by the newly ascended Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman, spearheaded the fight against the Iranian-backed Houthis. The coalition wants to restore power to the officially recognized Yemeni government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.\n\nBut international criticism of the Saudis' handling of the offensive in Yemen has mounted steadily, along with the civilian death toll from the war and the starvation and cholera outbreak it has unleashed on the impoverished nation.\n\nU.N. special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said on Friday that the country, \"remains the largest humanitarian disaster in the world.\"\n\nCriticism of the kingdom, and its ruling royal family, has reached new levels in the wake of the Oct. 2 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The CIA has assessed that Crown Prince Salman ordered the killing, based mainly on an understanding of how the kingdom operates and the proximity of several participants in the killing to the heir-in-waiting, as well as the organizations involved.\n\nEven before the Khashoggi scandal, the Trump administration reined in its support of the Saudi coalition, halting refuelling operations for Saudi aircraft on Nov. 10. The White House has called for a ceasefire in the conflict.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met the Saudi King this week in Riyadh and discussed the Khashoggi killing, as well as the \"vital need to seize the moment in Yemen and stop famine and cholera intensifying.\"\n\n\"We need a solution to the horrific catastrophe in Yemen,\" Hunt said. He also visited Iran, \"to discuss how Iran can use their influence to get the Houthis to engage constructively.\"\n\n\"It's now or never,\" Hunt tweeted on Monday as the U.K. Mission introduced the draft resolution to the Security Council.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nKuwait is a close ally and neighbor to Saudi Arabia, and on Monday its Ambassador to the U.N., Mansour al-Otaibi, told reporters that his tiny nation has several issues with the draft resolution on offer from Britain.\n\nAl-Otaibi specifically said his nation and Saudi Arabia were demanding that previous Security Council resolutions requiring the Houthis to stop fighting be enforced more rigorously in any new measure.\n\n\"We want this resolution to say 'demands,' not 'calls for,' he said. He suggested that Kuwait and the Saudis would propose numerous amendments during further Council discussion on Tuesday\n\nAsked if there would be an adoption this week, he said, \"I doubt it.\"\n\nBoth the Yemeni government and the Houthis have agreed to start talks in Sweden in the coming weeks, and there is a push by the U.K. and other nations on the Council to have the resolution in place as a framework for those talks.\n\nIn the meantime, aid is being delayed, and as the World Food Program chief said Friday as he returned from Yemen, \"time is running out.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Emotions run high as Rams honor wildfire, Thousand Oaks first responders, victims", "description": "L.A. chose one of season's most anticipated tilts,  vs. Kansas City Chiefs, to pay tribute", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/emotions-run-high-as-rams-honor-wildfire-thousand-oaks-first-responders-victims/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/20/12739f3b-d7ce-40ee-82ab-159077770a6f/thumbnail/1200x630/971daa2d72797a5a894a25f95023a1db/gettyimages-1063593448.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:44:00Z", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- With emotions still raw and recovery efforts underway across the region following the devastating Woolsey Fire and the Thousand Oaks massacre, the Los Angeles Rams used their tilt with the Kansas City Chiefs Monday night to honor first responde\u2026 [+4260 chars]", "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES -- With emotions still raw and recovery efforts underway across the region following the devastating Woolsey Fire and the Thousand Oaks massacre, the Los Angeles Rams used their tilt with the Kansas City Chiefs Monday night to honor first responders and victims of both incidents.\n\nThe team gave out thousands of complimentary tickets to fire and law enforcement agencies, such as the Ventura and L.A.

Tigar issued a temporary restraining order after hearing arguments in San Francisco. He acted on a request made by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which quickly sued after President Trump issued the ban this month in response to the caravans of migrants that have started to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMr. Trump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that said anyone who crossed the southern border illegally would be ineligible for asylum. The regulations, which would have remained in place for three months absent a court order, could potentially make it harder for thousands of people who enter the U.S. to avoid deportation.\n\n\"Individuals are entitled to asylum if they cross between ports of entry,\" said Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights. \"It couldn't be clearer.\"\n\nWhen it sued, the ACLU tweeted that neither \"the president nor his Cabinet can override the clear commands of our law.\"\n\nBut when Mr. Trump issued his proclamation, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen argued in a statement that he has \"the broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens\" into the U.S. if he deems it's in the national interest. She added that Congress had given the president the authority to take that action.\n\nThe president has argued that the recent caravans are a threat to national security.\n\nRecently, tens of thousands of immigrants have shown up each year in the Arizona desert or on the northern bank of the Rio Grande River in Texas, surrendered to immigration agents and requested asylum. The Department of Homeland Security estimates around 70,000 people a year claim asylum between official ports of entry.\n\nAround 3,000 people from the first of the caravans have arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Monday it closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the San Ysidro crossing. It has also installed movable, wire-topped barriers, apparently to stop a potential mass rush of people.\n\nAs of Monday, 107 people detained between official crossings have sought asylum since Mr. Trump's order went into effect, according to DHS, which oversees Customs and Border Protection. Officials didn't say whether those people's cases were still progressing through other avenues left to them after the proclamation.\n\nDHS has said it wants asylum seekers at the southern border to appear at an official border crossing. But many border crossings such as San Ysidro already have long wait times. People are often forced to wait in shelters or outdoor camps on the Mexican side, sometimes for weeks.\n\nACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said that some people seeking asylum cross between official ports because \"they're in real danger,\" either in their countries of origin or in Mexico.\n\n\"We don't condone people entering between ports of entry, but Congress has made the decision that if they do, they still need to be allowed to apply for asylum,\" he said.\n\nTigar was nominated to the court by former President Obama, the Reuters news agency notes."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Woman shot, another sexually assaulted in Catholic supply store outside St. Louis", "description": "Manhunt on for gunman considered armed and dangerous; woman was shot in head and died in hospital", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woman-shot-another-sexually-assaulted-catholic-supply-store-ballwin-missouri-outside-st-louis/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/20/141f0896-5c74-435a-8937-7db56aeceee1/thumbnail/1200x630/5da49fe2324d277c7263dd0963a2a7df/catholic-supply-store-ballwin-missouri-111918.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T06:39:59Z", "content": "BALLWIN, Mo. -- Police in suburban St. Louis were searching Monday for a gunman who walked into a religious supply store, sexually assaulted at least one woman and shot another woman in the head.

Instead, according to new research, we can expect a cascade of catastrophes, some gradual, others abrupt, all compounding as climate change takes a greater toll.\n\n\"Facing these climatic changes will be like getting into a fight with Mike Tyson, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Jackie Chan \u2014 all at the same time.\" That is how Camillo Mora, the lead author of the study released Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, describes the numerous impacts that are expected to hit us in the coming years. He adds, \"I think we are way above our heads.\"\n\nIn total, the researchers identified 467 distinct ways in which society is already being impacted by increasing climate extremes, and then laid out how these threats are likely to compound on top of each other in the decades ahead. If something isn't done to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they say that instead of dealing with a single major hazard at a time, people worldwide could be forced to cope with three to six at once.\n\nTo reach that conclusion, the team of 23 scientists reviewed more than 3,000 scientific peer-reviewed scientific papers. They examined the impact on human health, food supplies, water, the economy, infrastructure, and security from multiple factors including rising temperatures, drought, heat waves, wildfires, precipitation, floods, powerful storms, sea level rise and changes in land cover and ocean chemistry.\n\nThe University of Hawaii at Manoa, where several of the scientists are based, called the work \"one of the most comprehensive assessments yet of how humanity is being impacted by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple climate hazards strengthened by increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nWhile most studies focus on one or two threats from climate change, this paper aggregates the impacts and shows how the threats are not isolated, but rather compound on top of each other.\n\n\"If we only consider the most direct threats from climate change, for example heat waves or severe storms, we inevitably will be blindsided by even larger threats that, in combination, can have even broader societal impacts.\" says co-author Jonathan Patz, professor and director of the University of Wisconsin's Global Health Institute.\n\nAccording to Mora, \"The notion of these hazards happening simultaneously is not something far into the future, this is already here.\"\n\nWhile all regions of the globe face compounding threats, California and Florida are two prime examples close to home.\n\nIn humid areas like Florida, climate change is feeding more heat waves, heavier downpours, stronger hurricanes and sea level rise leading to more heat-related health issues, wind and water damage to infrastructure, water quality issues, increased algae blooms and economic loss from damage and decreased production.\n\nIn drier areas like California, the combination of heat, drought and wildfires threaten lives and health, water resources, food production and infrastructure. In recent years, an increase in heat and drought have helped fuel some of the largest fires in recent history.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious health impacts of the California fires are the direct effects of breathing in tiny smoke particulates in the air. Extended exposure can cause increases in lung and heart disease as these particulates end up one's respiratory and circulatory systems.\n\nDr. Madeleine Thomson studies health and climate at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. She says that while the direct impacts of climate change phenomena on health are obvious, the indirect effects may have even bigger implications for society.\n\n\"Take, for example, the Californian fires,\" says Thomson. \"The health risks from smoke inhalation are widespread and could have long term impacts \u2014 but loss of homes and livelihoods could have greater impact on the health of individuals in a society where access to health care is so dependent on work-based health insurance.\"\n\nIt's easy to see how climate change is a compounding problem. Heat leads to drought which helps fuel bigger fires. Fires lead to disease directly through smoke inhalation but also through loss of shelter and livelihood, which leads to loss of insurance and/or inability to pay for medical care. The more this type of compounding or domino effect occurs, the greater the cumulative harm to society.\n\nAs heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to rise, the threats will be multiplied in the decades to come. Mora and his team developed an interactive tool to map worldwide risks from a changing climate based on varying degrees of future greenhouse gas concentrations.\n\nThe research project showed that \"\u2026projected exposure to multiple climate hazards will be very similar between rich and poor countries, but variations in adaptive capacity will probably result in different types of impacts. For example, higher economic loss for developed nations and higher loss of life for developing countries.\"\n\nWhile some of these impacts already appear unavoidable, other longer term and more extreme consequences could still be avoided if action is taken to substantially reduce greenhouse gases, scientists say.\n\nMichael Mann is a Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State University and one of the global leaders in climate change science. He was not involved in the study, but in his view, \"This new research provides rigorous, quantitative support for a point we have emphasized for some time: the costs of inaction greatly outweigh the costs of taking action on climate change.\"\n\nAlthough the worst-case scenarios in the research are alarming, Mann insists the future is still very much in our hands: \"We can an still reduce future damage and suffering if we act quickly and dramatically to reduce carbon emissions.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Thanksgiving weather forecast", "description": "There could be some pretty rough weather conditions in parts of the country over the Thanksgiving holiday, the busiest travel holiday of the year.
