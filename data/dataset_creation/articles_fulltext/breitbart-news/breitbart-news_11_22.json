This is down two million from the 88 million subscribers to the sports commentary and news station in 2017.\n\nESPN wasn\u2019t the only Disney-owned network to lose subscribers this year: The Disney Channel went from 92 million subscribers in 2017 to 89 million subscribers in 2018, while Freeform fell by two million subscribers to 90 million, and Disney Junior and Disney XD both lost approximately three million subscribers.\n\nThe network\u2019s declining subscriber counts, based on estimates by Nielsen Media Research, indicate that the growing popularity of online streaming services and internet live streaming products such as YouTube Live and Hulu have resulted in a decline in traditional television network subscriptions. Disney is attempting to alleviate this issue with the launch of their own online streaming service, Disney Plus, expected to be launched in 2019.\n\nDisney launched ESPN Plus, an online sports streaming service, in early 2018 and claims that the service has received approximately one million subscribers so far. However, it appears that their traditional television network subscriber numbers are continuing to decline.\n\nESPN has come under fire this year for the inclusion of political elements within their coverage and has been accused of a left-leaning bias. Breitbart News reporter Warner Todd Huston reported in Februray 2017 that the network was losing subscribers at a rapid pace as a result of the network\u2019s political move, according to the latest fiscal report, Huston was correct.\n\nHuston stated in his article:\n\nFox Sports Radio host Clay Travis recently slammed ESPN as the \u201csocial justice warrior network\u201d saying, \u201cESPN decided to become a social justice warrior network, treating all liberal opinion makers as those worthy of promotion and casting aside all those who had the gall to challenge the new Disney world order \u2026 I\u2019m not saying that ESPN should just stick to sports, but I am saying that if you decide to allow political opinions to flourish from your network\u2019s stars that you shouldn\u2019t neuter all conservative opinion and allow liberal political opinion to advance unchecked. \u2026 Those with liberal opinions are rewarded and allowed to speak freely, those with conservative opinions are told to keep their mouths shut.\u201d Indeed, even ESPN itself seemed to walk up right to the edge of admitting it has gone too far to the political left with a piece by the network\u2019s ombudsman exploring the problem. A long piece back in November by ESPN ombudsman Jim Brady presents evidence that complaints have resonated, even inside its executive boardroom, that they have become far too liberal. In his piece, Brady grapples with charges of the network\u2019s emerging and extreme left-wing bias and suggests ways to address that perception. But, Brady spends much time insisting there is no left-wing bias at ESPN even as he argues that the network hasn\u2019t done enough to assure customers and sports fans that the network welcomes all political views. Unfortunately, even as Brady comes close to admitting that conservatives are quashed and liberals given free reign, he doesn\u2019t quite admit to what millions of fans see with their own eyes. The experience of former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, though, belies Brady\u2019s claim that ESPN is balanced and allows on-air talent to come to the support of conservative political ideals. Schilling was repeatedly punished by ESPN and eventually fired or his conservative statements.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger commented on the issue at the time, stating:\n\nWe believe that the best approach to doing well in a world that is disruptive, in a world that has far more digital distribution, is to have great content and tell great stories. And that includes ESPN, by the way. \u2026 But I can tell you that it is our full intent to go out there aggressively with digital offerings direct to the consumer for ESPN and other Disney-branded properties.\n\nWhether Iger continues to remain quite as optimistic about the network\u2019s direction following the latest fiscal report remains to be seen. In a September interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Disney\u2019s CEO admitted ESPN had become too political and was working with the network\u2019s president Jimmy Pitaro to remedy the growing issue. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big debate about whether ESPN should be focused more on what happens on the field of sport than what happens in terms of where sports is societally or politically,\u201d Iger said. \u201cAnd Jimmy felt that the pendulum may have swung a little bit too far away from the field. And I happen to believe he was right.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Justin Caruso", "title": "Late-Night Hate: Seth Meyers Calls Trump a \u2018Wannabe Dictator,\u2019 Colbert Offers Thanksgiving Table Talk Tips", "description": "Late-night hosts took no time off spewing their hate for President Donald Trump for Thanksgiving this year, with Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert attacking the president and his supporters in usual fashion.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/11/22/seth-meyers-calls-trump-a-wannabe-dictator-colbert-offers-thanksgiving-table-talk-tips/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/meyerswannabe1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T22:30:06Z", "content": "NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers referred to Trump as \u201ca wannabe dictator who thinks he can jail whoever he wants\u201d Wednesday, following a report that Trump was allegedly interested in prosecuting James Comey and Hillary Clinton.

It has become perfectly clear that the game as now played is unfit for college use.\u201d\n\nWalter Camp, a Yale player from Eliot\u2019s era, countered that only one person had died playing football, yet \u201cFive young men, students at Harvard, went sailing, their boat was upset in a squall, and all five were drowned. Had similar fatalities occurred in any of the sports called games, the shock to the community would have been so severe as to have prompted many letters to the newspapers and to the faculty, urging the forbidding of the sport.\u201d\n\nOver a century later, the same battle continues, with people attacking the sport over its safety, but not showing the same concerns about other sports, that might be more dangerous.\n\nHoge recently penned a book called, \u201cBrainwashed: The Bad Science Behind CTE and the Plot to Destroy Football.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the state of California, and you have some legislation to ban football until age 14,\u201d Hoge said on FS1 while promoting his book \u201cYou can start MMA fighting and boxing at age 8 in this state. Why would you tell me there\u2019s not a war on football, or a target if you are going to say it\u2019s okay to box? Keep this in mind. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, isn\u2019t the objective to target your head in MMA and boxing? At 8, we can box in California, but we want to ban tackle football and what is the scientific evidence that they\u2019re bringing to the table. There is no scientific evidence that there is anything wrong with kids playing contact sports.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Flynn wrote a book called, \u201cThe War on Football,\u201d with a strong focus on the misleading stats about football vis-a-vis other sports.\n\nFlynn, writing for National Review in 2013, said \u201cOne thousand times more Americans die from swimming than from football hits. Last year, skateboarding collisions killed 15 times as many Americans as football collisions did. About twelve times as many people die annually from crashes on the ski slopes than die from crashes on the gridiron.\u201d\n\nFlynn added, \u201cMore Americans died from cycling accidents last week than died from football hits during the last three seasons combined. The tragedies led no one to call for a ban on bikes.\u201d\n\nSo the same battle going on over 100 years ago, is still going on now.\n\n\u201cThere is an unfair, ridiculous war on football and I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Whitlock recently said on FS1.\n\nBut even with forces trying to bring down football, it still reins as America\u2019s top sport.\n\nAnd as Jeffrey pointed out about Eliot\u2019s lost battle to bring down the sport more than a century ago: \u201cHe lost \u2014 and America won.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Liam Deacon", "title": "'High Skilled' Migrant Route 'Heavily Abused,' 88% Claimed to Earn 10k More Than on Tax Declaration", "description": "A recently closed legal migrant route encouraging \u201chigh skilled\u201d individuals to come to the UK was \u201cheavily abused\u201d with huge numbers using it potentially lying about their incomes, a review by the Homes Office has found.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/11/22/high-skilled-migrant-route-heavily-abused-88-percent-claimed-earn-10000-more-tax-forms/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/GettyImages-611948610.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:53:08Z", "content": "Many migrants said their earnings were higher to immigration authorities than to tax authorities, with the highest recorded difference \u00a3154,159 and the average \u00a327,600, across all cases looked at.

I have found that I become so expansive and I begin to ad-lib and add various observations to the reading that I find myself in a hurried state trying to finish it. So I think I\u2019m going to open this hour with the reading of the Real Story of Thanksgiving. It\u2019s important to do it each and every year.\n\nWhen I discovered what it was when writing the book, I learned that even I as a young boy had not been told the entire truth of the first Thanksgiving, and the story I was told was somewhat mild. Over the years, it got worse and worse and worse. I could probably sum it up by saying that the story of Thanksgiving as generally taught in the American public school system was that a bunch of haggard people from Britain arrived at a desolate spot at a very cold time of the year and didn\u2019t know what the hell they were doing and didn\u2019t know where they were and had no idea how to live.\n\nAnd then they met some Indians, some Native Americans, and the Indians saved them. The Indians showed them how to farm. The Indians showed them how to make warm coats. The Indians showed them how to make pumpkins and carve them. The Indians showed them how to go out and kill turkey \u2014 and, if it weren\u2019t for the Indians, the Pilgrims would have starved, and there never would have been an America, and then the Indians would have never been overrun, and then there wouldn\u2019t be any Indian casinos.\n\nWell, there might have still have been an Indian casino, but there would not have been an America. Therefore, we owe Indians everything. That\u2019s essentially the story of Thanksgiving that people were taught. I\u2019m exaggerating a bit. But that\u2019s how it was taught. Even I, as I say, was taught a mild version of that, and it is nowhere near the truth. For the truth, I found the journals of William Bradford, who was the original governor of the original Plymouth plantation, and one of the primary movers and shakers of putting together the journey on the Mayflower that brought these Pilgrims to the New World.\n\nSo I wrote about it in my second book called See, I Told You So in Chapter 6: \u201cDead White Guys or What the History Books Never Told You, The True Story of Thanksgiving.\u201d If I have time, I\u2019m also gonna share with you excerpts of George Washington\u2019s first Thanksgiving Proclamation. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with that, it will startle you. \u201cThe story of the Pilgrims begins in the early part of the seventeenth century,\u201d the late 1600s.\n\n\u201cThe Church of England under King James I was persecuting anyone and everyone who did not recognize its absolute civil and spiritual authority. Those who challenged ecclesiastical authority [of the Church of England] and those who believed strongly in freedom of worship were \u2026 imprisoned, and sometimes executed for their [heresy]. A group of separatists\u201d people who wanted no part of that in England \u201cfirst fled to Holland and established a community.\n\n\u201cAfter eleven years,\u201d in Holland, \u201cabout forty of them agreed to make a perilous journey to\u201d what was then called \u201cthe New World, where they would certainly face hardships,\u201d and experiences that none of them could foresee. But to them it was worth the try because for them the objective was to \u201clive and worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences,\u201d their beliefs and their desires. \u201cOn August 1, 1620, the Mayflower set sail.\n\n\u201cIt carried a total of 102 passengers,\u201d not all of them Pilgrims, \u201cincluding forty Pilgrims led by William Bradford. On the journey, Bradford set up an agreement, a contract,\u201d for all the Pilgrims to agree to and sign, \u201cthat established just and equal laws for all [forty Pilgrims] of the new community\u2026\u201d It didn\u2019t matter what their religious beliefs were. None of that mattered. They just set up a contractual agreement that dictated behavior and a number of other things. Now, where did the ideas\u2026? This is the Mayflower Compact, by the way, is what it was called.\n\n\u201cWhere did the revolutionary ideas expressed in the Mayflower Compact come from? From the Bible. The Pilgrims were a people completely steeped in the lessons of the\u201d Bible, both \u201cOld and New Testaments.\u201d It was the reason they lived: To read it, to study it, to practice it. \u201cThey looked to the ancient Israelites for their example. And, because of the biblical precedents set forth in Scripture,\u201d this is all according to Bradford\u2019s journal, \u201cthey never doubted that their experiment would work.\u201d They were supremely confident that their objective would occur.\n\nBut everybody knows \u201cthis was no pleasure cruise.\u201d It was long. It was arduous. There were the usual bad relationships and problems on board this tiny ship with 102 people. But they made it. They made it in ways that people would not travel today. They had no other choice. Think of the primitive forms of navigation, lack of knowledge of any upcoming weather or condition of the seas. Yet they did it, \u201c[a]nd when the Pilgrims landed in New England in November, they found, according to Bradford\u2019s detailed journal,\u201d nothing \u201ca cold, barren, desolate,\u201d unsettled, \u201cwilderness.\n\n\u201cThere were no friends to greet them, he wrote.\u201d There was nobody to greet them. \u201cThere were no houses\u2026\u201d There was no shelter whatsoever, other than the trees. There was nothing that could be considered creature comforts whatsoever. There were no friends. There were no hotels. There were no bathrooms. There was no place \u201cthey could refresh themselves. And the sacrifice they had made for freedom was just beginning.\u201d They arrived at the onset of winter. Half of them, half of the first 40, \u201cincluding Bradford\u2019s own wife \u2014 died of either starvation, sickness or exposure.\u201d\n\nNo houses, no hotels, no Safeway, no American Express. Nothing. They endured the winter as best they could. \u201cWhen spring finally came, Indians,\u201d the Native American, did welcome them, and \u201ctaught the settlers how to plant corn, fish for cod and skin beavers for coats. Life improved for the Pilgrims, but they\u201d were nowhere near prosperity. \u201cThis is important to understand because this is where modern American history lessons often end.\u201d\n\nThis is what the traditional Thanksgiving story is. The Pilgrims arrived, barely made it through the winter. Indians befriended them and saved them \u2014 and today, to this day, we give thanks to the Indians for having saved the Pilgrims. This could not be further from the truth. This is not to diminish the assistance, but this is not what Thanksgiving is about. \u201cThanksgiving is actually explained in some textbooks as a holiday for which the Pilgrims gave thanks to the Indians for saving their lives,\u201d but that\u2019s not what it was.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving, in truth, my friends, is \u201ca devout expression of gratitude\u201d to God for their survival, which depending on a whole lot of things after they arrived \u2014 a whole lot of things besides assistance by the Indians. \u201cHere is the part that has been omitted: The original contract the Pilgrims had entered into,\u201d the Mayflower Compact, \u201cwith their merchant-sponsors in London\u2026\u201d They had no money. They had to have people help them here.\n\n\u201cThe original contract \u2026 called for everything they produced to go into a common store,\u201d a common account, \u201cand each member of the community was entitled to one common share.\u201d In other words, everybody got the same as everyone else. That\u2019s the way it was set up. It was fairness, and it was equality. \u201cAll of the land they cleared and the houses they built belong to the community,\u201d not to the people personally. \u201cThey were going to distribute it equally. All of the land they cleared\u2026 Nobody owned anything.\n\n\u201cThey just had a share in it. It was a commune,\u201d pure and simple. \u201cIt was the forerunner to the communes we saw in the \u201960s and \u201970s out in California \u2014 and it was complete with organic vegetables, by the way. Bradford, who had become the new governor of the colony, recognized that this\u201d wasn\u2019t working. This was collectivism. Nobody had any more than anybody else, nobody had any less, but that did not lead to prosperity. It never does.\n\nSo after a while, realizing that there was nothing but stagnation going on, \u201cBradford assigned a plot of land to each family to work and manage,\u201d and whatever they produced was theirs \u2014 and, in an early fashion, this unleashed \u201cthe power of the marketplace. Long before Karl Marx was even born, the Pilgrims had discovered and experimented with what could only be described as socialism. And what happened? It didn\u2019t work!\u201d You know why it didn\u2019t work?\n\nWhen everybody was entitled to the same, you have slackers. Slackers didn\u2019t do their share, they didn\u2019t contribute their share, but they got the same amount as everybody else. It led to recriminations and jealousies and anger. Bradford had to change it, and he did. \u201cWhat Bradford\u2026\u201d It\u2019s all in his journal. \u201cWhat Bradford and his community found was that the most creative and industrious people had no incentive to work any harder than anyone else, unless they could utilize the power of personal motivation,\u201d i.e., keep a majority of what they produced or earned.\n\n\u201cBut while most of the rest of the world has been experimenting with socialism for well over a hundred years \u2014 trying to refine it, perfect it, and re-invent it \u2014 the Pilgrims\u201d learned in less than a year that it was a failure. \u201cWhat Bradford wrote about this social experiment should be in every schoolchild\u2019s history lesson. If it were, we might prevent much needless suffering in the future.\u201d He wrote, \u201c\u2018The experience that we had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years\u2026that by taking away property, and bringing community into a common wealth, would make them happy and flourishing \u2014 as if they were wiser than God. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018For this community was found to breed much confusion and discontent, and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort. For young men that were most able and fit for labor and service\u201d didn\u2019t. They waited. They didn\u2019t want to produce for other men\u2019s wives and children what other men should have been providing, and eventually this \u201cwas thought injustice.\u201d Why should you work for other people when you can\u2019t work for yourself?\n\nWhat\u2019s the point? \u201cThe Pilgrims found that people could not be expected to do their best work without incentive. So what did [they] try next? They unharnessed the power of good old free enterprise by invoking the \u2026 principle of private property. Every family was assigned its own plot of land to work and permitted to market\u201d whatever they produced, able to sell \u2014 for whatever price they could get \u2014 their crops and their products. What do you think the result was?\n\n\u201c\u2018This had very good success,\u2019 wrote Bradford, \u2018for it made all hands industrious,\u201d which means everybody got off their duffs and started working. \u201c\u2018[M]uch more corn was planted than otherwise would have been.\u2019\u201d This is when they first began to experience prosperity, and it is for this discovery\u2026 By the way, it was at this point that they welcomed the Indians in, because there was so much production after that first barren winter of arrival \u2014 not knowing anything, not having anything.\n\nTrying everybody getting fair treatment didn\u2019t work. When they unleashed the incentives (stated simply as you get to keep what you produce), it turned everybody into \u2014 compared to the past \u2014 mass producers. They had so much more than they needed that they actually had a gratitude winter with the Indians where all of this bounty was shared, and the original Thanksgiving was to give thanks to God for the enlightenment and the courage and the fortitude to withstand all of the hardship and to endure all of the hassles and the problems to finally see through it and prosper.\n\n\u201cSo they set up trading posts and exchanged goods with the Indians. The profits allowed them to pay off their debts to the merchants in London\u201d and Holland who had sponsored their trip. \u201c[T]he success and prosperity of the Plymouth settlement attracted more Europeans and began what came to be known as the \u2018Great Puritan Migration.\u2019\u201d It was the word of success and prosperity among the original Pilgrim arrivals that spread to the New World and spawned to massive additional trips to the New World.\n\nYou could reduce it to say it was capitalism versus socialism, which it was. But that would be to undersell \u2014 underemphasize what really has happened. A people who had undying faith in God survived circumstances that they never knew they were going to face and ultimately prospered \u2014 and, at the end of it all, were still able to practice their religion as they chose who was the original reason for their trip in the first place. And for all of that, they were eternally thankful.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) first set forth the claim that she has Native American ancestry when she submitted several recipes using the byline \u201cElizabeth Warren-Cherokee.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s culinary contributions to the Pow Wow Chow cookbook suffer from the same lack of authenticity as do her claims of Native American ancestry, as Breitbart News first reported in May 2012:\n\nThe credibility of Massachusetts Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren took another hit today as Boston radio talk show host Howie Carr released evidence that appears to confirm Ms. Warren may have plagiarized at least three of the five recipes she submitted to the 1984 Pow Wow Chow cookbook edited by her cousin Candy Rowsey. Two of the possibly plagiarized recipes, said in the Pow Wow Chow cookbook to have been passed down through generations of Oklahoma Native American members of the Cherokee tribe, are described in a NewYork Times News Service story as originating at Le Pavilion, a fabulously expensive French restaurant in Manhattan. The dishes were said to be particular favorites of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Cole Porter. The two recipes, \u201cCold Omelets with Crab Meat\u201d and \u201cCrab with Tomato Mayonnaise Dressing,\u201d appear in an article titled \u201cCold Omelets with Crab Meat,\u201d written by Pierre Franey of the New York Times News Service that was published in the August 22, 1979 edition of the Virgin Islands Daily News, a copy of which can be seen here.\n\nThe Harvard Law School Admissions Committee that recommended Warren\u2019s hiring to a tenured faculty position in 1993 did not rely upon her recipes when considering her academic bona fides, but they almost certainly were aware of her subsequent unsubstantiated claims in the annual Association of American Law Schools Directory, made from 1986 to 1995, that she was a minority, and her 1989 declaration to the University of Pennsylvania Law School that she was a Native American.\n\n\u201cSo, we know one thing with almost 100% certainty: Elizabeth Warren identified herself as a minority law professor. We know something else with 90%+ certainty: (at least some) folks at Harvard were almost certainly aware that she identified as a minority law professor,\u201d David Bernstein wrote at the Volokh Conspiracy in 2012 of Warren\u2019s ancestry claims and how they were perceived at Harvard prior to her hiring there.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported extensively since 2012, there is absolutely no documentary evidence to support Warren\u2019s claim that she has Native American ancestry. Sen. Warren can not point to a single Native American ancestor in her family tree.\n\nThe genetic evidence which Warren set forth recently to support the claim in an October 10, 2018 report from Stanford\u2019s Dr. Carlos Bustamante is weak to the point of derision, as Breitbart News reported:\n\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied Sen Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) DNA sample did not actually use samples of Native American DNA. The Boston Globe broke the story Monday of Warren\u2019s DNA test, which she and the newspaper claimed as proof of her Native American ancestry, after results suggested she may have had a Native American ancestor six to ten generations ago. That means her genome may be between 1/64 to 1/1024 percent Native American. Buried deep within the Globe story, however, is the admission that the Stanford University researcher who studied her DNA sample did not actually use samples of Native American DNA to determine whether Warren\u2019s dubious claims of Cherokee ancestry were true.\n\n\u201cTo make up for the dearth of Native American DNA, Bustamante used samples from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia to stand in for Native American,\u201d the Globe reported.\n\nAt best, therefore, the DNA test results provided to Stanford University researcher Dr. Carlos Bustamante, \u201csuggested\u201d that Warren has between 1.56 percent and one tenth of one percent of the same DNA as people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, but no DNA match directly to Native American tribes in the United States, such as the Cherokee ancestry she claimed.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, many Americans can claim such a small level of Native American ancestry, one which is far below even the minimal level required for membership in any Native American tribe, and certainly below the standard required to claim such ancestry on employment and personnel records:\n\n23andMe, a prominent DNA testing company, reported in 2014 that \u201d European-Americans had genomes that were on average 98.6 percent European, .19 percent African, and .18 Native American,\u201d according to the New York Times. Warren\u2019s DNA test, even if accurate, would put her genome at somewhere between 0.1 percent and 1.56 percent Native American, meaning she could be no more Native American than the average \u201cEuropean-American,\u201d or even less so.\n\nBreitbart News has sent numerous email requests for comment to Dr. Bustamante and Sen. Warren, but neither has responded.\n\nWarren does appear to have one demonstrable heritage upon which she can draw for culinary inspiration, as Breitbart News noted in October:\n\nBreitbart News first reported in 2012 that Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) great-great-great grandfather Jonathan Crawford was a member of the Tennessee Militia that rounded up Cherokees living there at the time for the Trail of Tears journey to Oklahoma in the 1830s. This gives Warren a 1/32, or 3.125 percent, Tennessee Militia heritage, at least double the maximum 1.56 percent, minimum 0.1 percent, Native American heritage Dr. Carlos Bustamante said the evidence in the DNA genotypes purported to come from Warrren\u2019s DNA sample \u201cstrongly suggests\u201d in his October 10, 2018 report released by Sen.

Who Are We? is at bottom a defense of this culture, which he calls Anglo-Protestantism, as the dominant strain of national identity. Although he never eschews the creed, he regards it fundamentally as the offshoot of a particular cultural moment: \u201cThe Creed\u2026was the product of the distinct Anglo-Protestant culture of the founding settlers of America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\n\n\nThat American national identity dating back to the nation\u2019s settlers has in recent times come under revisionism by leftist pundits for the purpose of justifying the country\u2019s current mass legal immigration levels where more than 1.5 million immigrants arrive in the country every year.\n\nMost notably this Thanksgiving season, the Washington Post notes Plymouth\u2019s upcoming 400th birthday commemoration, highlighting Plymouth 400, Inc.

Between 1925 and 1966, the yearly U.S. legal immigration level did not exceed 327,000 admissions, a four-decades-long near moratorium that allowed the massive inflows of immigrants from before 1925 the ability to assimilate.\n\nSince major changes were enacted in 1965 and in the 1990s to the U.S. legal immigration system \u2014 changes that allow foreign nationals to bring as many foreign relatives to the country as they want \u2014 legal immigration levels have continued booming for more than five decades.\n\nFor example, since 1980, the number of legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. every year has not dipped below 525,000.

Garcia Luna allegedly received the second bribe in 2006, by then he was the Public Security Secretary for Mexico under President Felipe Calderon.\n\nThe testimony by Zambada also outed Gabriel Regino, who was the Mexico City Public Safety Sub-Secretary in 2005 when he allegedly received suitcases full of money. At the time, Regino worked under Mexico City\u2019s former mayor and incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). Following the allegations, Regino took to social media to deny taking any money and claimed El Chapo\u2019s legal team was strategically deflecting.\n\n4.

Saddam had a long-standing program to develop nuclear weapons, and in 1981, Israeli war strikes destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor that could have been used to develop nuclear weapons. In 1988, towards the end of the Iran/Iraq war, Saddam had used mustard gas chemical weapons in 1988 to kill Kurds and Iranians.\n\nIn 1990, Hussein\u2019s Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait, resulting in the first Gulf War, which ended up ejecting Iraq from Kuwait, but left Saddam Hussein in power, still able to produce WMDs. In the years that followed, Saddam continued to develop WMDs and refused to permit U.N. inspectors to enter Iraq. In 1998, the Bill Clinton administration ordered airstrikes against Iraq because it refused to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors.\n\nThe second Iraq War began in 2003 at a time when almost everyone in the world believed that Saddam was continuing WMD development, and the CIA reported that the evidence supported this. During all this time from 1991-2003, Iraq was heavily sanctioned in the hope of ending the WMD program.\n\nSaddam always complained that the crippling sanctions were hurting ordinary Iraqi people, so in 1996 instituted the \u201coil-for-food\u201d program. Under this program, Saddam could sell a limited amount of oil to other countries and use the money to buy food and humanitarian goods for the Iraqi people. The United Nations was to serve as a watchdog.\n\nSaddam corrupted the system by demanding that any company that wants to buy oil under this program would be invoiced for 110 percent of the actual cost of the oil. The 100 percent portion would be used to purchase food, and the other 10 percent would go into Saddam\u2019s own bank account. A U.N. inquiry led by former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker alleged in 2005 that the 2,200 companies involved in the programme had paid a total of $1.8 billion in kickbacks to win supply deals. Of those, 180 were French.\n\nIn 2016, French oil company Total was ordered to pay a $827,000 fine, the maximum allowed under French law, for corruption linked to the U.N. oil-for-food program. Other French companies were cleared of the charges because the situation did not match the offenses that French anti-corruption law is designed to prosecute. However, prosecutors hope that the judges in the trials that began on Wednesday for 14 companies will look at the situation differently, and will convict them.\n\nThe 14 companies include Renault Trucks, Legrand and Schneider Electric. The trial is expected to conclude by the end of November. Radio France International and Le Figaro (Paris) (Trans) and Deutsche Welle (2-Jul-2008) and Radio France International (26-Feb-2016)\n\nIraq War and the 58 Year Hypothesis\n\nThe Iraq War has been called the worst war in American history, mainly by people with such deficient reasoning skills that they can\u2019t figure out that without the war we would never have known that Saddam was not developing WMDs. After the war, President George Bush was able to leverage that discovery to convince Iran and Saudi Arabia to end their own WMD programs, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa late in 2003 ending their nuclear program.\n\nThe most vocal opponents of launching the Iraq war in 2003 were also those who were making huge amounts of money in corrupt practices in the oil-for-food program.\n\nKojo Annan, the son of Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, was heavily involved in the scheme through the Swiss company Cotecna, which won a large oil-for-food contract.\n\nRussia benefited the most from oil-for-food corruption, winning near a third of all the oil deals. Paul Volcker\u2019s U.N. inquiry identified the people involved, but none was prosecuted because the Russians refused to cooperate.\n\nFrance was in second place in benefiting from the corrupt scheme. For years, we have had to listen to French commentators express moral superiority because they opposed the Iraq War. Actually, they were the worst of all, since the advisors to France\u2019s President Jacques Chirac were heavily involved in the Iraq corruption. Chirac would have happily let Saddam kill thousands of people with WMDs, as long as Chirac kept making money from it.\n\nThere was something really remarkable about the 2003 Iraq War in that there was almost universal panic, an unrealistic panic, about Saddam\u2019s development of WMDs. We do not get nearly as panicky today about Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of Sarin gas in Syria or Russia\u2019s use of Novichok nerve agent to kill people in Britain.\n\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, the 2003 Iraq war was an example of the \u201c58-year hypothesis,\u201d which says that when some sort of calamitous event occurs, then some sort of panic will occur exactly 58 years later. That\u2019s because 5-10-year-old children at the time of the calamitous event all retire or die or lose power, all at once, 58 years later, and it is this cohort of people who panic because they suddenly realize that they will be gone and the younger generations will not be prepared. (See lengthier explanation at \u201cThe 58 Year Hypothesis\u201d)\n\nSo the 2003 panic over WMDs in Iraq occurred 58 years after the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nAnother example of the 58-year hypothesis was the swine flu panic that occurred in 1976. Anyone alive at that time will remember the nationwide panic that occurred and the demands for development of a swine flu vaccine, which turned out to be a disaster. That was 58 years after the devastating Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 that killed millions of people.\n\nAnother example was the 1987 stock market panic. If fizzled very quickly because it was not a real panic. It occurred 58 years after the 1929 stock market crash.\n\nAnother example is Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon in 2006. Hezbollah abducted two Israeli soldiers near the Lebanon border. Israel went into a state of total panic and launched the war in Lebanon within four hours, with no plan and no objectives. The war was a total disaster for Israel. It occurred 58 years after the genocidal war between Jews and Arabs in Palestine in 1948.\n\nThe 58-year hypothesis has turned out to be one of the most fascinating discoveries in the development of generational theory. It certainly does not explain everything, or even many things, but it does make sense of things like the \u201cfalse panics\u201d that occurred in 1976, 1987, 2003, and in Israel in 2006.

With their adoption of \u201copen borders\u201d advocacy\u2014and a fierce moral absolutism that regards any limit to migration as an unspeakable evil\u2014any criticism of the exploitative system of mass migration is effectively dismissed as blasphemy. Even solidly leftist politicians, like Bernie Sanders in the United States and Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom, are accused of \u201cnativism\u201d by critics if they recognize the legitimacy of borders or migration restriction at any point. This open borders radicalism ultimately benefits the elites within the most powerful countries in the world, further disempowers organized labor, robs the developing world of desperately needed professionals, and turns workers against workers.\n\nNagle also argues that mass immigration operates extracts human talent from developing societies for the benefit of wealthy, comfortable U.S. elites:\n\nAdvocates of open borders often overlook the costs of mass migration for developing countries. Indeed, globalization often creates a vicious cycle: liberalized trade policies destroy a region\u2019s economy, which in turn leads to mass emigration from that area, further eroding the potential of the origin country while depressing wages for the lowest paid workers in the destination country. One of the major causes of labor migration from Mexico to the United States has been the economic and social devastation caused by the North American Free Trade Agreement (nafta). Nafta forced Mexican farmers to compete with U.S. agriculture, with disastrous consequences for Mexico. Mexican imports doubled, and Mexico lost thousands of pig farms and corn growers to U.S. competition. When coffee prices fell below the cost of production, nafta prohibited state intervention to keep growers afloat. Additionally, U.S. companies were allowed to buy infrastructure in Mexico, including, for example, the country\u2019s main north-south rail line. The railroad then discontinued passenger service, resulting in the decimation of the rail workforce after a wildcat strike was crushed. By 2002, Mexican wages had dropped by 22 percent, even though worker productivity increased by 45 percent.7 In regions like Oaxaca, emigration devastated local economies and communities, as men emigrated to work in America\u2019s farm labor force and slaughterhouses, leaving behind women, children, and the elderly.\n\nLeft-wing servants of business elites spray claims of racism on the public to suppress their rational and reasonable opposition to immigration exploitation, Nagle argues:\n\nThe immigration expansionists have two key weapons. One is the big business and financial interests all working on their side, but an equally powerful weapon\u2014wielded more expertly by the left-leaning immigration expansionists\u2014is moral blackmail and public shame. People are right to see the mistreatment of migrants as morally wrong. Many people are concerned about the growth of racism and callousness toward minorities that often accompanies anti-immigration sentiment. But the open borders position does not even live up to its own professed moral code.\n\nThe tacit alliance of the wealthy against the middle prompt some invective by the Irish author;\n\nIn the wealthiest nations, open borders advocacy seems to function as a fanatical cult among true believers\u2014a product of big business and free market lobbying is carried along by a larger group of the urban creative, tech, media, and knowledge economy class, who are serving their own objective class interests by keeping their transient lifestyles cheap and their careers intact as they parrot the institutional ideology of their industries. The truth is that mass migration is a tragedy, and upper-middle-class moralizing about it is a farce. Perhaps the ultra-wealthy can afford to live in the borderless world they aggressively advocate for, but most people need\u2014and want\u2014a coherent, sovereign political body to defend their rights as citizens.\n\nRead it all here.\n\nThe establishment\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Kyle Morris", "title": "Pictures: Thanksgiving Salute \u2013 College Veterans March 150 Miles to Raise Suicide Awareness", "description": "Veterans from the University of Alabama and Auburn University have united to march 150 miles as one to raise awareness for the 22 veterans lost each day to suicide.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/22/college-veterans-march-to-raise-awareness-for-veteran-suicide/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/marchers.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:42:26Z", "content": "The more-than 70-hour journey, named for the Iron Bowl Ruck March, began at Auburn\u2019s Jordan Hare Stadium on Wednesday.

Through six titles and 30 years, Rocky Balboa had not only washed away the bad taste of Rocky V (1990), it had beautifully circled the franchise back to its roots, to where we first met the Italian Stallion in the opening scenes of Rocky (1976) \u2014 beat up after a brutal fight and longing for Adrian.\n\nHow do you improve on that? I didn\u2019t think anyone would even bother to try. Stallone was 60-years-old and barely got away with that last fight, so how could anyone even try to\u2013 who the hell is Ryan Coogler?\n\nFast-forward nine years and there stands Ryan Coogler, an up-and-coming director all of 29-years-old who wants to make his own Rocky movie. This can\u2019t be good.\n\nNot knowing anything about Coogler, the idea of someone other than Stallone having anything to do with that beloved character was terrifying. What I feared would happen is what ended up happening to the Star Wars franchise \u2014 they handed it over to someone (producer Kathleen Kennedy) who carried a grudge against the original, who wanted to \u201ccorrect\u201d the past, who wanted to film an \u201capology\u201d for all the prior ideological impurities.\n\nBut when Creed arrived in theaters in 2015, within about ten minutes I knew that Coogler not only loved and respected this franchise, I knew he was the perfect director (and co-writer) to perform the resurrection. Coogler\u2019s Rocky was still Rocky, and here we were \u2014 39-years after we first met the palooka \u2014 and thanks to Coogler\u2019s artistry, the palooka still mattered.\n\nWhat a gift that was.\n\nYou see, when you get to be my age (I\u2019m closing in on 53), time has already taken a lot of things away. And as those touchstones you took for granted as a younger man fade further and further away, you become more appreciative of, and, yes, sentimental about, the handful of ones that manage to hang in.\n\nBut they can\u2019t suck.\n\nHanging in while sucking does not count.\n\nThe Law & Order franchise might be 30-years-old, but now it sucks. Stephen King might still be pumping out 2500 words a day, but they suck. Spectre sucked. Alien: Whatever the Hell That Was sucked. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Oh My God This Movie Sucks sucked. Terminator: Genisys not only sucked, it was spelled wrong. George Carlin\u2019s dead. Sinatra\u2019s gone. Gene Hackman retired. They\u2019re putting overweight men in the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog\u2026\n\nWhat the hell do I have left?\n\nAll I got is Clint Eastwood, Tom Cruise, and Rocky Balboa.\n\nMay they live forever.\n\nThankfully, Rocky Balboa not only lives on in Creed II, he lives on in something that is even closer to a Rocky movie than the original Creed. You see, Creed II is basically a remake of Rocky II, III and IV. All the best elements of those iconic sequels are brought together in this sequel, which is as rousing as it is touching, as formulaic and predictable as you have come to expect, but in that very special way where you can\u2019t wait to see what you know is gunna happen happen.\n\nWhat stands out the most in Creed II, though, are the performances. Impossibly, rising Hollywood superstar Michael B. Jordan is even better here, and he\u2019s backed by a 72-year-old Sylvester Stallone, who looks every day of it, which gives this beloved character an unspoken depth and poignancy, a history the whole world is familiar with, even when the camera is on his back.\n\nJust as poignant is Dolph Lundgren, who returns as Ivan Drago. Balboa humiliated Drago (and won the Cold War \u2014 seriously, look it up) in 1985\u2019s Rocky IV, and all the fallout, disgrace, and bitterness he has carried for 32 years can be seen in Lundgren\u2019s lean, weather-beaten face and those haunted eyes. Unfortunately, Ivan has poured all of that into his own grown son.\n\nPhylicia Rashad returns as Creed\u2019s stepmother and has at least two great scenes.\n\nFinally, there is the always underrated Wood Harris, whose twitchy energy does so much with so little.\n\nI kind of hate movies that pass the baton, that ask me to accept that something is coming to an end and it\u2019s time to move on. I don\u2019t want move on. Moving on can kiss my ass. There is none of that in Creed II. Rocky Balboa may no longer be the lead character, but he is still the heart and soul of the series, and there are no \u201cclever\u201d callbacks in Creed II, no cheap Easter eggs, because this is not a franchise looking to shake off the past. Rather, it embraces, marinates in, honors, and builds on what came before.\n\nCreed II is also about something bigger than a man doing what a man\u2019s got to do. Like its predecessor, it is primarily about the vital importance of fathers, even surrogate fathers \u2014 a radical concept these days. Sons need their fathers, fathers need their sons, and that final scene between Rocky and his son, how moving and funny and perfect it is\u2026 Man it\u2019s dusty in here.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

She said:\n\n\u201cCrucially, the text we have agreed has an explicit reference to the development of an independent trade policy by the UK beyond this partnership with the EU.

It\u2019s pretty well a dictionary definition.\u201d Dr Rotherham said according to these paragraphs in the deal, the UK will have to align its regulation to the European Union, what he called a \u201cfax democracy\u201d.\n\nBritain being \u201cgoverned by fax\u201d by the European Union is taken to mean new laws and regulations being sent to London arbitrarily, without means to challenge or amend and was a threat against Brexit made by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012, before he gave Britain a vote on whether to leave the European Union.\n\nThe Reuters news agency reported further bad news from the Prime Minister\u2019s deal Thursday, an analysis of the text showed the government\u2019s negotiators had secured no improvements to the proposed future relationship regarding financial services with the EU. As things stand, British banks would only be granted access to the European market if the UK\u2019s rules and regulations remain closely aligned, another example of the EU preventing Britain from forging its own destiny after Brexit.\n\nThis story is developing and more follows"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Charlie Spiering", "title": "Donald Trump Thanksgiving Proclamation: \u2018Commit to Treating All with Charity\u2019", "description": "President Donald Trump issued a Thanksgiving proclamation on Thursday, urging all Americans to come together to recognize their blessings.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/22/donald-trump-thanksgiving-proclamation-commit-to-treating-all-with-charity/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/donald-trump-4.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:52:17Z", "content": "\u201cLet us be mindful of the reasons we are grateful for our lives, for those around us, and for our communities,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe also commit to treating all with charity and mutual respect, spreading the spirit of Thanksgiving throughout our country and acros\u2026 [+1446 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump issued a Thanksgiving proclamation on Thursday, urging all Americans to come together to recognize their blessings.\n\n\u201cLet us be mindful of the reasons we are grateful for our lives, for those around us, and for our communities,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe also commit to treating all with charity and mutual respect, spreading the spirit of Thanksgiving throughout our country and across the world.\u201d\n\nThe president recalled the journey of the Pilgrims who trusted God as they left their country and traveled to America to seek a better life.

Section 12, paragraph 75 of the document \u2014 the leaks claim \u2014 states that \u201cparties should establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, access to waters and quote shares.\n\nBritain\u2019s fishing industry enjoyed an elevated position within the context of the Brexit campaign, with industry representatives saying their livelihoods have been near-destroyed by decades of top-down mismanagement of waters and quotas by the European Union.\n\nOne of the most remarkable set-piece battles of the Brexit campaign was a flotilla of fishing boats sailed down the River Thames in support of leaving the European Union.

If the Prime Minister\u2019s agreement is confirmed to state that the UK and EU will continue to share quotas as they have done in the past in the post-Brexit era, this will inevitably be seen as a serious betrayal of the Brexit vote.\n\nThis story is developing, more follows"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Kristina Wong and Edwin Mora", "title": "Deployed U.S. Troops Send Thanksgiving Shoutouts to Families, Friends", "description": "Troops deployed around the world, including in war zones, took a moment\u2019s respite from their daily efforts to keep America safe to film Thanksgiving greetings for family and friends back home in videos posted by the Pentagon.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/22/troops-deployed-thanksgiving-shoutouts/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/Troops-Celebrate-Thanksgiving-AFPGetty-Images.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:41:25Z", "content": "\u201cI just want to say Happy Thanksgiving to my wife, my two little boys, and also say happy birthday to my little boy turning three, and a shoutout to my mom and my sister, and loving what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Army Sgt.

Some health insurers will not cover Americans with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAmericans thinking about purchasing short-term health insurance will often pay a lower average monthly premium, although they will likely have a relatively high deductible, meaning that they will spend more out-of-pocket when visiting the doctor.\n\nRelatively healthy Americans, younger citizens, and those who do not regularly visit the doctor may want to consider purchasing short-term health insurance.\n\nMany states such as California, New York, Delaware have curbed their citizens\u2019 access to short-term health insurance due to concerns that they may lead to higher Obamacare premiums.\n\nHeritage Foundation health scholar Doug Badger said in a research paper that short-term health plans \u201coffer broader choices of providers and lower premiums for people in good health than Obamacare policies.\u201d\n\nBadger added that short-term plans were \u201coffering a lifeboat enabling them to escape Obamacare\u2019s sinking ship.\u201d\n\nCato Institute health scholar Michael Cannon contended in May that Trump\u2019s expansion of short-term health plans could cost 90 percent less than Obamacare plans.\n\nCannon chastised Democrats for trying to protect Obamacare over affordable health insurance.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are literally trying to stop Republicans from expanding consumer protections because they would rather protect Obamacare,\u201d the Cato scholar wrote.\n\nASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS (AHPs)\n\nPresident Trump also expanded Association through the October 2017 executive orders. The Trump administration rule on AHPs allows small businesses to join together and benefit from the regulatory advantages that many large companies experience under health insurance rules. AHPs can serve employees in a city, county, state, or a particular industry across the nation.\n\nA study from Avalere Health found that Americans would experience drastically lower health premiums through AHPs compared to Obamacare. AHPs would be roughly $2,900 lower per year compared to the small-group market and $9,700 lower per year compared to the individual market. Avalere cites that the lower average premiums in AHPs mostly result from a healthier insurance pool due to \u201crisk selection\u201d and less generous offerings. The Avalere research found that as many as 3.2 million Americans could leave Obamacare for AHPs.\n\nLand O\u2019Lakes announced in November that they created the nation\u2019s first AHP, offering plans nearly 50 percent less expensive than Obamacare.\n\nThe dairy company created an AHP, or a self-insured multi-state insurance pool, for farmers who work within the company\u2019s network. The AHP includes both co-ops and individual farmers across Minnesota and Nebraska.\n\nOn the company\u2019s AHP, otherwise known as the Land O\u2019Lakes Cooperative Farmer Member Health Plan, farmers can choose from several Obamacare compliant plans that cover all of the ten of Obamacare\u2019s EHBs, while also providing broad network coverage and offering more affordable plan options than Obamacare\u2019s individual exchange.\n\nIn other words, thanks to Trump\u2019s executive actions on health care, Land O\u2019 Lakes can expand insurance coverage to more of their employees, offer less expensive plans that have broad network coverage, while at the same time protecting employees with pre-existing conditions.\n\nLand O\u2019 Lakes\u2019 creation of the first AHP could serve as a model for other companies and industries to create their own AHPs, which would offer Americans less expensive health insurance options compared to Obamacare.\n\nAHPs serve as an excellent option for businesses and associations that wish to offer their employees and their members health insurance, even if they do not have the resources of a large corporation. However, Americans who do not have the option of choosing an AHP through their employer may want to consider either a short-term health plan or a health sharing ministry.\n\nHEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRIES (HCSMs)\n\nHealth care sharing ministries serve as a health insurance alternative that covers members who share a religious belief, typically Christian, who make monthly payments to cover expenses of every member. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided a religious exemption to religious groups so that they do not have to comply with many of Obamacare\u2019s insurance regulations.\n\nDue to their religious Obamacare exemption, Americans who wish to join an HCSM will have to prove that they belong to and or regularly attend a Christian organization.\n\nAmericans with HCSMs pay out-of-pocket for medical expenses, and the HCSM will reimburse the patient for their medical costs. HCSMs will compensate patients after they pay an annual unshared amount, which acts similarly to a health insurance deductible.\n\nFor example, a single patient under the age of 30 with Liberty Health Share will pay a monthly shared amount of $249, to which the group will reimburse them up to $1,000,000 per medical incident.\n\nFour of the most popular health care sharing ministries include Christian Healthcare Ministries, Samaritan Ministries, Medi-Share, and Liberty Healthshare.\n\nBecause many HCSMs often do not cover many pre-existing conditions, health care sharing ministries may serve as a more attractive option for healthier Americans who do not wish to pay higher premiums to subsidize other Americans\u2019 more expensive health costs.\n\nDIRECT PRIMARY CARE\n\nPhysician practices described as direct primary care have sprung up across the country during the past decade. Membership-based medicine practices have patients pay a monthly or annual membership fee, instead of insurance, for a contracted bundle of services, which often includes doctor visits, certain services, discounted medications, and lab tests.\n\nPatients who use direct primary care often note that doctors have more time to work through their health care experience.\n\nDavid Coupe, a 47-year-old Illinois man, said, \u201cWhen you take (insurance) out of the equation, it\u2019s like, wow, the doctor actually has time to spend with you and answer questions and give you care.\u201d\n\nCoupe and his wife, Danielle, paid about $140 a month for their contracted bundle of services with Dr. Jill Green\u2019s Illinois-based direct primary care practice MedLogic.\n\nPatients often look to direct primary care as an alternative to traditional insurance medicine practices due to the rising cost of health insurance; many doctors have moved towards creating direct primary care practices because insurance companies often expect doctors to see a high volume of patients.\n\nDirect primary care practices will cover most medical expenses, treatments, and medications. However, some analysts suggest that Americans should pick up some form of insurance to cover more expensive medical costs such as hospital visits or surgeries in case of emergencies.\n\nOverall, a patient\u2019s average medical expenses should be less than Obamacare due to the more transparent cost and increased attention one receives from their direct primary care doctor.\n\nDr. Phillip Eskew, who tracks the direct primary industry, estimated in June that there may be more than 800 direct primary care physicians across the country.\n\nEskew said he adds roughly 200 new direct primary care practices across the country to each his list each year.\n\n\u201cAs long as people care about price and quality, it should keep growing,\u201d Eskew said.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAlthough President Trump managed for the first time in Obamacare\u2019s history to lower Obamacare federal exchange premiums, ACA premiums remain at a record high, making Obamacare still unaffordable for many Americans.\n\nObamacare may remain expensive for many consumers, and while Obamacare may have put on the backburner in the midst of a House Democrat majority, Americans have many suitable Obamacare alternatives to choose from for their healthcare needs."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart London", "title": "France Deploys Soldiers to Streets as Fuel Duty Hike Protests Intensify", "description": "France is deploying soldiers to calm violence on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion after protests over fuel tax hikes degenerated into looting and rioting.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/11/22/france-deploys-soldiers-to-streets-as-fuel-duty-hike-protests-intensify/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/19/178efd_protesters-blocked-access-fuel-depot-in-la-rochelle-southwest-france-on-e1542878256293.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:19:00Z", "content": "Schools are closed for a third day Thursday because protesters\u2019 roadblocks prevent teachers, children and food supplies from reaching them, according to the regional administration.

According to DHS memos obtained by The Washington Post on Wednesday, Central American asylum seekers who cannot establish a \u201creasonable fear\u201d of persecution in Mexico will not be allowed to enter the United States and would be turned around at the border. The plan, called \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d amounts to a major break with current screening procedures, which generally allow those who establish a fear of return to their home countries to avoid immediate deportation and remain in the United States until they can get a hearing with an immigration judge. Trump despises this system, which he calls \u201ccatch and release,\u201d and has vowed to end it.\n\nHowever, the article does not explain how migrants could be legally pushed back over the U.S. borders once migrants fail their initial test for asylum and then lodge an appeal.\n\nMexican officials have little incentive to cooperate, in part, because cartel-affiliated coyotes do not get paid if the migrants cannot get catch-and-release into the U.S. job market. So the cartels would likely protect their labor-trafficking business by pressuring local Mexican officials to prevent the U.S. government from returning asylum-seeking or illegal migrants.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump can use his authority over cross-border visas and trade to pressure Mexican government officials to accept migrants until the legal claims are fully heard.\n\nBusiness-backed pro-migration groups will use their influence in the U.S. courts to block Trump\u2019s reforms, no matter how beneficial they are to ordinary Americans.\n\nThe Post\u2018s report comes after a San Francisco judge agreed with the ACLU\u2019s request to block the administration\u2019s asylum reforms which are intended to curb the intertwined flow of caravan-style migrants and cartel-smuggled migrants.\n\nThe judge claimed November 20 that the President\u2019s constitutional duty to guard the border is overwhelmed by illegal migrants\u2019 Congress-granted right to claim full asylum once they illegally place a foot on the U.S. side of the border. The judge\u2019s decision would likely also bar U.S. officials from deporting migrants to Mexico pending a routine review of their asylum claims.\n\nThe establishment\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Edwin Mora", "title": "Australia PM: Muslim Leaders on 'a Path of Denial' by Not Discussing Extremism", "description": "Senior Islamic community leaders\u2019 decision to boycott a meeting to discuss the jihadi threat facing Australia reportedly prompted Prime Minister Scott Morrison to blast the Muslim chiefs on Wednesday for turning a blind eye to\u00a0terrorism.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/22/australia-pm-muslim-leaders-on-a-path-of-denial-by-not-discussing-extremism/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/07/abba95_prime-minister-scott-morrison-vowed-boost-australia-engagement-in-pacific-e1541705981663.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T08:30:43Z", "content": "\u201cThe meeting [scheduled for Thursday] is going ahead with those who want to deal with this issue seriously rather than look the other way, Mr. Morrison said, according to the Associated Press (AP). \u201cSome have chosen to publicly boycott this meeting.

These statements have achieved nothing to address underlying issues, but rather, have alienated large segments of the Muslim community.\n\nOn Tuesday, Australian authorities charged three men with planning to carry out a thwarted attack during the busy Christmas season in Melbourne on behalf of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).\n\nEarly this month, ISIS claimed responsibility for a knife rampage, also in Melbourne, that killed one person and wounded two others."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "James Delingpole", "title": "UN Environment Chief Forced to Resign for Racking up Too Many Air Miles\u2026", "description": "The head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\u00a0 has been forced to resign after building up an \u201cobscene\u201d carbon footprint.

It has no foundation in science and would undo decades of progress on understanding sex \u2014 a classification based on internal and external bodily characteristics \u2014 and gender, a social construct related to biological differences but also rooted in culture, societal norms and individual behaviour. Worse, it would undermine efforts to reduce discrimination against transgender people and those who do not fall into the binary categories of male or female.\n\nSince its gradual emergence from Christian Europe, science has dramatically raised people\u2019s health, wealth, living standards, and freedoms. Transgenderism, however, has had a more modest role since its invention in the 1950s by political advocates.\n\nThe journal\u2019s top editors \u2014 Magdalena Skipper, Ritu Dhand, and Helen Pearson \u2014 approved the editorial which admits that more than 99 percent of people are clearly female or male. But the federal government must reject the straightforward sex-is-biology rule because fewer than one percent of people have health conditions which include genetic or physical features from both sexes, says the editorial:\n\nBiology is not as straightforward as the proposal suggests. By some estimates, as many as one in 100 people have differences or disorders of sex development, such as hormonal conditions, genetic changes or anatomical ambiguities, some of which mean that their genitalia cannot clearly be classified as male or female.\n\nThe Nature editorial was slammed by scientists who are worried that progressives will warp science:\n\nTo say \"this proposal has no foundation in science\" is nonsense. The genitals one is born with show overwhelming correlation with one's self-assessed gender, as predicted by evolutionary theory.

Transgender women are women \u2014 they live, work and study as women.\u201d\n\nThe revolutionary ambition of that demand was sketched in a 2014 sermon from Attorney General Eric Holder, who told an audience in Sweden that:\n\nOur Civil Rights Division is fighting to \u2026 safeguard those who are targeted just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity [because] every human being is, and must be, free and equal in both dignity and rights. Neither tradition nor fear of change can absolve us of the obligation we share: to identify and eradicate discrimination in all its forms \u2026 As we continue to move forward, we will undoubtedly encounter resistance and opposition both at home and around the world.\n\nTrump\u2019s deputies have reversed much of Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policies, which would have reached into many corners of society. For example, Obama\u2019s education policy would have forced high school biology teachers to use opposite-sex pronouns when addressing children who had declared themselves to be \u201ctransgender\u201d:\n\nThe DCPS Guidance provides examples of prohibited harassment that transgender students sometimes experience, including misusing an individual\u2019s preferred name or pronouns on purpose, asking personal questions about a person\u2019s body or gender transition, and disclosing private information.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s transgender push has become party orthodoxy since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nHHS agency drafts plan to rely on biological sex \u2013 not transgender claims \u2013 when documenting people's legal sex. This return to normality would protect civil rights by disestablishing Obama's TG ideology which seeks to erase bio/sex in law & civic society. https://t.co/z48k8JqhDv \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 22, 2018\n\nIn November 2018, 98 Democratic members of Congress declared that it is \u201ccruel and unscientific\u201d to define a person\u2019s legal sex by their biology. Trump\u2019s biology-determines-sex policy \u201cmakes it clear that members of this administration are willing to \u2026 solidify an archaic, dogmatic, and alarming view of the world,\u201d the 98 Democrats complain their letter to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 statement was sent to the agency after the New York Times reported that the administration would formally clarify that the sex of people involved in sex-discrimination legal fights will be based on their male or female body.\n\nOn November 19, a group of 20 Democratic Attornies General declared:\n\n[We] write to express our deep concern over recent reports that your Departments are contemplating adopting a narrow definition of \u201csex\u201d that would have the purpose and effect of excluding transgender and gender nonconforming people from the protections of critical federal civil rights laws like Title IX and the nondiscrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act. \u2026 Defining \u201csex\u201d as an immutable, binary biological trait determined by or before birth is inconsistent with current medical consensus. The American Medical Association, for example, recognizes that \u201cgender is \u2018incompletely understood as a binary selection\u2019 because gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and genotypic and phenotypic sex are not always aligned\u201d\u2026\n\nThe full inclusion of all people, regardless of gender identity or expression, makes our communities stronger and more vibrant.

Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, and people trying to \u201cdetransition\u201d back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say are entitled to women\u2019s\u2019 rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug-companies and medical service providers.\n\nTransgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\n\nYet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, children\u2019s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u2019s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children\u2019s sexual privacy."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "AWR Hawkins", "title": "Sheriff Investigating Parkland Shooting: Teachers Must Be Armed to Stop Attacks", "description": "Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri is leading an investigation into the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting and insists teachers must be armed to stop attacks.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/21/sheriff-investigating-parkland-shooting-teachers-must-be-armed-to-stop-attacks/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Pinellas-County-Sheriff-Bob-Gualtieri-7-18-AP.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T04:50:48Z", "content": "This is a change in his position as he long contended that only law enforcement should be armed in schools.

This means more than 98 percent of Japan\u2019s population is native-born Japanese.\n\nAnd while there has been a global effort for Japan to take in more immigrants, nearly six-in-ten Japanese citizens, or 58 percent, say the country\u2019s near-zero net migration policy should remain in place.\n\nLess than 25 percent of Japanese citizens want more immigration to the country, and 13 percent say Japan should reduce the small number of immigrants it currently admits every year.\n\nJapanese citizens\u2019 immigrant restrictionist views are not due to their hostility towards immigrants, themselves, however. The vast majority, 75 percent, of Japanese citizens say immigrants want to adopt their customs and way of life.\n\nAbout 60 percent say immigrants in Japan \u2014 deriving primarily from Korea and China \u2014 are not terrorist threats, 59 percent say immigrants make their nation stronger, and 52 percent say immigrants are no more to blame for crime than citizens in Japan.\n\nThe immigration situation in Japan is immensely different from the one in the U.S., where the overwhelming majority of the 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants that arrive in America every year are from cultures and countries that differ greatly from the U.S.\n\nAs Breitbart News chronicled, the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country in 2017, with the foreign-born population booming to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.\n\nThe last time the U.S. foreign-born population was this high was in 1910 when immigrants made up 14.7 percent of the total country\u2019s population.\n\nThe country\u2019s last immigration boom \u2014 between 1900 and 1920 \u2014 was eventually met with a near immigration moratorium. Between 1925 and 1966, the yearly U.S. legal immigration level did not exceed 327,000 admissions, a four-decades-long near moratorium that allowed the massive inflows of immigrants from before 1925 the ability to assimilate.\n\nU.S. voters have hinted that they favor a near immigration moratorium \u2014 as done in the past \u2014 since the country\u2019s immigration flow has boomed to historic levels. In an April Harvard/Harris Poll, two out of three voters said they supported Trump\u2019s plan to cut legal immigration levels down to at least 500,000 admissions a year.\n\nA similar Harvard/Harris Poll in January found that more Americans support zero immigration to the country than they do current legal immigration levels. Black Americans, in the same Harvard/Harris Poll, were found to be the most supportive of a near immigration moratorium. Nearly half of black Americans said they would like to see between one and 250,000 legal immigrants brought to the U.S. a year.\n\nVoters have also suggested that mass immigration levels are resulting in a lack of assimilation among foreign populations in the U.S. A CBS News/YouGov Poll in June found that more than four-in-nine black Americans in swing districts across the country said immigration to the U.S. was making life \u201cworse\u201d in their communities.\n\nThe swing districts poll revealed that nearly 60 percent of white likely voters and 61 percent of likely swing voters who see changes in their neighborhoods from mass immigration said that immigration to the U.S. is making their communities \u201cworse.\u201d A majority of white, black, and Hispanic Americans say stricter immigration enforcement is needed.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

By this measure, religious faith ranks lower, on par with reading and careers. But among those who do find a great deal of meaning in their religious faith, more than half say it is the single most important source of meaning in their lives. Overall, 20 percent of Americans say religion is the most meaningful aspect of their lives, second only to the share who say this about family (40 percent).\n\nAmong the other key findings from the surveys:\n\n\u2022 Americans with high levels of household income and educational attainment are more likely to mention friendship, good health, stability, and travel. A quarter of Americans who earn at least $75,000 a year mention their friends when asked to describe, in their own words, what makes life meaningful, compared with 14 percent of Americans who earn less than $30,000 each year. Similarly, 23 percent of higher-income U.S. adults mention being in good health, compared with 10 percent of lower-income Americans. And among those with a college degree, 11 percent mention travel and a sense of security as things that make their lives fulfilling, compared with 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, who name these sources of meaning among those with a high school degree or less.\n\n\u2022 Politically conservative Americans are more likely than liberals to find meaning in religion, while liberals find more meaning in creativity and causes than do conservatives. Spirituality and faith are commonly mentioned by very conservative Americans as imbuing their lives with meaning and fulfillment; 38 percent cite it in response to the open-ended question, compared with just 8 percent of very liberal Americans \u2013 a difference that holds even when controlling for religious affiliation. By contrast, the closed-ended question finds that very liberal Americans are especially likely to derive \u201ca great deal\u201d of meaning from arts or crafts (34 percent) and social and political causes (30 percent), compared with rates of 20 percent and 12 percent among very conservative Americans.\n\n\u2022 Regardless of their particular religious denomination, black Americans are more likely than others to mention faith and spirituality when describing (in the open-ended question) what gives them a sense of meaning.3 Fully three-in-ten black Americans (30 percent) mention spirituality and faith, compared with 20 percent of whites and 15 percent of Hispanics.\n\n\u2022 Younger Americans less likely to mention religion, but draw more meaning from learning than older Americans. Just 10 percent of U.S. adults under age 30 mention spirituality, faith or God when describing (in the open-ended question) what affects their sense of meaning.

No one party has ever won an outright majority of seats in Israel\u2019s 120-seat parliament, the Knesset. And so, since the first Knesset was elected in 1949, all of Israel\u2019s governments have been coalition governments comprised of one or two major parties and several minor sectoral parties.\n\nLiberman is the head of a small party called Israel Beitenu. When he resigned, he pulled his party out of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition and brought its governing majority down from a healthy 67 seats to the bare minimum of 61 seats.\n\nIn the ensuing days, various coalition partners, jockeying to improve their positions vis-\u00e0-vis one another and vis-\u00e0-vis Netanhyahu\u2019s Likud party (the largest party by far in his governing coalition), threatened to bolt the government and so precipitate its downfall.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon Netanyahu had fended off their efforts while taking over the Defense Ministry from Liberman. Before Netanyahu quelled the unrest, it appeared that the Knesset elections, scheduled to take place next November would be pushed up to March 2019. But now, with his coalition partners\u2019 challenges fended off, there is a fairly good chance that Netanyahu\u2019s government will live out its days until next November, or, at a minimum, until the end of May.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the political drama that gripped Israel for the better part of the week isn\u2019t what was discussed in the news. The most interesting aspect of Netanyahu\u2019s political storm is who wasn\u2019t involved in it and indeed, who had nothing to say about it.\n\nLeft and center-left parties had nothing to contribute to the drama. No one looked to their leaders as possible successors to Netanyahu. All of the media commentaries and day-to-day instant polls showed that if the government were to have fallen and new elections held, at the end of a prolonged campaign, Israeli voters would return election results very similar to the results of the last election in 2015.\n\nThe polls are unanimous in their assessment that Netanyahu will maintain his position as prime minister. His Likud party will win the largest number of seats in the Knesset by far. His current coalition partners will return to the next Knesset with more or less the same number of seats they have in the current Knesset.\n\nAnd for their parts, the left and center-left parties will remain in the opposition as minority factions. They have no chance of cobbling together a governing majority and forming a left-center-left government.\n\nFor months the media have been touting former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of general staff Benny Gantz as a possible leftist spoiler in the next election. Although Gantz has made no significant policy statements since retiring four years ago, polls have a hypothetical party under his leadership receiving 15 seats, some of them from Likud.\n\nGantz\u2019s hypothetical party, however, is likely to only go down like a popped balloon if it every becomes a real entity. In 1999, the media insisted that recently retired IDF chief of general staff Amnon Shahak would beat Netanyahu in that year\u2019s elections. In the end, the party he formed won a mere five seats in the Knesset and disbanded shortly after the elections, with members splitting between the Likud and Labor parties.\n\nIn 2014, the media insisted that recently retired IDF chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi would form a party that would beat Likud in the 2015 elections. In the event, Ashkenazi was wrecked by scandal and never ran for office.\n\nShortly after the poll showing Gantz would win 15 seats in the next election, Miri Regev, Israel\u2019s Minister of Culture and Sports, noted that as chief of general staff, Ganz declared Israel\u2019s 2014 war with Hamas over and told Israelis to go hiking in the war torn south of the country. Shortly thereafter, four-year-old Daniel Tregerman was killed by a mortar in his home. If Gantz throws his hat in the ring, and makes any substantive statements, the 15 seats he polls as a hypothetical candidate will likely shrink significantly.\n\nHow has it happened that Israel\u2019s left and center-left parties have become bit players, if that, in Israeli politics? Why is it that commentators from both sides of the political spectrum dismiss the prospect of Netanyahu being unseated by a leftist challenger?\n\nThere are, in essence, three reasons that Israeli voters do not view political parties along the left-center-left spectrum as serious contenders to lead their government.\n\nThe first reason is that for the past generation, Israel\u2019s left has pursued national security and diplomatic policies that have unquestionably and vividly failed. The left\u2019s embrace of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as Israel\u2019s partner was based on a gamble that by giving the PLO land, money, arms and legitimacy, Israel would moderate the terror group.\n\nThe gamble failed. Some 1,600 Israelis \u2013 mainly civilians \u2014 were murdered in the Palestinian terror onslaught that began as the PLO was setting up its government in Gaza and parts of Judea and Samaria in 1994.\n\nThe left\u2019s big decision to withdraw unilaterally from Israel\u2019s security zone in southern Lebanon in May 2000 enabled Iran\u2019s Lebanese proxy army Hezbollah to take over southern Lebanon. It also set the conditions for the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nThe left\u2019s big decision to withdraw unilaterally from the Gaza Strip in August 2005 transformed Gaza, which had never been more than a tactical nuisance, into a strategic threat. Hamas seized control over Gaza from the PLO in 2007. And it is now poised to take over the PLO itself, while working hand-in-glove with various terror organizations \u2014 as well as with Iran, Turkey, and Qatar\u2014 to undermine Israel. Hamas and its partners are also helping terror forces in Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula with the goal of overthrowing the regime of Egyptian President Abdel el Fattah a-Sisi. More than 6 million Israelis now live in range of Hamas\u2019s missiles, mortars and rockets.\n\nSince Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza, it has fought three separate and significant counterterror operations against Hamas and its partner terror groups in Gaza.\n\nIsraelis were willing to trust the left with governing the country after the peace process failed. The last election the left won, in 2006, preceded the war with Hezbollah, which made clear that the 2000 withdrawal from the security zone was a mistake. It also preceded Hamas\u2019s takeover of Gaza, which demonstrated the folly of the left\u2019s push for unilateral withdrawals from contested territories.\n\nThe widespread public awareness of the devastating consequences of the left\u2019s national security policies is not the only reason that the left has made itself into a political irrelevancy in Israel. During its years in the political desert, the left has become increasingly radicalized both organizationally and ideologically. This radicalization has worked to its disadvantage in two ways.\n\nFrom and organizational standpoint, for the better part of the last decade, Israeli left and center-left parties have devoted time and energy demonizing large sectors of Israeli society and insisting that they won\u2019t work with parties that represent those sectors. Leftist parties have rejected cooperation with religious parties, social conservative parties, and free market parties, as well as center-right parties.\n\nIn 2009, the center-left Kadima party won 29 seats in Knesset elections, which made it the largest faction in the parliament. But Kadima leader and former foreign minister Tzipi Livni was unable to cobble together a coalition because most of the minor parties refused to join a coalition government under her leadership. Netanyahu and his Likud party had won 28 seats in the 2009 elections, but unlike Livni, Netanyahu was able to form a fairly stable governing coalition.\n\nThe left\u2019s ideological radicalization became undeniable over the past summer. In July, the Knesset passed a new law called the Jewish Nation State Law. The law did nothing more than give quasi-constitutional weight to Israel\u2019s national identity as the nation state of the Jewish people, and to its national symbols, including its national anthem and flag. It declared that Israel\u2019s national language \u2013 Hebrew \u2013 is Israel\u2019s national language. And so on and so forth.\n\nRather than shrug their shoulders and vote in favor of this uncontroversial piece of legislation, Israel\u2019s political left had a collective apoplectic fit. They insisted that Israel\u2019s national ethos and symbols were exclusionary and therefore passing the law was a racist act.\n\nTheir position was shocking because consistent survey data of the Israeli people have demonstrated that the public is nationalist, proud, and unapologetic. A mere eight percent of Israeli Jews identify as leftists. And yet, far-left and center-left parties spent several months competing to see who could condemn the law most vociferously and hysterically. In so doing, they effectively wrote the Likud\u2019s political campaign in the next elections.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear that Netanyahu\u2019s government will live out its days or whether Israel will go to early elections. Some commentators claim that the next elections will take place in late May, after Israel\u2019s Independence Day.\n\nBut what the political dramas of the past several days made clear is that whenever Israel holds its next elections, their results will be unlikely to deliver a new government that is significantly different from the current one.\n\nCaroline Glick is a world-renowned journalist and commentator on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, and the author of The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East.

For example, Forbes claimed in September that Trump\u2019s tariffs on China would hurt the U.S. more than China:\n\nLikewise, the Associated Press in July highlighted \u201cexperts\u201d who said Trump\u2019s tariffs would hurt American workers and the U.S. rather than China:\n\nInstead, many analysts say they expect the Trump administration to impose more tariffs on China and potentially other key U.S. trading partners. With those nations almost certain to retaliate, the result could be higher prices for Americans, diminished export sales and a weaker U.S. economy by next year. \u2026 \u201cPeople are underestimating what we\u2019re headed for,\u201d said Rod Hunter, a lawyer who served as a White House economic adviser under President George W. Bush. \u201cHe\u2019s been saying since the \u201980s that trade deals are bad and we should have more tariffs, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney claimed in June that the tariffs on China would hurt the U.S. going as far as to say a trade war with China would reduce U.S. GDP.\n\n\u201c[Mark Carney] revealed forecasts made by Threadneedle Street showing the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners,\u201d the Guardian reported.\n\nFree trader Dan Hutcheson of VLSI Research Inc. told MarketWatch last month that Trump\u2019s tariffs would hurt U.S. tech conglomerates\u2019 billion dollar profits.\n\n\u201cHere are two ways tariffs will slow industry growth: Prices will be raised, and it will create uncertainty,\u201d Hutcheson said. \u201cHigher prices across all goods affected will cause companies to be uncertain about demand for electronics products in the upcoming holiday season. If they are not confident that the market will be there, they will hold off buying semiconductors to build inventories for the holidays.\u201d\n\nFor months, Silicon Valley has complained that tariffs will make importing their Chinese-manufactured products back into the U.S. more expensive and cut into their profit margins. The tech companies, though, could avoid the Chinese tariffs by moving their production back to the U.S.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Trump\u2019s recently imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion boosted American manufacturing orders for communications equipment, computers, appliances, and fabricated metals. The increase in U.S. manufacturing orders on these tariff-protected goods reveals that Trump\u2019s tariffs are working as intended, boosting domestic manufacturing while reducing reliance on Chinese imports.\n\nChina Tariffs Boosted Manufacturing Orders in October | Breitbart https://t.co/6CtpGVYaPI via @BreitbartNews \u2014 John Carney (@carney) November 21, 2018\n\nThere have been about 11,100 U.S. jobs created due to Trump\u2019s protective tariffs as of August. On the other hand, there have been about 514 job losses directly tied to the tariffs. There are 20 times as many American jobs that have been created in the last six months thanks to Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported foreign goods than jobs that have been lost.\n\nA majority of nearly 60 percent of likely voters say it is important for Trump and Congress to \u201cplace trade restrictions on countries that violate trade agreements\u201d to create more American jobs. Meanwhile, only 38 percent of likely voters said entering new free trade deals is the most important means to creating U.S. jobs."}]
