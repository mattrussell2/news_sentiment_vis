Even if you haven\u2019t said them, you most certainly believe in your neighbor\u2019s right to say them. But for too many people around the globe, words such as these can be a death sentence. I\u2019ve made it a personal mission of mine in office to stop the United States from funding or being allied with places that persecute Christians.\n\nOne such case is Pakistan and the story of Asia Bibi, a Christian who was on death row for blasphemy. She says it all began when she drew water from a Muslim villager\u2019s well. A few days after the initial incident, where she made the statement mentioned above, she was confronted by a crowd chanting, \u201cDeath! Death to the Christian!\u201d She pleaded for her life. She was pelted with stones, punched in the face, and dragged through the streets. The local Imam finally intervened only to say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, you must convert to Islam.\u201d The crowd descended on her again, beating her with sticks. She refused.\n\nFinally, the police stopped the attackers, only to arrest her. They put her in jail, where she remained from 2010 to last month. She was recently released from Pakistan prison, but she is not free.\n\nAmid protests in Pakistan from the extremist TLP party, the government has now refused to let her leave the country, putting her on their no-fly list. The protests and threats continue. It is only a matter of time before she is killed.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked President Trump to personally intervene and to urge the Pakistani government to release Asia Bibi to the United States.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to fight for Asia Bibi for years now. I spoke about her in speeches starting in 2012. I wrote about her in op-eds and in one of my books.\n\nDuring my time in Congress, I have introduced legislation to directly go after Pakistan\u2019s foreign aid and turn up the pressure on them to release Asia Bibi and stop persecuting religious minorities.\n\nUntil Asia Bibi is freed, Pakistan should not receive a penny of U.S. aid! Not one penny should go to any nation that persecutes or kills Christians!\n\nYou would think your representatives would get that message, but they don\u2019t. In 2014, I pushed legislatively to stop foreign aid to any country that gives the death penalty or life in prison to Christians for religious choices. Both Republicans and Democrats voted overwhelmingly to continue funding countries that persecute Christians. The committee voted 16-2 to keep sending aid to such countries.\n\nI can assure you this wouldn\u2019t be the result if we let Americans vote on it. Common sense isn\u2019t so common in Washington, D.C., so I\u2019ve been fighting this uphill battle on foreign aid subsidizing the war on Christianity for years, nearly alone.\n\nBut Donald Trump has the chance to do things differently. He\u2019s already signed legislation taking away aid from the Palestinian Authority, and he also taken away some aid from Pakistan for other problems.\n\nHe has the chance to both fix a huge human rights problem while attacking the D.C. foreign policy swamp that loves foreign aid more than nearly anything else.\n\nAsia Bibi deserves asylum in the United States. She deserves real freedom. And Americans deserve to know their tax dollars aren\u2019t being sent to subsidize a country\u2019s war on Christianity.\n\nRand Paul, a Republican, is Kentucky\u2019s junior U.S. senator."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Edwin Mora, Edwin Mora", "title": "State Media: China Orders Muslim Uighurs 'to Surrender' to Re-Education Centers", "description": "Chinese authorities in Muslim-majority Xinjiang ordered members of the majority-Muslim Uighur ethnic minority this weekend \u201cto surrender within 30 days\u201d if they have been accused of \"terrorism,\" or dissent from the Communist Party.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/19/state-media-china-muslim-uighurs-surrender-re-education-centers/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/afp/10/2b16ab_china-has-launched-an-unprecedented-crackdown-on-religious-expression-e1539525424790.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:48:50Z", "content": "Those who surrender will be eligible to avoid prison and instead join the estimated million being held in internment camps China calls \u201cvocational centers,\u201d where they are forced to swear allegiance to Communist Party leader Xi Jinping and abandon their faith\u2026 [+5409 chars]", "fulltext": "Chinese authorities in Muslim-majority Xinjiang ordered members of the majority-Muslim Uighur ethnic minority this weekend \u201cto surrender within 30 days\u201d if they have been accused of \u201cterrorism,\u201d or dissent from the Communist Party.\n\nThose who surrender will be eligible to avoid prison and instead join the estimated million being held in internment camps China calls \u201cvocational centers,\u201d where they are forced to swear allegiance to Communist Party leader Xi Jinping and abandon their faith or face various forms of torture.\n\nChina has reportedly forced Uighurs accused of engaging in terrorist and separatist activities into various concentration camps, also known as re-education centers, located across Xinjiang, an accusation that Beijing denies.\n\nBeijing argues that the camps are vocational training centers used to purge the \u201cthree evil forces\u201d of separatism, extremism, and terrorism from the Muslim Uighur community.\n\nVarious human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, have long accused China of conducting a \u201ccampaign of systematic repression\u201d against Muslim residents in the predominantly Uighur (or Uyghur) Xinjiang province.\n\nCiting a notice published on the official WeChat account of Hami Cyberspace Affairs Commission on Sunday, the state-run Global Times noted that Uighur suspects of terrorist and separatist activities should \u201cturn themselves in to authorities by visiting police stations, procurators, courts, or by letter, telegram or phone,\u201d adding that those who surrender would face a \u201clesser punishment.\u201d\n\nLi Wei, a counter-terrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, conceded to the Global Times that \u201csuch notice served to deepen the campaign of cracking down on terrorism in Xinjiang, as regional vocational training centers have achieved great success in anti-radicalization of Xinjiang society.\u201d\n\nWei reportedly indicated, \u201cSome terrorists who surrender, instead of being put into prisons, may go to vocational training centers to learn practical skills, such as language and knowledge to better understand the religion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. government and United Nations, China has forced hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uighurs into the concentration camps in Xinjiang, the country\u2019s largest province, as part of Bejing\u2019s efforts to bring them back into the fold of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nAs part of Beijing\u2019s mind-transformation efforts, Muslim Uighurs are subjected to forced Communist Party indoctrination, systemic torture, disappearances, executions, and arbitrary detentions.\n\nAccording to its annual report unveiled last month, the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China found:\n\nSecurity personnel at these facilities reportedly subjected detainees to political indoctrination and forced marching; overcrowding; poor quality food; and torture, including in the forms of medical neglect and maltreatment, waterboarding, sleep deprivation, lack of adequate clothing in cold temperatures, and other forms of abuse.\n\nGlobal Times claims that Communist authorities in Xinjiang \u201curged suspects of violence and terrorism and those influenced by the three evil forces of separatism, extremism, and terrorism to surrender within 30 days for leniency.\u201d\n\nThe state media outlet reveals that local authorities listed 18 situations in which Muslim Uighurs should turn themselves in, including:\n\n[R]recruiting people to establish terrorist groups or colluding with overseas terrorist groups, helping terrorists make weapons or explosives and raising funds or providing other needed help for terrorists. People who receive training from terrorist groups, or purchase maps, GPS, compasses, telescopes, ropes, tents or other training materials, and help download or provide links of audio, video, and text related to terrorism or offer VPN for overseas websites should surrender. Those who send minor children or students to learn religious doctrine or advocate using the Koran to regulate normal life and reject Party officials should also turn themselves in, and those who get married or divorced using religious rites, commit bigamy or interfere with family planning policy in the name of religion should surrender.\n\nMoreover, Communist authorities also urged Uighurs who prevent \u201cothers from watching television programs or induce others to boycott national preferential policies, such as rejecting government-subsidized housing or calling for a ban of goods belong to Han people, to give themselves up,\u201d Global Times revealed.\n\nThis month, the Global Times noted that China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) had intensified its counterterrorism and border patrol activities in Xinjiang.\n\nSome experts from the Council on Foreign Relations have linked some Chinese Uighurs to al-Qaeda and Taliban-affiliated jihadi groups like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) that operate in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, which the Pentagon says is home to the \u201chighest concentration\u201d of terrorist groups in the world.\n\nXinjiang shares a long border with various countries including Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.\n\nUighur (or Uyghur) members of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS) have threatened to attack China. Bejing has accused some Uighurs of carrying out attacks in China in the past.\n\nChinese authorities have also reportedly sent some Uighurs who converted to Christianity to the mind-transformation camps.\n\nA Canada-led coalition of 15 Western ambassadors in Beijing is pushing for a meeting with Xinjiang\u2019s Communist Party boss to discuss the rampant human rights abuses against Uighurs, Reuters reported last week.\n\nAlthough the letter did not include an American envoy, U.S. President Donald Trump and members of Congress have expressed a willingness to sanction Beijing for the abuses at the concentration camps in Xinjiang."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Penny Starr", "title": "Pelosi Prepares for Speakership Battle, Paints Opposition as Leftist Version of Freedom Caucus", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is putting in place the support she needs to regain the Speaker\u2019s gavel despite some opposition.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/19/pelosi-prepares-speakership-battle-paints-opposition-leftist-version-freedom-caucus/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/ap/19/8663bb_democrats-pelosi-48988-nancy-pelosi-house-minority-leader-nancy-pelosi-e1542670812826.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:42:00Z", "content": "But part of Pelosis strategy is warning members of her party that taking her down would give power to a minority of Democrats, similar to the conservative House Freedom Caucus and the influence it has wielded over the eight years of a Republican majority.

But the policy penalizes illegal migrants by preventing them from applying for a full asylum once they are caught sneaking over the border.\n\nThe illegal migrants are still allowed to apply for a limited asylum, dubbed \u201cwithholding of removal.\u201d Officials say the reform follows the law by providing asylum-like protections to illegal migrants, but it does not allow the migrants to become citizens, and also helps border officials quickly deport the migrants.\n\nThe lawsuit is being heard by an English-born judge, Jon S. Tigar. He was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2012 to a seat on the very progressive, migrant-friendly Ninth Circuit. If he rules against Trump\u2019s \u201cwithholding of departure\u201d reform, Justice Department will ask the Supreme Court to quickly reverse the judge\u2019s decision.\n\nThe ACLU and its allies argue that all migrants who enter U.S. territory must be allowed to make a request for a full asylum \u2014 even if the U.S. territory is on the Mexican side of the border wall or is in the U.S. half of the Rio Grande river.\n\nThis one-foot-asylum policy would help large groups of economic migrants \u2014 such as the progressive-backed caravan of several thousand Hondurans \u2014 legally overwhelm U.S. border defenses. For example, on November 12 and 13, coyotes delivered 654 migrants, most of whom are parents with children, or youths traveling alone, to the U.S. side of the border near Yuma Arizona, according to a DHS statement. Once on U.S. territory, the illegal migrants ask for asylum \u2014 and often get catch-and-release if the local border officials do not have enough detention space.\n\nThe Associated Press reported:\n\n\u201cIndividuals are entitled to asylum if they cross between ports of entry,\u201d said Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be clearer.\u201d \u2026 ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said that some people seeking asylum cross between official ports because \u201cthey\u2019re in real danger,\u201d either in their countries of origin or in Mexico. \u201cWe don\u2019t condone people entering between ports of entry, but Congress has made the decision that if they do, they still need to be allowed to apply for asylum,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s asylum reform curbs the caravan by pressuring the migrants to wait in line at the official \u201cports of entry,\u201d rather than by just walking over the invisible borderline in the sand or the river to claim amnesty.\n\nAt the same time, officials are also limiting the number of migrants who can apply for asylum each day at the official ports of entry.\n\nThe waiting process, dubbed \u201cmetering,\u201d allows officials to begin processing roughly 100 migrants per day. The complex legal process takes at least 40 days to accomplish, so a daily intake of 100 people per day adds up to roughly 4,000 people in detention from one entry point.\n\nThe metering process allows officials to keep a manageable number of people in the process, and to perhaps sharply reduce the number of migrants who are being released into the United States via the \u201ccatch and release\u201d loopholes.\n\nEnding catch-and-release is vital because it would stop migrants from getting the U.S jobs which fund the migration process. Without access to jobs, migrants cannot pay their smuggling debts to the cartels, and cannot hire the cartels to bring their spouses and children up to the United States. If the migrants cannot pay their smuggling debts, the cartels\u2019 labor-trafficking business will shrink.\n\nThe ACLU and its allies are also asking a judge to stop the metering process.\n\nIf the ACLU\u2019s elite lawyers persuade a judge to block either the metering process of the withholding of removal rule, they will cripply Trump\u2019s effort to protect American workers from cheap migrant labor, such as cheap kitchen staff at restaurants used by elite lawyers.\n\nTrump's new asylum ban is in effect right now.

Salah and his brother Abdullah have been, at most, moderately critical of the government over the death of their father and have even defended the monarchy against \u201cmisinformation\u201d about Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death.

The Washington Post, which employed Jamal Khashoggi as a contributor, has speculated the brothers have been \u201cmeasured\u201d in their criticism because they are worried about the safety of family members in Saudi Arabia, or perhaps because they have \u201cgenuine faith in the Saudi government and skepticism of the way the Turkish government is handling the investigation into the killing.\u201d\n\nSelvi also said Turkish officials have a second, longer audio recording of Khashoggi\u2019s death that contradicts some of the key findings released by the Saudi prosecutor\u2019s office last week. The Wall Street Journal elaborated that Turkish investigators have phone intercepts that contradict the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that Khashoggi\u2019s death was an accident:\n\nOne recording captured the Saudi operatives rehearsing how they would proceed with the killing minutes before Mr. Khashoggi entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, according to a senior Turkish official. \u201cThey discuss how they are going to kill him,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt was fully premeditated.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Sunday that he has not personally listened to the \u201cterrible tape\u201d of Khashoggi\u2019s \u201cvery violent, very vicious\u201d killing, but he has been \u201cfully briefed\u201d on its contents. The president said U.S. officials would produce a \u201cvery full report\u201d on the Khashoggi slaying before Thanksgiving, most likely on Monday or Tuesday. He did not indicate whether the report will be made public.\n\nTurkish commentator Ibrahim Karag\u00fcl of the pro-government Yeni Safak expects nothing less than a string of atomic bombshells to tumble from the files of Turkish prosecutors in the coming days, as they release information that will implicate suspects far beyond the royal palaces of Riyadh in Khashoggi\u2019s murder:\n\nThe conversations among the murderers, their conversations with Riyadh after committing the murder, dialogues that will prove the crown prince was the one who directly gave the order, perhaps the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egyptian intelligence\u2019s role in the incident, and as a matter of fact, information on Israeli intelligence\u2019s \u201cexpertise\u201d or on the U.S. leg of the murder may be revealed. Information of this kind will shake the world, lead to tremors in the region, turn the Saudi palace upside down, and create brand new situations in the region\u2019s power structuring. I have been writing from the very start of the incident that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the boss behind this, that he personally gave the order, that the UAE\u2019s Mohammed Bin Zayed is a partner in the murder, that the whole world is now trying to save the crown prince, and that they are at the table ready to exhaust all their money and influence for this purpose. Up until now, when everything was actually very blatant, despite everybody knowing who gave the order, who killed Khashoggi, who the murderers are connected to, that the Saudi crown prince is directly the architect of this atrocity, efforts have been made to cover up the incident. We know that Saudi Arabia and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration are trying to cover up this incident, and that the U.S.-Israel-Saudi Arabia-UAE axis are both negotiating and tampering with evidence in efforts to \u201csave\u201d the Saudi crown prince. They have reached the point of paying any price to save the crown prince; they are willing to negotiate anything, including Qatar or the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (FET\u00d6). The forces behind the July 15, 2016 coup attempt are now working hard to save Prince Mohammed, to save the newly established \u201cevil axis\u201d in the region, and to maintain the \u201cnew Middle East design\u201d they planned themselves.\n\nThe Fethullah Terrorist Organization is the Turkish government\u2019s name for the followers of exiled imam Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States and has been accused of masterminding the failed 2016 coup against President Erdogan.\n\nKarag\u00fcl had one more suspect to loop into his Murder on the Orient Express scenario: President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner:\n\nWhy is Trump in panic? Because the third leg in the relationship between Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE\u2019s Mohammed bin Zayed is his son-in-law Jared Kushner. It was this trio behind the secret negotiations for Jerusalem. It was this trio that tried to wipe out Turkey from the whole region. It is this trio that is still carrying out all the covert operations targeting Turkey, and trying to activate certain groups inside the country. It is this trio that doomed Saudi Arabia to Israel. It is this trio that made secret negotiations regarding Mecca and Medina.\n\nIt should not take long to discover if Turkish investigators have more damaging audiotapes to release; Karagul is probably correct to anticipate them doing so sooner rather than later, most likely after the Turks see what is contained in the upcoming U.S. report and what President Trump decides to do with the information. For the moment, the Turkish rumor mill keeps churning."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Frances Martel, Frances Martel", "title": "Imprisoned Cuban Dissident Rapper Sews His Mouth Shut in Protest", "description": "Cuban rapper \"Pupito en Sy\" announced a hunger strike in solidarity with fellow hip-hop artist Maykel Castillo \"El Osorbo,\" who last week sewed his mouth shut while in prison to protest Cuba's impending ban on \"unauthorized\" music.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/19/imprisoned-cuban-dissident-rapper-sews-mouth-shut-protest/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/19/c2b79d_senior-cuban-foreign-ministry-official-rodolfo-reyes-told-afp-talks-eu-e1542669292692.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:16:29Z", "content": "The ban, known as Decree 349, requires that all musicians register with the Communist Party\u2019s Ministry of Culture before they produce music or perform music in public, effectively banning any musicians who disagree with the government from distributing their \u2026 [+4937 chars]", "fulltext": "Cuban rapper \u201cPupito en Sy\u201d announced a hunger strike in solidarity with fellow hip-hop artist Maykel Castillo \u201cEl Osorbo,\u201d who last week sewed his mouth shut while in prison to protest Cuba\u2019s impending ban on \u201cunauthorized\u201d music.\n\nThe ban, known as Decree 349, requires that all musicians register with the Communist Party\u2019s Ministry of Culture before they produce music or perform music in public, effectively banning any musicians who disagree with the government from distributing their art. Rappers and artists of the Latin dance genre reggaet\u00f3n have complained that the law disproportionately hurts their genres as dissidents have found in them an innovative form of expressing their displeasure with communism.\n\n\u201cPupito en Sy,\u201d whose real name is L\u00e1zaro Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez Betancourt, was arrested last week for allegedly attempting to assault police officials. According to sister Aymara D\u00edaz, who spoke to the Miami-based news outlet Mart\u00ed, two members of the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) approached Rodr\u00edguez and beat him in public, an incident which she claims was caught on video. There is no evidence that Rodr\u00edguez approached or attacked the police officers.\n\nAccording to D\u00edaz, Rodr\u00edguez is \u201curinating blood, he has a fever and his brow is cut open, which needs stitches but he hasn\u2019t received them.\u201d A report in the Spain-based Diario de Cuba publication states that Rodr\u00edguez has also complained of a serious injury to his leg or foot, potentially a broken bone, but has not received medical attention.\n\nRodr\u00edguez said in a statement to his sister, \u201cIf I get out of here, it\u2019s to go home or the cemetery, I haven\u2019t done anything to anyone. He is refusing to eat at press time, citing both the attack on him and on colleague Maykel El Osorbo. Both artists are part of a larger movement opposing Decree 349.\n\nMaykel El Osorbo was arrested in September after organizing a concert featuring a variety of anti-communist rappers, including Rodr\u00edguez, to speak out against Decree 349. Diario de Cuba notes that he is facing charges that the government had already dropped against him, but does not specify what the charges are.\n\nOn Thursday, the artist Amaury Pacheco, a friend of the rapper\u2019s, posted a message on Facebook announcing that Maykel El Osorbo had launched a hunger strike and sewn his mouth shut. Pacheco posted a letter that the rapper had provided him with during his last visit to the prison where he is being held.\n\n\u201cIt is almost possible that this will be my last letter \u2026 in 24 hours I will begin a strike \u2026 with the purpose of reclaiming my freedom,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cI have made mine the pain of all of those politically exiled by the system in this country,\u201d it continues, urging all Cubans \u201cto join us pacifically with ideas, with art, without shedding a single drop of blood.\u201d\n\nMaykel El Osorbo also pointed to the individual Havana officials responsible for his arrest as also personally responsible for his death if it occurs.\n\n\u201cGod bless all Cubans wherever in the world they may be and, if death comes to me as part of my struggle for freedom of expression, don\u2019t feel guilty,\u201d he concludes.\n\nThe two rappers are part of a national coalition rejecting Decree 349 for essentially banning their art out of existence. In August, a group of artists published a letter protesting against several issues with the decree, including its vague language, the fact that the regime did not discuss the potential drawbacks of the law with any artists, and its proposed ban on crowdfunding, forcing all artists to profit through the communist government and allowing the regime to take a cut."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Oliver JJ Lane", "title": "Shots Across the Bow: Theresa May Warned Over Brexit Course as MPs Abstain on Finance Bill Votes", "description": "Theresa May had a warning shot fired across her bows Monday night as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) members of Parliament abstained from key votes on the Finance Bill, the legislation which permits the government\u2019s programme of taxation from the budget.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/11/19/shots-accross-the-bow-theresa-may-warned-over-brexit-course-as-mps-abstain-on-finance-bill-votes/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/GettyImages-1001891098-e1542664930118.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:05:41Z", "content": "The Northern Irish DUP members withheld their votes from the government, in a show of strength to the Prime Minister as she pushes on with her Brexit deal which, the party says, has crossed her red lines and betrayed the British region to the European Union. \u2026 [+2301 chars]", "fulltext": "Theresa May had a warning shot fired across her bows Monday night as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) members of Parliament abstained from key votes on the Finance Bill, the legislation which permits the government\u2019s programme of taxation from the budget.\n\nThe Northern Irish DUP members withheld their votes from the government, in a show of strength to the Prime Minister as she pushes on with her Brexit deal which, the party says, has crossed her red lines and betrayed the British region to the European Union.\n\nThe Prime Minister has been accused of putting the integrity of the United Kingdom at risk by allowing the European Union to treat Northern Ireland \u2014 an equal constituent part of the country \u2014 as separate and different.\n\nFollowing the 2017 election, the United Kingdom\u2019s Conservative government is a minority administration which is kept in power through a \u2018supply and confidence\u2019 agreement with the Northern Irish regional group the DUP.\n\nDUP Will Block May\u2019s Budget if \u2018Red Lines\u2019 Abandoned, Wants Brexit Delivered https://t.co/fOAcYULgk4 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 10, 2018\n\nWhen struck, the deal meant the smaller party would support the government on key votes including the Queen\u2019s Speech, the budget, and finance bills, allowing the administration to survive without enough of their own parliamentarians to otherwise run a stable government.\n\nBut the deal appeared to be in tatters Monday night after the MPs failed to vote with the government one of the bills specifically laid out in the agreement, the first time they have done so.\n\nBritain\u2019s BBC reports an unnamed \u201csenior DUP source\u201d who spoke of the abstention in divisions, remarking that it was \u201csending a message to Theresa May that if she wants to continue down the road of the withdrawal agreement and its effect on the Union then there will be repercussions in the Commons.

For example, I read Tom Cotton\u2019s piece, and it\u2019s filled with pure demagoguery in attacking this bill called the First Step Act.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nKirk continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a prison reform bill that\u2019s hopefully passing through Congress. The House passed it a couple of months ago, and now in this lame duck session the president is trying to get a legislative win before the new Congress is installed. The Senate would have to pass it and Mitch McConnell is being very hesitant. In fact he said it\u2019s probably unlikely that it would come to a vote.\u201d\n\nKirk added, \u201cThe demagoguery that Tom Cotton is putting forth in critiquing this bill really frustrated me, because I looked at the actual text of the bill and the studies from some conservative-libertarian think tanks. For example, Tom Cotton said it\u2019s going to be harder to deport illegal aliens which is something I care a lot about \u2026 and there\u2019s been no evidence to show that. I can\u2019t figure out where he came up with that.\u201d\n\nKirk went on, \u201cTom Cotton and his allies say, \u2018Anyone who is supporting this, you\u2019re also aligning yourself with Van Jones.\u2019 I\u2019m not fan of Van Jones, but that\u2019s a horrible argument; not to support something just because Van Jones supports it.\u201d\n\nMarlow concurred in rejecting guilt-by-association arguments against the FSA. \u201c[It is] the same thing as, [saying], \u2018You shouldn\u2019t like the president because David Duke endorsed him.'\u201d\n\nKirk remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s not sentencing reform. It\u2019s not even criminal justice reform. It\u2019s prison reform. Those are three different categories. \u2026 In essence, we have an exploding prison population of what some would call the wrong types of prisoners. So we focus a lot on non-violent prisoners and because of mandatory minimums and other laws, we have a heavy focus on people that didn\u2019t commit non-violent crimes that are serving a lot longer in prison than those that was actually committed violent atrocities.\u201d\n\nKirk stated, \u201cFor example, the average prison time for a rapist in America is eight to ten years, where you have some of these non-violent drug dealers that are in prison for 30, 40, or 50 years.\u201d\n\nKirk assessed, \u201cWe have to admit that at some time some of these prisoners will re-enter society. Studies and data show they have an extremely high likelihood of committing another crime and going back into the prison population if there aren\u2019t some measures \u2014 that have been proven to work, by the way, in red states \u2014 to allow these prisoners to re-enter society.\u201d\n\nKirk continued, \u201cFor example, Texas \u2014 that\u2019s not exactly Connecticut or Massachusetts \u2014 passed their equivalent of the First Step Act under Governor Rick Perry, and they saw recidivism rates go down, they saw prisoners re-enter the workplace population, and this bill is almost a direct carbon copy of what worked in Texas.\u201d\n\nKirk added, \u201cIt also worked in some other states in the South. I don\u2019t want to misspeak, but I believe Louisiana or Georgia did something similar. I know Texas has been the blueprint.\u201d\n\nKirk noted the FSA\u2019s proposal to do away with mandates for convicted felons to identify themselves as such via job applications.\n\n\u201c[The FSA has] a provision to get rid of the box, and that is, essentially, that a felon has to check a box when they go and apply for a job,\u201d noted Kirk. \u201cNow, the Senate is debating whether or not to put this in the Senate version bill, and there\u2019s been data to show there\u2019s some good and some bad about it.\u201d\n\nKirk explained, \u201cPart of the bill would provide some funding to a lot job training for the last ten percent of a prison sentence for some of the prisons to actually get some form of applicative job training to when they re-enter society they have some form of a skill so they can find some job.\u201d\n\nKirk continued, \u201cThe other part [of the bill] is actually parole reform, which incentivizes parole officers \u2014 and this worked in Texas, to actually work with former prisoners to find jobs and say, \u2018This is something you should do, and it actually is a forward direction to find work.'\u201d\n\nKirk claimed, \u201cStudies show that in Texas, when they did appropriate this money, it had a massive impact on actually [improving] prisoners\u2019 re-entry into society.\u201d\n\nKirk spoke of the status quo of what he described of excessive sentencing of felons convicted of non-violent crimes.\n\n\u201cWe do have to admit, something has to be done about this prison population,\u201d declared Kirk. \u201cIt is actually a huge burden on taxpayers. We spend tens of billions of dollars on prisons every single year, and arguably hundreds of billions of dollars on societal and cultural costs, whether it be broken families or broken homes. There is no good argument to be made that the prison system is working as it should, right now.\u201d\n\nKirk said, \u201cThis is not a get-out-of-jail-free or jailbreak bill. It does address sentencing reform. It does have some reforms on the parole side and allows re-entry to be more seamless, again, basing on red state reforms. \u2026 This is not a prison reform bill based on California or New York where people would maybe say, \u2018Oh my goodness.'\u201d\n\nKirk added, \u201cIt was [based] on the tough-on-crime state of Texas that Rick Perry supported. This is not a jailbreak bill. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t allow violent criminals the capacity to get out quicker. I think if a non-violent offender has been serving 20 years for drug possession or a drug-dealing charge, I think they should be able get another chance to re-enter society. People may disagree with that, but I think there have been a lot of problems with how we have overemphasized people that have distributed certain forms of drugs over the last 20 or 30 years and the difficulty for them to be able to re-enter society.\u201d\n\nSuccessful prison reform measures may help Republicans make political inroads with various communities, said Kirk.\n\n\u201cWhat if this actually works?\u201d asked Kirk. \u201cWhat if these prisoners start to get jobs and these communities get better? Maybe their communities might stop being so Democrat over a long period of time. That makes you think \u2026 Democrats want these communities to be perpetually poor.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Charlie Spiering, Charlie Spiering", "title": "Sarah Sanders Outlines Conduct Rules for White House Reporters", "description": "\"We have created these rules with a degree of regret,\" Sanders said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/19/sarah-sanders-outlines-rules-white-house-reporters/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/ap/08/0b0721_trump-36356-donald-trump-jim-acosta-president-donald-trump-speaks-cnn-journalist-e1542667937431.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:54:39Z", "content": "\u201cWe have created these rules with a degree of regret,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.

That poor management extends to the massive tracts of national forests in places like Colorado where so-called \u201cenvironmentalists\u201d use court challenges to prevent any logging, which curtails the natural spread of killer beetles and removes freshly killed standing trees.\n\nWithout select cutting or timbering, what remains is a tinderbox that will \u2014 eventually \u2014 go up in a plume of smoke that the so-called \u201cenvironmentalists\u201d will then claim as evidence somehow of their kooky religion.\n\n\u201cWith hotter and drier weather on the way, forest fires will be a part of life for tens of millions of Americans for the foreseeable future,\u201d Ms. Kolden wrote. \u201cWe need a new way to deal with them \u2014 not just better management, as the president suggests, but an entirely different approach to where and how we live in fire-prone areas.\u201d\n\nIf it were left up to the Never-Trumpers and Trump Derangement Syndrome patients, he would just play the fiddle instead.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Nate Church", "title": "\u2018Bus Driver from Heaven\u2019 Rescues Children from California Fire", "description": "Kevin McKay, 41, evacuated 22 children from the Ponderosa Elementary School in Paradise, California, on November 8.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/pre-viral/2018/11/19/bus-driver-heaven-rescues-children-california-fire/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/ap/17/6157b8_trump-california-wildfires-51187-donald-trump-children-stand-on-road-holding-e1542666546774.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:30:20Z", "content": "While most children had been picked up by their parents as the Camp Fire spread, nearly two dozen children were left stranded at the school.

The framework for all previous peace proposals (each of which was rejected by the Palestinian Authority) never called for an entire Israeli evacuation from the West Bank.\n\nPalestinians never had a state in the West Bank and they are not legally recognized as the undisputed authorities in those areas. Jordan illegally occupied and annexed the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem from 1948 until Israel captured the lands in a defensive war in 1967.\n\nThe 1967 Six Day War was launched after Arab countries used the territories to stage attacks against the Jewish state. In 1988, Jordan officially renounced its claims to the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and unilaterally recognized terrorist Yasser Arafat\u2019s Palestine Liberation Organization as \u201cthe sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nAirbnb\u2019s statement goes beyond the \u201coccupied\u201d canard to suggest Jews displaced Palestinians to build settlements. \u201cUS law permits companies like Airbnb to engage in business in these territories,\u201d Airbnb explained. \u201cAt the same time, many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced.\u201d\n\nHere, Airbnb seems to channel the wildly exaggerated Palestinian \u201cNakba\u201d narrative, which falsely claims that hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were expelled from their homes when the Jewish state was founded.\n\nThe reality is quite different. After Israel was founded in 1948, a military coalition of Arab nations immediately formed to wage war on the new Jewish state. Some local Arabs, who did not yet go by the name of Palestinians, left the area in anticipation of the war, others directly responded to the dictates of Arab states to stay out of the way so that invading armies could conquer Israel, and still others fled once the war started so that they were not caught up in the fighting.\n\nArab states waged the war after refusing to accept UN Resolution 181, which called for the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. The Jews immediately accepted the resolution, but the Arabs forthrightly rejected the plan, launching a war to destroy the Jewish state.\n\nIt should be noted that Israel\u2019s Declaration of Independence called on the local Arab population to remain in place:\n\nIn the midst of wanton aggression, we yet call upon the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve the ways of peace and play their part in the development of the State, on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its bodies and institutions.\n\nIt is true that some Jewish groups, including the Haganah, encouraged local Arabs to flee, however those few documented cases were the exception and not the rule.\n\nThe Economist, for example, reported that the Arab residents of Haifa left their homes in large part because of Arab army warnings:\n\nOf the 62,000 Arabs who formerly lived in Haifa not more than 5,000 or 6,000 remained. Various factors influenced their decision to seek safety in flight. There is but little doubt that the most potent of the factors were the announcements made over the air by the Higher Arab Executive, urging the Arabs to quit. \u2026 It was clearly intimated that those Arabs who remained in Haifa and accepted Jewish protection would be regarded as renegades.\n\n\u201cArab officers ordered the complete evacuation of specific villages in certain areas, lest their inhabitants \u2018treacherously\u2019 acquiesce in Israeli rule or hamper Arab military deployments,\u201d wrote historian Benny Morris.\n\nAirbnb, meanwhile, punishes Jews for living in the West Bank while seemingly ignoring that Israel offered much of the territory to the PA in numerous peace proposals. If the Palestinians wanted a state, they would not have to resort to peddling the BDS movement. Israel attempted to broker a Palestinian state in much of the West Bank with a shared capital in Jerusalem numerous times.\n\nThose offers were made at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, and more offers were made in 2008 and reportedly in 2014. In each of these cases, the PA refused generous Israeli offers of statehood and bolted negotiations without counteroffers. Many times, the PA launched campaigns of terrorism following the Israeli offers. The PA has since refused to return to the bargaining table, and has already rejected the Trump administration\u2019s forthcoming Mideast peace plan before it is even made public.\n\nIsraeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin slammed Airbnb\u2019s move as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d as well as \u201cdisgraceful and miserable.\u201d Levin called for his office to \u201cformulate immediate measures to limit the company\u2019s activity throughout the country,\u201d and to develop a plan to further promote West Bank tourism.\n\nStrategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said he will investigate whether the decision violates local U.S. laws against boycotting Israel. He also called on Airbnb to explain why it singled out the Jewish state: \u201cNational conflicts exist all over the world.

This isn\u2019t new from the Pakistani prime minister. He did the same this year when he briefly appointed a world-renowned Princeton professor as an economic adviser only to bow to protests days later because the scholar happened to be an Ahmadi Muslim. The Ahmadiyya is a minority sect of Islam Pakistan\u2019s Islamists viciously oppose.\n\nIn what can only be described as a devil\u2019s bargain, the Pakistani government has now agreed to step aside and allow the extremists to put Bibi on a \u201cflight risk\u201d list to prevent her from leaving the country and to file an absurd appeal against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe government\u2019s kowtowing to religious fanatics does not bode well for Bibi who, after spending over nine years in jail, seems closer to death than ever \u2014 either by a court\u2019s reinstitution of her death sentence or an extrajudicial execution by a mob.\n\nIf you think I am an alarmist and the situation isn\u2019t so dire, I beg you to consider this: Salman Taseer, former governor of Punjab, was murdered by his own bodyguard in 2011 because he was against the blasphemy laws and suggested filing a mercy petition for Bibi. Saiful Malook, Bibi\u2019s attorney, was forced to flee to the Netherlands after receiving death threats. And the judges who ordered her acquittal have been similarly threatened.\n\nWere extremists to get near Bibi, her husband Ashiq Masih, and her children, we would be reading the news of their horrendous murders the next day. In places like Pakistan, religious minorities \u2014 whether Christians, Hindus, Baha\u2019is, or Ahmadis \u2014 not only suffer from a lack of religious freedom; they suffer from a lack of any basic rights.\n\nSo far, a few European countries, chiefly Italy among them, have hinted at extending an asylum offer to Bibi, if she can manage to get out of Pakistan. Canada also has reportedly raised the issue with the Pakistani government.\n\nBesides government-level discussions to save Bibi, there have been some grassroots efforts to urge countries to action, including by three prominent British imams who wrote a letter to England\u2019s home secretary asking him to offer sanctuary to Bibi. Scottish church leaders also have asked their home secretary to bring her to Scotland.\n\nAll of these are encouraging signs of a possible peaceful resolution to Bibi\u2019s fate, but it is America everyone is waiting to hear from.\n\nSimply by telling Pakistan the United States will not tolerate this miscarriage of justice, President Donald Trump will do more for Asia Bibi\u2019s release than probably everybody else\u2019s efforts combined. This is because the United States has the political gravitas as an ally to let Pakistan know there will be a hefty price to pay if they allow Bibi to be murdered.\n\nFew Western nations \u2014 which tend to be encumbered by political correctness and a misguided obsession with the separation of church and state \u2014 are bold enough to take a stand for persecuted Christians, despite the fact Christians are the most widely persecuted religious group in the world. Even the U.K. has hesitated at offering asylum to Bibi, after being urged by the Foreign Office to refrain from doing so due to fear for the safety of its consular staff in Islamabad.\n\nPresident Trump has shown before the fortitude to act when it comes to issues of international religious freedom, as was the case with Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned in Turkey. Of course, Brunson is an American citizen, but the president went to lengths previous presidents would doubtfully have gone to ensure his release.\n\nMoreover, his administration has made religious freedom a priority like no other administration before. The State Department recently hosted the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, which culminated with the Potomac Declaration and Plan of Action, two documents that call for committed action to protect people from religious persecution.\n\nThankfully, Bibi\u2019s plight has not gone unnoticed in Congress. In a recent interview, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said he spoke to the president and asked him to offer her asylum. The senator also introduced a bipartisan bill last year to prod the Pakistani government to release Bibi from jail.\n\n\u201cIf ever there was a call for a refugee to be admitted into our country, I think this is one,\u201d Sen. Paul said.\n\nHopefully, Sen. Paul\u2019s efforts will encourage more lawmakers to speak up and spur the White House to intervene on behalf of Bibi.\n\nAmericans might not always be aware of it, but when it comes to religious freedom, the U.S. holds a unique significance for Christians and other religious minorities across the world.\n\nEvery faith has a home where it can find protection and support. For Muslims, it is Saudi Arabia or Iran; for Hindus, it is India; for Buddhists, it is Southeast Asia; and for Jews it is Israel. But where do the world\u2019s Christians go to in time of need?\n\nAsia Bibi is looking to the place where she knows persecuted Christians can find succor. Will America respond?\n\nMost Rev. Joseph D\u2019Souza is an internationally renowned human and civil rights activist. He is the founder of Dignity Freedom Network, an organization that advocates for and delivers humanitarian aid to the marginalized and outcast of South Asia.

Reynolds specifically pointed out how President Teddy Roosevelt broke up big businesses when he was president.\n\nRoosevelt built a strong reputation by going after the trusts, huge combinations that placed control of entire industries in the hands of one or a few men. He broke up John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil, the Google of its day. He shut down J.P. Morgan\u2019s Northern Securities Co., which would have monopolized rail transportation in much of the United States. And he pursued numerous other cases (45 in all) that broke up monopolies and returned competition to markets.\n\nReynolds goes on to argue that monopolies are an economic threat due to their overwhelming influence on certain industries.\n\nBig monopolies aren\u2019t just an economic threat: They\u2019re a political threat. Because they\u2019re largely free of market constraints, they don\u2019t have to put all their energy into making a better product for less money. Instead, they put a lot of their energy into political manipulation to protect their monopoly.\n\nMonopolies of the 21st century are even more powerful than those in previous generations. Why? Because modern monopolies, especially those in the social media space, wield tremendous political power as a result of their ability to control mass communications.\n\nAnd these new tech monsters have a one-two punch that Standard Oil lacked: Not only do they control immense wealth and important industries, but their fields of operation \u2014 which give them enormous control over communications, including communications about politics \u2014 also give them direct political power that in many ways exceeds that of previous monopolies.\n\nYou can read all of Reynolds\u2019 column here."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Awr Hawkins", "title": "Board of Health: Gun Stores Must Post Warning Signs for Firearm Risks", "description": "The King County Board of Health is requiring gun stores and shooting ranges to post warning signs regarding risks associated with firearms.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/19/board-health-gun-stores-ranges-post-warning-signs-firearm-risks/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/ar-15-gun-shop-utah-2-18-getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:05:19Z", "content": "On August 7, Breitbart News reported that the warning signs were proposed by King County Council Chair Joe McDermott (D).

The number now surpasses that arrested former Venezuelan dictators Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez.\n\nAs part of their effort to guarantee loyalty, the regime recently began purging high-rankings members of the military who they suspect of disloyalty. In March, Maduro issued a presidential decree announcing that 24 soldiers had been demoted or dismissed from the military over their supposed attempts \u201cto damage the Republic by violent means.\u201d\n\nSome of the individuals dismissed from their military positions included the exiled General Antonio Rivero of the Voluntad Popular party, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s former defense minister and imprisoned government critic General Ra\u00fal Isa\u00edas Badue, and Captain Juan Caguaripano, who last year stormed a barracks and called on the military to overthrow the regime.\n\nYet there is growing evidence of widespread discontent among lower military ranks, as thousands of soldiers choose to jump ship amid devastatingly low morale caused in large part by a drastic fall in wages that has left many of them unable to access enough food or living essentials.\n\nThere have also been various rebellions designed to overthrow the regime, including an alleged assassination attempt against Maduro himself, although none have had any measurable success. Tensions reached a head back in January, following the assassination of the rebel militia leader \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez, himself a former police officer.\n\nThe higher echelons of the Venezuelan military remain relatively loyal to the government, as the regime continues to subsidize their expensive lifestyles and appoint military leaders to powerful government positions. Last month, leading regime official Diosdado Cabello claimed that the country\u2019s armed forces would remain loyal to them should the U.S. or any other country try to topple the regime and were now \u201cfully prepared\u201d to go into combat.\n\n\u201cThe United States offers our military amnesty.

Some of the tropical reefs in the region now boast complete artificial islands equipped with advanced Chinese military equipment. Beijing insists that its development of the islands is legal and for civilian purposes despite a 2016 international law ruling finding China has no sovereignty over the region.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported Monday that state propaganda outlets had posted images of the tourist brigade landing on Yagong and raising the red Chinese flag. The group sang the national anthem, \u201cThe March of the Volunteers,\u201d and chanted pro-Beijing slogans as they raised the flag, according to the report.\n\nThe Post translated some of the remarks quoted in Chinese media from the participants.\n\n\u201cFinally my dream was fulfilled, and I feel very proud to be standing here looking at the Chinese flag,\u201d one tourist, identified as Deng Runping, said. \u201cHere I feel that we look very dignified and solemn, because it is the motherland\u2019s most southern point.\u201d\n\nWhile Vietnam and Taiwan dispute various parts of the South China Sea, Vietnam only claims Yagong Island. The Vietnamese government claims it falls within the exclusive territory of Vietnam, though the country has not had control of the island since 1974, when the Chinese sent the People\u2019s Liberation Army to invade and colonize it. The beleaguered Vietnamese government did not have the ability at the time to withstand the Chinese onslaught and, still dwarfed in military might by China, only gingerly challenges China\u2019s claims to its territory.\n\nThe largest Chinese artificial islands in the South China Sea are in the Spratly and Paracel Islands. Vietnam lays claim to some of both, while the Philippines claims much of the Spratly Islands. China also claims territory belonging to Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia elsewhere in the South China Sea, but has not so aggressively imposed its will there.\n\nThe tourist invasion of Yagong is part of a larger, years-long effort to convince Chinese tourists to swarm the disputed territories of the South China Sea, making an active effort to maintain a Han Chinese presence in the region. China\u2019s local administrators began campaigning to attract more tourists in 2016 as efforts to illegally construct artificial islands there escalated. That year, the New York Times noted, Paracel Island Mayor Xiao Jie told China Daily that the chain would begin introducing a greater selection of tropical cruises and wedding packages to attract mainland Han Chinese.\n\n\u201cWe will develop some islands and reefs to accommodate a select number of tourists,\u201d Xiao announced. Among the islands named as targets of the new cruise itineraries was Yagong Island.\n\nA year later, China announced a new initiative to attract more cruise trips to the Paracel Islands through Hainan, its largest tropical resort. According to Quartz, \u201cthe trips include a stirring flag-raising ceremony on one of the Paracel islands and a documentary about how China bravely won full control of the chain from Vietnam in the mid-1970s.\u201d\n\nVietnam has attempted to fortify its territory by expanding its diplomatic reach, hosting joint military exercises with the Philippines, allowing a U.S. warship to visit Vietnamese territory and generally welcoming closer ties to Washington, and reaching out to India for closer diplomatic cooperation. India shares a border with China where Chinese troops have illegally attempted to usurp territory, as well.\n\nIndividual Vietnamese people have also organized widespread protests against China, demanding that Chinese soldiers leave Vietnamese waters and stop harassing Vietnamese fishermen. Along with them, Philippine protesters have undertaken similar voyages to the region as the one by the Chinese this weekend, raising the Philippine flag over the Spratly Islands. The Vietnamese government has been more receptive to the protesters than the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte repeatedly rejects the idea of confronting China.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Hayward", "title": "Rouhani: Iran Will Continue Exporting Oil, America's 'Psychological War' Will Fail", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani gave a nationally televised speech on Monday in which he vowed to continue oil exports in defiance of U.S. sanctions and condemned America\u2019s \u201cpsychological war\u201d against his regime.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/19/rouhani-iran-will-continue-exporting-oil-americas-psychological-war-will-fail/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/afp/24/bffeb9_iranian-president-hassan-rouhani-saudi-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-heinous-e1540422530406.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:12:56Z", "content": "Reuters provided a few choice excerpts from Rouhanis fiery speech: \u201cWe will not yield to this pressure, which is part of the psychological war launched against Iran,\u201d Rouhani said in a speech in the city of Khoy, broadcast live on state television. \u201cThey have\u2026 [+3714 chars]", "fulltext": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani gave a nationally televised speech on Monday in which he vowed to continue oil exports in defiance of U.S. sanctions and condemned America\u2019s \u201cpsychological war\u201d against his regime.\n\nReuters provided a few choice excerpts from Rouhani\u2019s fiery speech:\n\n\u201cWe will not yield to this pressure, which is part of the psychological war launched against Iran,\u201d Rouhani said in a speech in the city of Khoy, broadcast live on state television. \u201cThey have failed to stop our oil exports.

Iran is supported by many countries. Except for the Zionist regime (Israel) and some countries in the region, no other country backs America\u2019s pressure on Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nContrary to Rouhani\u2019s assertions, the new round of sanctions is having far more than a \u201cpsychological\u201d effect on Iran. Reuters on Monday found \u201chundreds of companies have suspended production and thousands of workers are being laid off because of a hostile business climate mainly caused by new U.S. sanctions.\u201d Many of the businessmen interviewed said there only months or weeks away from laying off more employees or shuttering their enterprises entirely.\n\n\u201cFour days before parliament fired him August for failing to do enough to protect the jobs market from sanctions, labor minister Ali Rabiei said Iran would lose a million jobs by the end of year as a direct result of the U.S. measures,\u201d Reuters recalled.\n\nIranian business owners blamed poor decisions by their own government and the financial sector, in addition to U.S. sanctions, for the job losses. They also spoke of money and optimism surging into their economy after the nuclear deal negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama lifted longstanding sanctions against Iran, only to see the optimism drain as Tehran spent the nation\u2019s newfound wealth on foreign adventures and imposed confusing monetary policies that kneecapped the Iranian recovery.\n\nThe Trump administration sanctions dealt a powerful blow to an already weak economy and it will soon dawn on Iran\u2019s business class that their government has no reason to make things easier on them. On the contrary, the regime will want to maximize suffering for the Iranian middle and lower classes so it can complain about the humanitarian horrors of harsh sanctions, once Rouhani is finished pretending the U.S. measures are no more than a trifling inconvenience.\n\nE.U. anger at Iranian plots to murder dissidents in Paris and Denmark have jeopardized Iran\u2019s hopes for a European bailout, as the E.U. imposed sanctions against several Iranian conspirators with more to come.\n\n\u201cThough largely symbolic, the E.U.\u2019s readiness to target Iranians marks a shift after months of division within the bloc over how to punish Iranians accused of destabilizing activities in Europe and the Middle East,\u201d Reuters noted on Monday.\n\nIronically, Iran\u2019s best hope for relief from sanctions pressure may lie with its archrival Saudi Arabia. The Saudis sent mixed signals about oil production over the past few months, at first promising to easily compensate for the loss of Iranian exports \u2013 with a little help from the cheerfully opportunistic Russians \u2013 but then talking about production cuts and warning of oversupply in 2019.\n\nMarket analysts say the Saudis now believe President Donald Trump essentially tricked them into overcompensating for lost Iranian oil, and they are disappointed by Trump\u2019s waivers to eight of Iran\u2019s biggest oil customers. The global economic slowdown produced by the U.S.-China trade war is keeping oil demand down, while the growing strength of American producers increased supply.

This is legislation that would affect people who are involved with drugs, which we have seen across our country as such a major scourage at this time. I really think people\u2019s thinking has evolved on drugs. No one thinks they\u2019re good, but we recognize that just locking people up is not solving the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more opportunities for recovery. We need more opportunities for rehabilitation. We need to give people, frankly, a second chance in a lot of these situations,\u201d Paul explained.\n\n\u201cThis legislation, not only has some sensing reform but it also does speak to people who are incarcerated, giving them opportunities, frankly, for hope,\u201d Paul stated. \u201cOne of the most poignant aspects of it, to me, is that we have so many people that are incarcerated multi-days drive away from their families and if you are behind bars and you\u2019re serving time, who are the people that would support you and give you hope to make right changes in your life?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has devastating consequences on the children, especially of incarcerated mothers. So this bill has a requirement that they would put someone in a federal prison no more than 500 driving miles away from their family, which, to me, I think my goodness, the bare minimum. 500 miles is still a very long way.\u201d\n\nThis bill, according to Paul, gives people an \u201copportunity to earn some good time back while they\u2019re in prison by taking part in job training, taking part in anger management \u2013 if they\u2019ve had issues with that, mental health concerns, and drug and alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nIn closing, Paul argued that it is in everyone\u2019s interest to support this legislation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can ever lose sight of the fact that 95 percent of the people in our prisons will one day be released and they will be rejoining society.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruled for the Philippines and declared China\u2019s invasion of the territory illegal in 2016. China responded by vowing to ignore the ruling and continuing to expand its reach in the region.\n\nIn his piece, published in several Philippine newspapers Monday, Xi declares that, thanks to President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s refusal to confront China on its illegal development, their \u201crelations have now seen a rainbow after the rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to properly handle differences through friendly consultations, enhance dialogue and cooperation on maritime issues, and make the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship, and cooperation that truly benefits our two peoples,\u201d Xi writes, announcing that China has become Manila\u2019s largest trading partner and expects the Philippines to participate actively in One Belt, One Road (OBOR), or the Belt and Road Initiative, the Communist Party\u2019s plan to control all major global infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines, with its unique geographical advantage, is a natural partner in the Belt and Road Initiative. China wishes to work with the Philippines to renew the legacy of the ancient maritime Silk Road,\u201d Xi writes. \u201cTrade liberalization and economic globalization is an unstoppable trend of our times. As a major responsible country committed to win-win cooperation and greater openness, China stands ready to share with all countries the opportunities and potential of its market.\u201d\n\nXi also takes the time to argue that China is not a belligerent entity in the region despite its consistent attempts to block Philippines vessels from their sovereign territory. Instead, Xi argues that China has long fallen victim to Western hostility.\n\n\u201cSeveral centuries ago, China\u2019s GDP already accounted for 30 percent of the global total, yet it never engaged in aggression or expansion,\u201d Xi claims, adding:\n\nIn the over 100 years after the Opium War in 1840, China suffered immensely from repeated aggression, wars and turmoil. \u2026 China will remain committed to the path of peaceful development and will always stay as an anchor of peace and stability for the Asia-Pacific and the wider world.\n\nXi is expected in the Philippines on Tuesday after visits to Papua New Guinea and Brunei.\n\nThe 2016 ruling that legally banned China from colonizing the Spratly Islands occurred during the administration of the more U.S.-friendly former President Benigno Aquino. Following Duterte\u2019s victory, however, the Philippines have done nothing to enforce the decree. On the contrary, Duterte has repeatedly argued that the Philippine military is too weak to go to war with China, and he has no interest in challenging Beijing.\n\nDuring this weekend\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Papua New Guinea, Duterte discouraged Washington\u2019s policy of standing up for Philippine sovereignty in the region.\n\n\u201cAnd in all of these things, China is there. That\u2019s a reality and America and everybody should realize that they are there,\u201d Duterte said. \u201cSo if you just keep on creating friction, little friction, one day a bad miscalculation could turn things\u2026 Murphy\u2019s Law \u2013 if anything can go wrong, it will go wrong.\u201d\n\nDuterte added that he did \u201cnot mind everybody going to war, except that the Philippines is just beside those islands. And if there\u2019s a shooting there, [his] country will be the first to suffer.\u201d\n\nDuterte has been otherwise largely absent in both the APEC summit and other international events in the region this week, scheduled in a cluster to take advantage of having a large number of world leaders in one place. Duterte skipped several events at last week\u2019s Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit to take \u201cpower naps,\u201d according to a presidential spokesman.\n\nDuterte\u2019s friendly behavior towards China has netted him significant criticism within his country. A national poll published in July found that as much as 70 percent of the country wanted Duterte to challenge China directly on South China Sea claims. Articulating their concerns in a piece on Sunday, Philippine Star columnist Federico D. Pascual Jr. wrote:\n\nPresident Duterte could have served national interest just by staying in bed \u2013 for \u201cpower naps\u201d or whatever \u2013 and not saying a word about Chinese expansionism while he was in Singapore last week for the 33rd summit meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. As China continued to occupy and militarize these artificial islets in the Philippine EEZ [exclusive economic zone], not a whimper of protest was heard from Duterte. He had just pivoted to the left toward Beijing apparently hoping to secure the massive investments, loans and aid dangled before him.\n\nWhile Duterte refused to challenge Xi, representatives of the U.S. government, including National Security Adviser John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence, vocally opposed giving China the power to impose a code of conduct on other nations in the international waters of the South China Sea.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Bob Price", "title": "Child Rapist, Gang Members Arrested by Texas Border Patrol Agents", "description": "Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector arrested three Central Americans who are known members of violent gangs.

To qualify, a production needs to spend at least $500,000 in the state and the company can receive up to a 30 percent tax credit. The Governor\u2019s office said there was $2.7 billion in direct spending in the state from these productions, which ranged from \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and \u201cOzark\u201d to \u201cTag\u201d and \u201cMile 22,\u201d which came out this past weekend. That is about the same amount as the previous year, when some big-budget extravaganzas such as \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d were in production. Overall, it\u2019s ten-fold increase from 2008 before the tax credits were sweetened.\n\nAbrams campaign officials argued Kemp, who served as George\u2019s Secretary of State, engaged in \u201cgross management\u201d of the election, announcing last week they would file a federal lawsuit against the Republican.

Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s new approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook, driving several key executives from the company, according to people familiar with the matter.

One employee at the session asked if Facebook could deter leaks by publishing an internal report about how frequently offenders are found and fired. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook does fire leakers, but the root cause was \u201cbad morale\u201d perpetuated by attacks in the media.\n\nEven some of Zuckerberg\u2019s top advisors have reportedly not been safe from his criticism, with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg even worrying for her job in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal earlier this year.\n\nThis spring, Mr. Zuckerberg told Ms. Sandberg, 49, that he blamed her and her teams for the public fallout over Cambridge Analytica, the research firm that inappropriately accessed private data on Facebook users and used it for political research, according to people familiar with the exchange. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told friends she wondered whether her job might be at risk from the fallout to the Cambridge Analytical scandal. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Ms. Sandberg later confided in friends that the exchange rattled her, and she wondered if she should be worried about her job.\n\nIt would seem that Facebook\u2019s internal company dynamic has been shaken up over the course of the last year due to a number of scandals, whether Zuckerberg will manage to stay true to his promise to \u201cfix Facebook\u201d over the next year or whether we will see an even bigger restructuring of Facebook\u2019s executives in the near future remains to be seen."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Sean Moran", "title": "Exclusive\u2014Rep.

On Thursday night, he reportedly burst into their room after crossing paths with the young boy at a vending machine on the premises. Authorities say he offered to pay the parents $300 to have sex with their son.\n\nKVUE reported the father said he gave the 10-year-old permission to go to the vending machine, which was located two floors down from their room. There, the child reportedly encountered Palmer. The suspect allegedly tried to give the boy money to show he liked him. The youngster frantically ran back to the family\u2019s hotel room, saying: \u201cDaddy, daddy, that man\u2019s trying to get me.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Palmer came to the family\u2019s room, pulled out his wallet and offered the couple money in exchange for sex with the son. The parents refused. Palmer left. Then, the father went downstairs and asked the front desk clerk to alert local law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, Palmer returned to the family\u2019s room and knocked on the door, according to the court documents obtained by KVUE. The mother, who remained in the room with the children, opened the door, thinking it was her husband. When she saw Palmer, she claimed she told him to leave but he said no, insisting he wanted her son for sex. The woman allegedly closed the door in his face and called police from the room.\n\nHowever, Palmer reportedly banged on the door and a window. The mother said she feared he would break the glass, get into the room, and take her children. To try to stop the suspect, she opened the door. Palmer forced his way inside. Later, the woman told officers she pushed him out and \u201cslammed the door shut and got some scissors to try to protect herself and her children.\u201d\n\nAustin police said when they arrived they found the purported sexual predator inside of the family\u2019s motel room with the parents and the children. Officers asked Palmer why he was in their hotel room. Allegedly, he replied: \u201cI was trying to [expletive] him, and they won\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\nPalmer told detectives he thought the boy was five or six years old when he approached him at the vending machine. The suspect admitted he tried to pay the couple $300 to have sex with their son, according to KXAN. Palmer confessed he was under the influence of marijuana, THC oil from a vape pen, and alcohol at the time of the incident.\n\nIt turned out the hotel manager previously called police after Palmer purportedly tried to kiss women working in the lobby.\n\nOfficers arrested Palmer on Friday and charged him with one felony count of burglary of a residence with the intent to commit aggravated sexual assault of a child, according to Travis County jail records. Authorities set Palmer\u2019s bail at $100,000.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Palmer remained in custody at the Travis County Correctional Complex.\n\nFollow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Hayward", "title": "Hayward: APEC Summit an Unexpected Disaster for China", "description": "The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) concluded on Sunday without issuing a joint statement for the first time in the organization\u2019s 25-year history.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/11/19/hayward-apec-summit-an-unexpected-disaster-for-china/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/18/dc14f7_chinese-president-xi-jinping-erecting-trade-barriers-was-short-sighted-e1542636542512.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:23:28Z", "content": "China reportedly objected to portions of the draft statement, particularly a line condemning unfair trade practices.

AFP also reported on the misbehavior of Chinese officials on Sunday and said police officers were stationed outside the foreign minister\u2019s office to prevent further unpleasant encounters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for the minister to negotiate solo with the Chinese. The Chinese negotiating officials know this,\u201d an unnamed source told AFP.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported numerous APEC members \u201clined up against Beijing\u201d during the meeting. The O\u2019Neill administration in Papua New Guinea is actually pro-China, but opposition leaders said \u201cthe biggest issue to come out of APEC\u201d this year was the lack of transparency in China\u2019s business dealings, a point stressed by the United States.\n\nThe Journal related clashing statements between Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence:\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Xi clashed with the U.S. over trade and security, calling on officials to \u201creject arrogance and prejudice,\u201d as Beijing and Washington vie for global influence. Speaking to reporters before leaving Papua New Guinea, Vice President Mike Pence, traveling in Asia over the past week, said he twice spoke privately\u2014briefly and candidly\u2014to Mr. Xi during the APEC summit. \u201cI reiterated that they need to open up their markets,\u201d said Mr. Pence, who has repeatedly warned of \u201caggression\u201d and \u201cempire\u201d in the region\u2014an implicit reference to China\u2019s behavior. He added that \u201cPresident Trump believes that a [trade] deal is possible but we also believe we\u2019re in a very strong position.\u201d On Thursday, in Singapore, Mr. Pence had a candid private exchange with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Walking back to their seats after a summit photo, Mr. Li told the vice president that China was still \u201ca developing country,\u201d another U.S. administration official said. Mr. Pence, pointing to China\u2019s trade practices, told Mr. Li: \u201cThings have to change.\u201d\n\nThe APEC meeting was a battlefield cratered by verbal artillery exchanges between the Chinese and U.S. delegations, with Xi complaining about \u201cunilateralism\u201d and \u201cprotectionism\u201d and Pence vowing to \u201chold nations accountable for their unfair economic practices.\u201d\n\nThe mood among APEC members is apparently turning sour on China and its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which finally has serious competition from the U.S.-Japan-Australia partnership.\n\nPence openly mocked Belt and Road and its infamous un-repayable loans, as reported by CNN, prompting a peevish response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry:\n\n\u201cThe terms of those loans are often opaque at best. Projects they support are often unsustainable and of poor quality. Too often, they come with strings attached and lead to staggering debt \u2026 The United States deals openly, fairly. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road,\u201d he said, mocking China\u2019s One Belt, One Road initiative. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry lashed out at Pence for his remarks. \u201cOur advice for the relevant country is that instead of pointing fingers at others, it would be better to match its deeds with its words and truly treat all countries, big or small, as equals,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. \u201cNot a single developing country has been mired in debt difficulties because of its cooperation with China. On the contrary, their cooperation with China has helped them enhance their capacity for self-driven development and improved their people\u2019s livelihood,\u201d Hua said about Pence\u2019s allegations on loans.\n\nThere were signs of growing unease among APEC members concerning China\u2019s military buildup in the South China Sea. China\u2019s assurances that it merely wishes to cleanse the area of pirates have given way to blatant territorial demands and ominous threats to the freedom of navigation, a menacing atmosphere that belies China\u2019s constant praise for \u201cfree trade.\u201d\n\nCNN, which ran several articles over the weekend declaring APEC a surprising disappointment for China, found APEC members unhappy with China\u2019s use of \u201csharp power\u201d \u2013 Beijing\u2019s unique tactic of using economic muscle to force foreign companies to comply with the Communist Party\u2019s agenda, a brand of compulsion halfway between the \u201chard power\u201d of military might and the \u201csoft power\u201d of diplomacy.\n\nReuters added that China scored an \u201cown goal\u201d against itself by banning all but a few handpicked, mostly Chinese media outlets from covering Xi\u2019s meeting with Pacific Island leaders ahead of the APEC summit. Dozens of international journalists invited to the forum by Papua New Guinea were turned away at the door by the Chinese, including reporters from Papua New Guinea itself.\n\nJonathan Pryke of Australia\u2019s Lowy Institute said the heavy-handed move sent a \u201cterrible signal\u201d that China is \u201ctrying to buy influence but not build influence.\u201d One reporter from Papua New Guinea simply called it \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey begin with trade practices, with tariffs and quotas, forced technology transfers, the theft of intellectual property. It goes beyond that to freedom of navigation in the seas, concerns about human rights,\u201d Vice President Pence said of the Chinese agenda as he departed Papua New Guinea. Angry reporters turned away from a PNG conference facility that was essentially annexed by China might be inclined to agree with his assessment."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Pam Key", "title": "Whoopi Goldberg: Trump Needs to \u2018Shut Up,\u2019 He Doesn\u2019t \u2018Give a Damn About the People in California\u2019", "description": "Monday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d co-host Whoopi Goldberg criticized President Donald Trump for his comments about the California wildfires.

The rate of rape and sexual assault for non-students is actually 1.2 times higher than for students \u2013 7.6 per 1,000.\n\n\u201cWhere did the CDC find more than a million and nearly 14 million victims of sexual violence that professional criminologists somehow overlooked?\u201d Sommers asked in the video. \u201cIt found them by using a poorly constructed telephone survey with a low response rate and a non-representative sample of respondents. No one interviewed was asked if they had been raped or sexually assaulted.\u201d\n\nArmed with the false \u201c1 in 5\u201d statistic, however, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement its policy.\n\nThe Obama administration also instructed colleges and universities to use the lesser \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard to resolve allegations of sexual misconduct, rather than the higher \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard.\n\nTo promote its policy, the Obama-era education department engaged the media with the CDC report\u2019s statistic and even the former president himself repeated it in his speeches.\n\nThe Obama policy delivered \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d on college campuses in which mostly male students were accused of sexual misconduct with little information about the allegations against them and no recourse to defend themselves.\n\nDavid French at National Review wrote the new Trump administration rules will not only \u201crestore basic due process and fairness to college tribunals, but they also \u2014 given how basic the changes are \u2014 highlight just how ridiculous university kangaroo courts have become.\u201d He added:\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWait.

Allen is a political conservative, which would make Kaepernick and his habit of protesting during the national anthem something that Allen wouldn\u2019t be inclined to embrace, ever. So even though Washington quarterbacks coach Kevin O\u2019Connell served on the last coaching staff in San Francisco that had Kaepernick on the roster, Kaepernick won\u2019t be on the Washington roster, barring a dramatic change of heart by Allen \u2014 or a direct order from owner Daniel Snyder that having someone who possibly could help push a 6-4 start toward a finish atop the division outweighs all non-football considerations.\n\nBruce Allen is the brother of well-known conservative and former Virginia Senator George Allen. So it would certainly come as no surprise if Allen is indeed a \u201cpolitical conservative,\u201d as PFT\u2019s source says. However, the Redskins decision to not invite Kaepernick for a tryout can\u2019t be boiled down to mere political concerns.\n\nAfter all, when San Francisco\u2019s Jimmy Garoppolo tore his ACL earlier this year, the 49ers didn\u2019t call Kaepernick either. An important point considering the 49ers organization has come out in support of Kaepernick and it would have been a wildly popular move in the politically liberal Bay Area.\n\nKaepernick has also had offers or interest from two other left-leaning teams \u2014 the Ravens and Seahawks \u2014 and was not been able to reach an agreement. So clearly, this decision doesn\u2019t boil down to politics from Kaepernick\u2019s standpoint either.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the American sports media, Kaepernick\u2019s employment status is indeed a mere political exercise.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Joshua Caplan", "title": "CNN Requests Emergency Hearing After Trump Warns Acosta\u2019s Press Pass in Jeopardy Again", "description": "CNN host Brian Stelter reports that the White House may once again revoke White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press credential after a judge ruled to reinstate the \"hard pass\" last week.

Circuit Court case, Sherrill v. H. Knight, said the White House did not provide Acosta \u201cdue process\u201d in revoking the pass. Kelly, a Trump appointee, made clear that the ruling was not based on whether the White House violated Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights. Rather, CNN and the White House correspondent demonstrated a likelihood of success in arguing that their Fifth Amendment rights to due process were breached, the judge said. Further, the judge stated the fact that CNN has other pass holders does not reduce the level of \u201charm\u201d towards the network\u2019s White House correspondent. The judge also remarked on Acosta \u201claying hands\u201d on a White House intern, calling the characterization \u201clikely untrue\u201d and \u201cpartly based on evidence of questionable accuracy.\u201d Notably, Kelly, referring to his ruling as \u201cvery limited\u201d in nature, left the door open for the White House to revoke Acosta\u2019s credentials, granted due process is respected.\n\nReacting to the ruling, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced it would \u201ctemporarily\u201d reinstate the CNN reporter\u2019s credentials and said the administration would come up with new rules to better the decorum during the briefings.\n\n\u201cToday, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cIn response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass. We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.\u201d\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday, President Trump told Fox News host Chris Wallace that Kelly\u2019s ruling was not a \u201cbig deal\u201d and warned Acosta\u2019s pass would be revoked if he \u201cmisbehaves\u201d once more.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine, I mean it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d the president said. \u201cWhat they said, though, is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct etc. etc. We\u2019re doing that, were going to write them up right now.

But those who rightly believe the west is superior to authoritarian regimes must now contend with a troubling trend \u2014 the rise of the western dissident.\n\nChief among them is Julian Assange, who for a half-decade has been forced to live in the tiny Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has claimed political asylum since 2011. Assange claimed that he would be extradited to the U.S. to face charges over his work at WikiLeaks if he left the embassy, and was routinely mocked as paranoid for doing so.\n\nThis week, we learned that Assange was right and his critics were wrong. Thanks to a clerical error by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria, Virginia, reporters were able to confirm the existence of sealed criminal charges against the WikiLeaks founder.\n\nBecause the charges are sealed and the evidence is unknown, it\u2019s impossible to say if the case has merit. But it likely relates to WikiLeaks\u2019 release of unredacted diplomatic cables in 2011, which forced the U.S. to relocate several of its foreign sources.\n\nSome allegations are more serious. While he was alive, neoconservative Senator John McCain maintained that leaks provided to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning, which included the diplomatic cables, caused U.S sources to be murdered.\n\nThose who see Assange as a villain will end the story here. What is typically left out is that WikiLeaks originally released the diplomatic cables in piecemeal form, with names redacted to prevent loss of life and minimize harm.\n\nIt was only after a Guardian journalist\u2019s error led to the full unredacted cables leaking to third parties on the web that WikiLeaks published them as well \u2014 and not before Assange attempted to warn the office of Hillary Clinton, then U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nIn other words, WikiLeaks behaved precisely as any responsible publisher handling sensitive material should, redacting information that could cause harm. The redactions only stopped when they became pointless. Assange is unlikely to have won more than a dozen journalism awards if he were completely reckless in his publications.\n\nThe Pentagon later admitted under oath that they could not find any instances of individuals being killed as a result of being named in Manning\u2019s leaks to WikiLeaks, contradicting Sen. McCain\u2019s allegations.\n\nAt worst, Assange and WikiLeaks can be accused of negligence, not deliberate recklessness, in the way it handled sensitive material. But as Breitbart Tech reporter Lucas Nolan points out, a far stronger case can be made against Hillary Clinton for the way she handled State Department emails \u2014 yet we see no criminal charges against her.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that the only reason Assange is being targeted is that he tangled with the highest levels of the western establishment. In that, he is far from alone.\n\nIn the late 2000s to early 2010s, western governments targeted all manner of individuals associated with Assange and the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, including Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald\u2019s partner David Miranda, and The Guardian newspaper.\n\nThis was the early growth period of the internet, when the web had become a truly popular medium but had yet to be censored by pliant social media corporations. It was a time of profound unease at the power of the internet to undermine authority, both through the dissemination of information as in the case of WikiLeaks and Snowden, and in the new mobilization of political forces, as in the case of Occupy Wall Street and the SOPA/PIPA protests. Heavy-handed crackdowns against individuals and groups that were seen, rightly or wrongly, as symbols of the web\u2019s early anarchic tendencies, like Kim Dotcom, Aaron Swartz, Anonymous, and LulzSec, were not uncommon.\n\nThese days, however, a new class of western dissident has emerged \u2014 the populist dissident.\n\nPopulist Dissidents\n\nWho would have thought that the highest court in Europe, home of the enlightenment, would uphold a case in which a woman was prosecuted for blasphemy against Islam?\n\nWho would have thought that Britain, the birthplace of liberalism and the free press, would ban an independent journalist from its shores for satirizing the same religion?\n\nWho would have thought that Germany, whose living memory of the totalitarian Stasi is just three decades old, would put its largest opposition party under surveillance?\n\nJust a few years ago, all three would sound far-fetched. But cases like these have become common as elites in virtually every western country mount a panicked attempt to contain the rise of populism (the goal, in the words of a Google executive, is to render it a \u201chiccup\u201d in history\u2019s march towards progress).\n\nLook at the case of Tommy Robinson, the British critic of Islam who was dragged through Britain\u2019s courts on fuzzy contempt-of-court charges. Sentenced to an astonishing thirteen-month imprisonment, Robinson was eventually freed after a successful appeal and now awaits a final trial before Britain\u2019s Attorney General. Shaky charges that have been successfully appealed were exploited to persecute a British citizen who was inconvenient to the establishment. And there\u2019s still a further trial to come.\n\nThen again, Britain is a country that routinely bans foreign politicians and media figures from the country for being too right-wing. Michael Savage, Geert Wilders, Lauren Southern, Pamela Geller, and Robert Spencer all enjoy this dubious distinction. Theresa May, who was responsible for internal affairs and immigration when Spencer and Geller were banned, is now the Prime Minister.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Britain. Not only has Trump\u2019s White House, supposedly an ally of populists, failed to publicly intervene on behalf of the American citizens banned from the U.K. for expressing populist viewpoints, but it hasn\u2019t even investigated allegations that far-left Antifa activists were able to stop conservative Rebel Media personality Jack Buckby from entering the country by spreading false criminal allegations.\n\nJulian Assange, a left-libertarian may share little ideological ground with right-wing critics of Islam. But they all share at least one thing: persecution by western states coupled with anti-establishment political speech or activities. They are also targets of the security establishment \u2014 Assange because of leaks that have exposed their secrets, and the populists because they refuse to censor themselves to avoid angering Muslims. (The UK justified its attempted ban of Geert Wilders by arguing that his presence in the country could lead to \u201cinter-faith violence.\u201d)\n\nWe also see attacks on free speech, with governments and politicians across the west pressuring Silicon Valley to suppress its critics. An unaccountable, unelected elite can sweep away a person\u2019s livelihood in minutes, and cut their political message off from millions of American citizens. As I wrote in my column two weeks ago, the overarching trend is the gradual destruction or delegitimization of every tool, digital or otherwise, that non-elites use to express their preferences. Does that sound like a free society, or a controlled one?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with any of the individuals or groups listed above to see that surveilling political parties, blocking journalists from entering countries, jailing critics of religion, upholding blasphemy laws and censoring the net is the behavior of authoritarian nations, not liberal democracies. Yet this is the disturbing pattern we now see in the west.\n\nWorse, foreign authoritarian regimes now provide safe harbor for western dissidents, in the same way that the west does for foreign dissidents. Edward Snowden, accused of violating the U.S. Espionage Act of 1917 for blowing the whistle on the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance of Americans, has for years resided safely in Russia, a country that persecutes and even kills its own journalists. Before that, he sought refuge in Hong Kong, a \u201cSpecial Administrative Region\u201d of the People\u2019s Republic of China, an even more terrifyingly totalitarian state.\n\nWill there now be a quid pro quo, with Russia and other authoritarian regimes protecting our dissidents while the west protects theirs? Or will western countries remain true to their liberal traditions, and stop its alarming attempts to surveil, suppress, and persecute a growing number of its own citizens? On present trends, a dark and dystopian future seems to loom on the horizon.\n\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Not only did some schools deny cross-examination, but they also denied the accused access to the relevant evidence in his case, including exculpatory evidence?\u201d Yes, they did deny access to evidence. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for accused students to walk into hearings with only a cursory understanding of the charges against them and partial access to evidence, and then have to respond \u2014 on the fly \u2014 without access to any legal help.\n\nFrench continued the ACLU\u2019s response to the new rule created \u201ca disturbance in the legal Force, as if the voices of generations of ACLU civil libertarians cried out in anguish and were suddenly silenced by wokeness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe old-school ACLU knew there was no contradiction between defending due process and \u2018supporting survivors,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIndeed, it was through healthy processes that we not only determined whether a person had been victimized, but also prevented the accused from becoming a \u2018survivor\u2019 of a profound injustice.\u201d\n\nSoooo, in a world where \u2013 \"survivors\" = accusers \u2013 and you support survivors then, where does the whole Civil Liberties part come in? \u2014 joebrenner (@joeabrenner) November 16, 2018\n\nAnd just like that, you lose millions in donations from anyone who has a son in college.

He\u2019s a medical doctor, but he was a trauma combat surgeon in Iraq and he saw a similar incident [with] a person who had an entry wound but no exit wound, and he knew what kind of damage happened to that soldier and he knew the same thing had happened to me.

In a challenge to Parliament to back her plan, the PM said it was down to the House to back her deal \u201cin the national interest\u201d in the coming weeks.\n\nDespite the PM\u2019s promises that her deal would give Britain control of its borders, her speech was immediately criticised by pressure group Migration Watch, which said it totally failed to address public concern about the scale of immigration, calling it \u201chighly unsatisfactory\u201d.\n\nMay also talked up the Conservative record in government, praising the \u201cstriking economics success story\u2026 the jobs miracle\u201d and the state of public finances compared to the last Labour government, and said her new agreement for a services trade deal with the EU represented a significant liberalisation that goes \u201cwell beyond\u201d World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\n\nBut the support of the CBI for Theresa May\u2019s deal \u2014 illustrated in part as it was taken for granted in a leaked document written weeks before the content and form of May\u2019s deal was even known \u2014 is proof that the deal is a bad one, critics say. In a statement seen by Breitbart London Monday, UKIP leader Gerrard Batten said of the speech and the CBI\u2019s track record on the European Union:\n\n\u201cThe CBI endorsing the government\u2019s Brexit plan is the rotten cherry on top of the poisoned cake that Mrs May has served up to the British people.\n\n\u201cThe CBI campaigned for Britain to have price controls in the 1970s, join the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism] in the late 80\u2019s, dump the pound and adopt the euro in the 90\u2019s and backed the remain campaign in 2016. On every single major economic and political question facing the UK the CBI has been wrong \u2013 at this point, it has zero credibility.\n\n\u201cThe CBI represents the interests of large corporations who want to drive down wages by flooding the jobs market with mass uncontrolled immigration.

The EU has made it absolutely clear that they don\u2019t want us to be more competitive, so we can\u2019t improve our productivity and that means we can\u2019t improve our prosperity.\n\n\u201cSo can I ask you to think again about the economics of the whole thing rather than listening to the petitions of the CBI, which is really the confederation of European Industry.\u201d\n\nThe speaker\u2019s comments were met by groans from the conference hall, while the Prime Minister taking her turn to accuse the speaker of speaking innacurately was replied to with applause by the pro-EU business body\u2019s members.\n\nWhile her speech made no allusion to the difficulties the Prime Minister faces nor the looming leadership challenge that could come before the EU summit this coming weekend, the matter was raised in questions after. Responding to BBC politics editor Laura Kuennsberg when asked why it was her Brexit deal was so unpopular her own colleagues wouldn\u2019t back it, May said Brits shouldn\u2019t listen to their own elected representatives, but put their faith in business leaders who opposed the Brexit vote back in 2016 instead.\n\nOn taking your political direction from big business, the PM said: \u201cWhat I would say to your viewers and listeners is, don\u2019t just listen to the politicians. Listen to what business is saying \u2014 listen to what business that is providing your jobs, and proving that income that puts food on the table for your family is saying.\n\n\u201cBusiness is saying we want a good deal with the EU, and we want a good trading relationship with the European Union.\u201d\n\nOliver JJ Lane is the editor of Breitbart London \u2014 Follow him on Twitter and Facebook"}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "title": "Israeli Arab Teenager: It's 'A Privilege' to Serve in IDF", "description": "T., a 19-year-old from the Jerusalem area, where clashes with police is a regular occurence, decided four months ago in an unprecedented move to join the Border Police.

Congress gave the president a valuable tool in the event that an \u201cimminent mass influx of aliens\u201d arrived at a coastal or land border of the United States.\n\nIt was part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Clinton. Codified in federal law at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a)(10), the provision empowers the Secretary of Homeland Security to deal with a mass influx of aliens by authorizing state and local law enforcement officers to \u201cexercise any of the powers, privileges, or duties\u201d of ICE officers or Border Patrol officers.\n\nIn other words, hundreds of police officers can be mobilized rapidly to assist the border patrol in performing its duties.\n\nIt\u2019s an instant force multiplier to protect our nation\u2019s borders.\n\nThe time has come to put this tool to use. As the caravan members become frustrated with delays in obtaining asylum hearings and realize that, in any event, their chances of gaining asylum are miniscule, many will attempt to cross the border illegally. The U.S. military forces on the border are helpful in installing additional fencing, performing reconnaissance, and providing a visual deterrent; but they can\u2019t make immigration arrests.\n\nHowever, state and local police officers who are authorized under this law and provided appropriate training can.\n\nOne might argue that the liberal police departments in southern California are unlikely to want to assist the Border Patrol. That may be true. But the federal statute permits any state and local police officers to be deployed in the event of a mass influx, not just the ones at the site of the aliens\u2019 arrival. So if Texas Rangers want to help, they can.\n\nSame goes with sheriff\u2019s deputies from Kansas, or from Maine, for that matter. Any state or local law enforcement agency that wants to assist in protecting our borders in the event of a mass influx of aliens can do so, provided they are authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security and undertake the training the Secretary requires.\n\nOne of the most common expressions we hear about immigration is that \u201cour immigration laws are broken and need to be fixed.\u201d That\u2019s a cop out. In many respects, our immigration laws are perfectly fine; and they include useful tools to ensure that the law is fully enforced.\n\nBut it takes knowledge of what is in those laws and the will to enforce them, if we are serious about restoring the rule of law in immigration.\n\nKris W.

Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has already vowed, on two occasions, that her caucus will not support any border wall funding once they are in charge of the House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any of us [House Democrats] voting for wall funding,\u201d Pelosi said last month.\n\nWatch\u2013Nancy Pelosi: Democrats Will Trade \u2018Nothing\u2019 for Border Wallhttps://t.co/vGwf0cSJvl \u2014 John Binder \ud83d\udc7d (@JxhnBinder) October 18, 2018\n\nTrump has signaled that he may shut down the federal government before the new year unless he receives funding for his border wall, Breitbart News reported. The funding Trump is asking for, though, is only a fifth of what is needed to construct the wall.\n\n\u201cProbably if I was ever going to do a shutdown on border security, when you look at the caravans, when you look at the mess, when you look at the people coming in, this would be a very good time to do a shutdown,\u201d Trump said.\n\nShould illegal and legal immigration levels continue, the U.S. population will hit an unprecedented 404 million residents by 2060. The current legal immigration system would be responsible for importing 75 million new immigrants in the next four decades.\n\nEvery year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

That sent tremors throughout the globalist and leftist academic community. Almost immediately, the President of France felt called upon to explain why his country cousins in North America should be disturbed.\n\nWe were told that there was every reason to be dismayed\u2014that nationalism was \u201cthe very opposite\u201d of patriotism. While we all feel patriotic on occasion, we are told that we should never ever feel nationalistic. It is not obvious why that should be the case, but it is affirmed by the authority of the President of France. Now, it is not at all clear that the distinction offered is true, and if true, how it was intended to help. At this point we can only undertake reasoned speculation.\n\nFor most of us, the terms \u201cnationalism\u201d and \u201cpatriotism\u201d are sufficiently similar to qualify as synonyms in most dictionaries. There is some suggestion that the one is a sentiment and the other is the sentiment in act. In effect, it is generally understood that one expresses one\u2019s nationalism in patriotic acts. But the French President suggests something more than that. He suggests that each of these terms has an entirely different reference. Each refers to an entirely different something. One cannot be both a nationalist and a patriot\u2014for the President of France, they are mutually exclusive. One is the opposite of the other. The President of France apparently knows something we do not.\n\nThe fact is that in the recent political history of our time, there were some who made that very same distinction. Foremost among them was Josef Stalin. It is a story worth the telling.\n\nIt seems that the founders of classical Marxism, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, were convinced that nationalism was a transient sentiment that, at that time, teetered on the very brink of extinction. In the Communist Manifesto of 1848 we were told that the masses were no longer disposed to make recourse to nationalism\u2014their sentiments were all universalistic. They were all globalists. Among themselves, they no longer dwelt on differences of language, or culture, or history, or descent, or territorial origin. They recognized only class identity. The agents of history were proletarians, and their sentiments were universal working-class sentiments. In 1848, Marx already saw nationalism as an anachronism, as a sentiment that inspired only reaction.\n\nUnhappily, the proletariat, itself, was apparently not as intuitive as Marx\u2014and with the outbreak of the Great War of 1914-1918, threw itself into the conflict without reservation\u2014as waves of nationalist sentiment drove millions of young men to sacrifice and death on the battlefields.\n\nThe Marxists of the Second International, convinced that the proletariat had forsaken nationalism, had called on them to rise up against international conflict\u2014to refuse to fight their brother proletarians. In response, the proletariat everywhere opted to support their respective nation in the conflict\u2014and proceeded to fight their brother proletarians with unmitigated ferocity.\n\nRevolutionary Marxists were confounded. How were they to make a universalistic revolution when each national segment of the proletariat insisted on its own nationalism? Russia\u2019s Bolsheviks saw nationalism as an obstacle to the mass mobilization of revolutionaries. As Marxists, they conceived nationalism a reactionary sentiment\u2014dividing the working class into jealous enclaves against itself. They saw nationalism as a contrivance of the oppressing class, designed to frustrate the efforts at universal revolution. For revolutionaries, it seemed evident that simple membership in the working class was not enough to serve as a unifying inspiration.\n\nWhat the community organizers of Bolshevism ultimately settled on was an appeal to patriotism\u2014which came to mean disciplined obedience to the directives of the revolutionary Party. Since the Party came to control all of what had been Russia, obedience to the Party took on all the overt features of nationalist commitment. Ordinary Russians could feel loyalty to the territory, the language, the culture, and the history of Mother Russia\u2014and call it \u201cpatriotism.\u201d The Party could see in that expression of patriotism loyalty to the revolution, and to the Party. To Stalin\u2019s communists, patriotism was welcomed as the exact opposite of nationalism. While nationalism parsed the working class into separatist national segments, patriotism was made to unite the proletariat into seamless obedience to the Party.\n\nWith the passage of time, Stalin used patriotism to mobilize unqualified support for his dictatorship. He had accepted the reality of his circumstances and declared that Bolshevism no longer anticipated imminent universal revolution\u2014and in violation of every precept of classical Marxism chose to attempt the making of socialism \u201cin one country.\u201d\n\nSince Marx had precluded the employment of nationalism as a means to mobilize revolutionaries, Stalin enjoined the masses to be \u201cpatriotic.\u201d The masses were taught that they lived in a land that had given the world its most cherished cultural products. They learned that the land on which they dwelt should be defended with their lives. They learned that they were the future of the world\u2014and when the Motherland was invaded, they fought \u201cThe Great Patriotic War\u201d\u2014at the cost of more than twenty million lives. Nationalism never demanded more.\n\nDuring much of the Cold War, France was the site of one of the largest communist parties in the West\u2014and was noted as being particularly Stalinist in orientation\u2014until Stalin was exposed by his own followers as being a singularly homicidal despot. French enthusiasm cooled. But the echoes of the involvement remain, and the President of France apparently still recognizes the Stalinist distinction between nationalism and patriotism he learned at university from his leftist professors.\n\nIn their time, the major communist parties acknowledged that same distinction. Patriotism supported the Party. Nationalism did not. Patriotism was the \u201cdirect opposite\u201d of nationalism. Taking their lead from the Soviet Union, the communist parties of Maoist China and Pol Pot\u2019s Kampuchea insisted that their populations be not nationalistic, but \u201cpatriotic.\u201d Which meant that the masses be compliant, obedient, prepared to sacrifice, as well as defend the Party from all enemies in the geographic space it controlled\u2014with behaviors that looked all the world like those of devoted nationalists. Of course, some communists have rejected the entire charade, and like the fidelistas of Cuba, commit themselves to unabashed nationalism with cries like the \u201cFatherland (Patria) or Death!\u201d\n\nToday, there are few communists and former communists who respect the labored distinction between nationalism and patriotism offered us by the President of France. The distinction no longer serves any political purpose. The Chinese of Xi Jinping do not systematically keep up the pretense. Vladimir Putin is a frank nationalist. One finds nationalism everywhere, with patriotism its overt expression.\n\nThe President of France really has very little to teach Americans about nationalism or patriotism. We have among us thousands of young persons who were prepared to expose themselves to mortal danger on the battlefield in order to defend the flag and the values it represents. We do not need instruction from anyone about the true meaning of nationalism and its heroic expression in patriotism.\n\nProfessor A.
