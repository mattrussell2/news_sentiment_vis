The police saw no sign of that.\u201d\n\nThe article calls into question a singular claim made by Carlson to the Washington Post: that an Antifa activist cracked his front door by throwing his body against it.\n\nLast week, Carlson\u2019s wife was home alone when a D.C. Antifa group surrounded his home and terrorized his family. They shouted, \u201cTucker Carlson, we will fight. We know where you sleep at night!\u201d\n\nBrian Stelter has now, for some reason, decided to focus on one detail of Carlson\u2019s account of what happened in order to cast doubt on his story.\n\nStelter writes:\n\nLiberal critics of Carlson have cast doubt on that claim by saying there was no evidence of damage to the door. They have accused him of lying and exaggerating to score political points. So CNN contacted the D.C. police and asked about the door. The police report about the incident did not mention any damage on the door. Was there any sign that it was cracked, as Carlson claimed? A police spokeswoman responded, \u201cMPD did not observe any visible damage to the front door of the victim\u2019s house the night of the incident.\u201d\n\nThis paragraph is immediately followed up by this line: \u201cIt is still possible that the door was cracked.\u201d\n\nStelter contacted Carlson for a comment on the story, to which he responded, \u201cCNN has repeatedly defended Antifa, and you are doing it again now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour story is a disgusting attempt to minimize an attack on my family and bring more pain to my wife and four children. I\u2019m not playing along. I hope you\u2019re ashamed of yourself. You should be,\u201d Carlson also told CNN.\n\nStelter then wrote, \u201cFor the record, I said on last week\u2019s \u2018Reliable Sources\u2019 that \u2018it is absolutely inappropriate and unacceptable for protesters to show up at his own home to try to make him feel threatened where he lives.'\u201d\n\nTo his credit, Stelter has condemned the use of these harassment tactics on Carlson. But Carlson\u2019s condemnation of CNN is still well deserved. Zeroing in on one small detail to try to paint him as dishonest after his family was targeted for harassment is ridiculous.\n\nAnd, by Stelter\u2019s own admission, he doesn\u2019t even debunk Carlson\u2019s claim\u2013the door very well could have been cracked.\n\nThe Fox News host is also 100% right for calling out CNN\u2019s encouragement of Antifa.\n\nWhile Stelter himself hasn\u2019t made the kinds of equivocations that his fellow CNN employees have, the network\u2019s hosts and commentators have repeatedly whitewashed, made excuses for, and outright defended Antifa, despite the group\u2019s open calls for intimidation and violence.\n\nCNN host Chris Cuomo said in August that while violence is wrong, if you are doing it to fight \u201chate,\u201d you are \u201con the side of right.\u201d\n\nDon Lemon has also repeatedly defended the group. Lemon said in August, \u201cListen, no organization\u2019s perfect. There was some violence. No one condones violence, but there were different reasons for Antifa and for these neo-Nazis to be there. One, racists, fascists, the other group, fighting racist fascists. There is a distinction there.\u201d\n\nThe CNN host again defended the tactics of the Antifa group Smash Racism DC, the same group that targeted Carlson, in September."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Katherine Rodriguez, Katherine Rodriguez", "title": "Michelle Obama's Memoir Sells 725,000 Copies on First Day", "description": "Former first lady Michelle Obama's memoir, Becoming, sold 725,000 copies on its first day on the market, making it the biggest opening for a book in 2018 under publishing company Penguin Random House.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/17/michelle-obamas-memoir-sells-725000-copies-first-day/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Michelle-Obama-Becoming-memoir-book-signing-getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T20:27:56Z", "content": "The figures include preorder and first-day sales of hardcover, audio, and ebook editions of the memoir sold in the U.S. and Canada, the Associated Press reported.

After she was removed from her ESPN show, ratings for SportsCenter skyrocketed into positive territory for the first time in years.\n\nLater in her Late Show interview, Hill spoke of how sports and politics have always been intermingled and exclaimed that Tim Tebow never faced any backlash over his pro-life Super Bowl ad. Hill\u2019s assumption is hardly true. Pro-abortion activists excoriated Tebow for the ad. In fact, pro-abortion activists tried to get the CBS and the NFL to cancel the Tebow ad.\n\nHill also spoke about her new Showtime documentary, Shut Up And Dribble, by disingenuously acting as if she couldn\u2019t remember who inspired the name of the show.\n\nThe former TV host said the three-part series was inspired by \u201csome woman on Fox News.

So, way to give me another check!\u201d\n\nShe wrapped up her appearance saying that she thinks former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick will be \u201cremembered as a hero\u201d for his protests against the U.S.A. during the national anthem.\n\nBut Hill also added that the racist NFL \u2014 the organization that makes millionaires of more blacks than any in history \u2014 would never let Colin play again.\n\n\u201cHe stood for equality. If Colin Kaepernick had hit a woman, he\u2019d be back in the NFL already,\u201d Hill proclaimed. \u201cBut he\u2019s not back playing because of his stand on social justice, and it makes a lot of the ownership in the NFL uncomfortable and the fan base that watches \u2019em.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Katherine Rodriguez", "title": "Michael Avenatti Law Firm Evicted from CA Office for Skipping $213,000 in Rent", "description": "A judge affirmed his order Friday to evict Michael Avenatti's law firm from a California office building for skipping out on $213,000 in rent over four months.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/17/michael-avenatti-law-firm-evicted-ca-office-skipping-213000-rent/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Michael-Avenatti-leaves-courthouse-exit-only-getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T18:59:17Z", "content": "Judge Robert J.

Because the US intelligence community\u2026Saudi Arabia is something that they follow very closely. And so, the idea that something like this would happen without our intelligence agencies knowing something about what happened, I always thought was very unlikely. And so, what we\u2019ve seen over the last few weeks is Trump kind of trying to get through this, and trying to avoid blaming Mohammed bin Salman, this person who he\u2019s held in a full embrace since the beginning of his presidency. He\u2019s acted almost like the defense attorney for Mohammed bin Salman, trying to figure out what the cover story is today.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAnd they just felt like they were about to get through it.

So, when Trump says, well, we just got this information in, no. You just got an intelligence assessment that leaked to the press. The intelligence that informed that assessment has probably been in the system for some time. And guess what? They would share intelligence about a high profile event like this with the White House. So, I think a Democratic House should look very carefully at, was the White House aware that MBS was responsible for this murder? Were they lying about it when they knew MBS was responsible for this murder?

It is sometime in the early 1970s, and our story is based in part on a true one \u2014 that actually took place about a decade later. But this is a good call on Lee\u2019s part. After all, the early 70s were much more stylish than the late 70s.\n\nAfter proving himself as a uniformed officer, Stallworth requests undercover work and ends up (over the phone) earning an opportunity to join the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, just as they are planning a domestic terrorist attack. While Stallworth works the phone with the Klan, including long conversations with Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace), his partner, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), poses as Ron Stallworth in person for the meetings and initiations.\n\nMeanwhile, after he falls in love with a student activist, the real Ron Stallworth finds himself trapped between the black power movement and the white power movement.\n\nBelieve it or not, BlacKkKlansman is nowhere near as radical as you might expect. In fact, the first half is a charmer as the story sets up the characters, their relationships, and the overall plot. The second half only loses a little steam, but is nowhere near as suspenseful as it could have been.\n\nThose looking for Lee to come out swinging, though, will be disappointed. His hero is a cop, a man who might see black radicalism as less threatening than white power, but just as misguided.\n\nLee\u2019s only misstep comes at the very, very end when he jumps to present-day with news footage of Charlottesville and President Trump.\n\nThis is the same mistake Lee made with his masterpiece Malcolm X (1991), where the director cuts from a great movie to heavy-handed editorializing in the present-day. In Klansman, Lee had made his point about Trump, and although I disagree with how he sees Trump (as David Duke\u2019s ultimate goal come to life), I was still impressed with how he got his point across. It was subtle and intelligent. The jarring cut the Charlottesville is dumb and ham-fisted.\n\nStill, Klansman is recommended. The performances are outstanding and the production design flawless. Lee is a director with many talents (and flaws), but his ability to take us back to this era (Summer of Sam, Crooklyn) is second-to-none.\n\nIncredibles II\n\nAfter a 14-year wait, writer/director Brad Bird reunites us with the Parr family and picks things up almost exactly where they left off in 2004. Only now, due to public disfavor, superheroes are banned and the Parrs find themselves chafing under the oppression of everyday life in the suburbs due to a government that refuses to allow them to reach their full potential.\n\nThankfully, Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener), two superhero devotees who own a gigantic telecommunications company, have a plan, which is to use Helen Parr/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) in various publicity stunts to change public opinion.\n\nAnd so, while the wife is out saving everyone\u2019s day, Bob/Mr. Incredible is stuck at home playing Mr. Mom with the three kids.\n\nAs he did in the original, Bird is working with a lot of big themes here. Even though the movie is set in an era before the iPhone or PC, our villain (Screenslaver) still uses screens to control people\u2019s minds. But, then again, so does Winston, the man helping our heroes get what they want. Only he is using manipulated public relations across those screens to get what he wants. Interesting, no?\n\nAnd what do our heroes want? To be our moral and physical vigilantes righting what they see as wrongs without interference from the government. Troubling, no?\n\nThe original Incredibles was about living under an oppressive regime of forced equality, which is a wonderful message. This one is a little, uhm, sketchy. The movie makes a point of pointing out how little confidence the public has in Congress, but it is still our Congress, our representatives. No one voted to make Elastigirl or Mr. Incredible the boss of us.\n\nAnyway, Incredibles II is never dull, but it also never thrills, not like that first one the felt so fresh and original.\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story\n\nOver the past year I have been so hard on Star Wars, I thought it only fair to give Solo another chance. Overall, unfortunately, there is not much to add or to subtract from my original review.\n\nSolo holds your attention, and the train robbery is still thrilling. What I really wish, though, is that this had been a movie about the characters played by Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and their gang of inter-galactic bandits. I also wish the cinematography was not so murky.\n\nThe real problem remains the three leads. Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover cannot come close to filling the shoes of Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams, and as the love interest, Emilia Clarke has no sizzle or spark.\n\nThis is not Clarke\u2019s fault. She\u2019s proved she has plenty of sizzle and spark elsewhere, but the feminist extremism that has done so much damage to this franchise, strips Clarke of everything that would drive a man to not only choose her over every other woman in the galaxy, but to risk his life to get back to her.\n\nIf a movie ever needed a gold bikini, Solo is it.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

A polling firm, Populus, ran the survey of 2,074 UK respondents in late October.\n\n\u201cElected representatives need to be aware that a very significant majority of the population want to retain rights related to sex and its objective nature, not [to the idea of] \u201cgender\u201d and the ideology connected with it,\u201d said Paul Dirks, a Canadian who supports the legal recognition of male and female differences.\n\nThe best score for transgender advocates is the 19 percent of respondents who provided a \u201cyes\u201d answer to this question:\n\nQ2. We would now like you to think about a person who was born male and has male genitalia but who identifies as a woman. In your own personal view would you consider this person to be a woman or a man?\n\nBut that generous personal acceptance by one-in-five respondents dropped quickly when the respondents were asked to apply the identity-over-biology rule to commonplace situations.\n\nFor example, only 13 percent of people said men who are living as women should be allowed \u201cto compete in female-only sporting events.\u201d\n\nEleven percent answered \u201cyes\u201d when they were asked, \u201cShould a self-identifying transwoman with a penis be free to use female changing rooms?\u201d\n\nThirteen percent said people should be allowed to change their sex without even visiting a doctor for confirmation.\n\nThe U.K. has many \u201chate speech\u201d laws, including criminal penalties and government stigmatization for criticism of religions.

In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency in 2016.\n\nMultiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology.\n\nDespite the public disapproval, many Democrats are forcefully endorsing the transgender claim that men are entitled to be treated as women once they say they are women. Breitbart News reported in November:\n\nIt is \u201ccruel and unscientific\u201d to define a person\u2019s legal sex by their biology, says a pro-transgender complaint signed by 98 Democratic House legislators. The Democrats\u2019 statement was sent to President Donald Trump\u2019s administration after the New York Times reported that the administration will formally clarify that the sex of people involved in sex-discrimination legal fights will be based on their male or female body. Trump\u2019s biology-determines-sex policy \u201cmakes it clear that members of this administration are willing to \u2026 solidify an archaic, dogmatic, and alarming view of the world,\u201d the Democrats complain their letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nThis men-have-women\u2019s-rights demand is having a growing impact on civic rules and even on companies.\n\nTransgender groups appropriate women's ideal: Victoria's Secret manager says he 'hopes' to use transgender models, AKA men who want to be women.

Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\n\nYet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies.\n\nIn Ohio, for example, in February 2018, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nIn November, progressives united with business and media groups to defeat an anti-transgenderism, pro-women ballot in Massachusetts.

Somebody from the Colts\u2019 social media department pumped in audio of him yelling on another play and dubbed it over Nelson\u2019s pancake block on Church.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t yelling, not on that play,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it got amped up like that.\u201d\n\nNelson isn\u2019t thrilled with the fine which he thinks is unjust and late.\n\n\u201cIt was five days late, it\u2019s a Friday, so yeah [I\u2019m surprised],\u201d Nelson said Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t [agree with the fine].\u201d\n\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported that Nelson will appeal the fine.\n\nSurely Nelson can\u2019t be thrilled with the individual, from his own organization, who superimposed that audio from another play, which helped make the video a sensation, but also brought extra scrutiny from NFL officials. The Colts removed the video from Twitter a few days after posting it.\n\nSo why was Nelson\u2019s block illegal? In May, NFL owners approved a new rule it hopes will cut down on concussions.\n\nThe new rule states:\n\nIt is a foul if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent. Contact does not have to be to an opponent\u2019s head or neck area \u2013 lowering the head and initiating contact to an opponent\u2019s torso, hips, and lower body, is also a foul. Violations of the rule will be easier to see and officiate when they occur in open space \u2013 as opposed to close line play \u2013 but this rule applies anywhere on the field at any time.\n\nWatching the video, Nelson clearly violated the new NFL rule, a rule many players think is unrealistic.\n\n\u201cTo all those [people] including those who made the rule,\u201d 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman said in August. \u201cI want a video of YOU running full speed and being lead by anything but your head while also attempting to bring down a moving target. You will soon realize it\u2019s impossible.\n\nThe league expects players to adjust, either by keeping their faces up, by striking the opponent with the flipper of the shoulder pad, or by contorting their bodies to spin the helmet away from the opponent, striking him with something other than the thing covering the defensive player\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018make adjustment\u2018 to the way you tackle. Even in a perfect form tackle the body is led by the head. The rule is idiotic and should be dismissed immediately. When you watch rugby players tackle they are still lead by their head.\u201d\n\nWhether the rule is realistic or not, the NFL, which is being sued by dozens of former players claiming to have suffered brain injuries playing the sport, is on a mission to make the game safer.\n\nSo expect a lot more fines for these kind of plays moving forward.\n\nSo perhaps teams should be careful promoting great blocks or hits by players that might violate the new rule.\n\nAnd certainly avoid piping in audio making the hit look even more violent."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Breitbart News", "title": "California Fire: Number of Missing Soars Past 1,000 as Death Toll Hits 71", "description": "CHICO, Calif.

The number of people unaccounted for grew from 631 on Thursday night to more than 1,011 on Friday, but Sheriff Kory Honea said the list was dynamic and could easily contain duplicate names and unreliable spellings of names.\n\nHe said the roster probably includes some who fled the blaze and do not realize they\u2019ve been reported missing.\n\nSome on the list have been confirmed as dead by family and friends on social media. Others have been located and are safe, but authorities haven\u2019t gotten around to marking them as found.\n\nTamara Conry said she should never have been on the list.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I are not missing and never were!\u201d Conry wrote Thursday night on Facebook. \u201cWe have no family looking for us. \u2026 I called and left a message to take our names off.\u201d\n\nAuthorities compiled the list by going back to listen to all the dispatch calls they received since the fire started, to make sure they didn\u2019t miss anyone.\n\nIn last year\u2019s catastrophic wildfires in California wine country, Sonoma County authorities at one point listed more than 2,000 people as missing. But they slowly whittled down the number. In the end, 44 people died in several counties.\n\nThe wildfire this time all but razed the town of Paradise, population 27,000, and heavily damaged the outlying communities of Magalia and Concow on Nov. 8, destroying 9,700 houses and 144 apartment buildings, authorities said.\n\nFirefighters were gaining ground against the blaze, which blackened 222 square miles (575 square kilometers). It was 45 percent contained and posed no immediate threat to populated areas. Crews managed to stop it from spreading toward Oroville, population 19,000. This patch of California, a former Gold Rush region in the Sierra Nevada foothills, is to some extent Trump country, with Trump beating Hillary Clinton in Butte County by 4 percentage points in 2016.\n\nBut some survivors resent that Trump took to Twitter two days after the disaster to blame the wildfires on poor forest mismanagement. He threatened to withhold federal payments from California.\n\n\u201cIf you insult people, then you go visit them, how do you think you\u2019re going to be accepted? You\u2019re not going to have a parade,\u201d Maggie Crowder of Magalia said Thursday outside an informal shelter at a Walmart parking lot in Chico.\n\nBut Stacy Lazzarino, who voted for Trump, said it would be good for the president to see the devastation up close: \u201cI think by maybe seeing it he\u2019s going to be like \u2018Oh, my goodness,\u2019 and it might start opening people\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nIn his Fox News interview on the eve of his visit, the president repeated his criticism. Asked if he thought climate change contributed to the fires, he said, \u201cMaybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management.\u201d\n\nNick Shawkey, a captain with the state fire agency, said the president\u2019s tweet blaming poor forest management was based on a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d The federal government manages 46 percent of land in California.\n\n\u201cThe thing he\u2019s tweeting about is his property,\u201d Shawkey said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s outgoing and incoming governors said they would join Trump on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats Gov. Jerry Brown and governor-elect Gavin Newsom said they welcomed the president\u2019s visit and \u201cnow is a time to pull together for the people of California.\u201d Brown and Newsom have been vocal critics of Trump.\n\nMore than 450 searchers continued looking for human remains in the ashes.\n\nAround 52,000 people have been driven out and have gone to shelters, motels and the homes of friends and relatives. With winter coming on, many are seeking answers on what assistance will be provided.\n\nAt the Chico Mall where the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others set up an assistance center, 68-year-old Richard Wilson sought information about lodging.

Meanwhile, actual and real threats to press freedoms that began with the Obama DOJ and have escalated with the Trump DOJ \u2013 such as aggressive attempts to unearth and prosecute sources \u2013 have gone largely ignored if not applauded.\n\nBut prosecuting Assange and/or WikiLeaks for publishing classified documents would be in an entirely different universe of press freedom threats. Reporting on the secret acts of government officials or powerful financial actors \u2013 including by publishing documents taken without authorization \u2013 is at the core of investigative journalism. From the Pentagon Papers to the Panama Papers to the Snowden disclosures to publication of Trump\u2019s tax returns to the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, some of the most important journalism over the last several decades has occurred because it is legal and constitutional to publish secret documents even if the sources of those documents obtained them through illicit or even illegal means.\n\nThe Obama DOJ \u2013 despite launching notoriously aggressive attacks on press freedoms \u2013 recognized this critical principle when it came to WikiLeaks. It spent years exploring whether it could criminally charge Assange and WikiLeaks for publishing classified information. It ultimately decided it would not do so, and could not do so, consistent with the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment. After all, the Obama DOJ concluded, such a prosecution would pose a severe threat to press freedom because there would be no way to prosecute Assange for publishing classified documents without also prosecuting the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian and others for doing exactly the same thing.\n\nAs the Washington Post put it in 2013 when it explained the Obama DOJ\u2019s decision not to prosecute Assange:\n\nJustice officials said they looked hard at Assange but realized that they have what they described as a \u201cNew York Times problem.\u201d If the Justice Department indicted Assange, it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organizations and writers who published classified material, including The Washington Post and Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "Charlie Spiering", "title": "Donald Trump Surprises Audience with Elvis Presley Song During Medal of Freedom Ceremony", "description": "The president called Elvis the \"True King\" of Rock and Roll, as he paused while his version of \"How Great Thou Art\" played.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/16/donald-trump-surprises-audience-with-elvis-presley-song-during-medal-of-freedom-ceremony/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Elvis-Presley-AP.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T02:34:56Z", "content": "The president called Elvis the \u201cTrue King\u201d of Rock and Roll and paused his speech while Presley\u2019s version of \u201cHow Great Thou Art\u201d played on the sound system.

And it is why Ms. Paz joined the same caravan with her 6-year-old son. \u201cThey say that bringing your child is your ticket in,\u201d said Ms. Paz.\n\nThe migrants know that current laws and court-imposed settlements force border officials to release asylum-seekers with children in just 20 days. This early release allows the migrants to get blue-collar jobs \u2014 and to pay their smuggling debts \u2014 until they are caught and sent home.\n\nThe economic migrants are also splitting their families to maximize their chance of getting through the border, amid progressives\u2019 complaints that President Donald Trump\u2019s border policies are \u201cripping\u201d children from their mothers\u2019 arms.\n\nThe progressives\u2019 media-magnified complaints about \u201cfamily separation\u201d forced Trump to drop his zero-tolerance policy for migrants with children. The progressive win prompted at least one migrant to separate herself from her own family, according to the Wall Street Journal:\n\nThat is how Cintia, a 29-year-old single mother of three from the city of Choloma, Honduras, reached the U.S. last month. She decided to leave Honduras, where about two-thirds of the population lives in poverty, after losing her job at a cleaning company during the political unrest sparked by last year\u2019s contested presidential election. Afterward, she said, she couldn\u2019t find a job, and became scared to leave her home after being the victim of street robberies. A friend in Kentucky offered to help by paying a smuggler a $8,000 fee. She knew that she would have a better chance of avoiding deportation if she traveled with children, but couldn\u2019t afford to pay for all three; she decided to take her youngest daughter. When the White House ended its family separation policy in June, she decided it was a good time to make the trip. After crossing into Brownsville, Texas, Cintia and her daughter were held for one night and released, she said. \u201cHonestly, it was a quick process,\u201d she said by phone from Kentucky, where she was looking for work. \u201cMy plan is to get a job and be able to help my kids and mom.\u201d\n\nIn November, the Washington Post also admitted that the U.S. asylum rules encourage migrants to bring some of their children up to the border:\n\nThe controversy generated by the policy and its abrupt rollback six weeks later handed smuggling guides across Central America a potent sales pitch. They now tell potential customers the Americans do not jail parents who bring children \u2014 and to hurry up before they might start doing so again. \u2026 Migrants have adapted \u2026 As asylum officers and immigration judges reject more [asylum] claims [by single adults], the number of single adults who arrive claiming fear of persecution is dropping. The fastest-growing portion comprises parents coming with children, preventing their long-term detention and significantly reducing the likelihood they will be deported.\n\nThe New York Times (NYT) has downplayed the asylum fraud, even though its reporters have written on the reality. NYT reported June 22:\n\n\u201cThis is the reason I brought a minor with me,\u201d said Guillermo T., 57, a construction worker who recently arrived in Arizona. Facing unemployment at home in Guatemala, he decided to head north; he had been told that bringing his 16-year-old daughter would assure passage. He asked that only his first named be used to avoid consequences with his immigration case. \u201cShe was my passport,\u201d he said of his daughter.\n\n#CBP #USBP Twenty-eight Guatemalan and four Honduran family groups, not part of the migrant caravans, surrender to Yuma Sector agents Wednesday after crossing the Colorado River vehicle barriers #NationalSecurity #SouthwestBorder pic.twitter.com/5vztseq1Ov \u2014 CBP Arizona (@CBPArizona) November 16, 2018\n\nThe WSJ, like the Post and the New York Times, however, ignores the profitable labor-trafficking aspect of the Central American migration into the U.S. jobs market.\n\nCartel-affiliated coyotes delivered many of the 65,218 asylum-seeking migrants to the U.S. border in fiscal 2018. That huge number \u2014 plus the variety of legal loopholes \u2014 ensured that many of the cartels\u2019 migrants were quickly released into the U.S. jobs market where they can work to pay off their smuggling contracts with the cartel-affiliated coyotes.\n\nThe migrants are released because Congress does not fund enough beds to detain all the migrants and their children. In turn, the immigration courts are backlogged for two years, so migrants can work illegally and legally until their court date \u2014 and until they are found and deported.\n\nPresident Trump is trying to break the smuggling business by ending the catch-and-release policies that allow migrants to get jobs. If the migrants are not released, they cannot get U.S. jobs to pay their smuggling debts to the cartels or fund the cartels\u2019 transport of their spouses and children to the United States.\n\nSince 2016, cartel-affiliated coyotes have also used the nation\u2019s lax asylum laws to deliver more than 110,000 children and youths from Central America to parents, relatives, or employers in the United States. The government-aided business has been hidden by media and by Democrats who portray the expensively smuggled young migrants as \u201cUnaccompanied Alien Children.\u201d\n\nMany business-first Republicans and Democrats look away when employers tacitly use the cartel-affiliated coyotes as labor brokers. In September 2018, the Department of Justice announced a guilty plea by a labor broker who helped to smuggle \u201cunaccompanied\u201d minors into the U.S. labor market. The U.S. employer paid $6 million to the labor-broker, the department reported:\n\nPablo Duran Ramirez, 50, pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Cleveland, Ohio, to encouraging the illegal entry of Guatemalan nationals, including unaccompanied minors, into the United States for financial gain \u2026 Duran Ramirez is the fourth defendant to plead guilty in connection with a labor trafficking scheme that forced Guatemalan minors to work at egg farms in central Ohio. According to the defendant\u2019s plea agreement and admissions in court, the defendant, through his company, Haba Corporate Services, contracted to provide labor to Trillium Farms, knowing that the workers were unlawfully present in the United States. He further admitted to knowing that some of the workers were unaccompanied minors who had been coerced or threatened to enter the United States and then housed in an isolated trailer park in Marion, Ohio. In 2013 and 2014, Trillim Farms paid the defendant\u2019s company approximately $6 million for its labor services.\n\nThe Honduran caravan\u2019s economic migrants are trying to stay outside the cartels\u2019 trafficking business as they seek jobs in the United States, often via their relatives. The Dallas News reported one example on November 10:\n\n[Edwin Edgardo] Hernandez has grand plans of reuniting with his brother in Dallas. But, for now, he said Atlanta beckons with a bigger sense of urgency: Jobs. Weeks ago, his former boss sent word to his community via recruiters that construction jobs await him and others to build stores like Wal-Marts and Home Depots \u2014 the kind of construction work he once did here in the U.S., the very work that once helped him earn enough money to build a home back in Honduras. \u201cI\u2019m told the economy is very good again,\u201d he said. \u201cI know from past experience that when there are jobs there will be a way to get in. It\u2019s about resolve, and God, not Trump.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nImmigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states."}, {"source": {"id": "breitbart-news", "name": "Breitbart News"}, "author": "John Binder", "title": "Exclusive\u2013Expert: Florida Democrats\u2019 Alleged Election Fraud \u2018Potentially Grounds for RICO\u2019 Investigation", "description": "An effort to allegedly add Democrat votes after Election Day in Florida is \"potentially grounds for a RICO\" investigation, an election fraud expert says.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/16/exclusive-expert-florida-democrats-alleged-election-fraud-potentially-grounds-for-rico-investigation/", "urlToImage": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/brenda-snipes-getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T01:37:01Z", "content": "The Government Accountability Institute (GAI) research director Eric Eggers exclusively told SiriusXM Patriots Breitbart News Tonight s Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak that a report revealing that Florida Democrats asked voters to subm\u2026 [+2232 chars]", "fulltext": "An effort to allegedly add Democrat votes after Election Day in Florida is \u201cpotentially grounds for a RICO\u201d investigation, an election fraud expert says.\n\nThe Government Accountability Institute (GAI) research director Eric Eggers exclusively told SiriusXM Patriot\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight\u2018s Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak that a report revealing that Florida Democrats asked voters to submit absentee ballots after Election Day is a \u201csmoking gun\u201d and could possibly lead to a racketeering investigation.\n\nEggers said:\n\nI spoke with a Republican attorney today who is quite familiar with this and connected to the inter-workings and they believe that it is not only the smoking gun, but it is potentially the grounds for a RICO case \u2026 this is not over.

Republicans in the state are appealing the decision.\n\nIn a recent piece for Breitbart News, Eggers reviewed Brenda Snipes\u2019 history of allowing illegal aliens and felons to vote in elections in Broward County, along with her destroying of ballots.
