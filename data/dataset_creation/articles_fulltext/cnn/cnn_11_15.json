I own a ton of shares,\" said Immelt, who left the company last year.\n\nThose shares plummeted to nine-year lows this week. Years of bad decisions, including poorly-timed acquisitions, have caught up to GE. The company's balance sheet is riddled with debt and its cash flow has rapidly deteriorated.\n\nImmelt received about $168 million in total compensation since 2006, according to Equilar. Since stepping down as GE's CEO in July 2017, Immelt has gone to work in Silicon Valley as a venture capitalist. He's also teaching a management seminar at Stanford Business School.\n\nAsked what he would have done differently at GE, Immelt cited a failure to fully separate GE's industrial businesses from GE Capital, its money-losing financial arm.\n\nWhile Immelt did sell much of GE Capital in 2015, the remnants continue to haunt the company. The long-term insurance portfolio recently suffered a $6 billion loss. And GE is facing a potential costly Justice Department settlement over WMC, the subprime mortgage lender that Immelt acquired in 2004 just before the housing market peaked.\n\n\"Believe me, it wasn't for a lack of trying,\" Immelt said of efforts to get rid of GE Capital. \"It was just hard to do.\"\n\nImmelt also pointed to unspecified personnel decisions that he made at GE.\n\n\"The worst decisions you ever make are on people,\" he said.\n\nRecalling 2008\n\nImmelt did not mention the infamous spare jet that followed him around the world. GE has said that practice, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal last year, was stopped in 2014.\n\nWhile he led GE, Immelt received praise for guiding the company through the Sept. 11 terror attacks, which took place just days after he became CEO. Barron's named Immelt one of the \"World's Best CEOs\" three times and he also sat on advisory panels under both Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama.\n\nImmelt recalled the harrowing experience of leading GE through the 2008 financial crisis. In particular, he pointed to the difficult decision of having to decide whether to go forward with an $18 billion share sale just weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n\n\"I remember walking down the hall and thinking, 'I want my mommy,'\" Immelt said to laughter. \"I want someone to hold me.\"\n\nGE ultimately went forward with the share sale, which helped stabilize the company.\n\nImmelt said he also learned not to obsess over media coverage of his company. He pointed to how he ignored the flurry of stories surrounding GE's decision to sell NBC Universal, its media arm.\n\n\"Don't read things,\" Immelt told the audience. \"I just went a month without watching TV or reading.\"\n\nBuying Enron's wind business\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of GE over the past decade is that too often it bought companies high and sold them low. For instance, Immelt's acquisition of Alstom's power business deal turned out to be a disaster, underscored by the $22 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded last quarter.\n\nImmelt did not mention the Alstom deal, but he did cite GE's acquisition of Enron's wind business out of bankruptcy in 2002.\n\n\"I hated the wind business. I thought it was stupid, subsidized and too expensive,\" Immelt said. Eventually, it got cheap enough where he let an executive go ahead and purchase it.\n\n\"I said, 'Just don't tell me what it costs,'\" Immelt said.\n\nWind power has since taken off and it remains part of GE's renewable energy division.\n\n\"Now I take credit for it as a brilliant, thoughtful strategy,\" Immelt joked."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "CNN, CNN", "title": "CNN10 - 11/16/18", "description": "The debate over a U.S. prison reform bill, a high-stakes exam for 600,000 students, and newly proposed rules concerning e-cigarettes are featured this Friday.", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/services/podcasting/studentnews/rss/~3/kCHNJ5Iuqxk/ten-1116.cnn_2341541_ios_1240.mp4", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:09:45Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eli Watkins, CNN", "title": "Trump administration creates 'in-flight sexual misconduct' task force", "description": "The Department of Transportation announced on Thursday that it will create a task force to review procedures surrounding episodes of sexual misconduct by airplane passengers.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/department-of-transportation-flight-sexual-misconduct/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115170444-elaine-chao-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:57:30Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) The Department of Transportation announced on Thursday that it will create a task force to review procedures surrounding episodes of sexual misconduct by airplane passengers.\n\nThe announcement said Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was establishing the National In-Flight Sexual Misconduct Task Force to review practices and protocols for US airlines in handling allegations.\n\nThe task force will be established as a subcommittee of the Aviation Consumer Protection Advisory Committee, a newly reconstituted panel due to meet for the first time in January.

Click to subscribe!\n\nThe difficulty in seeing this forest through the trees of drama is based on this reality: The margins in both races are very small but only as compared to the raw number of votes cast. In terms of the sorts of historical margins that we've seen recounts -- automatic or manual -- flip, these margins are nowhere near small enough to expect that outcome.\n\nLet's go over the numbers first.\n\nIn the Senate race, Gov. Rick Scott (R) has 4,097,689 votes as compared to Sen. Bill Nelson's (D) 4,085,086. That's a margin for Scott of 12,603 votes. In the governor's race, former Rep. Ron DeSantis (R) has 4,075,445 votes while Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has 4,041,762. That's a 33,683-vote lead for DeSantis. Scott's margin amounts to 0.15% of all the votes cast (8,183,652) while DeSantis' edge is 0.41% of the 8,118,074 ballots cast in the governor's race.\n\nWhich is a SUPER SMALL margin.\n\nBut the vote gaps in the two races -- 12,000 and 33,000 -- are massive when you consider the history of modern recounts.\n\nThe most recent hugely high-profile recount happened a decade ago in Minnesota between Republican Sen. Norm Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken. The state canvassing board showed Coleman with a 206-vote lead. A recount was triggered. Almost two months later -- in January 2009 -- Franken had the lead by 225 votes. After a HUGE amount of legal wrangling, Franken's final margin was finalized at 312 votes. From the beginning to the end of the process, the vote changed by 518 votes in Franken's favor. That was 0.01% of the 2,862,451 votes cast.\n\nFour years earlier, the Washington state governor's race ended in a virtual tie between Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, and Republican Dino Rossi. Rossi was originally named the winner by a margin of 261 votes. A mandated machine recount narrowed Rossi's lead to 42 votes. Gregoire, with the help of a number of national Democrats who raised money for her, funded -- via the state party -- a manual recount. The manual recount ended 58 days after the election, and gave Gregoire a 129-vote final margin over Rossi. The total votes changed by the series of manual and automatic recounts was 390 total votes, or 0.01% of all ballots cast.\n\nThe point here is that in the two most recent statewide recounts of a major race -- for governor or Senate -- the starting margin between the two candidates was less than 300 votes. That's miles and miles away from where we are in either the Senate or governor's race in Florida. And, as Harry Enten notes in his terrific piece on why Nelson is going to need a miracle to win , the 2004 Washington governor's race and the 2008 Minnesota Senate race are not anomalous when it comes to recounts. Writes Harry\n\n\"According to a FairVote database of statewide recounts from 2000 to 2015, the average recount moves the margin by 0.02 points. Nelson needs the margin to move by nearly eight times as much. ... In terms of pure votes, it doesn't look any better for Nelson. The average recount from 2000 to 2015 shifted the result by 282 votes. You don't need to be a math wizard to know that 282 is considerably less than 12,000. The maximum change in the margin in any recount from 2000 to 2015 was 1,247 votes.\"\n\nThose facts -- and the long history of recounts changing only races in which the original count was extremely narrow -- get lost in the coverage of the various suits and countersuits both sides are lobbing at each other. President Donald Trump has added to the confusion by repeatedly insisting via Twitter that there is something nefarious going on in the state's MANDATED recount.\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" tweeted Trump . \"An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\"\n\nNow. History is only predictive until it's not. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for one, seems to believe that Nelson will buck history. \"When all the votes are counted in Florida, we could be just where we started at the beginning of the 115th Congress, with 48 members, even facing the worst map that we've ever had,\" the New York Democrat insisted.\n\nMaybe! But a victory by Nelson or Gillum, given the margins they are trailing by, would be hugely out of step with what most recounts -- manual or machine -- produce."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Sara Ashley O'Brien, CNN Business", "title": "Facebook unveils new way for users to appeal content removal", "description": "Facebook is admitting it needs oversight with content moderation.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/tech/facebook-content-moderation/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181004100054-business-facebook-wall-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:10:26Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New York (CNN) Facebook is admitting it needs oversight with content moderation.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday the company plans to establish an independent group to oversee users' appeals of content policy decisions, starting next year.\n\nCritcs have long urged the company to exhibit greater transparency into what content Facebook's human moderators and artificial intelligence take down, keep up and why.\n\nThe news, which was announced on a call with reporters, came one day after a report from The New York Times revealed how Facebook execs, including Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, navigated the company's recent crises, ranging from Russian interference to data privacy.

Col. Joseph Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, told CNN on Thursday.\n\nBut for now at least, defense officials say there are no additional requests for troops and that DHS has not requested additional military support for tasks that have not yet been specified, meaning the total number essentially tops out at 5,900.\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN reported that the US troops on the Texas southern border were expected to finish their assigned task of reinforcing border crossing points, largely with concertina wire, in the coming days. Once that work is done, it's not clear what additional orders they will be given other than putting up more wire, according to two defense officials.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Tami Luhby Business", "title": "Bernie Sanders unveils Stop Walmart Act", "description": "Fresh off a campaign to get Amazon to raise its minimum wage, Senator Bernie Sanders is now shining his progressive spotlight on Walmart.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/business/bernie-sanders-walmart-minimum-wage/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115150022-20181115-bernie-sanders-walmart-minimum-wage-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:57:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New York (CNN Business) Fresh off a campaign to get Amazon to raise its minimum wage, Senator Bernie Sanders is now shining his progressive spotlight on Walmart.\n\nSanders on Thursday introduced a bill, titled the Stop Walmart Act, that would prevent large companies from buying back stock unless they pay all employees at least $15 an hour, allow workers to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave and limit CEO compensation to no more than 150 times the median pay of all staffers.\n\nCalling Walmart the poster child for corporate greed, Sanders noted that the company made $13 billion in profits last year and paid CEO Doug McMillon more than $22 million, or 1,188 times its typical worker, who earned $19,177.\n\nThe Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion.

And he said, 'Only one way: It's at the gym!' \"\n\nSpanberger, a former CIA officer who's the mother of three young daughters, expressed excitement and optimism about her new role and the historic wave of women elected in last week's midterms while she was in Washington for orientation.\n\n\"It's amazing the way some of us have already bonded and become friends and found commonality,\" she said. \"I realized this morning that my 4-year-old will probably not have any strong memories of me not as a public person, which is amazing to me.\"\n\nIn a district that was Republican red -- held by conservative Rep. Dave Brat, who famously defeated GOP Rep. Eric Cantor in a primary just a few years ago -- Spanberger describes herself as a pragmatist on the political spectrum.\n\n\"I want to get things done,\" she said over a cup of tea. \"I want to move forward.\"\n\nHer desire to work with a bipartisan group of members extends beyond Congress to the White House, where she thinks she can work with President Donald Trump to lower the prices of prescription drugs.\n\n\"He's the President,\" she said matter-of-factly, \"So if we want to have legislation signed into law we have to work with him.\"\n\n\"Prescription drug prices should be a pretty straightforward place. It benefits the people in my district. It is consistent with the values of the American people for us to have greater competition and allow people to get the drugs that they need to stay healthy,\" she said adding, \"I think there are other areas, particularly infrastructure bills, things into the opioid crisis -- on a related note -- where if we could make the right steps forward, ideally, we'd be able to make progress and get him to sign off on things.\"\n\nHer opponent in the race, Brat, tried to paint Spanberger as a Nancy Pelosi-sympathist. Having never run for public office before, Spanberger tried to keep the race about policy, she said, \"but it became a very personal race.\" She reflected more: \"It was motivating but it was absolutely challenging. It was all worth it.\"\n\nFor the record, she doesn't support Pelosi for speaker, but she also doesn't know who should fill Democratic leadership roles, calling it \"problematic\" that no one has stepped forward to challenge the leadership.\n\n\"I really do think that it's incredibly important that if we are going to change the conversation in Washington we need to change the people having it and directing it. It's not in any way a negative assessment of the job that anybody is doing but at times cyclical change, I believe, is a good thing.\"\n\nAnother political issue she'll be wading into: the Democrats' desire for oversight of the White House and the Trump administration. Her initial reaction is that it's not a good idea for Democrats to focus on oversight investigations.\n\n\"I don't think that we should sort of all of a sudden say, 'We've got the majority, therefore we're going to march headfirst into investigating everything,' \" she told CNN. \"Where appropriate, I am in no way opposed to investigations. However, investigations for the sake of investigations is not something that I support, because there has to be a significant and legitimate concern. And there has to be a goal. And if it's diving deep into something just to prove a point, I have concern about that.\"\n\nSpanberger, like many Democrats in the 2018 midterms, focused heavily on health care on the campaign trail, but the issue she is most eager to tackle in DC is campaign finance, after she says voters repeatedly expressed \"a basic level of distrust of the government\" on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I want to focus on a variety of things when I first get there but I think the place where we actually need to achieve first steps is on campaign finance reform and good governance,\" she said. Likewise, she has her eyes on a few committees she'd like to serve on, including Ways and Means, Intelligence, Education and the Workforce, Foreign Affairs, and Veteran's Affairs.\n\nIn the meantime, she's trying to enjoy the week of orientation exercises and bonding time with her fellow new members while she navigates the lottery system for offices (\"I had somebody tell me, 'Don't be on the sixth floor of Longworth and don't be near construction in Cannon' but I don't know how you avoid the construction in Cannon!\").\n\n\"I'm just trying to enjoy it at this point,\" she said with a smile, adding, \"My husband keeps joking with me that I'm going off to college.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Like him or not, Trump is why America voted", "description": "Florida.

After finding out that the girl shared his birthday of April 20, Hitler was immediately captivated with her.\n\nThe two were later photographed by his trusted photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, Alexander Historical Auctions said.\n\nOne of the photos was later inscribed by Hitler himself with the words \"The dear and (considerate?)

She has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"The government contends Maria is a Kremlin agent because she shared her memorable American happenings and na\u00efve, youthful optimism for better Russian-American relations with others, including an individual claimed to be 'Russian Official,' who did not employ her, pay her, request her to pursue better relations between the two countries, or exert any control over her daily activities,\" Butina's lawyers wrote in their 28-page request to Judge Tanya Chutkan of the US District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nIn grandiose language, Butina's lawyers argued that the evidence against her is so weak that if that conduct is criminal, \"scores of people are unknowingly violating this statute\" against acting as an agent for a foreign government without informing the Justice Department.\n\nIf Chutkan doesn't throw out the full two-count indictment, Butina's lawyers want the judge to force prosecutors to drop one of the charges. They say the prosecutors violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the US Constitution by charging Butina with two crimes for the same conduct.\n\nThe separate charges \"afford the government an unfair advantage by increasing the likelihood that the jury will convict on at least one count, if only as the result of a compromise verdict,\" Butina's lawyers told the judge.\n\nButina has been in an Alexandria, Virginia, jail since her arrest in July. Despite pleading from Butina's lawyers, the judge previously ruled that Butina must stay in jail until her trial because she is a significant flight risk.\n\nProsecutors previously said Butina spent years infiltrating US political groups at the behest of her mentor, Kremlin-linked banker Alexander Torshin, to push the groups to adopt a friendlier position toward Russia. Prosecutors also said Butina and Torshin tried to use their contacts at the National Rifle Association to set up back-channel communications between candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nButina's lawyers repeated their claim on Thursday that she \"came to the United States as a student to better her career and make connections all on her own volition.\" She received a graduate degree from American University this year.\n\nProsecutors have faced some hurdles in their case against Butina.

But crossing the border legally could still take them weeks, if not longer, due to bottlenecks at ports of entry that US authorities say are already at capacity and unable to process them faster.\n\nAdvocates warn that the lengthy wait poses serious risks for migrants who are seeking safety and pose no threat. Officials in Mexican border cities have worried about how they'll handle the influx. And some local residents are already bristling at the new arrivals, with tensions flaring in the streets.\n\nHere's what we've seen unfolding so far:\n\n'This time we are going to be first'\n\nA group of about 80 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender members of the caravan were the first to make it to Tijuana.\n\nThey told reporters they broke away from the larger caravan after facing discrimination for weeks.\n\n\"The LGBT community was the last to be taken into account in every way. So what we wanted to do was to change that and say, 'This time we are going to be first,'\" said Cesar Mejia, a 23-year-old from Honduras who trekked north with a rainbow flag in tow.\n\nIn this November 2, 2018 photo, Central American migrants who hitched a ride on a flatbed truck jeer at LGBT migrants on the road to Donaji, Mexico.

Supposedly we were all united,\" said Lisett Won, a transgender woman from Honduras who said she fled her home country after being assaulted multiple times.\n\nBut meeting other LGBT migrants and banding together was empowering, Won said. And now, she said, they're focused on their goal of seeking asylum in the United States.\n\n\"We want the opportunity to have a better life,\" Mejia said, \"a life with out discrimination.\"\n\nProtests and skirmishes\n\nThe LGBT group's arrival in Tijuana was greeted by sharp questioning from locals, who interrupted a press conference the migrants were holding over the weekend to express their concerns.\n\nNeighborhood residents told reporters they were worried for their children's safety. A woman spotted a migrant wrapped in a rainbow flag and shouted, \"You don't need to go walking around like that.\"\n\nMejia told CNN that in recent days, some neighbors stopped by the house where the LGBT group is staying to apologize and offer donations of blankets and other items.\n\nCentral American migrants gathered near the US-Mexico border fence in Tijuana on Tuesday.\n\nBut hundreds more migrants have arrived in Tijuana this week, and by late Wednesday night, tensions flared once again.\n\nWon told CNN some locals pushed her to the ground after she attempted to pass out socks, sweaters and other items that had been donated.\n\n\"People here are trying to throw us out and threatening us and saying thousands of things. ... This cannot continue,\" she said. \"We are all human beings and we all united in the struggle to reach the United States and seek asylum. They cannot trample us like this.\"\n\nLive online footage showed small protests and skirmishes in the Playas de Tijuana neighborhood Wednesday night.\n\nProtesters chanted, \"we want security,\" demanding the migrants get on buses and go to a local shelter. \"We are not racist,\" one resident is heard saying in one video, asking that the local government take action as fear grows that the migrants will destabilize the economy and insecurity could increase.\n\nMexican police formed a barrier between the migrants and residents to calm the situation.\n\nThousands more migrants are expected to arrive soon\n\nMore than 400 migrants have arrived in Tijuana in recent days, according to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garcia, director of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter.\n\nAn additional 2,000 migrants are expected to reach the border city in the next two days, state official Rodolfo Olimpo Hernandez Bojorquez told CNN.\n\nAnd there could be more coming after that. Officials have said several additional large groups of migrants are moving through Mexico -- largely trekking on foot.\n\nHernandez said local officials in Mexico's Baja California state have been preparing for the arrival of large numbers of migrants -- possibly up to 9,000 -- and are ready to shelter them in a stadium once other shelters are full. But he stressed that resources are strained, and that Mexican federal authorities aren't doing enough to help.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump's migrant caravan warnings aside, what's going on at the border?

CBP has deployed additional resources to ensure the continued security of the border, and safety for everyone in the area. US Customs and Border Protection officials continue to monitor the movement in Mexico of individuals who are part of the caravan,\" spokesman Ralph DeSio said. \"At this time, we believe that at least some of those individuals currently gathered in this area are from the caravan.\"\n\nTwo Central American migrants walk along the top of the border structure separating Mexico and the United States on Wednesday in Tijuana.\n\nThere are already some 1,600 migrants waiting to seek asylum at the San Ysidro port of entry, Hernandez said.\n\nThat's because, long before recent large groups of migrants started heading toward the US border, the wait to seek asylum at ports of entry has been weeks long. And now it's likely to be even longer.\n\nAnd Cristian Sanchez, an attorney with RAICES who's been meeting with LGBT migrants in Tijuana, noted that the process of seeking asylum itself is lengthy and complicated.\n\n\"The journey has really just begun,\" he said.\n\nMigrants from the caravan told CNN they still plan to cross the border legally -- no matter how long it takes.\n\nThe group of LGBT migrants headed to the border Thursday to add their names to a waiting list.\n\n\"We want to do it legally, not to climb over the wall,\" Won said. \"We are trusting in God and hoping that they don't change the rules, and that God speaks from the heart to Donald Trump.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Brian Lowry, CNN", "title": "'Fantastic Beasts' plunges deeper into pre-Harry Potter world", "description": "More workmanlike than magical, \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" nevertheless feels like an upgrade from its predecessor, one that adds star power, introduces key characters and lays the foundation for a genuine \"Wizarding World\" franchise.

We have been hard at work on those four areas of agreement,\" Nauert said.\n\n\"We take Chairman Kim at his word that he will work on this with us and when the President and Chairman Kim are next able to meet whenever that does take place, we think probably early in the next year, we expect those four elements of the Singapore summit will be addressed by the two leaders,\" she added.\n\nHidden missile bases revealed\n\nPence's comments come days after the release of new commercial satellite images identifying more than a dozen undeclared North Korean missile operating bases, another sign that Pyongyang is continuing to move forward with its ballistic missile program.\n\nThat assessment comes as no surprise to American intelligence agencies which have long assessed that the North Koreans have stored much of their weapons capability, including mobile missile launchers, in underground mountain bunkers.\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that his administration is aware of the sites and that the images offered \"nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal.\"\n\nBut experts noted that the State Department's response to the report, which implored Kim to \"follow through on his commitments -- including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs\" indicates that there is still a disconnect between the two sides.\n\nLater on Thursday evening, the North Korean state-run Korean Central News Agency published a story stating that Kim visited the Academy of Defense Science facility in Pyongyang and \"supervised a newly developed ultra modern tactical weapon test.\" The details of the weapon and the test could not independently be corroborated by CNN.\n\n\"North Korea is still building nuclear weapons. Kim is doing exactly the opposite,\" according to Bruce Bennett, a senior researcher who specializes in North Korea at the RAND Corporation.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Monday that the images once again show that Trump's comments on North Korea have been a \"fabrication.\"\n\n\"The North Koreans have not signed any document working out, laying out, what steps they are going to take to denuclearize,\" Hagel said. \"There has been nothing stated, agreed to, framed signed, except what President Trump says they've said ... but now ... we have a whole different story, and it is the reality, it is not fantasy,\" he added.\n\nWhile North Korea claims that it has taken some steps toward denuclearization, experts say those moves are largely cosmetic and easily reversible. Kim's regime has shuttered a missile engine testing facility; destroyed the entrances to its nuclear test site; and promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, if Washington takes what it calls \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nTrump says he's 'very happy'\n\nTrump has insisted that he is \"very happy with how it's going with North Korea,\" but US and foreign sources close to the talks have painted a starkly different image, describing a situation in which progress has been slowed by disagreements over sanctions relief and personal friction between working-level negotiators.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing dance between officials in Washington and Pyongyang said that North Korea's stance is that the US \"must make a move before we make the next one.\"\n\nFor the time being however, Trump remains optimistic about the possibility achieving his administration's goal of achieving denuclearization, even if that means being flexible on certain demands in an effort to rebuild trust between the two sides.\n\n\"Certainly the administration is doing everything it can, within bounds, to get North Korea to trust them,\" Bennett told CNN. \"But North Korea's terminology, what they are saying, is exactly the opposite, which makes it sound like what Kim is really trying to do is play the hard bargainer and extort as much as he can ... until the Americans decide (he is) not serious.\"\n\nPence's comments may indicate that the US is making a calculated attempt to break through that impasse, according to Adam Mount, senior fellow and director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\n\"Though it clearly wasn't the US preference, setting aside a demand for a declaration is very much for the best,\" said Mount, who added that an inventory in itself would do little to address the nuclear threat from North Korea or add momentum to the talks.\n\n\"North Korea is clearly signaling it is not willing to rapidly dismantle its arsenal, but it may well agree to important limits on its capabilities. Rather than symbolic steps that hint at total disarmament, the US should lock in practical measures to limit the threat, especially agreed limits on reactors, missile tests and destabilizing military operations,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"The administration's experts understand that they cannot go into another summit without an agenda, a tangible deliverable, or a road map for future working level talks,\" Mount added.\n\nPlaying into Kim's hands?\n\nPyongyang has often argued it is unable to provide comprehensive details about the locations of its nuclear and missile sites because that could serve as a target list should the situation escalate into an armed conflict.\n\nAnd the consensus among many North Korea watchers is Kim will likely never surrender a complete list of his nuclear and missile sites.\n\n\"It was asking to be lied to, and would have led to months or years of vicious arguments about its completeness,\" said Mount, about making a declaration of sites a prerequisite for a second summit.\n\n\"Every time the administration issues and then abandons an unrealistic demand, it loses some credibility and momentum,\" he said.\n\nWhile dropping that demand as a prerequisite for a second summit may help jump-start the stalled talks, some argue that administration could be playing into Kim's hands by moving forward with a second Trump-Kim summit without a plan in place for how that meeting will help advance working-level discussions.\n\nLisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at CSIS, told CNN this week that \"you can't get anywhere without these working-level talks because that's where the nitty-gritty stuff happens.\"\n\n\"You can't get a verifiable list of anything unless nuclear weapons experts are part of the process,\" she said.\"Is President Trump going to create a list of all those facilities? Does he even know where some of these places are? I would be very skeptical.\"\n\nBennett told CNN that he thinks that the administration is hoping to show they are open to a degree of compromise that will encourage the North Koreans will start to negotiate at the working-level again. If the North Koreans then still resist, US officials would likely use that reaction as evidence to convince Trump of their true intentions.\n\n\"If they do not, then that is a clear signal we can give to President Trump that they are not taking this all that seriously,\" he said, adding that message could also be interpreted as a personal affront to Trump and potentially prompt him to reconsider the upcoming summit."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Manu Raju and Ashley Killough, CNN", "title": "Republican says he may back Pelosi for speaker on certain conditions", "description": "As a faction of Democrats try to deny House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi the speakership, at least one Republican may offer her a lifeline.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/tom-reed-nancy-pelosi-republicans-speakership/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160328064748-capitol-hill-dome-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:25:02Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) As a faction of Democrats try to deny House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi the speakership, at least one Republican may offer her a lifeline.\n\nGOP Rep.

It is hard work, and it takes time: Sweeping change doesn't come from any one election.\n\nGeorge Mitchell\n\nLeading up to this year's midterm elections, that's one reason why so many reporters, pundits and other public figures cast doubt on whether young people would turn out to vote. They cited low youth turnout figures from past elections, and often various negative stereotypes of millennials, asking: Can we really expect change from our young people? Aren't they just too ignorant, too apathetic, too selfish, too lazy to vote? Are they really up to the task of reshaping our democracy?\n\nWith the results of the midterms now in, we have an answer: The skeptics were wrong, and our youth are indeed ready to do the work of democracy. Across the country, young people turned out in numbers dwarfing the last several midterm elections; for many of them, it was their first time voting. Of course, the election results varied widely across the board, and in some cases, their candidate didn't win. But I have full confidence that these youth have made a lasting, lifelong commitment to engaging in our democracy.\n\nWhy am I so confident? Because young people didn't simply turn out at the behest of their elders, political parties, or other existing institutions run by adults. Rather, they took the lead in changing the political landscape, building their own organizations, amplifying each others' voices, turning out their peers to vote, and sending our political leaders a powerful message: that hate, racism, and division are not our future, and that a government that looks like and represents the country we live in is.\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch students walk out of schools across US Replay More Videos ...

The stock has now plummeted more than 60% since the wildfires began the morning of November 8.\n\nThe death toll has risen to 56 people . More than 8,500 homes have been destroyed. And the fire is still not completely under control.\n\nThe cause of the fire has yet to be determined. But investors are clearly worried about the possible legal risks.\n\nPG&E disclosed in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it \"experienced an outage\" on a transmission line in Butte County at 6:15 a.m. on November 8 -- just 15 minutes before the Camp Fire broke out.\n\nPG&E added that if its equipment is found to be responsible for the fire, PG&E \"could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" and that this could have \"a material impact\" on its financial results.\n\nThe utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for an amount of approximately $1.4 billion that covers the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, the company said in the SEC filing\n\nBut the estimated damages are rising rapidly. Moody's said earlier this week that it could cost up to $6.8 billion, while Citigroup estimates the damages could be as high as $15 billion.\n\nPG&E may not have enough to cover this cost, let alone any legal fees or fines it might have to pay.\n\nThe utility's total market value is now below $10 billion, and PG&E said in its filing that it currently has just $3.46 billion in cash after borrowing from an existing revolving credit line.\n\nSo it could need another bailout from the state of California if it's found to be liable for the Camp Fire.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown signed a bill in September that lets PG&E issue bonds backed by surcharges from the utility's customers. Those bonds will help pay for damages tied to deadly California wildfires in October 2017 caused by faulty PG&E equipment.\n\nThe bill allows for the possibility that utilities could issue similar bonds for future fires, but that is not guaranteed.\n\nPG&E already faces one lawsuit related to the Camp Fire.

I had to make something up to make people feel bad.\"\n\nIn other texts, the couple discussed their inability to pay bills and their mounting debts.\n\nCoffina also pointed out that Bobbitt posted a \"remarkably similar\" story on his Facebook page in 2012.\n\nAt the time, he wrote that he had come across a woman who had run out of gas and had a flat tire at a Walmart in North Carolina. He said he had given her the last of his money.\n\n\"I don't think that's a coincidence,\" Coffina said.\n\nGoFundMe has committed to providing a full refund to the campaign's 14,000 donors, Coffina said.\n\nD'Amico and McClure surrendered Wednesday night and were released pending a court date, Coffina said. Bobbitt was also taken into custody in Philadelphia and is awaiting extradition. Second-degree crimes in New Jersey carry the potential of five to 10 years in jail, Coffina said.\n\nErnest Badway, an attorney for D'Amico and McClure, declined to comment.\n\nThe charges come months after Bobbitt sued McClure and D'Amico, accusing them of withholding the money raised on his behalf.\n\nAsked by a reporter if the trio would have gotten away with the deception had they not begun to fight over the money, Coffina replied, \"There's a good chance they might have.\"\n\nFrom left: Kate McClure, Mark D'Amico, and Johnny Bobbitt Jr.\n\n'Misuse' is rare on GoFundMe, spokesman says\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman for the crowdfunding site confirmed donors will receive a refund. GoFundMe is \"fully cooperating\" with law enforcement officials in the investigation.\n\n\"While this type of behavior by an individual is extremely rare, it's unacceptable and clearly it has consequences,\" said Bobby Whithorne, adding that misuse is rare on GoFundMe.\n\n\"Campaigns with misuse make up less than one-tenth of 1% of all campaigns,\" he said. \"We have a zero tolerance policy for fraudulent behavior.\"\n\nAccording to its website, the company has a Trust and Safety team that reviews GoFundMe campaigns around the clock and works to prevent fraud. It also guarantees a refund for donors in case \"something isn't right\" with a campaign, the site says.\n\nA viral story falls apart\n\nLast fall, social media was abuzz with the story of McClure and D'Amico's seeming act of kindness.\n\nMcClure and D'Amico began a GoFundMe campaign so they could \"do something special\" for Bobbitt, they said. The campaign quickly raised a total of $402,706.\n\nVideo showed the couple revealing the sum to an overjoyed Bobbitt, promising him they would get him settled in a new home. The money, Bobbitt said, would change his life.\n\nBut questions about the money soon followed.\n\nIn August, Bobbitt's lawyers sued the couple for fraud , claiming that the funds McClure and D'Amico raised were never used as promised.\n\nInstead of giving Bobbitt money for a house, the couple bought him a camper without his consent and kept him in it on their property with \"no access to money or food,\" his lawyers alleged. They said Bobbitt only saw $75,000 of the nearly $400,000 he was owed.\n\nThe money was put into the couple's personal accounts, his lawyers said.\n\nThe couple said they were being cautious about giving Bobbitt large sums of money until he had a job and was off drugs.\n\nBut with questions looming about how much -- if any -- of the money was left for Bobbitt, a judge ordered that the couple appear before the court for a deposition.\n\nThe next day, Florence Township police in New Jersey executed a search warrant in the couple's home. Police confirmed the warrant was related to Johnny Bobbitt Jr., but the couple was not charged with anything at the time."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Noelle Ike", "title": "Take better outdoor photographs with 35+ hours of pro instruction", "description": "Looking to learn how to take professional-grade outdoor photographs?

He's reportedly annoyed at how his trip to Paris went over the weekend, frustrated with the increasingly bad outcome for Republicans at the ballot box last week and itching to make changes in his senior staff.\n\nBunkered in, Trump turned to a friendly face -- the conservative news website Daily Caller, which he sat down with on Wednesday to talk about the state of his White House. I went through the transcript -- points to the Daily Caller for releasing it! -- and picked out the lines worth some more attention. They're below.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n1. \"I'm looking at things and I've got a lot of options.\"\n\nTrump on his Cabinet. Also, away we go!\n\n2. \"You know, you're talking about a few names, you're not talking about many.\"\n\nHere Trump is trying to downplay the amount of turnover at the Cabinet level in his administration. But as I detailed on Wednesday , he has lost as many Cabinet secretaries (nine) as President Barack Obama lost in his entire first term and more than double the number (four) President George W. Bush lost in his first four years.\n\n3. \"Uh, we've been doing incredibly on trade deals and trade with my whole staff of traders, because that's what they are.\"\n\n\"Staff of Traders\" would be a good name for a Jimmy Buffett band. Or the first novel in an epic series about the search for a long-lost staff known in ancient lore as the \"Staff of Traders.\"\n\n4. \"I knew him only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions.\"\n\n\"I can tell you Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker.\" -- Donald Trump, October 11, 2018\n\n5. \" It's an illegal investigation.\"\n\nThis is simply wrong. Trump continues to insist that a leaked memo, written by fired FBI Director James Comey and sent to the media at his behest, which is widely regarded as having triggered the special counsel investigation, contained classified information. Since leaking classified information is illegal, then this whole probe is illegal. Get it? ( I explain in MUCH greater detail here .) But here's the rub: Comey has testified -- under oath -- that the memo he asked his friend to leak contained zero classified information in it. So to believe Trump, you have to believe Comey is lying under oath -- which is a felony.\n\n6. \"And you know, it's very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, Mueller's not Senate confirmed.\"\n\nWhat Trump means is that Robert Mueller, the former FBI director appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, was not confirmed by the Senate to that role. Of course, Rosenstein, the man who picked Mueller, was Senate-confirmed. And Mueller has been confirmed not once but twice by the Senate; in 2001 when he was nominated to head the FBI by George W. Bush, and then again in 2011 . A total of zero senators voted against Mueller's confirmation in those votes. There is, on the other hand, a significant legal argument as to whether Whitaker, who is currently the acting attorney general, can hold that position without Senate confirmation as he oversees people, like Rosenstein, who have it.\n\n7. \"He's just a grandstander. He's just an average guy who's a grandstander. And he's got the guts to stand up and, you know, and shout.\"\n\nThis is Trump's take on my CNN colleague Jim Acosta. I don't agree with Trump on Acosta, obviously, But even if you do, the problem for Trump is that being a \"grandstander\" isn't cause to restrict Acosta's speech rights. You don't have to like the way Acosta asks questions to understand that the White House is not allowed to ban reporters from covering the White House and its taxpayer-funded employees because they don't like the questions a certain reporter asks.\n\n8. \"It's primarily led by CNN because they pay him to do that.\"\n\nCNN pays Acosta to ask tough and probing questions of the White House and the President. Which is what every news organization pays their White House reporters to do. Or at least it should be.\n\n9. \"Certainly, you shouldn't be able to go up into a White House and, on principle, it's very disrespectful to the rest of the press.\"\n\nAgain, simply not approving of Acosta's methods of question-asking is not grounds for the suspension of his ability to ask questions.\n\n10. \"He was very rude to the young lady. I won't, I won't even \u2014 who knows. Who knows.\"\n\nClassic Trump here. He seems to be insinuating that Acosta did something nefarious in regard to the female intern who was trying to take the mic from him. But he doesn't elaborate because truth isn't on his side. Watch the video . it's clear Acosta never, as the White House originally insisted, assaulted the intern or anything close to it.\n\n11. \"You guys are at my rallies all the time, you see the anger when I mention the words 'fake news' and they turn around.\"\n\nI wonder if all the peoples' anger directed toward the media and Trump's rallies has anything to do with him insisting reporters are the most dishonest and bad people he has ever met and then falsely accusing them of purposely making \"fake news?\" Just a theory.\n\n12. \"I actually have good approval ratings, which nobody ever writes.\"\n\nTrump's approval in Real Clear Politics' aggregate of polling is 43% . It's among the lowest for any president at this point in their first terms.\n\n13. \"You know, all my life I told this story, had stories on the front page. A few, not a big deal. Which wasn't bad, you know, maybe seven, but, you know, a few. And, you know, now if I have a few each day it's surprisingly low.\"\n\nSo, so revealing. As I have said and written many times, no one is more obsessed with the media or a bigger consumer of the media's product that Donald Trump. Always has been. Can you imagine any other president talking, out of the blue, about how many stories on the front page of a newspaper are about him -- or remembering how many were about him before he was president?\n\n14. \"I may be. I may be. I'll have to see how it plays out. But I may very well be willing to shut down the government.\"\n\nI am sure this will warm Mitch McConnell's heart to hear!\n\n15. \"They can do presidential harassment, put very simply, and I'll be very good at handling that and I think I'll be better than anybody in the history of this office.\"\n\nDonald Trump: Even the best at handling presidential harassment. Many people are saying it.\n\n16. \"Just like the witch hunt, the Mueller witch hunt. It's pure harassment.\"\n\n17. \"There's a great chance at comprehensive immigration reform\"\n\n18. \"Where I am now, when they have a small majority, I can sit back and say, 'Hey.'\"\n\nSame. \"Hey.\"\n\n19. \"This is a problem in California that's so bad of illegals voting. This is a California problem and if you notice, almost every race -- I was watching today -- out of like 11 races that are in question they're gonna win all of them.\"\n\nThere is zero evidence that the reason Democrats are winning House races in California has to do with \"illegals voting,\" as Trump alleges. If you really want to know why it takes a while to count all the votes cast last Tuesday, read Mark Z. Barabak's explainer\n\n20. \"The Republicans don't win and that's because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I've been saying for a long time. I have no doubt about it.\"\n\nHe may have no doubt about it but he also has no evidence that proves his claim of illegal votes being cast. Remember that Trump alleged that 3-5 million illegal votes had been cast in the 2016 election. He never provided any proof for that claim.\n\n21. \"Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It's really a disgrace what's going on.\"\n\nI know I sound like a broken record but, outside of Trump's anecdote that he knows people who have seen this happen, there's no evidence it happens in any widespread or even medium-spread manner.\n\n22. \"The disgrace is that, voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID.\"\n\n23. \"If you look at what happened in New Hampshire, where thousands of people came up and voted from a very liberal part of Massachusetts and they came up in buses and they voted. I said, 'what's going on over here,' my people said, 'you won New Hampshire easily except they have tremendous numbers of buses coming up.' \"\n\n24. \"I think they should've called Florida election evening.\"\n\nBut if they did that then not all of the votes would have been counted, much less recount ... ah, forget it.\n\n25. \"I mean, if there's anything really that I would be -- because, again, in the 2016 election, you guys remember, remember how long it took to get Florida?\"\n\nAccording to this terrific election night 2016 timeline from The Guardian , Florida was called for Trump at 10:53 p.m. -- less than three hours after the polls closed across the state. Not bad given that 9.1 million votes were cast in the presidential race in the state.\n\n26. \"And I won by, you know, I won by a lot of votes. I call it four Yankee Stadiums.\"\n\nThis is an intriguing new measurement that Trump is introducing. Yankee Stadium seats 54,251 people. So, in saying he won Florida in 2016 by four Yankee Stadiums, Trump is saying he won Florida by 217,004 votes. He actually won by 122,911 votes. Using this measure, Trump is alleging that somewhere between 55 Yankee Stadiums 92 Yankee Stadiums voted illegally in the 2016 election . Of course, he has zero actual evidence that any Yankee Stadiums voted illegally.\n\n27. \"I think I did very well.\"\n\nThis is Trump's answer to the question of how he think the election went. First off, notice the emphasis on \"I\" rather than on the Republican Party or the country. Telling. Second, there's very few objective measures where Trump can say he did \"very well.\" His party lost the House. They netted one -- and potentially two -- Senate seats in the best map for Republicans in modern memory . They lost six governorships and hundreds of state legislative seats. The 2018 election wasn't a tsunami for Democrats, but it was a wave.\n\n28. \"So we picked up three or four Senate seats depending on how it all goes -- it's a big pickup.\"\n\nNope. Senate Republicans have netted one Senate seat. If the Florida result holds, a nd I suspect it will , they will net two seats. That's it.\n\n29. \"But she didn't question strongly, so I'm not going to, but I think that was very odd the way that all happened in Arizona.\"\n\n30. \"In the history of politics nobody's ever gotten crowds like that or close because you were in those stadiums and those arenas, but outside you had many more times -- you know, in Houston we had 109,000 people sign up for 22,000 seats.\"\n\nIt's very difficult to substantiate these claims that Trump had the biggest crowds in the history of politics during the 2018 campaign. I will note, however, that more than 75,000 attended an Oregon rally for Barack Obama in 2008\n\n31. \"The truth is, every place I went, we either won or did well or did really well.\"\n\nBroadly true! No question that Trump helped GOP candidates in Florida, Missouri in Indiana win Senate seats.\n\n32. \"If I didn't do those stops, I think we would've lost 10 Senate seats, seven to 10 Senate seats.\"\n\nMathematically impossible, since Republicans were only defending nine Senate seats in 2018. Also, of the nine, only one was in a state Trump lost in 2016. And a Democrat won that one -- beating Republican Sen. Dean Heller.\n\n33. \"Nobody has ever had a greater impact.\"\n\nIn which the President claims that no one -- I assume he means no politician or president -- has ever had a greater positive impact on a midterm election. This is somewhat in the eye of the beholder but, just in the recent past, I would suggest George W. Bush's handling of the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks had more of a positive effect on the GOP's wins in 2002 than what Trump did in 2018.\n\n34. \"It was 70 to 30, something like that, 70-30 or 70-40, maybe 70-40. But it was an easy win.\"\n\nTrump is talking about Brian Kemp's victory in the Georgia governor's primary. Also, elections are based on 100%. So Kemp definitely didn't win 70-40.\n\n35. \"There's never been an impact -- I don't say it braggingly. I mean, it's hard for me to say it because I'd rather have them say it but they don't say it very well. No, there's never been a story, nobody ever writes it.\"\n\nHe doesn't say it braggingly, you see.\n\n36. \"Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.\"\n\nThis feels like the right place to end."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Christina Maxouris, CNN", "title": "Total Recall: The CNN news quiz", "description": null, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/world/cnn-news-quiz-111618/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150202094508-01-cnn-newsroom-file-super-169.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:30:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

May seems to be the only person in Westminster who understands the Brexit reality: a deal doesn't exist that satisfies everyone in the UK and everyone in Brussels.\n\nDespite hearing MP after MP tell her in the House of Commons on Thursday that they were ready to vote against her proposed deal with Brussels and losing a number of government ministers, the Prime Minister said in a news conference that she is still taking the deal to Parliament.\n\nSome would call it brave; others would call it lunacy. But May is going to face down her most vocal critics in the most public, damning way imaginable.\n\nBriefly, back to the deal. The sticking point -- what happens on the island of Ireland -- seems to come down to essentially one question: is it more important for the UK to have an independent trading policy or to have a hard border between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which will remain a part of the UK? Everything else -- laws, borders, even money -- hangs on this question being answered.\n\nFor the record, it's worth pointing out that a hard border is something the EU and the Republic of Ireland absolutely will not tolerate.\n\nAnd it's pretty clear now that having both is not possible.\n\nMay's deal with the EU, her supporters would tell you, gets as close to both options as is ever going to be possible. Still, it's not enough for large sections of the UK parliament, who will have a say on the deal when May has it signed off in Brussels.\n\nJUST WATCHED British PM Theresa May strikes Brexit deal with cabinet Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH British PM Theresa May strikes Brexit deal with cabinet 01:25\n\nFrom Scottish nationalists to Northern Irish unionists to countryside Brexiteers, this is a deal that doesn't address their foremost concerns. These concerns vary from shaking the shackles of EU law and regulation to maintaining access to the EU's single market. Some even want to chuck the whole thing and rejoin the EU.\n\nSo why on earth would the Prime Minister take the vote to the Commons knowing there's a real chance she could lose? Why is she not changing course and going back to Brussels to try for more concessions?\n\nMay has a habit of hanging on and proving us all wrong. Ever since she lost her majority in Parliament in last year's election, her leadership has been in constant question. But on she goes.\n\nIt could be brinksmanship. It could be confidence. It could even be a direct challenge to her own party: back me or push me.\n\nAll day, we have heard rumors of her MPs submitting letters of no confidence in her leadership, a process that could lead to a vote that could dislodge her as Prime Minister.\n\nOr not. There is still the very real possibility that she could win such a vote and strengthen her position among her own MPs. But even at that point, the arithmetic of Parliament would remain something of a mystery.\n\nAnd it's a mystery that needs solving very soon. Businesses, investors, employers and diplomatic allies want clarity.\n\nAnd until that mystery is solved, the real costs will stack up. The pound will continue to be volatile, jobs will continue to be put at risk and economists will continue to tear their hair out.\n\nBut this isn't about economics; it's about the mayhem in a country whose politics have barely functioned in 2018."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Chris Isidore, CNN Business", "title": "Sears gets a little more time to stay in business", "description": "Sears has won some more time to save itself.

That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation,\" Zwingli said.\n\nRepresentatives from American, United and Southwest airlines each said Friday that Boeing did not include information in its flight crew manual that explained the functions of new features found on the aircraft.\n\nBecause that information was not spelled out with specificity, the airlines said, their pilots were not clear on all of the functionality of a key system in the aircraft.\n\nThe airlines say Boeing has now communicated what the new features are and how they work, and pilots are aware of them as well. American and United airlines said the revelation of new information will not require additional pilot training.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether a sensor on the outside of the plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the stall-prevention system.\n\nThe airline's claims come after Boeing was similarly accused Tuesday by the Allied Pilots Association (APA), a labor union that represents American Airlines pilots, of withholding information about the potential danger of the plane's new features. On Thursday, American Airlines backed up their pilots' claims.\n\nLion Air Flight 610 crashed shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on October 29. Investigators believe the Max 8 plane may have experienced problems with several sensors.\n\nBoeing said last week that a safety bulletin issued to aircraft operators in the wake of the crash was merely meant to reinforce existing procedures. Both Lion Air and the APA reject the company's assertion.\n\n\"They (Boeing) didn't provide us all the info we rely on when we fly an aircraft,\" Capt. Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the APA group, told CNN on Tuesday. \"The bulletin is not reaffirming, it's enlightening and adding new info.\"\n\nZwingli added that Boeing's safety bulletin did not suggest additional training for pilots operating that aircraft. \"We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots,\" he said.\n\nZwingli said that if the result of the ongoing investigation -- conducted by Indonesia's National Transportation Commission, the US National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing -- found that additional training was necessary, Lion Air pilots would undertake it.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the company could not \"discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation\" and that the company had \"provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe head of the Directorate of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations (DOAAO) at the Indonesian Transportation Ministry told CNN on Wednesday that the agency was in the process of intensive discussions about additional training for the pilots who fly the Max 8 planes, but did not elaborate on what any additional training would involve.\n\nOn Tuesday, the APA said while there were no immediate safety concerns about the Max 8 planes, \"the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Ex-UK official: There's no ideal Brexit", "description": "Former head of the U.K. Foreign Office Sir Simon Fraser discusses the latest twists in Britain's Brexit saga.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/15/amanpour-simon-fraser-brexit.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115124357-theresa-may-defends-brexit-press-conference-sot-vpx-00000000-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:02:33Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

College professors turned the school's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences into a \"21st Century Animal House,\" where female students were subjected to rape and sexual harassment, a federal lawsuit alleges.\n\nTenured professors Todd Heatherton, William Kelley, and Paul Whalen treated women as sex objects, the lawsuit from seven women claims. The men, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced them into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to go along with the \"alcohol-saturated\" culture the prominent researchers created, according to the complaint.\n\nKelley and Whalen have not responded to CNN's requests for comment. In a statement through his lawyer, Heatherton categorically denied \"playing any role in creating a toxic environment at Dartmouth College,\" and said he was disturbed by the allegations. None of the plaintiffs were his graduate students, the statement adds.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Thursday, comes as US universities continue to grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\n\nThe US Department of Education in 2017 withdrew Obama administration guidance on how schools should handle sexual assault claims under Title IX, citing concerns that it denied due process rights to the accused. New guidance is expected soon.\n\nThe women are suing Dartmouth's trustees for $70 million in damages, based on allegations the Ivy League school breached its duty to protect them from sexual harassment. The suit also accuses the New Hampshire institution of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\n\n\"The seven Plaintiffs, each an exemplary female scientist at the start of her career, came to Dartmouth to contribute to a crucial and burgeoning field of academic study. Plaintiffs were instead sexually harassed and sexually assaulted by the Department's tenured professors and expected to tolerate increasing levels of sexual predation,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nAs many as 40 current and former female students may be eligible to join the class-action suit, plaintiffs' attorneys told CNN. Three of the women are still at Dartmouth, the suit states.\n\n'Inclusive campus for all members'\n\nThe 72-page complaint offers the first graphic insights into allegations that first emerged publicly about a year ago with a report in The Dartmouth student newspaper . They range from one professor forcing a female student to have sex with him against her will to another professor sending a female student an unwanted photo of his erect penis, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe suit alleges that women felt pressure to participate in a \"predatory boys club\" -- or risk their careers, because the men controlled resources in their labs.\n\nNew Hampshire Attorney General Gordon MacDonald in October 2017 announced a joint law enforcement investigation into the claims. The investigation is \"active and ongoing,\" a spokesperson for the office said.\n\nSchool officials also launched an inquiry that culminated in the resignations of Whalen and Kelley in June and July, the school said. Heatherton was on sabbatical leave during the investigation and chose to retire in June.\n\n\"Sexual misconduct and harassment have no place at Dartmouth,\" the school said in a statement to CNN. \"Dartmouth's board of trustees and senior leadership team are dedicated to maintaining a safe and inclusive campus for all members of our community and we remain committed to improving our culture as we work to make our community the best it can be.\"\n\nHeatherton last year addressed the claims, telling Slate he did his \"best not to socialize with graduate students outside of the work setting, as the mentoring relationship should remain professional.\" The statement to CNN on Thursday said Heatherton was \"extremely concerned about being grouped together with the other professors\" and pointed out that the lawsuit's allegations predominantly involved Kelley and Whalen.\n\n\"He had no knowledge of the specific allegations that were made about them. He did not engage in the general patterns of conduct they are accused of,\" the statement says. \"While at Dartmouth, Professor Heatherton did his best to support and promote the careers of all graduate students.\"\n\n16 years of inaction, plaintiffs claim\n\nThe plaintiffs claim Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing. Then in 2017, at least 27 people came forward in connection with formal claims of alleged sexual assault and sexual harassment by the three men.\n\nUnnamed female graduate students, including all the women now suing Dartmouth, reported the claims to the college's Title IX office or attested to them, according to the suit and plaintiffs' lawyers.\n\nDuring the Title IX investigation, Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then \"unilaterally terminated\" the disciplinary process, letting Heatherton retire and Kelley and Whalen resign, without seeking their input, the lawsuit claims.\n\nIn its statement, school officials said: \"We applaud the courage displayed by members of our community within the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (PBS) who brought the misconduct allegations to Dartmouth's attention last year. And we remain open to a fair resolution of the students' claims through an alternative to the court process.\n\n\"However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings,\" they said.\n\n'Mandatory fun' events alleged\n\nThe plaintiffs were mostly graduate students in a department known for its strong reputation and its professors' credentials, the suit states.\n\nWhat the women found, according to the lawsuit, was a sexually hostile environment where the professors tied female students' success to their \"willingness to tolerate unwanted sexual attention\" and engage in frequent drinking binges.\n\nSome plaintiffs described the consequences of resisting the professors' unwanted behavior. Plaintiff Annemarie Brown says she felt pressured to attend what Whalen called \"mandatory fun\" events, such as pajama parties and \"boozy lunches\" on workdays. When she refused, Whalen called her a \"goody two shoes\" and then began ignoring her academically, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe professors \"prided\" themselves on having attractive women in their labs, the lawsuit claims. Kelley and Whalen openly debated who had \"the hottest lab,\" and the three men routinely objectified women and commented on their appearances, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPlaintiff Sasha Brietzke said Kelley treated her like a \"doll\" and often commented on the size of her breasts and complimented her makeup. He urged her to date his male friends \"whom he instructed to flirt with Ms. Brietzke and give her hugs even after she expressed disinterest,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nHeatherton denied that the professors tended to hire attractive research assistants. Hiring for his lab was conducted by his female lab manager, the statement said. \"Research assistants were both men and women who were selected based on their interests and skills, not on their physical appearance.\"\n\nHe also denied regularly socializing with graduate students or attending any of the parties mentioned in the lawsuit. Lab meetings with students did not involve alcohol, the statement says.\n\nAs for an allegation in the complaint that he described, in a lab meeting, smiles from women as \"socially rewarding,\" he said his words were misconstrued. He was in fact describing the Ph.D. thesis work of a male student \"who found that smiles from people directed toward others activated brain regions involved in reward,\" the statement says.\n\n\"I don't appreciate how my description of research findings that were gender-neutral has been spun to imply hostile intent. It's just not true.\"\n\n'Severe depressive episodes and a suicide attempt'\n\nKelley sent plaintiff Marissa Evans electronic messages of his naked body, including his erect penis, and pictures of himself engaged in sexual encounters with others, the lawsuit says. He regularly hosted \"hot tub parties\" at his house, which he dubbed \"tubby time,\" late at night after drinking at bars, according to the lawsuit.\n\nEvans grew fearful that Kelley would force her to have sex with him after he stated his intention to do so, the lawsuit says. She \"was driven to severe depressive episodes and a suicide attempt,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Ms. Evans's experiences at Dartmouth have had a lasting effect on her professional career and mental health. Ms. Evans will only work in research labs run by women because of her deep distrust of male employers. She was forced to withdraw from her first semester in a postbaccalaureate premedical program due to mental health reasons resulting from her time at Dartmouth,\" the lawsuit says.\n\n'She is plagued with doubts about her future'\n\nThe unwanted behavior allegedly continued after some of the plaintiffs reported it to college officials in April 2017. Weeks later, plaintiff Vassiki Chauhan says Whalen raped her, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe assault occurred in Whalen's home after he pressured her to drink throughout the night, the lawsuit says. It goes on the say she strongly rejected his advances and tried to flee but he prevented her from leaving. He forced himself on her and when she asked him to use protection he refused, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAfter she was sexually assaulted, she sought professional counseling services at Dartmouth's health center and shared intimate thoughts about the assault, the lawsuit said. During the Title IX inquiry, Chauhan provided her records to the school's investigator. According to the lawsuit, she was appalled to learn later from the Title IX report that the investigator showed her counseling records to Whalen and his attorneys without her consent.\n\n\"Ms. Chauhan feels so betrayed by that action that she cannot trust therapists enough to seek the treatment she knows she needs,\" the lawsuit claims. \"She is plagued with doubts about her future prospects in academia and has lost her optimism for her well-being in personal relationships.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ryan Browne, CNN", "title": "US to reduce number of troops in Africa", "description": "The Pentagon has approved a long-awaited plan to reduce the number of US troops conducting counterterrorism missions in Africa over the next three years, three US officials tell CNN.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/us-reduce-troops-africa/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180601183550-us-cameroonian-troops-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:35:17Z", "content": "Washington (CNN) The Pentagon has approved a long-awaited plan to reduce the number of US troops conducting counterterrorism missions in Africa over the next three years, three US officials tell CNN.

It also provided temporary refuge considering that Haiti had suffered one of the deadliest earthquakes in history, and the country was seen as too unstable for people to return.\n\nThe program has since been repeatedly renewed. But in 2017, Department of Homeland Security officials said conditions in Haiti were improving since the earthquake and that the program should be terminated.\n\nJUST WATCHED Olympic Stadium is shelter for asylum seekers Replay More Videos ...

The bank's shares earlier this week had their worst day since November 2011, falling more than 7% Monday and failing to recover since. The reason, according to analyst Brian Kleinhanzl at KBW: Goldman's ongoing exposure to the scandal surrounding Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad.\n\nThe US Justice Department claims conspirators misappropriated $4.5 billion from the 1MDB fund, and the government has scrutinized Goldman's role in the scheme. Almost half of the money that Goldman Sachs ( GS ) helped 1MDB raise through bond offerings was allegedly siphoned off to pay for jewelry and fine art, and to fund bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials.\n\nThe bank, which has reportedly been meeting with Justice Department officials, maintains that rogue employees misled its legal and compliance teams about the deals. Two former Goldman Sachs bankers who managed the 1MDB relationship have been charged for their involvement in the conspiracy.\n\nBut the \"bad eggs\" approach might not be enough to keep the bank out of legal trouble.\n\nGoldman could face large fines or have to forfeit the money it made on the bond deals. The bank could even be indicted. In theory, its banking charter could be revoked \u2014 though the government almost certainly won't go that far, said Stefan Cassella, a former US prosecutor who specializes in asset forfeiture and money laundering.\n\n\"Usually, what happens is the middle ground between doing nothing and a criminal indictment,\" he said.\n\nHow Goldman got caught up in the 1MDB saga\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Goldman Sachs arranged three large bond offerings for the 1MDB fund. The bond sales, which raised a total of $6.5 billion, earned Goldman Sachs about $600 million in fees, according to court documents.\n\nBut more than $2.7 billion of the proceeds from those offerings was stolen from 1MDB, according to the Justice Department. That raises questions about who at the firm knew about the questionable integrity of the deals, and when they knew it.\n\nAt the center of the saga is Tim Leissner, Goldman's former chairman of Southeast Asia. Earlier this month, the Justice Department announced that he had pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act through the payment of bribes to government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe government also filed charges against another ex-Goldman banker, Roger Ng, and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier who US officials say was behind much of the embezzlement plot. Ng was arrested in Malaysia and Low remains at large. CNN has been unable to reach Ng for comment. A spokesperson for Low said that Low maintains his innocence, and \"simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case.\"\n\nCharging documents paint a stark picture of Leissner, the lead banker at Goldman in charge of the 1MDB relationship, and Ng, a managing director at the firm.\n\nLeissner and Ng, who started to work with Low in 2009, are said to have repeatedly concealed Low's involvement in deals with 1MDB and its predecessor, Terengganu Investment Authority, from the bank's legal and compliance teams so that deals with the entities would be approved.\n\nThey allegedly supported at least three attempts between 2009 and 2011 to make Low a formal client of Goldman Sachs, believing he would help land the firm lucrative deals. Each time, people in Goldman's compliance department raised concerns, since the source of Low's wealth was murky at best.\n\nStill, Leissner and Ng allegedly worked with Low to secure 1MDB business for Goldman. The bank was selected to underwrite the three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013. Leissner and Ng allegedly scored the deals with Low by facilitating millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks, according to court documents. They allegedly hid from the bank's legal team the fact that Low was involved, and kept some of the stolen money for themselves.\n\nLeissner left Goldman Sachs in 2016 after it was discovered that he wrote an unsanctioned letter of recommendation for Low. Ng left in 2014.\n\nWhat's next for the bank\n\nGoldman's corporate liability depends on whether the Justice Department believes the firm had adequate legal and compliance controls in place to catch this type of behavior, and whether Goldman executives were in fact duped, or if they had some knowledge of impropriety, legal experts say.\n\nLeissner, in his guilty plea from August unsealed earlier this month, said it was \"very much in line of its culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees.\"\n\nGovernment prosecutors made similar claims in their charging documents. The business culture at Goldman \"was highly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper orientation of its compliance functions,\" especially in Southeast Asia, according to the indictment of Low and Ng.\n\nLanguage in these documents leaves open the possibility that the Justice Department could indict Goldman Sachs, said Cassella.\n\n\"The government took pains to allege that the individual defendants, who were Goldman employees, were acting within the scope of their employment and for the purpose of benefiting the corporation,\" he said.\n\nSuch a move would be rare, however \u2014 especially since Goldman is working with authorities, supplying documents and other material. This could mitigate penalties, Cassella added.\n\nStill, the firm appears to be preparing for a hefty fine. Goldman Sachs said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that investigations by the Justice Department and other authorities \"could result in the imposition of significant fines, penalties and other sanctions against the firm.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Justice Department charged JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, which requires financial companies to help the federal government detect money laundering, for its ties to Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Prosecutors said the bank failed to appropriately flag suspicious activity from Madoff's accounts, and required JPMorgan to pay $1.7 billion to victims of his fraud.\n\nA spokesperson for Goldman said the firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating the matter."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Maegan Vazquez, CNN", "title": "Why is Trump talking about cereal and voter ID?", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again tried to make a case for voter ID laws by using a grocery store analogy, inexplicably claiming shoppers need to show identification to buy cereal.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/cereal-voter-id-donald-trump/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181011114942-donald-trump-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:27:10Z", "content": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again tried to make a case for voter ID laws by using a grocery store analogy, inexplicably claiming shoppers need to show identification to buy cereal. \"The disgrace is that, voter ID.

If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID,\" Trump told the conservative news website The Daily Caller\n\nThe President appeared to be referencing an earlier argument he'd made this summer -- that because photo identification is required for something as basic as purchasing groceries with a check or credit card, it should also be required in order to vote.\n\nHowever, if you're purchasing cereal in the United States, there's no universal requirement for showing your ID at the cash register. The White House did not respond to CNN's request for clarification on the President's Wednesday remarks.\n\nPhoto ID is required when purchasing alcohol, cigarettes, some medicines, and occasionally when verifying purchases made with a credit card or, decreasingly, with a check. In a small number of states, identification photos are included on food stamp cards for low income families, and several chains, such as Costco, may require identification when applying for membership.\n\nThe President said in August: \"You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID. You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture.\"\n\n\"The only time you don't need it in many cases is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman. It's crazy,\" he said at the time.\n\nFollowing Trump's August comments, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump was referring to liquor purchases.\n\n\"If you go to a grocery store and you buy beer or wine, you're certainly going to show your ID,\" Sanders said. \"He's not saying every time he went in. He said, 'When you go to the grocery store.' I'm pretty sure that everybody in here who's been to a grocery store that's purchased beer or wine has probably had to show their ID. If they didn't, then that's probably a problem with the grocery store.\"\n\nTrump has used other false examples to bolster his argument in favor of voter ID laws.\n\n\"The Republicans don't win and that's because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I've been saying for a long time,\" Trump said in the Daily Caller interview Wednesday. \"I have no doubt about it. And I've seen it, I've had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It's really a disgrace what's going on.\"\n\nHowever, there is well-established evidence that voter fraud is extremely rare , and the President did not provide evidence for the type of voter fraud he referenced.\n\nFor example, stealing someone's identity to vote is less likely than being struck by lightning, as the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law put it."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0648\u063a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629

Trump administration are awaiting an initial ruling on the network's federal lawsuit over press access to the White House . And they're going to have to wait a little while longer.\n\nJudge Timothy J. Kelly heard nearly two hours of oral arguments about CNN's request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on Wednesday. Then he said court would reconvene Thursday at 3 p.m.\n\nBut on Thursday afternoon, he rescheduled the next hearing for Friday at 10 a.m.\n\nIf Kelly grants CNN's requests on Friday, CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta would get his press pass back for a short period of time. If it's denied, Acosta's pass will remain suspended.\n\nEither way, this is just round one. By filing for a temporary restraining order, CNN is seeking what's known as \"emergency relief.\" CNN is arguing that Acosta's First Amendment rights are being violated every day he is banned from White House grounds.\n\nCNN is also asking for \"permanent relief,\" meaning a declaration from the judge that President Trump's revocation of Acosta's press pass was unconstitutional. This legal conclusion could protect other reporters from retaliation by the administration.\n\nBut the judge will not be ruling on that yet. Kelly is only expected to weigh in on the temporary status of Acosta's press pass.\n\nFurther hearings are likely to take place in the next few weeks, according to CNN's lawyers.\n\nThe White House took the unprecedented step of suspending Acosta's access after he had a combative exchange with Trump at last week's post-midterms press conference. CNN sought a resolution for several days before filing suit on Tuesday.\n\nThe case was assigned to Kelly, a Trump appointee who has been on the federal bench just more than a year now. He was very inquisitive at Wednesday's hearing, asking tough questions of both sides, drilling particularly deep into some of CNN's arguments.\n\nAttorney Theodore Boutrous, representing CNN in court, called Trump's move to revoke Acosta's hard pass \"the definition of arbitrariness and capriciousness.\"\n\n\"What are the standards?\" Boutrous asked. \"Rudeness is not a standard. If it were, no one could have gone to the press conference.\"\n\nBoutrous also commented that Trump is \"the most aggressive, dare I say rude, person in the room\" at press conferences.\n\nAfter Boutrous spoke, Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that the Trump White House has the legal right to kick out any reporter at any time for any reason.\n\nBurnham, who's been tasked with defending Trump, was responding to a hypothetical from Kelly. Burnham said that it would be perfectly legal for the White House to revoke a journalist's press pass if it didn't agree with their reporting. \"As a matter of law... yes,\" he said.\n\nBurnham's comment in court made the stakes of CNN v. Trump crystal clear.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House Correspondents' Association asked to file an amicus brief backing up CNN's suit. In the brief , lawyers for the association -- which represents the White House press corps -- write that the administration's stance is \"wrong\" and \"dangerous.\"\n\n\"Simply stated, if the President were to have the absolute discretion to strip a correspondent of a hard pass, the chilling effect would be severe and the First Amendment protections afforded journalists to gather and report news on the activities on the President would be largely eviscerated,\" the association says in the brief."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Aanu Adeoye, for CNN", "title": "Malawi nurse suspended over selfie in labor ward", "description": "A nurse in Malawi has been suspended after her selfie in a labor ward showing a naked pregnant woman in the background surfaced online.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/africa/malawi-selfie-nurse-suspended-africa-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120511050402-sierra-leone-maternal-mortality-story-top.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:17:44Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) A nurse in Malawi has been suspended after her selfie in a labor ward showing a naked pregnant woman in the background surfaced online.\n\nPatricia Malichi's selfie, which has an unidentified pregnant woman lying on a hospital bed at Ndirande Health Centre in Blantyre city, provoked public anger on social media with many Malawians calling for her dismissal.\n\nMalawi's Ministry of Health spokesman Joshua Malango told CNN the midwifery council and the district health authorities were handling the case.\n\nThe health ministry is also investigating whether the photo was leaked or posted by the midwife.\n\n\"We don't want to judge her, and that's why we're working with the council for a fair trial and a clear investigation of the matter, and for them to come up with a recommendation,\" Malango told CNN.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN", "title": "Postal Service reports $3.9 billion in losses for fiscal year 2018", "description": "The US Postal Service reported a loss of $3.9 billion for fiscal year 2018, despite growth in its shipping and packaging business.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/politics/postal-service-losses-fiscal-year-2018/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181010155303-usps-postage-stamps-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:11:09Z", "content": "Washington (CNN Politics) The US Postal Service reported a loss of $3.9 billion for fiscal year 2018, despite growth in its shipping and packaging business.

Credit: JACK TAYLOR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAbrahams noted that while the statues took his breath away, he was focused on unveiling \"anatomical, scientific accuracy.\"\n\n\"Being an observant person, both as a doctor and a scientist, I noticed that the toes on the bronzes were a bit off,\" the Daily Telegraph reported him as saying.\n\n\"I then went and had a look at all the toes that I could find anywhere in Michelangelo's oeuvre. Out of 40 toes, all except for two fitted this brief: they had a short big toe and a long second toe, and the big toe goes outwards -- it looks like someone is wearing a flip-flop in between the toes.\"\n\nHe noted that the same toes can be seen on David and Moses in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, and added that other characteristics \"shine through\" in his work, including distinctive torsos and anatomically accurate pubic hair.\n\nMoment Da Vinci painting sold for $450 million\n\n\"We all know a six-pack, but these guys actually have an eight-pack. I found two statues and five Michelangelo drawings that have that same, rare anomaly, which tells me that the model he used for those was the same model he used for these bronzes,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed to highly distinctive pubic hair that goes \"up towards the umbilicus\" in Michelangelo's work, in contrast with the majority of classical and Renaissance sculptures, where pubic hair goes \"down towards the genitalia.\"\n\nAbrahams' conclusions were echoed by Victoria Avery, Keeper of Applied Arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum, who said the sculptures were the \"real thing.\"\n\n\"We believe these to be made by Michelangelo.

Mueller's team says the company was involved in a well-funded \"troll farm\" that pumped out political propaganda to millions of Americans throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIt was the second time that Friedrich, a Trump appointee, sided with Mueller and let the case proceed. Earlier this year , she rebuffed Concord's arguments that there were constitutional problems with Mueller's appointment and authority. Thursday's ruling centered more on the merits of the indictment.\n\nConcord was charged with conspiring to defraud the US government by hiding its election-related activities and failing to register as a foreign agent trying to influence the US political process. The company wasn't charged with violating these laws, a point Concord made in its arguments.\n\nBut in upholding the indictment, Friedrich wrote that \"the key question\" was not whether Concord violated the underlying US laws that regulate foreign agents and political spending. Instead, she said the threshold to indict Concord on the conspiracy charge was whether the company's actions were \"deceptive and intended to frustrate the lawful government functions\" of the relevant agencies.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN Business", "title": "Bid to shake up Campbell Soup gets a boost", "description": "The activist investor trying to shake up Campbell Soup just got two important advocates on his side.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/business/campbell-soup-proxy-fight-iss/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180801092643-02-campbells-earnings-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:30:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New York (CNN Business) The activist investor trying to shake up Campbell Soup just got two important advocates on his side.\n\nDaniel Loeb, a billionaire who has a history of taking stakes in major companies and demanding change, has targeted the soup maker in his latest attempt to upend management at a major company.\n\nHis hedge fund, Third Point, owns 7% of Campbell, and Loeb has been trying to rally support from other Campbell's shareholders to change the company's leadership and install new directors.\n\nProxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Service, or ISS, lent support to Loeb's hedge fund late Wednesday, saying that shareholders should vote for all five of Third Point's board nominees.\n\nGlass Lewis, another important proxy adviser, lent support to three of the five.\n\nSupport from proxy advisory firms, third parties that advise investors on which side is best positioned to increase shareholder value, will likely help sway some investors in Third Point's favor. But it's still an uphill battle for Loeb's side.\n\nThird Point started off by trying to replace the entire board, and argued that Campbell's leaders should sell the company.\n\nIt has softened its stance since then, and offered a plan to improve the health of the company and nominated fewer board members. Campbell has held firm in its belief that it knows what's best for the struggling company.\n\nAbout 41% of the company is controlled by descendants of the founding family, who have vowed to support the current leaders. Third Point and its supporters hold only about 10%.That means odds are against Third Point, which is making its case ahead of a shareholder vote during the company's annual investor meeting on November 29.\n\n\"Winning ISS approval is a big step for Mr. Loeb,\" said Charles Elson, director of the center for corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \"That being said, he still has to overcome the hurdle\" of the family controlled shares.\n\nISS said that Campbell has lagged its peers in recent years, that it has failed to correctly manage its acquisitions and that the current leadership, while acknowledging the company's shortcomings, has been too slow to make changes.\n\n\"The dissident has presented a compelling case that change at the board level is warranted,\" ISS said, adding that the nominees chosen by Third Point seem \"well qualified to contribute to the company's turnaround.\"\n\nCampbell said they \"strongly disagree,\" with the recommendation, maintaining that the company's leadership \"combines the necessary skills ... needed to provide the proper oversight and strategic guidance on a variety of diverse consumer and business needs.\"\n\nAnother important proxy adviser, Glass Lewis, called out the lack of marketing and operating experience among members of Campbell's current board.\n\n\"We remain concerned that Campbell's boardroom suffers not from having too many, but the wrong, cooks in the kitchen,\" Glass Lewis said on Thursday.\n\nThe firm recommended Kurt Schmidt, former Gerber CEO and William Toler, a former CEO of Hostess who worked at Campbell Soup for many years. It also recommended Sarah Hofstetter, who worked on Oreo and Oscar Mayer ad campaigns.\n\nCampbell said it \"largely agrees with the thoughtful views outlined by Glass Lewis.\"\n\nThe company said recently that it offered to add Hofstetter and Schmidt to its board after the upcoming annual shareholder meeting, but that Third Point rejected the offer.\n\nIt doesn't want Toler on the board. Campbell said Thursday that \"we are very familiar with him due to his period of employment with the company and concluded that he would not be an appropriate director.\"\n\nThird Point celebrated the recommendations from both advisory firms.\n\n\"ISS and Glass Lewis sent a powerful message to Campbell shareholders that the time has come for significant change,\" the hedge fund said on Thursday.\n\nSupport from the advisers gives Third Point a much-needed boost, said Kai Liekefett, a partner at the law firm Sidley Austin.\n\n\"I think they have a small chance of winning anywhere between one and three seats,\" he said. But \"they need to pitch a perfect game to get there.\"\n\nAnd though ISS and Glass Lewis are influential, they are unlikely to sway the company's major institutional shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, which control about 13% altogether.\n\n\"They make their own decisions,\" Liekefett noted. And they tend to give corporate leaders \"the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nCampbell is scheduled to report earnings next week."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title":

Northern Ireland will receive access to abortion services in the Republic of Ireland as of next year, Irish Health Minister Simon Harris announced Thursday morning.\n\nHarris told Irish broadcaster RTE that it is a \"matter of great regret\" that women and girls in Northern Ireland are not currently able to access critical abortion services in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHe added that it was \"appropriate and important\" that these women should be able to access these services rather than being forced to travel to other parts of the UK.\n\nWomen in Northern Ireland have previously been unable to travel to the Republic of Ireland for abortions, because the Republic's ban on the practice was only revoked in its landslide referendum in May, with legislation currently passing through parliament. Harris pledged to work toward passing the legislation ahead of parliament's Christmas vacation, with the intention of implementing services as early as January.\n\nAbortions in Northern Ireland are currently illegal in all cases except when women's physical or mental health is in serious risk.\n\nHis statements came ahead of his meeting with pro-choice activists in Northern Ireland Thursday afternoon, and were welcomed by abortion campaigners.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639 \u0623\u0631\u0628\u0627\u062d

Investors recognize that it's not going to last forever.\"\n\nJust one in three investors surveyed said the bull market will last three or more years.\n\nDemocrats tilted more bearish, but only slightly so. One in four say the end is near, compared with 17% of Republican investors. And 53% of Democrats said market volatility will increase as a result of the US midterm elections, compared with 43% of Republicans.\n\nThe E*Trade survey included 900 active voting investors who manage at least $10,000 in an online brokerage account.\n\nS&P 500 has quadrupled\n\nOf course, calling the demise of the bull market has been a bad bet in the past.\n\nDespite the recent uptick in volatility, the S&P 500 has quadrupled since the bear market low in March 2009. The bull has survived countless scares, including the 2011 European debt crisis and debt ceiling stalemate and the early 2016 growth scare. It's now the longest bull market in American history.\n\nAnd the US economy is enjoying strong growth, especially relative to recent slowdowns overseas . If that continues, the bull market could live on for years.\n\n1 in 3 say stocks have already peaked\n\nBut it's not just investors surveyed by E*Trade growing more cautious.\n\nThe Office of Financial Research, an arm of the Treasury Department, warned in its annual report issued to Congress on Thursday that \"market risks remain high\" and there are more risks to the macroeconomic outlook than last year.\n\nWhile overall financial stability risks are moderate, the OFR report said that \"stock prices are historically high.\"\n\nForty-four percent of global fund managers surveyed in November by Bank of America Merrill Lynch say economic growth will decelerate in the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade. And one in three investors think US stocks have already peaked, double the amount who said that in October.\n\nSlowdown fears have already dented the US stock market. The S&P 500 is trading about 9% lower than its record high in September.\n\nRecession in 2020?\n\nFew investors are bracing for an imminent recession, the likely trigger for a new bear market. Yet there is growing concern about whether the economic expansion can endure beyond next year.\n\nSome investors are pointing to the recent downturns in crude oil as well as autos and housing as early warnings of potential trouble ahead.\n\nE*Trade urged investors to recognize how much risk they have in their portfolios. If the recent market volatility is too painful to stomach, investors can pare their exposure to stocks.\n\n\"We're always preparing for the Russian winter, and that holds more today than it ever would,\" Loewengart said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eric Levenson, CNN", "title": "Many Camp Fire victims didn't get emergency alerts.

When she heard the trees blow up and saw the huge pieces of ash, she knew it was time to get out.\n\nChatfield hopped in her car and drove through fire and smoke to safety, a harrowing journey that she filmed from the driver's seat\n\n\"Heavenly Father, please help us. Please help us to be safe,\" she pleaded in the video.\n\nThough she managed to escape, she never did receive an emergency alert to her phone telling her to watch out for the oncoming fire.\n\nBrad Weldon, also from Paradise, did get a phone alert. But he said it came as he was already fighting off the flames surrounding his home.\n\nTheir experiences reflect a widespread issue for residents in Paradise and surrounding Butte County: Many people did not receive emergency alert warnings, and some who did received them too late.\n\nInstead, they learned of the danger not from authorities but through their own eyes and ears, or from concerned friends and family.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea defended the county's use of the emergency alert system during the fire. He said the situation was \"extraordinarily chaotic and rapidly moving\" and so it took time for fire experts to get to the scene, determine the fire's direction and warn the affected people -- time they just didn't have.\n\n\"There were notifications sent out, but as I said over and over again, this fire was moving so rapidly we couldn't keep ahead of it,\" Honea said.\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones said landline phones are automatically enrolled in the county's alert system, but cell phones have to be opted in to get the alerts. She said they have conducted drives to get people to register, but she wasn't sure how many residents signed up.\n\n\"I got a phone call, I got texts on my cell phone. My husband got a phone call on the landline,\" she told CNN. \"So that's the kind of notification people would get. If they went outside they could see what was happening also.\"\n\nThe fire spread too quickly\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California Jacob Saylors, 11, walks through the burned remains of his home in Paradise, California, on Sunday, November 18.

Hide Caption 102 of 102\n\nThe questions over the use of the emergency alert system come as firefighters continue to battle the Camp Fire in Butte County.\n\nThe fire's rapid spread through the town of Paradise and beyond left at least 56 people dead and destroyed thousands of homes and structures, making it the most destructive and deadliest blaze in state history.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Butte County sheriff published a list of more than a hundred people unaccounted for and still missing from the Camp Fire. The blaze, which has burned 140,000 acres, remains just 40% contained.\n\nHonea said that, for now, Butte County would continue to focus on assisting CalFire on fighting the Camp Fire. Once the fire is contained, they will go back and look closer into the emergency alert system, he said.\n\n\"We're getting a lot of requests and calls from people who want us to spend a lot of time going back and collecting data and there will be a time for that, but right now I need to focus on the fight in front of us,\" Honea said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape 02:15\n\nAs Honea noted, the speed of the fire took everyone by surprise and left residents of Paradise scrambling to escape in car and on foot.\n\nThe Camp Fire charred 20,000 acres last Thursday in less than 14 hours . Its most significant growth period was early Thursday afternoon, when it grew 10,000 acres in about 90 minutes -- burning the equivalent of more than one football field every second during that time.\n\n\"We did our absolute best in terms of Amber-style alert, we used emergency mass notification system as well as our efforts to notify people when we're in the communities. We employed that,\" Honea said.\n\nHonea offered several other explanations for why the alerts did not reach people in harm's way.\n\nHe said the fire took place in a remote area where cell phone service may not be great. He also said that some people who received the warning may not have acted immediately to get out, and suggested that people may have been lulled into a false sense of security regarding fires.\n\n\"I don't think it would be appropriate to draw the conclusion that because (bodies) were found in their house, you can automatically assume they were not notified,\" he said. \"It is possible that they were notified but they chose not to heed the warning and we have heard of stories like that.\"\n\n'For the most part, our plan worked'\n\nMayor Jones said that the fire simply moved too quickly, especially compared to 2008's devastating fire season.\n\n\"I mean, it just happened so fast. There wasn't time to give anybody longer. In 2008, we had three hours between the first notice and the mandatory evacuation. We had three hours to pack up stuff,\" she said.\n\nThis time, though? \"We had no time at all. Maybe five minutes,\" she added.\n\nAbout 26,000 people live in Paradise, some 85 miles north of Sacramento. Jones estimated that about 80 to 90% of the town was destroyed.\n\nStill, despite the issue with the alert system, she defended the evacuation plan, calling it \"organized chaos.\"\n\n\"It did take time to get everybody through just because so many people were evacuated at the same time,\" she said. \"But I think for the most part, our plan worked. If we hadn't had that plan, it would have been awful.\"\n\nLast October, officials in Northern California faced similar criticism from residents who said they learned of the fire by the smell of smoke or noise from their pets rather than from an emergency alert.\n\nAt the time, Kelly Huston, then the deputy director for California's Office of Emergency Service, said alerts and warnings happen on a local level, not a state level.\n\n\"They decide what are the appropriate alerts for their population,\" Houston said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "m.nadi", "title":

As predicted by fans and industry insiders, it was the work of one of the country's top designers, Sabyasachi Mukherjee.\n\nWidely known by his first name, Sabyasachi was seen as the most likely candidate after he posted an Instagram picture from a pre-wedding event showing the bride-to-be in a long orange tunic top and pants, known as a salwar kameez, along with a matching \"dupatta\" (a long shawl-like scarf that's draped over the head and shoulders).\n\n\"He's always been a fantastic designer and couturier,\" said Spardha Malik, a fashion journalist and stylist, in a phone interview. \"But he became a celebrity after (his TV show) 'Band Baaja Bride with Sabyasachi,' a show on bridal makeovers.\"\n\nThe show, whose name translates as \"The Bride's Wedding Party,\" is now in its eighth season.\n\n\"Everyone wanted to be on the show and be dressed by him,\" Malik added.\n\nAn 'old-school' designer\n\nOriginally from the eastern city of Kolkata, Sabyasachi has 2.7 million followers on Instagram and has dressed everyone from Bollywood actresses to politicians. Malik described him as a \"revivalist\" who is \"bringing back a more old-school Indian look.\"\n\n\"While his designs are very decadent, they're still simple and in monotone as opposed to the bright, clashing colors we often see at Indian weddings,\" she said.\n\nSabyasachi's creations on show at the Bridal Asia fashion show.

Brides usually wear saris embroidered with intricate patterns, or a \"lehenga\" (a type of long skirt), paired with a matching blouse and dupatta.\n\nWhile many modern brides now choose light, pastel colors for their weddings, red remains a favorite -- especially for Hindu ceremonies, according to Malik. The color symbolizes fertility and prosperity, as well as representing Mars, the planet of marriage, in Hindu astrology.\n\nCelebrity brides who have worn Sabyasachi's creations in the past include actresses Bipasha Basu, Soha Ali Khan and Anushka Sharma (who wed Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli last year). The designer is well aware of the role of bridal wear in his brand's success, according to Malik.\n\n\"Most designers today have bridal collections,\" she said. \"Now we're seeing Sabyasachi branch out into jewelery and accessories. Again, other big designers are following him and doing the same.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jeff Nesbit for CNN Business Perspectives", "title": "3 things businesses can do to win the climate change fight", "description": "Renewable energy needs to replace traditional energy as quickly as possible, and electric vehicles need to replace the internal combustion engine in the next 10 to 15 years, writes Jeff Nesbit, executive director of Climate Nexus.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/perspectives/un-climate-change-report-businesses/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115103942-solar-panel-farm-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:47:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Jeff Nesbit is author of This is the Way the World Ends and executive director of Climate Nexus. The opinions expressed in this commmentary are his own.\n\nThe sobering report issued by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last month was a public jolt. The report found that the Earth's temperature will warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by as soon as 2030, sparking some devastating consequences.\n\nLike it or not, if we are going to make any progress on climate change, we are going to have to look to the business world. There are roughly 100 companies directly responsible for CO2 emissions, outlined in the Carbon Majors report. Others in the utility and transportation sectors are indirectly responsible for carbon emissions.\n\nThe good news is that more business leaders are recognizing that climate change is indeed a real threat, and many are leading the way in making it a priority in business decisions.\n\nHere's how businesses can tackle climate change head-on:\n\nMake it a part of the business\n\nSome boardrooms have begun to build climate risks into their assumptions and business plans.\n\nFor some businesses, it means making changes in their own supply chains that reduce CO2 emissions. Walmart , for instance, has pledged to reduce a gigaton of CO2 from its supply chain.\n\nFor other companies, it means shifting their own energy needs away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Google and Facebook are good examples of this. They have both committed to buying 100% of their energy needs from renewable sources.\n\nSupport a carbon tax\n\nMany large multinational corporations now allocate resources to either mitigate damage or exposure from climate risks or to adapt to changing environments. They're doing so largely because they want regulatory certainty, as well as a level playing field as governments begin to restrict carbon emissions in the next 20 years.\n\nMore than a dozen industry sector leaders \u2014 including General Motors, MetLife, Exelon, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, Unilever, Shell, BP and Total \u2014 have agreed to support the proposed Climate Leadership Council's Baker-Shultz carbon dividends plan in the past year. This plan would set a national carbon price at $40 a ton in the first year, and it would rise each year after that. The revenue from the carbon fee would be returned to US families as a dividend. The business community as a whole can and should support this prospoal.\n\nTurn to renewable energy\n\nRenewables now disrupt our biggest energy markets and industries such as transportation and utilities. Distributed-grid technologies offer homeowners and small businesses options to generate power for zero fuel costs. Vast new economies of scale drive down prices, making clean energy easier, cheaper and available to all. For businesses, utilities should offer solar and wind options and have solar rooftops integrated into the electric grid. The cost of building solar plants is now as cheap as building a coal plant.\n\nJUST WATCHED Protecting a Melting Glacier Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Protecting a Melting Glacier 08:26\n\nCorporations are realizing that shifting to more efficient, environmentally friendly renewable energy can be important to bottom lines. Pepsi and Coca-Cola have both chosen to address climate impacts affecting their supply chain. Two of the largest packaged food companies, Kellogg and General Mills, have environmental and climate data programs that map out risks and energy efficiency goals throughout their global supply chains. The programs embrace renewables as a way to find and improve efficiencies and reduce energy costs.\n\nBut will such changes happen fast enough to stave off the worst impacts already occurring? Renewable energy needs to replace traditional energy as quickly as possible, and electric vehicles need to replace the internal combustion engine in the next 10 to 15 years. Those are big, seemingly impossible benchmarks. Consumers should demand this.\n\nBut the next move could be revolutionary. Climate change has created the single greatest wealth opportunity in history. The free-market forge is poised to refine a $90 trillion thing of beauty and wonder by using a \"carbon price signal\" sufficient to engineer a low-carbon energy economy.\n\nWill America's business leaders choose to grab this hammer and aim it at the anvil to remake the world before it's too late \u2014 especially if tens of millions of technology-savvy consumers actively support that change for all our best interests on this shared planet?"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Banu Ibrahim, CNN", "title": "24 unconventional Advent calendars to help you count down to Christmas", "description": "Looking for an unusual Advent calendar to gift this year?

The risk of a chaotic exit from the bloc has risen sharply as a result.\n\nThe pound was flat Friday after falling as much as 2% against the dollar during the previous trading session. Shares in UK banks such as Lloyds ( LYG ), Barclays ( BCS ) and Royal Bank of Scotland were hit for a second consecutive day.\n\n\"That's quite a serious escalation and the markets are reacting very violently, [because] the risks of a more disorderly situation are increasing and are very material,\" John Wraith, head of UK rates strategy at UBS, said on Thursday.\n\nWraith said the United Kingdom will plunge into recession next year if the government fails to secure an orderly break with its largest trading partner. He predicted the UK economy would be up to 10% smaller in 2023 than if the country had remained in the European Union.\n\n\"It's a big number, but it is a big problem,\" he said.\n\nThe fear is that Britain could tumble out of the European Union without a transition deal to keep it temporarily inside the bloc's market for goods and services and customs union.\n\nThat would mean new trade barriers, and disruption to supply chains for food, medicines and manufactured goods. Analysts expect a sharp decline in business confidence, real estate prices and an even weaker pound. Airlines may not be able to fly.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund warned Wednesday that a disorderly exit would \"lead to widespread disruptions in production and services.\" Rating agency S&P has told Brits to expect \"a short, sharp recession.\"\n\n\"Nobody can be sure of the extent of any hit to activity, but we think it could be as high as 3% of GDP, with an outright recession probable,\" wrote analysts at research firm Capital Economics.\n\nCompanies have raced to prepare for the worst as negotiations dragged on in recent months. The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, but the prolonged talks left businesses in the dark on terms of future trade.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are stockpiling medicines. BMW ( BMWYY ) plans to shut its Mini factory in England for one month of maintenance immediately after Brexit because it can't be sure of getting the parts it needs.\n\nThe German carmaker said in a statement Friday that it would \"continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario\" because of the \"uncertain\" political situation.\n\n\"We continue to call on all sides to work towards a final agreement which maintains the truly frictionless trade on which our international production network is based,\" BMW said.\n\nFinancial services firms are likely see their access to EU markets reduced under any Brexit scenario, but a messy exit would be most dangerous.\n\nHouseholds would also be harmed by a chaotic Brexit. The value of the pound would slump further, hiking the cost of imported products. Inflation would rise.\n\nS&P estimated that annual household incomes would drop by \u00a32,700 ($3,440) on average in each of the three years following a messy breakup.\n\nThe IMF warned that a decline slump in the value of the pound would hit consumer and business confidence.\n\n\"[That] in turn would have adverse impact on the balance sheets of households, firms and financial intermediaries,\" it said.\n\nBank shares were particular hard hit on Thursday because of worries that borrowers would struggle to pay back loans if the economy slumps following a messy Brexit. Interest rates may also have to remain lower for longer.\n\nRBS has already set aside \u00a3100 million ($125 million) to cover the fallout from Brexit.\n\nWhile a recession is likely under the worst Brexit scenario, the United Kingdom would probably dodge a financial crisis.\n\n\"The UK banking system is incredibly resilient and well capitalized,\" said Wraith. \"If you look at the stress tests they all passed \u2014 they include way worse scenarios than we envision even in the worst case Brexit scenario.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Chloe Melas, CNN", "title": "Meet the entire live-action 'Dumbo' cast in new trailer", "description": "Disney has released the first full-length trailer for a live-action remake of its 1941 animated classic \"Dumbo.\"", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/entertainment/dumbo-trailer/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115103958-dumbo-tim-burton-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:20:56Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) The latest \"Dumbo\" trailer is bound to pull at your heartstrings and childhood memories.\n\nDisney has released the first full-length trailer for a live-action remake of its 1941 animated classic.\n\nTim Burton is directing, with famous names such as Michael Keaton, Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito and Eva Green taking center stage.\n\nFrom the trailer, it appears the plot will stay true to the classic tale of an elephant who was an outcast for having oversize ears but finds a home in a circus.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Disney has a long list of live-action remakes in the works, including \"The Lion King,\" \"Aladdin\" and \"The Sword in the Stone\" to name just a few.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "These are the regulations coming for ecigarettes", "description": "The US Food and Drug Administration has proposed new measures against flavored e-cigarette products.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2018/11/15/fda-vaping-ecigarette-regulations-nr-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180516171927-vape-vaping-stock-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:13:38Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

What's the safest alternative for an average investor?\n\nAlternative investments are becoming increasingly attractive and more readily available to the average investor.\n\nWith interest rates on the rise and the bull market beginning to show signs of fatigue , investors are turning to these investments to increase their diversification, grow their returns and get some downside protection.\n\nEasier access to alternative investments like commodities, cryptocurrencies, collectibles, venture capital, real estate or private equity, also means these holdings are no longer solely for the uber-wealthy.\n\nBut how safe are they for average investors?\n\n\"Some alternatives are investments, others are no more than speculation,\" says Bradley Nelson, an investment adviser and president at Lyon Park Advisors.\n\nTraditional investments, he says, have intrinsic worth, most often a stream of revenue. \"But the worth of a speculative investment depends primarily on the 'greater fool theory', or, what someone else is willing to pay for it.\"\n\nWhile alternative investments are attractive since they are generally negatively correlated with the stock market and some, including commodities like gold or oil, tend to be good hedges against inflation, they also come with many challenges.\n\nThey may have higher fees and steeper barriers to entry. They can also be more volatile and are often less liquid than stocks or bonds.\n\nBut they can sometimes carry higher upside potential, as long as you do your research before investing.\n\nKnow what you're getting into\n\nAlternative investments should be approached the same way as traditional investments, says Nick Stanley, a certified investment management analyst with Protege Wealth Planning.\n\nHe says to ask yourself the following questions: Does the investment improve my portfolio's diversification? Can I afford to bear the risk? Do I understand how this investment strategy works and the underlying investments?\n\nStanley likes structured products and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, for retail investors because they take complicated alternative investments and make them manageable for less sophisticated investors.\n\n\"Most alternative investments are 'alternative' because they typically utilize investments, or strategies, that are difficult for most people outside of the financial services industry to understand,\" Stanley says. \"They also may carry risk that the average investor cannot afford.\"\n\nStructured products can take a complex investment strategy like using short positions, options or futures, and bundle them together into a product that consumers can understand.\n\n\"Before deciding on structured products, investors should understand their potential maximum gains or losses.\"\n\nTread lightly\n\nA big mistake alternative investors make is chasing yield or returns, says Stanley.\n\n\"I tell clients that if something outperforms enough to draw public attention, it's probably already too late to make the investment,\" he says.\n\nWith cryptocurrencies, he says, investors hear about 100% gains and want to jump on board. But most likely, the owners of cryptocurrency exchanges will earn more profits from the crypto fever, than the actual investors in the currency.\n\nAnother pitfall with alternatives is purchasing an individual asset or security. That will greatly increase your exposure to risk, says Nelson. \"We always recommend a mutual fund when investing in an asset category.\"\n\nFor example, rather than going all in on a single real estate investment, Nelson recommends looking at real estate investment trusts, or REITs. \"Real estate is a very traditional alternative investment and there are several options for investment in low-expense REIT mutual funds.\"\n\nWith investments like alternative lending (a peer-to-peer platform not directly associated with traditional banks and mortgage lenders) or reinsurance (insurance for insurance companies) he says to proceed with great caution.\n\n\"Only invest a small allocation to your portfolio,\" he advises.\n\nAlso be wary of commodity funds, says Chris Jackson, certified financial planner and founder of Lionshare Partners.\n\n\"Commodity funds don't invest directly in the commodity but in their commodity future contracts,\" says Jackson.

Saudi Arabia's explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance shifted constantly, from initial assertions that he was still alive to the possibility rogue actors were to blame, even as it became clear responsibility for his death reached the highest offices in the Kingdom and could implicate the de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.\n\nNeither the Saudi prosecutor's release nor the Treasury statement on sanctions mentioned bin Salman, but Pompeo acknowledged that at the time of Khashoggi's killing, the individuals sanctioned by Treasury on Thursday \"occupied positions in the Royal Court and several ministries and offices of the Government of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has made the Kingdom central to its hopes for a Middle East peace between Israelis and Palestinians as well as its efforts to contain Iran and to keep oil prices steady as it moves to sanction Tehran. President Donald Trump has veered from proposing \"severe punishment\" to suggesting \"rogue\" elements were behind the killing.\n\nThe killing has also drawn attention to Trump's business ties to Saudi Arabia and the relationship between the crown prince and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. As outrage grew on Capitol Hill and overseas, Trump and Pompeo have stressed the need for patience, for the Saudis to complete their own investigation and the importance of US ties with the kingdom.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 14: U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in the Oval Office at the White House, March 14, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nAllen Keiswetter, a scholar with the Middle East Institute who served in the region with the State Department, said that if any serious steps are taken against Saudi Arabia, it will likely happen on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"The major action, I think, is going to be in the new Congress where Congressional approval of Saudi arms sales will be a major issue,\" Keiswetter told CNN. \"Particularly in the House , with the Democrats in control. The other major impact is the worldwide reaction to all of this, which means that Saudi Arabia has suffered a strong blow to its reputation.\"\n\nOne Republican lawmaker was already voicing his frustration with the sanctions. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN's Brianna Keilar on \"Right Now\" that the Treasury announcement amounted to the administration \"pretending to do something\" about Khashoggi's death, given that some of the sanctioned men have now been sentenced to die.\n\n\"Sanction people already in jail is pretending to do something,\" Paul said CNN. \"If you sanction them, do you think they really care if they are on death row?\"\n\nPaul said his primary concern is the Saudi-led war in Yemen and that a US decision to stop selling arms to the Kingdom could put real pressure on the leadership there. \"Saudi Arabia cares about the weapons and I also think Saudi Arabia's air force would not fly\" if it weren't for support and training from the United States, Paul said.\n\nAnd he added that he believes it's extremely unlikely that bin Salman wasn't aware of the operation. \"It's doubtful that in an authoritarian regime like Saudi Arabia that anything happened without the crown prince's ... he likely did know of this and directed it,\" Paul charged.\n\nKhashoggi, a former Saudi royal insider who became a critic of the country's government, disappeared on October 2 after he went into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, to obtain paperwork to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e.\n\nMnuchin said the US government would work \"diligently\" to obtain all the facts on the death of Khashoggi and hold \"accountable\" any individual found responsible.\n\n\"The Government of Saudi Arabia must take appropriate steps to end any targeting of political dissidents or journalists,\" he said.\n\n'An overdose'\n\nMnuchin had previously told reporters it would be \"premature\" to discuss whether the US would impose sanctions on the Saudi government.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Saudi Public Prosecutor's office said a total of 11 people were charged, adding that the five people facing capital punishment were directly involved in \"ordering and executing the crime.\"\n\nThe prosecution also shared details of the journalist's murder, saying Khashoggi was killed following \"a fight and a quarrel\" at the Saudi consulate.\n\nKhashoggi was then \"forcibly restrained and injected with a large amount of a drug resulting in an overdose that led to his death,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nThe body was then dismembered and removed from consulate by five people. One person was responsible for giving it to a local collaborator. One person shut down internal CCTV cameras, the prosecutor said.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his father King Salman pictured shaking hands with Salah bin Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist's eldest son, and Sahl bin Ahmad Khashoggi, another relative, at Al Yamama Palace in Riyadh in October, after Jamal Khashoggi's killing.\n\nThe head of the mission and the head of the negotiating team decided together to write a \"false report\" to the intelligence deputy chief saying Khashoggi left the building after the failed negotiations.\n\nOverall, 21 people were arrested and six officials were removed from their positions, according to the prosecutor and the Saudi foreign minister. Of the 11 charged, the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five of them.\n\nHours after the Saudi prosecutors made their announcement, Khashoggi's family announced it would receive condolences at his home in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah starting Friday.\n\nThe wake will go on for three days, per Muslim tradition.\n\nKhashoggi's son Salah wrote on Twitter a prayer for his late father, pleading God to give the family patience. Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e Hatice Cengiz also wrote a similar prayer on Twitter following the announcement."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Melissa Vel\u00e1squez Loaiza", "title": "Marchas de estudiantes en Colombia: esto es lo que debes saber", "description": "Una nueva jornada de movilizaciones de estudiantes y gremios como los de los profesores, ind\u00edgenas y trabajadores marchar\u00e1n en varias ciudades del pa\u00eds pidi\u00e9ndole al gobierno del presidente Iv\u00e1n Duque m\u00e1s recursos para la educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/15/marchas-de-estudiantes-en-colombia-esto-es-lo-que-debes-saber/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gettyimages-1052404474.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:45:22Z", "content": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Por sexta vez en un poco m\u00e1s de un mes, estudiantes colombianos se movilizar\u00e1n en todo el pa\u00eds pidiendo m\u00e1s recursos para la educaci\u00f3n superior p\u00fablica.

These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN on Thursday.\n\nDespite these exceptions for e-cigarette flavors, Gottlieb proposed additional bans on regular menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\nHe also proposed tightening the reins on products that are marketed or \"appealing to youth.\"\n\n\"This could include using popular children's cartoon or animated characters, or names of products favored by kids like brands of candy or soda,\" the announcement said.\n\nConsumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate about vaping: While some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\n\"We're committed to utilizing the full range of our regulatory authorities to directly target the places kids are getting these products and address the role flavors and marketing are playing,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned,\" he said. \"This is one of our highest priorities.\"\n\n'Spike in use'\n\nOne in five high schoolers has vaped in the past month, according to the new numbers announced by the FDA and released in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I'm also a father of young kids, and every time I go home and talk to parents of other kids ... this is the number one thing I hear about,\" Gottlieb told CNN. \"Parents are deeply concerned about the trends that they're seeing in their high schools, in their middle schools.\"\n\nHealth experts worry that these products could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\n\"The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"This is a large pool of future risk.\"\n\nThe new statistics also show that students who vape are doing so more frequently than last year, and they are using flavored liquids more often, according to the FDA. More than a quarter of current users vaped at least 20 of the last 30 days, and over two-thirds had used flavored products.\n\n\"Flavors are a major reason they use these products in the first place,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Flavors increase the likelihood of kids progressing from experimentation to regular use, and a portion of them will go on to use combustible tobacco products, with the huge added dangers of tobacco-related disease.\"\n\nThe new numbers come from a school-based survey, conducted from March to May, which revealed that the number of current users in middle and high school -- meaning those who have vaped in the past 30 days -- increased 48% and 78% from last year, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the number of current vapers in middle and high school has jumped by roughly 1.5 million since last year, now totaling 3.6 million kids, Gottlieb said.\n\nThe \"alarming\" surge in adolescent e-cigarette use prompted health officials to release these numbers \"earlier than usual\" in hopes of spurring immediate action, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Not only are we seeing a staggering increase in the number of high schoolers who use e-cigarettes, we're seeing that more and more of them have moved beyond experimentation and are using e-cigarettes almost daily,\" Dr. Colleen A. Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nThe rapid spread of e-cigarettes -- which work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes -- was flagged in a 2016 report by the US surgeon general that cited a 900% increase in e-cigarette use by high school students from 2011 to 2015. E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady -- under 12% -- the following year. Now, that number is 20.8%.\n\nGottlieb worries that soaring e-cigarette use will undermine the progress on youth anti-smoking efforts over the years.\n\n\"The rate of use of e-cigarettes among kids threatens to reverse those gains,\" he told CNN. \"We simply cannot let that happen.\"\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nHealth and advocacy groups had mixed responses after news reports last week foreshadowed Thursday's policy-related announcement. Some applauded the proposals, but those organizations also chided the agency for stopping short and not acting sooner.\n\n\"Even with new sales restrictions, teens will still find ways to purchase flavored e-cigarettes,\" Kraft said.\n\nThe proposed policy revision wouldn't apply to vaping products \"sold exclusively in age-restricted locations -- for instance, a stand-alone tobacco retailer (such as a vape shop),\" the announcement said.\n\nCritics say this could shift the problem out of some storefronts but not out of existence.\n\n\"The FDA needs to go further,\" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement Friday. \"There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales.\"\n\nThe FDA has cracked down on vape shops in the past, issuing warnings and fines to more than 1,300 retailers for illegally selling vaping products to kids, after an undercover investigation this summer.\n\nMyers urged the FDA to ban all flavored vaping products whose impact on public health hasn't been scrutinized by the FDA \"as the law requires ... rather than dealing with them after they have become popular with kids, as in the case of Juul.\"\n\nInstead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold, the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.\n\nThis decision has also been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the FDA and Health and Human Services, filed in March by health advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the earlier requirement for pre-market approval.\n\nUnder Gottlieb's latest proposal, the FDA's less-stringent approach would no longer apply to flavored products whose companies don't take these steps to avoid underage use.\n\n\"We hope that within the next 90 days, manufacturers will choose to remove flavored [e-cigarette] products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\nHe told CNN, \"If we don't see the youth use rates start to come down -- and come down sharply -- we'll be back here, because there is more that we can do.\"\n\nMenthol\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes,\" Gottlieb said Thursday. \"I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes.\n\n\"Moreover, I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the NAACP released a statement in support of the FDA's then-anticipated plan to ban menthol cigarettes, saying that \"the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans.\"\n\nNearly one in five African-Americans smoked menthols in 2010, representing more than 80% of black smokers, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, R.J. Reynolds, which manufactures the top-selling menthol cigarette in the US, denied that the evidence supports regulating menthols differently from other cigarettes. The company said it \"will continue to engage with the FDA on its proposed plans\" and asserted that regulating menthol cigarettes would \"increase the illegal market, fueling more criminal activity.\"\n\nThe company has fought previous similar efforts, contributing nearly $12 million against a San Francisco proposition to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, which voters approved in June.\n\nCiting the popularity of menthol cigarettes among African-Americans and youth, National Urban League CEO and President Marc H. Morial urged the FDA \"to move forward with urgency to implement this plan\" in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The destructive impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community is clear,\" Morial said.\n\n'Not enough'\n\nVaping associations criticized the FDA's announcement Thursday.\n\n\"No youth should vape and there is room for more rigorous enforcement to ensure youth are not accessing these products. However, this move by Commissioner Gottlieb will only serve to make it harder for adult smokers to switch to a far less harmful alternative,\" Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"Allowing convenience stores to continue selling mint and menthol pods is hardly a compromise worthy of applause,\" he said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that it disagrees with the limitations Gottlieb has proposed -- though it has also taken a stance against flavors and marketing geared toward kids.\n\n\"We strongly disagree that e-Vapor products are a gateway product,\" said the association, which encouraged more partnership between the FDA and the industry.\n\nPharmacy chain CVS Health, which does not sell tobacco or vaping products, supported the move. Its chief medical officer, Dr. Troyen Brennan, said that the company applauds \"the FDA's decision to restrict access to flavored tobacco and e-cigarette products, which have been expertly marketed and targeted at teens and young adults.\"\n\n\"The need for action is urgent,\" Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. \"But limiting the sale of e-cigarettes is not enough.\n\n\"The FDA should also remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market,\" she added, \"and prohibit companies from marketing their products in ways that appeal to kids.\"\n\nOther actions\n\nThe agency has made a number of moves in recent months to counter vaping among kids, beyond warning and fining retailers for illegally selling e-cig products to kids.\n\nIt recently expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies last month in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nThat move came less than two weeks after the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.\n\nThis month, Gottlieb announced a public hearing in December that will \"focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation among youth.\"\n\nGottlieb has met with companies like Juul, asking them to to address what he described as a mutual goal to keep e-cigs out of kids' hands. But some have been critical of these efforts, with one anti-tobacco advocate comparing them to \"asking the fox to recommend plans for guarding the hen house.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe leading maker of e-cigarettes, Juul, vowed on Tuesday to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website. The company also announced that it was shutting down some of its social media accounts.\n\n\"Underage use of e-cigarette products is a problem that requires immediate action,\" Juul Labs said in a statement Thursday. \"That is why we implemented our action plan .\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Chloe Melas, CNN", "title": "Jessie J tells crowd she is unable to have children", "description": "Jessie J, whose real name is Jessica Ellen Cornish, shared a personal detail about her life while performing Tuesday night.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/entertainment/jessie-j-cant-have-kids-concert/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115071738-jessie-j-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:24:01Z", "content": "(CNN) Jessie J, whose real name is Jessica Ellen Cornish, shared a personal detail about her life while performing Tuesday night.

It's the call of the modern investment adviser. The risk-management strategy allows you to protect yourself from huge losses by putting your investments into different asset classes, funds, geographies or stocks.\n\nWhile one asset class may perform better than another in a given year, a diversified portfolio will deliver relatively consistent returns over time.\n\n\"Diversification may have hurt you this year since emerging markets and international markets haven't done as well,\" says Brian Face, of Face2Face Financial Planning. \"But for the average investor, if you diversify correctly, diversification is going to be a smoother ride in the long run.\"\n\nHere are some ways to determine if you are getting what you want out of your diversification strategy.\n\nDiversification can be cheaper\n\n\"If you are not diversifying you are not investing \u2014 you're gambling,\" says Roger Healy, principal of Hibernian Financial Planning.\n\n\"You can't overdo this,\" he says. Any added investment to your portfolio is going to increase your diversification, he says, and will ultimately lower your risk for the same return or increase your return for the same risk.\n\nHowever, he says, the 'over-diversification' problem arises when you increase complexity without lowering your risk or increasing your return. This will increase your cost, as well, in the form of extra fees.\n\nKeep it simple, he says, and buy diversification wholesale, at a lower cost through mutual funds or ETFs.\n\n\"You probably need no more than 30 well-chosen stocks to have a diversified portfolio, but it is cheaper to buy a basket containing all 500 S&P index stocks, so save time and money and buy the index,\" Healy says.\n\nDiversification is a strategy that is put into place after your asset allocation, he adds. Buy a basket (or baskets) of securities in the proportions that make sense for your level of risk tolerance.\n\nRedundancies don't diversify\n\nMany estimate the point at which over-diversification occurs is when a portfolio has over 20 stocks, says Samuel Wieser, investment adviser at Northman Financial. But it isn't just about the raw number of investments you hold.\n\n\"Just buying a bunch of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs doesn't necessarily mean you are diversifying,\" he says. \"You can hold five different ETFs or mutual funds that track the S&P 500 and you won't be any more diversified than just holding one of them.\"\n\nSince they all track the same index, they will all have very similar, if not identical, returns over time. Proper diversification entails buying a mix of securities that differ in size, style, sector, and region of the world.\n\nAnd just because you have funds with multiple custodians (like TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Fidelity and Charles Schwab) does not mean you're diversified. You may ultimately be invested in similar funds and are just paying more in fees.\n\nCheck your work\n\nThe most common way to measure if holding two or more securities will provide your portfolio with diversification is to look at the correlation between their historical returns, says Weiser.\n\n\"One key mistake many make when looking at correlation is that they use a static figure,\" he says. \"Two securities may go through periods in which they are highly correlated and others in which they are relatively uncorrelated. So if you just look at the correlation over the past 12 months or past 36 months, it can be misleading. A better approach is to look at the rolling correlation over a long period of time.\"\n\nAlternatively, you can look at the returns of your various holdings over time, says Weiser. \"Many will likely grow together or decline together, but you are likely only over-diversified if they are growing and declining at the same rate over the long term.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"},

worth.\n\nThere are things investors can do to hedge the immediate effects of inflation, or earn a return that outpaces inflation over time. But it can be hard to predict.\n\n\"After-inflation returns are the only ones that matter for investors in the real world,\" says Robinson Crawford, an investment adviser with Montebello Avenue.\n\nEven if inflation is currently rising more slowly than analysts predicted, it's better to be prepared.\n\nStocks\n\nFinancial advisers say one of the most consistent hedges against inflation is a properly diversified stock portfolio.\n\nEquities have historically outpaced inflation, says Sean C. Gillespie, a financial planner with Redeployment Wealth Strategies says that while there is inherent volatility in a stock portfolio, \"equities are a long-term asset for your plan just like inflation is a long-term threat.\"\n\nTo figure out where to put your money in the stock market, investors could look to a total return strategy that relies on equities to provide positive inflation-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\n\"Of course, investors have to accept more risk when investing in stocks and endure periods when the returns have not outpaced inflation,\" says Dejan Ilijevski, an investment adviser at Sabela Capital Markets. \"Although some investors may assume that higher inflation leads to lower stock performance, US market history shows that nominal annual stock returns are unrelated to inflation.\"\n\nGold and commodities\n\nGold and commodities have been standard havens from inflation for investors.\n\n\"Traditionally commodities and gold have been good inflation hedges,\" says Stephanie Bucko, a chartered financial analyst and co-founder of Mana Financial Life Design. But she says it is important to take into account the US dollar's strength as part of this equation.\n\n\"We like oil exposure, as this impacts our clients on a day-to-day basis related to gas prices, but it also provides a good inflation hedge,\" says Bucko, adding that we saw this in the 1970s as inflation doubled and nominal oil prices skyrocketed.\n\nBut commodity markets, for the unfamiliar, can be complex and risky.\n\n\"Commodities are volatile, more so than stocks, which means that adding commodities to a portfolio may increase real return volatility, offsetting the benefits of hedging,\" says Ilijevski.\n\nReal estate\n\nReal estate is the ultimate hard asset in times of inflation since it will see price appreciation. Financial advisers suggest investors find a place for real estate in a portfolio.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to real estate by directly owning commercial or residential property, or by investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nReal estate is a sound investment, says Crawford. \"But I would caution that if you're not increasing rent in your real estate, you aren't fighting inflation.\"\n\nShort term bonds and TIPS\n\nShort-term bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are investments that are a hedge against inflation.\n\n\"Hedging seeks out asset classes that tend to positively correlate with inflation,\" says Ilijevski.\n\nFor example, he says, short-term maturities allow bond-holders to more frequently roll over the principal at higher interest rates. This helps inflation-sensitive investors keep up with short-term inflation.\n\nSimilarly, TIPS, issued by the government, are also a fixed-income security hedge against inflation.

It was painted on the outside wall of a bargain shop in north London in 2012 but was removed from the wall months later, before resurfacing at auction in Miami.\n\nThe lot was withdrawn after protests, but the artwork was eventually sold in London in 2013.\n\n\"Slave Labour\" was sold again on Wednesday at Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles.

They may feel their money could work harder elsewhere.\n\nThat may be true. There are situations in which selling mutual fund shares works to your advantage. But you could also encounter adverse consequences.\n\nMove on your strategy not on the market\n\nThe time to sell a mutual fund is when you need the liquidity and you have planned ahead to make the move, says Eric Gabor, certified financial planner and founder of Eagle Grove Advisors.\n\n\"Any kind of decline in the market or reaction to a geo-political event is not the time to sell,\" he said.\n\nIndividual investors should only sell funds when their situation calls for a need to make a change, says Amy Hubble, a certified financial planner and principal investment adviser at Radix Financial. Investors may need cash, she says, or need to reduce risk as a need for cash draws nearer.\n\n\"Or maybe your target allocation to that asset class has grown outside its tolerance compared to the rest of the portfolio,\" says Hubble. \"For example, you had a strategic allocation of 10% and it's now 17% of your portfolio.\"\n\nBut it can be hard for investors to remember that they need to sit on their hands when they hear bad news.\n\nIt's not uncommon for a novice investor to want to sell their investments when they see declines in the market, says Leah Hadley, a certified divorce financial analyst and chief executive of Great Lakes Investment Management. \"That's why we work with clients to determine an appropriate level of liquidity so that there is less temptation to sell when the market is down.\"\n\nKeep in mind that your mutual funds might include more than just US stocks, says Bloom, head of Open World Financial Life Planning.\n\n\"Your portfolio will include funds that include different parts of the market,\" he says. \"Sure there's the S&P, but there might also be bonds, international and emerging markets. When the market goes down, no one is talking about the other parts, the international investments, the bonds. The part that stands out is the part that is in the red: the S&P.\"\n\nRed flags\n\nWhile your plan is to stick with your strategy for the duration of your timeline, there are mutual fund red flags that could merit a change.\n\n\"I will consider making a change in portfolios if there has been a change in the fund's strategy and it no longer makes sense in my overall strategy with the client,\" says Hadley. \"I will also sell out of a mutual fund that is consistently under-performing the relevant benchmark.\"\n\nGabor recommends watching the fund manager, too. \"If a manger leaves a fund they have managed for many years and a new successor is named, that may be a time to re-evaluate how it fits into your portfolio.\"\n\nHe adds that investors should also be on the lookout for tax inefficient funds.\n\n\"You could get out if there are large inverse tax consequences,\" says Gabor. \"That's why I like tax-managed mutual funds, and exchange traded funds.\"\n\nWatch out for high turnover ratios, says Hubble, like those over 25% per year. \"Funds with high turnover ratios mean the fund is managed tax inefficiently and you're likely to receive unannounced short-term capital gain distributions at the end of the year, which have high tax costs.\"\n\nAnother red flag is high expense ratios. \"This is the most important number to look at in a fund,\" says Hubble. \"Do not pay managers more than 1% to underperform the market half the time in long-term savings accounts. Do yourself a favor and for long-term money, skip the active managers altogether and invest in low-cost index funds.\"\n\nThe consequences of getting out\n\nIf an investor does decide to liquidate the fund, keep an eye on your tax liability.\n\n\"If the investor has held the fund for a less than a year, all capital gains will be taxed at their income level,\" says Timothy Kenney, a certified financial planner and founder of TK Pacific Wealth. \"If they have held the fund for greater than a year, they can get a little break in the capital gains tax, maybe 5% or 20% depending on your tax bracket, but they may have a big tax bill to pay next year since we've been in a bull market for so long.\"\n\nIf you have a fund you are looking to sell and it happens to be at a loss, Kenney suggests paying attention to the capital gains distribution.\n\nFunds tend to pay capital gains toward the end of the year, and by selling before the distribution you avoid getting hit with the tax."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "David McKenzie and Brent Swails, CNN", "title": "Controversial South Africa land reform looms after key hurdle is cleared", "description": "Its proponents say it will help unlock economic potential; critics say it could lead to ruin in Africa's most advanced economy.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/africa/south-africa-land-reform-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180216195559-01-cyril-ramaphosa-0216-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:52:07Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Its proponents say it will help unlock economic potential; critics say it could lead to ruin in Africa's most advanced economy.\n\nNow, after months of contentious public hearings across South Africa and scores of parliamentary debates, a parliamentary review committee took the next step in the controversial policy of expropriation of land without compensation by recommending that a constitutional change be enacted.\n\n\"South Africans have spoken loud and clear, and we listened to their cry,\" said Lewis Nzimande, the co-chair of the committee.\n\nThe ruling African National Congress, pushed by an insurgent opposition party on the left in the run-up to a general election next year, adopted the policy late last year to help accelerate land reform.

(CNN) Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have spent much of Thursday swinging back after a New York Times investigation published Wednesday suggested that the company had not been forthcoming enough about Russian interference on its platform and reported that it had hired a firm that dug up dirt on its competitors.\n\nParticipating in a conference call with reporters Thursday that was meant to be about rules regarding how Facebook polices its platform, Zuckerberg instead had to focus mainly on the Times' story and reporters' questions about it.\n\nHe began the call by addressing the Times' story, acknowledging \u2014 in a line that has become something of a company mantra \u2014 that Facebook had been too slow to deal with the Russian disinformation problem on its platform in 2016, but saying that \"to suggest we weren't interested in knowing the truth\" was \"simply untrue.\"\n\nFacebook has spent a great deal of its time and energy over the past two years handling increasing scrutiny from the public and from Washington arising out of its inaction in 2016. One step it took during that period was to hire Definers Public Affairs, a DC-based conservative firm, which did PR work for Facebook \u2014 and dug up dirt on the company's competitors and its critics.\n\nZuckerberg said during the call that he only learned about the company's work with Definers when he read the Times' article.\n\nAfter he'd read the article, he said, \"I got on the phone with our team, and we are no longer working with this firm.\"\n\nHe said Facebook would need to ensure it was not working with similar companies.\n\nFacebook had earlier announced its decision to end its relationship with Definers, which had pushed negative stories about other tech companies and about Facebook's critics, some of which were posted on a conservative website linked to the firm.\n\nThe Times reported that Definers had circulated a document earlier this year encouraging reporters to examine the links between liberal billionaire George Soros and a group campaigning to break up Facebook.\n\nOnline criticism of Soros is sometimes explicitly anti-Semitic, and sometimes harkens back to anti-Semitic tropes. Some of the backlash that followed the Times' report came from critics suggesting Facebook had engaged in dog whistle politics.\n\nZuckerberg told reporters on Thursday that he had \"tremendous respect\" for Soros, even though they disagreed about the impact of the internet.\n\nA statement from Facebook earlier in the day read, \"Definers did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of 'Freedom from Facebook,' an anti-Facebook organization. The intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company. To suggest that this was an anti-Semitic attack is reprehensible and\n\nIn the same statement, Facebook said, \"The New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook's behalf -- or to spread misinformation. Our relationship with Definers was well known by the media -- not least because they have on several occasions sent out invitations to hundreds of journalists about important press calls on our behalf,\" a Facebook statement read.\n\nPatrick Gaspard, the president of Open Society Foundations, which Soros founded, wrote to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on Wednesday, saying Facebook had attempted to distract from its accountability problems.\n\n\"I was shocked to learn from the New York Times that you and your colleagues at Facebook hired a Republican opposition research firm to stir up animus toward George Soros. As you know, there is a concerted right-wing effort the world over to demonize Mr. Soros and his foundations, which I lead\u2014an effort which has contributed to death threats and the delivery of a pipe bomb to Mr. Soros' home. You are no doubt also aware that much of this hateful and blatantly false and Anti-Semitic information is spread via Facebook,\" Gaspard wrote.\n\nSandberg's handling of Facebook's approach to the fallout from misinformation and interference on the platform was one of the primary focuses of the Times' report. On Thursday's call with reporters, Zuckerberg praised Sandberg, describing her as an \"important partner.\"\n\nThe Times also reported that Joel Kaplan, a former aide to George W. Bush who is now Facebook's vice president of global public policy, advised against the company publishing a paper in early 2017 detailing the extent of Russian interference on the platform.\n\nKaplan became a lightning rod for controversy inside and outside the company last month when he attended the Senate confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, his friend and former Bush administration colleague.\n\nColor of Change, a progressive civil advocacy group that was, according to The Times, included in a brief compiled by Definers, called on Thursday for Facebook to fire Kaplan.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business that Kaplan continues to have the confidence of the company's leaders and that he was not involved in Definers' work for the company.\n\nA spokesperson for Definers said in a statement to CNN Business on Thursday morning, \"We are proud to have partnered with Facebook over the past year on a range of public affairs services. All of our work is based on publicly-available documents and information. The document referenced in the Times story regarding the anti-Facebook organization's potential funding sources was entirely factual and based on public records, including public statements by one of its organizers about receiving funding from Mr. Soros' foundation.\"\n\nBefore the call began, Facebook's board of directors \u2014 on which Zuckerberg serves as chairmain \u2014 put out a statement responding to the Times' article.\n\n\"As Mark and Sheryl made clear to Congress, the company was too slow to spot Russian interference, and too slow to take action. As a board we did indeed push them to move faster. But to suggest that they knew about Russian interference and either tried to ignore it or prevent investigations into what had happened is grossly unfair,\" the statement read. \"In the last eighteen months Facebook, with the full support of this board, has invested heavily in more people and better technology to prevent misuse of its services, including during elections. As the US mid-term showed they have made considerable progress and we support their continued to efforts to fight abuse and improve security.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN Business, a spokesperson for the Times said, \"Our story is accurate and we stand by it. The monthslong investigation by a team of reporters was based on interviews with more than 50 sources including current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u0645\u0646 \"\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0625\u062b\u0631

storm that hit the eastern half of the country Thursday morning is expected to make its way into the Northeast, spreading heavy rain and flooding along the East Coast and snow and ice inland. Flooding may and icy conditions will continue across the South, where five people have been killed recently in weather-related incidents.\n\nTiming\n\nAround 88 million people are under winter weather watches, warnings and advisories that extend over a wide area from Missouri to Maine.\n\nSt. Louis is under a winter storm warning because 2-6 inches of snow has fallen and will continue through this morning.\n\nIce storm warnings are posted for parts of Indiana and Ohio, including Indianapolis and Dayton, where up to a quarter inch of ice is already causing widespread power outages.\n\nHeavy ice accumulations are forecast over parts of West Virginia, eastern Virginia and western Maryland.\n\nThe heaviest snow will likely pile up from the central Appalachians into New England, where over 6 inches is expected. A heavy pocket of 4-6 inches is also possible around the St. Louis area, making it their biggest November snowfall in decades.\n\nSnow amounts in major metro areas\n\nPrecipitation will likely start as snow in major metro areas before changing over to rain. Here's what to expect:\n\nBoston: 1-3 inches starting as snow Thursday evening, changing to rain overnight, with rain lingering into Friday morning.\n\n1-3 inches starting as snow Thursday evening, changing to rain overnight, with rain lingering into Friday morning. New York City: 1 inch of snow beginning late Thursday morning, becoming a wintery mix in the afternoon before changing to all rain. Heavier snow of 1-3 inches in New Jersey up the Hudson Valley.\n\n1 inch of snow beginning late Thursday morning, becoming a wintery mix in the afternoon before changing to all rain. Heavier snow of 1-3 inches in New Jersey up the Hudson Valley. Philadelphia: 1 inch or less of snow Thursday morning, mixing to rain and sleet around noon, and all rain late afternoon and Thursday night.\n\n1 inch or less of snow Thursday morning, mixing to rain and sleet around noon, and all rain late afternoon and Thursday night. Washington: A half inch or less of wintery mix on Thursday, changing to rain with little accumulation.\n\nFlooding continues in the South\n\nThe Northeast metros will escape the heavy snow, but will be left with a miserable mix of rain and snow, changing to all rain as the temperatures warm slightly into the mid and upper 30s.\n\nOver 34 million are under flood or flash flood watches in the South, including cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, Norfolk and Richmond.\n\nIcy conditions are responsible for the deaths of at least five people, according to state highway patrols.\n\nTwo people were killed in Desoto County, Mississippi, Wednesday afternoon after their tour bus crashed, said Sgt. Joseph Miller with the Mississippi Highway Patrol.

On those levels, the show proves breezy and likable, and about as far from the ad-supported pressure to reach \"younger demos\" as a TV show can get.\n\nDouglas plays Sandy Kominsky, a renowned acting coach who gives brilliant advice to his classes -- who pepper him with questions about things like auditioning for a shampoo commercial -- but could use a bit of his own when it comes to his personal affairs.\n\nKominsky tells his charges that they should act for the love of their craft, \"not the pursuit of fame or money.\" But he's in desperate need of the latter, a source of consternation to his longtime agent and bosom pal Norman (Arkin).\n\nAlthough Kominsky embarks on a relationship with one of his students -- a relatively age-appropriate woman (Nancy Travis), to the surprise of those who know him -- it's the banter between Douglas and Arkin that defines the show and consistently delivers its best moments. The two even engage in an amusing \"Who's on first?\"-type routine built around the rapper Ludacris (Kominsky has no idea who that is), and is later told by an exasperated Norman, \"I'm not sugarcoating. I'm lying.\"\n\nOver the course of the eight-episode run, Kominsky and Norman deal with all the vagaries of getting older, from death to a prostate cancer scare, as the acting coach becomes alarmed over his frequent trips to the bathroom. A trip to the urologist, played by Danny DeVito, leads to more one-liners and groaning about life's little indignities on the wrong side of middle age.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Brian Lowry, CNN", "title": "'Widows' plots crime thriller with more valleys than peaks", "description": "'Widows' review: Viola Davis, a splendid supporting cast and director Steve McQueen plot out an elaborate crime thriller with more valleys than peaks", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/entertainment/widows-review/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181109105152-widows-viola-davis-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:31:50Z", "content": "(CNN) \"Widows\" is a wildly uneven crime caper, one with more valleys than peaks.

Juggling too many threads, the film delivers strong and twisty moments -- and a feminist hook -- but largely squanders its impressive array of talent, headed by Viola Davis.\n\nThe plot actually has a pretty basic backbone to it, and a durable one at that. Originally a 1980s British miniseries from \"Prime Suspect\" creator Lynda La Plante, it was remade 20 years later, and bears a resemblance to NBC's recent series \"Good Girls,\" in which three suburban women have to resort to crime.\n\nAs the title suggests, the women here are the widows of a heist gone wrong, which ended with their husbands dying in a fiery crash. Veronica (Davis) has the most to lose, since a local crime boss, Jamal Manning (\"Atlanta's\" Brian Tyree Henry) is the one who was robbed, and he wants his $2 million back in a month's time, or else.\n\nVeronica's husband Harry (Liam Neeson) had been a master thief, enabling the couple to live in luxury. But dark aspects of their past gradually emerge, even as Veronica discovers a book that maps out Harry's next planned job, deciding to undertake it with the other widows --all left financially bereft by the deaths -- in order to make Veronica's Manning problem go away, and get themselves solvent again.\n\n\"This is not your world,\" Veronica is warned, which, in the women's determination to prove that wrong, is just one of the female-empowerment elements at play.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "'Batkid' is now cancer-free", "description": "Miles Scott, who is affectionately known as \"Batkid,\" is cancer-free five years after saving the city of San Francisco through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2018/11/15/batkid-cancer-free-mxp-vpx.hln", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131115203255-03-batkid-1115-story-top.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:29:59Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

in scope, the series remains as addictive as ever in chronicling the bleak history of the drug war, delivering a drama so crisp and smartly executed as to provide its own kind of high.\n\nAlthough the setting and key characters have changed, the common thread throughout has been the collateral damage the war on drugs has inflicted across decades -- an endless cycle of violence amid enforcement efforts that, as the omniscient narration notes, has claimed a half million lives.\n\nAfter beginning with Pablo Escobar in Colombia, \"Narcos\" shifted to the Cali cartel, an equally colorful and bloodthirsty bunch. The latest change of scenery adds considerable star power, with Diego Luna as Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, the savvy drug lord seeking to consolidate power across Mexico in the 1980s; and Michael Pena as Kiki Camarena, the gung-ho DEA agent who ultimately met a tragic end (previously turned into a 1990 miniseries).\n\n\"Someone should call D.C. and tell them we surrendered Guadalajara,\" Camarena grouses early on, chafing against what he sees as the handcuffs placed on his agency by feckless superiors.\n\nBoth sides of the equation are fascinating, with Gallardo seeking to forge an uneasy peace among the various drug kingpins -- in what only can be likened to the mob families parceling off Cuba in \"The Godfather Part II\" -- establishing Mexico's first narco-union.

Where are you Teresa?\" Bezos said, looking out into the crowd for Carlson, the company's head of cloud services for the public sector. \"Everybody in Washington knows Teresa.\"\n\nHe might be right.\n\nFor people in government, Carlson is the face of Amazon Web Services. The cloud hosting business has turned into a revenue juggernaut for Amazon since its founding 14 years ago, earning $6.68 billion in the third quarter. AWS, as it's known, claims a third of the worldwide cloud market \u2014 but its biggest growth opportunity right now may come from the US government\n\nThe Seattle-based tech giant, which announced on Tuesday that it will plant a new headquarters a mile south of the Pentagon, already holds a number of contracts with federal agencies.It's in line for another $10 billion if it succeeds in its bid for a massive Defense Department contract known as JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure. Amazon is widely seen as the frontrunner to win the job,which involves hosting data operations critical to military missions across the globe.\n\nSecuring the JEDI contract would better set Amazon up to win additional lucrative cloud computing jobs from the federal government, as well as make it even more competitive in the civilian market. Meanwhile, the company is also pursuing another type of federal business: Serving as the portal for all government purchases, and charging fees along the way.\n\nAs Amazon takes a larger piece of the federal procurement pie, it could save taxpayer dollars and improve efficiency \u2014 but also, some fear, squeeze out competition.\n\n\"When you're in the door, when the next opportunity comes in, you have the competitive advantage,\" says Steve Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University. \"The reality is if you are the primary contractor in a certain space, people will turn to you for ideas and opportunities going forward. The growth is potentially unlimited.\"\n\nA slow build\n\nBefore Amazon ever went to Washington, its cloud computing operation had a leg up on everyone else.\n\nAmazon Web Services was born after Bezos realized that buying and maintaining physical warehouses to house data was less efficient than storing it on the internet. Once his engineers figured that out for Amazon's website, they realized they could sell the service to others \u2014 years before other tech companies got in the cloud-hosting game.\n\nWe faced no like-minded competition for 7 years. It's unbelievable.\" Jeff Bezos\n\n\"We faced no like-minded competition for 7 years. It's unbelievable,\" Bezos said at Economic Club event. \"The enterprise companies didn't see Amazon as a credible enterprise software company.\"\n\nIt still took a while to get the federal government \u2014 which has a history of pioneering new technologies, but is often slow to adopt them \u2014 on board.\n\nspent on traditional data centers each year. The shift began in 2010, when the incoming Obama administration began pushing federal agencies to put their data into the cloud in an effort to reduce the $19 billion theyspent on traditional data centers each year.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos speaking at the Economic Club in Washington, D.C. in September.\n\nAmazon was well-positioned to help.\n\nThe company had a substantial head start over competitors like Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM, which were heavily invested in providing the federal government with software and data centers. Moving into the cloud computing business would only cannibalize those steady revenue streams.\n\n\"The big benefit [Amazon] had was they could continue to innovate, because they didn't have to disrupt their own business,\" said Scott Drossos, president of Infiniti Consulting Group, which helps public sector clients move their data to Amazon Web Services' cloud.\n\nby the Obama administration to oversee the use of billions of dollars in stimulus spending following the recession \u2014 moved Recovery.gov to AWS' cloud. According to Amazon, that decision saved the government $750,000 in one year. In 2010, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board \u2014 an agency createdby the Obama administrationto oversee the use of billions of dollars in stimulus spending following the recession \u2014 moved Recovery.gov to AWS' cloud. According to Amazon, that decision saved the government $750,000 in one year. That same year , Amazon migrated NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, the Federal Register, the food stamp program and a wiki run by the Department of Energy.\n\nLater that year, Amazon hired Carlson away from Microsoft, where she had led federal sales for nine years, in order to turbocharge their presence in D.C.\n\ncloud. To assuage their concerns, Amazon created a federal data security requirements in part because it could only be accessed by vetted individuals on US soil. Still, federal IT bosses remained skeptical of the security of thecloud. To assuage their concerns, Amazon created a whole new cloud \"region,\" which complied withfederal data security requirements in part because it could only be accessed by vetted individuals on US soil.\n\nOver the years, Amazon layered in compliance with an alphabet soup of data security standards and procurement regulations, building further confidence in cloud data storage. They also had to acclimate contracting officers to the idea of buying computing capacity on a pay-as-you-go basis, rather than all at once.\n\nWhen Marina Martin came in as chief technology officer of the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2013, she took on the massive project of transitioning the agency's rickety IT systems to the cloud. Amazon Web Services was the most attractive option, Martin says.\n\n\"They have a tremendous community, and a training environment that I think is really important,\" Martin says, noting the conferences, videos, and wide network of users who help each other troubleshoot problems.\n\nBuilding such a robust product tailored for government and spending time holding the hands of federal officials paid off big in 2013, when Amazon won a $600 million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency, putting to rest any doubts about the security of stashing data in the cloud. Now, at Amazon Web Services' annual public sector summit in Washington, federal agencies sing the service's praises \u2014 and none more effusively than CIA Chief Information Officer John Edwards.\n\nin a 2017 \"We wanted the best of breed, that's why we partnered with Amazon,\" Edwards saidin a 2017 address to the AWS Public Sector Summit , an event that's taken place annually since 2010, and is now emceed by Carlson. \"It's the best decision we ever made. It's the most innovative thing we've ever done.\"\n\nIt's difficult to assess the total magnitude of Amazon Web Services' business with the federal government because so much of it \u2014 including the CIA contract \u2014 is classified, and Amazon declined to disclose a list of its federal clients. It's also difficult to track because the contracts are often granted to third-party firms that execute the task of migrating an agency's data to Amazon's cloud.\n\nBut as an indicator of how quickly the government has been ramping up these types of services, data and analytics firm Govini estimates that federal civilian agencies have gone from spending $13.5 million on non-classified Amazon cloud hosting contracts in fiscal 2014 to $45.3 million in 2017, with 2018 on pace to continue the upward trend.\n\nthe money Amazon has spent on lobbying has nonprofit watchdog Center for Responsive Politics. Federal procurement was one of many issues Amazon weighed in on, along with drones, data privacy, the Post Office, state sales taxes, international trade, net neutrality, and patents. The company Amazon has also learned to play the Washington game. Since 2013,the money Amazon has spent on lobbying has nearly quadrupled , to $13 million in 2017, according to thenonprofit watchdogCenter for Responsive Politics. Federal procurement was one of many issues Amazon weighed in on, along with drones, data privacy, the Post Office, state sales taxes, international trade, net neutrality, and patents. The company started lobbying the Pentagon on cloud computing policy in 2016.\n\nFeel the Force\n\nDefense Department The CIA contract is peanuts, though, in comparison to the prize Amazon is vying for now: The $10 billionDefense Department JEDI cloud contract\n\nFirst announced in September 2017, the solicitation has been delayed by Congressional inquiries and protests by other bidders. Bids were due in October, with an expected award date of April 2019.\n\nThe objections center mostly around whether the Pentagon should award the entire contract to one company, an approach that might favor Amazon, or divide it up among multiple companies. The private sector has moved towards a \"multi-cloud\" strategy in order to insure against failure by one company, and to utilize the best aspects of several different cloud providers. If Amazon wins a $10 billion chunk of the military's business, the fear is that it could set the military on a path toward using Amazon's platform for so much of its data that it would be difficult to change course.\n\nThat's the argument that Amazon's competitors have made publicly and in their lobbying efforts. Oracle filed a protest of the solicitation in August saying that awarding the contract to one company was out of step with commercial practices and did not promote competition. IBM followed suit in October, saying that the solicitation was \"written with just one company in mind,\" a thinly-veiled reference to Amazon.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Government Accountability Office ruled against Oracle, and a decision in IBM's protest is due in January. Even impartial observers note that going with just one provider carries risk.\n\nAmazon and several other big tech firms are vying for the $10 billion JEDI contract with the Department of Defense.\n\n\"Maybe it's more costly up front to say 'I'm going to do Amazon and Microsoft,'\" says Brad Wilson, an analyst at the Rand Group. \"The tradeoff is, you're increasing the complexity of your operation by doing that. But maybe keeping them competing is going to provide you with benefits or saving down the road.\"\n\nThe Defense Department defended its decision to go with a single provider in a report to Congress, saying that using multiple clouds would inhibit its ability to analyze information all at once \u2014 to create what it calls a \"data lake.\"\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, has emphasized that it makes it easy to switch between cloud providers by using open standards and allowing data portability, meaning that the Pentagon could hire someone else if it fails to perform. Other than that, it declined to comment on the solicitation process. Other defenders point out that JEDI wasn't the first big cloud solicitation from the federal government or even the military, and it won't be the last.\n\n\"Air Force, Army, Navy, they'll all have their own clouds,\" says John Wood, CEO of Telos, a federal IT contractor that often manages Amazon Web Services migrations. \"This is definitely not a winner-take-all initiative, as the competitors are trying to make it out to be.\"\n\nWood estimates that less than 5% of the federal government's data has been moved to the cloud, meaning that there's still plenty of work to be done.\n\nStill, even if opportunities abound and switching is easy, the federal contract could give Amazon an advantage long into the future. Steve Schooner, from George Washington University, says there's a certain inertia to government contracting.\n\n\"The firm that is in the Pentagon providing IT services to all of the different components who everyone looks to as the go-to contractor for all of their needs, they're going to be first in line when new innovations and technologies are introduced into the defense space,\" says Schooner.\n\n1-Click Government\n\nCloud storage isn't the only piece of the approximately $500 billion in annual federal procurement that Amazon has its eye on.\n\ncosting less than $25,000. It may also benefit from a provision to a law passed by Congress last year that directs the General Services Administration to set up \" commercial e-commerce portals \" for government purchase orderscosting less than $25,000.\n\nAmazon, which already has an extensive section on its website devoted to serving business customers, is an obvious choice \u2014 so much so that the legislation has commonly been referred to as the \"Amazon Amendment,\" even though companies like Walmart and SAP have also expressed interest in doing the job.\n\nBut some of the federal government's existing suppliers are worried, because of what it could cost to operate through Amazon's platform rather than selling to government directly.\n\nBecoming a GSA vendor requires an upfront investment in compliance systems, but then can be a valuable source of stable income. If Amazon became the primary procurement portal, it could not only charge fees to suppliers, but also compete against them with its own generic or branded products, as it does currently in its consumer retail business.\n\nSince 2004, Pacific Ink of San Diego has supplied federal customers with office and restroom supplies, and now does about $12 million in business per year with the General Services Administration. CEO Jaime Mautz thinks the feds should improve the procurement systems they have, rather than hand them over to a private platform \u2014 especially one like Amazon, which offers products that compete against those offered by sellers in its marketplace.\n\nIt's not a market if it's controlled by a private actor who decides what companies are allowed to sell what, and sets pricing according to the fees that it charges.\" Stacy Mitchell\n\n\"Already our margins are so thin to have these contracts,\" Mautz says. \"To then add any Amazon fee on top of that is going to take a lot of the companies out of the competition.\"\n\nto Amazon to provide its 55,000 member agencies with access to the Amazon's business portal. The It's already happened with purchasing on the state and local government level. In early 2017, a government purchasing alliance called US Communities awarded a contractto Amazon to provide its 55,000 member agencies with access to the Amazon's business portal. The request for proposals estimates that the program facilitates $500 million in purchases per year.\n\nThe Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit research group that has been skeptical of Amazon's local influence, produced a lengthy report over the summer arguing that the contract was set up for Amazon to win \u2014 and that it won't necessarily offer the lowest prices available.\n\n\"It's not a market if it's controlled by a private actor who decides what companies are allowed to sell what, and sets pricing according to the fees that it charges,\" says Stacy Mitchell, who coauthored the Institute for Local Self-Reliance report. \"Amazon's real aim is to take over enough of the business that you don't really have any benchmarks anymore to figure out what is a reasonable price.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Paula Bravo Medina", "title": "Detienen a 10 personas por explosi\u00f3n en cementerio de la Recoleta y paquete explosivo enviado al juez Bonadio", "description": "Tras la explosi\u00f3n de este mi\u00e9rcoles en el mausoleo del ex jefe de polic\u00eda Ram\u00f3n Falc\u00f3n en el cementerio de la Recoleta y el paquete explosivo enviado al domicilio personal del juez Claudio Bonadio, quien lleva adelante la investigaci\u00f3n de la denominada causa \u2026", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/15/detienen-a-10-personas-por-explosion-en-cementerio-de-la-recoleta-y-paquete-explosivo-enviado-al-juez-bonadio/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/whatsapp-image-2018-11-15-at-7-18-01-am.jpeg?quality=100&strip=info&w=1200", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:55:26Z", "content": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Tras la explosi\u00f3n de este mi\u00e9rcoles en el mausoleo del ex jefe de polic\u00eda Ram\u00f3n Falc\u00f3n en el cementerio de la Recoleta y el paquete explosivo enviado al domicilio personal del juez Claudio Bonadio, quien lleva adelante la investigaci\u00f3n de la d\u2026 [+1548 chars]", "fulltext": "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nUn joven fue detenido por arrojar un paquete explosivo en el patio de la residencia del juez Bonadio\n\nSe produjo una explosi\u00f3n en el cementerio de la Recoleta este mi\u00e9rcoles\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Tras la explosi\u00f3n de este mi\u00e9rcoles en el mausoleo del ex jefe de polic\u00eda Ram\u00f3n Falc\u00f3n en el cementerio de la Recoleta y el paquete explosivo enviado al domicilio personal del juez Claudio Bonadio, quien lleva adelante la investigaci\u00f3n de la denominada causa de los cuadernos de la supuesta corrupci\u00f3n, la Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina realiz\u00f3 un operativo encabezado por el jefe de la fuerza, N\u00e9stor Roncaglia, en el que se detuvieron en la madrugada de este jueves a 10 personas que permanecen incomunicadas, seg\u00fan confirmaron fuentes policiales a CNN.\n\n\n\nEn los allanamientos se encontraron p\u00f3lvora, mechas, ca\u00f1os y amoladoras, informaron desde la Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina.

Those numbers will then be certified by the secretary of state. We expect that 66 out of 67 counties will get there with time to spare (that includes Broward).\n\nThere is one county, however, that could complicate things.\n\nPalm Beach has been a serious problem since day one. They've been plagued with issues ranging from a system that won't allow all three races to be tabulated at the same time to machines breaking down and needing fixing. As it stands now, if Palm Beach cannot be done by 3 p.m., their numbers from the initial count will stand. That is not good for incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who needs new tabulations in Democratic-heavy counties with the hope votes will flip in his direction.\n\nWhat about that extension?\n\nThe Nelson legal team has a lawsuit pending to allow the deadline for the recount to be extended in every single county. It looks like the only county impacted by that will be Palm Beach. The case is currently being considered by Judge Mark Walker in federal court. At any time Thursday, Walker could hand down a ruling that grants an extension that would give Palm Beach time to get their recount done. That ruling could be very important, but it is not the only one.\n\nLawsuit mania\n\nIn court on Wednesday, Walker described his role in the rapidly increasing number of lawsuits related to the recount in \"Star Trek\" terms.\n\n\"I feel a little like Captain Kirk in the episode where the Tribbles started multiplying,\" the judge said.\n\nIt's important to remember that the path to victory for Nelson means winning these lawsuits and winning them in a way that a whole host of new votes are potentially added to the total.\n\nAlready, Thursday's developments do not bode well for Nelson.\n\nWalker ruled early Thursday that the state must give voters whose mismatched signatures disqualified their provisional and mail-in ballots until Saturday at 5 p.m. to correct those signature problems. But the ruling is narrower than the wider relief that Democrats were seeking -- to invalidate the signature-match requirement entirely. And the number of ballots in question is unclear. Judge Walker said in his ruling that there are about 5,000 total votes in play, but made it clear only people who were \"belatedly notified\" that there was a problem can seek relief. We don't know the full number impacted, but it is far less than the margin of votes separating him and his Republican challenger, Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nThe end of the governor's race\n\nThursday may be the day we can begin to feel comfortable calling Ron DeSantis governor-elect. We never expected the results of the governor's race to change, but the margin between the two candidates did end up in the recount territory. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee, rescinded his concession, continued to give speeches and on Wednesday, ominously tweeted, \"I believe that we will win.\" Thursday could bring the faint hope of a Gillum surge to an end. If the votes don't demonstrably change and the margin remains more than .25%, they will stop counting. The governor's race will be effectively over, if it wasn't already.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nThe biggest moment on Thursday will likely be the finality of the first recount. The secretary of state is expected to post the results all in one big batch sometime after 3 p.m. Once those numbers are posted, we should receive the official word about which hand recounts will be ordered. It is very likely both the Senate race and the agriculture commissioner race will fall in that category. While we wait for the recount results, we will patiently refresh the federal court's website for updates from Walker's chamber.\n\nWill he rule on any of these important cases? Will those rulings expand the pool of available votes or extend the amount of time the counties have to count their ballots? Those answers could all come on Thursday."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Brexit crisis engulfs British government", "description": null, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/collections/brexit-deal-fallout-intl/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:26:39Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Zahraa Alkhalisi, CNN Business", "title": "Spotify makes a play for the Middle East with an Arabic service", "description": "Spotify is bringing its services to the Middle East where it will compete with Deezer and local startup Anghami.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/tech/spotify-middle-east/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180330092002-01-spotify-tease-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:25:49Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Dubai (CNN Business) Spotify is bringing its services to the Middle East.\n\nThe music streaming platform has launched in 13 Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nUsers in the region will have full access to Spotify and a \"fully localized Arabic Spotify service with right-to-left text alignment,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nFans of Spotify ( SPOT ) could previously only access its services by using accounts registered in other countries.\n\nThe company is also launching a platform on its app to offer Arabic music globally, it added.\n\nBy moving into the region, Spotify is taking on Deezer, a French company backed by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, in the battle for a market of more than 300 million people.\n\nIn August, Deezer signed an exclusive agreement with Rotana, a Saudi-based media company owned by Prince Alwaleed, to distribute its content.

Courtesy Plan South America\n\nThe larger-than-life hand towers an impressive 36 feet (11 meters). It's taller than an NFL goal post and nearly as high as a yellow school bus is long. The nearest city of Antofagasta, still some 46-odd miles away, lays claim to the imposing structure.\n\nChilean sculptor Mario Irarr\u00e1zabal was asked by the townspeople to create a monument for the vast region of Atacama. And so he created the \"Hand of the Desert,\" protruding starkly from the sand and reaching for the brilliant blue sky.\n\nFinanced by local organization Corporaci\u00f3n Pro Antofagasta, the hand was constructed in 1992, from concrete and iron.\n\nThe meanings of the monument are unknown. Some say it is meant to be a reminder that humans should be humbled by nature and the elements. Others are convinced it is a display of humans rising against the odds.\n\nMario Irarr\u00e1zabal studied in the US, where he lived for five years, as well as in Italy and Germany. He returned to Chile in the late 1960s to dedicate his life to sculpting, and rejected a life in the clergy (his father was a church official, and he spent many years studying in church schools). He has won numerous awards for his striking work.\n\nUnfortunately, despite numerous signs urging tourists to refrain from defacing the monument, locals rally twice yearly to clean the sculpture, which is regularly covered in profanity-ridden graffiti.\n\nThe hand may strike a solitary figure in the desert, but actually it's part of a pair.\n\nIt's right counterpart sits in Uruguay. Built a decade earlier, in Punta del Este near the Atlantic Sea, an identical four fingers and thumb stretch for the skies, this time rising from the beach.\n\nRelated content Chilean hike joins short list of longest treks in the world\n\nGetting there\n\nTo get to the sculpture from Antofagasta, take Route 26 or 28, and drive until the road joins Route 5. The hand sits between mile 1309 and 1310, which are handily marked by the roadside.\n\nOnce you hit a road sign reading \"Escultura,\" there will be a path off to the right, which is the track to head down to encounter the hand.\n\nThe attraction has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more tour guides include the hand on their clients' itineraries.\n\nHarry Hastings, founder of Plan South America, says his agency always tries to incorporate a visit to the \"Mano del Desierto\" for any guests traveling to the Atacama Desert."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "merinojavier73", "title": "Paula Barrag\u00e1n, la ecuatoriana que dise\u00f1\u00f3 la imagen art\u00edstica de los Latin Grammy 2018", "description": "Zona Pop convers\u00f3 con la dise\u00f1adora del afiche de los Latin Grammy 2018, Paula Barrag\u00e1n", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/15/paula-barragan-la-ecuatoriana-que-diseno-la-imagen-artistica-de-los-latin-grammy-2018/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/paula-barragan-disenadora.jpg?quality=100&strip=info&w=1200", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:19:29Z", "content": "Nota del editor : Escucha Zona Pop en Apple Podcasts o en TuneIn si tienes Android y si tienes Spotify, suscr\u00edbete y comparte tus comentarios con la etiqueta #ZonaPOP.

Witnesses said Roberson bravely stopped the shooter and pinned him to the ground.\n\nBut shortly later, a Midlothian police officer shot and killed the security guard, leaving the mother of their child in shambles.\n\n\"A family member called me and told me. ... I just broke down crying in the bathroom. For a long time, I was in the bathroom,\" said Avontae Boose, who's pregnant with the couple's second child.\n\nTheir 9-month-old son Tristan is too young to understand what happened. But he knows his father is missing.\n\n\"He's just been calling (for) his dad,\" Boose said Thursday.\n\nSecurity guard Jemel Roberson, 26, wanted to become a police officer.\n\nMany community members are demanding answers as to why Roberson was killed. One major point of contention is whether Roberson was wearing anything with \"security\" written on it.\n\nWitness Adam Harris told CNN affiliate WGN that Roberson \"had somebody on the ground ... with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don't move.' \"\n\nMerritt lauded Roberson as \"the quintessential good guy with a gun\" for stopping an active shooter. \"But he still had to face the reality of being a black man in America,\" Merritt said.\n\nIllinois State Police described the events differently.\n\n\"According to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking\" the security guard, Illinois State Police said in a statement.\n\nMidlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney described the shooting as \"the equivalent of a 'blue on blue,' friendly fire incident.\"\n\nThe Roberson family's attorney disagreed.\n\n\"If this was a case where they saw this as a friendly fire, as if a police officer was shot, then this would be handled much differently,\" Merritt said. \"There would be more transparency.\"\n\nSpecifically, Merritt said authorities should identify the officer.\n\n\"It's important to put that name and face out in the public spectrum because it allows the community to report if this officer has a history of brutality,\" he said. \"That information certainly becomes relevant for any future criminal proceedings.\"\n\nMidlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney has not identified the officer, but said he is a white male who has worked with the department for about four years. Per standard policy, the officer is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police investigation.\n\n\"What we have also learned is Jemel Roberson was a very brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room,\" Delaney said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his mother, his entire family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\"\n\nBoose, now grappling with the reality of raising two children without their father, is already thinking about what she will tell her children about their dad.\n\n\"He was a good father. He was a hero,\" Boose said.\n\n\"I'm going to tell them when they get older -- when they get real older -- what happened to their father. That he was a hero, and he saved a lot of people.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "herbertholguin", "title": "Su donaci\u00f3n de ri\u00f1\u00f3n podr\u00eda salvar la vida de su nieta en el futuro", "description": "Quer\u00eda ser donante, pero no hab\u00eda forma de saber si su nieta necesitar\u00eda un ri\u00f1\u00f3n o cu\u00e1ndo.

El ecografista se mostr\u00f3 optimista y se\u00f1al\u00f3 todas las diferentes partes de las ni\u00f1as. Pero cuando entr\u00f3 el m\u00e9dico, el tono cambi\u00f3.\n\nAunque Aubrey parec\u00eda estar saludable y creciendo bien, el ultrasonido revel\u00f3 quistes en uno de los ri\u00f1ones de Delly.\n\nLos Adams fueron invitados a reunirse con un consejero gen\u00e9tico. El diagn\u00f3stico: ri\u00f1\u00f3n displ\u00e1sico multiqu\u00edstico, que se cree afecta a uno de cada 3.500 nacimientos. Ocurre cuando el ri\u00f1\u00f3n est\u00e1 mal formado y lleno de quistes y, como resultado, no puede funcionar. En la mayor\u00eda de los casos, los ni\u00f1os que tienen un solo ri\u00f1\u00f3n viven una vida normal; el ri\u00f1\u00f3n restante se har\u00e1 cargo y esencialmente har\u00e1 doble funci\u00f3n. Pero en algunos casos, un trasplante de ri\u00f1\u00f3n puede ser necesario.\n\nMcNeil, la abuela de las gemelas, quer\u00eda ser donante, pero no hab\u00eda manera de saber si Delly podr\u00eda necesitar un ri\u00f1\u00f3n o cu\u00e1ndo.\n\n\"Fue realmente abrumador y devastador\", dijo Adams.\n\nLa larga espera por un ri\u00f1\u00f3n sano\n\nDelly y Aubrey nacieron seis semanas antes de tiempo, en diciembre de 2015. Debido a su diagn\u00f3stico, Delly fue internada de inmediato en la unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales para el monitoreo. \"Ni siquiera pude abrazarla el d\u00eda que naci\u00f3\", dijo Adam.\n\nA los 6 d\u00edas de nacida, Delly comenz\u00f3 a experimentar insuficiencia renal. A los 3 meses, su ri\u00f1\u00f3n sano no hab\u00eda crecido tanto como los m\u00e9dicos hab\u00edan esperado.\n\nSu nefr\u00f3logo comenz\u00f3 a hablar sobre la posible necesidad de un trasplante, no de inmediato, pero tal vez pronto.\n\n\"Un certificado de regalo para un \u00f3rgano\"\n\nPara aquellos que necesitan un trasplante de ri\u00f1\u00f3n, la espera es larga. De las casi 100.000 personas que esperaron un ri\u00f1\u00f3n el a\u00f1o pasado, solo alrededor del 20% pudieron encontrarlo, seg\u00fan la Red de Organizaci\u00f3n de \u00d3rganos.

Sabiendo que Delly podr\u00eda alg\u00fan d\u00eda encontrarse a s\u00ed misma en la lista de espera de un ri\u00f1\u00f3n, Adams y su madre, McNeil, comenzaron a buscar opciones para prepararse.\n\nLEE: \u00c9l don\u00f3 sangre todas las semanas durante 60 a\u00f1os y salv\u00f3 la vida de 2,4 millones de beb\u00e9s\n\nMcNeil no dud\u00f3: so\u00f1aba con ser donante. Pero tiene m\u00e1s de 50 a\u00f1os y es probable que ya sea demasiado vieja para donar cuando Delly necesite un ri\u00f1\u00f3n.\n\nY as\u00ed es como se encontraron con un programa nuevo e innovador, el Programa de Vales del Registro Nacional del Ri\u00f1\u00f3n.\n\nEsencialmente, es \"un certificado de regalo para un \u00f3rgano\", dijo Adams.\n\nDonantes \"esperando su destinatario\"\n\nEl programa comenz\u00f3 en la Universidad de California en Los \u00c1ngeles hace cuatro a\u00f1os cuando Howard Broadman, de 64 a\u00f1os, se acerc\u00f3 al Programa de Intercambio de Ri\u00f1ones de la UCLA, dirigido por el cirujano de trasplantes Jeffrey Veale con la idea de donar su ri\u00f1\u00f3n a un desconocido ahora a cambio de un vale que potencialmente proporcionar\u00eda un ri\u00f1\u00f3n para su nieto en el futuro.\n\nAl igual que Delly, el nieto de Broadman, Quinn, entonces de 4 a\u00f1os, naci\u00f3 con una enfermedad renal cr\u00f3nica. Y al igual que McNeil, Broadman probablemente ser\u00eda demasiado viejo para donar cuando el ni\u00f1o lo necesitase.\n\nVeale reflexion\u00f3 sobre la idea. Los trasplantes de donantes vivos pueden reducir los tiempos de espera por a\u00f1os, y las investigaciones han demostrado que los ri\u00f1ones de donantes vivos tienden a superar a los donantes fallecidos.\n\nVeale decidi\u00f3 agregar a Broadman al grupo de donantes para iniciar una cadena. A cambio, Quinn recibi\u00f3 un cup\u00f3n que lo colocar\u00eda al final de una cadena futura una vez que necesitara un ri\u00f1\u00f3n.\n\n\"El cup\u00f3n se capitaliza en pares donante-receptor que son cronol\u00f3gicamente incompatibles\", dijo Veale. \"Estos son pacientes que quieren donar su ri\u00f1\u00f3n ahora, pero est\u00e1n esperando a su ser querido, que todav\u00eda no necesita un ri\u00f1\u00f3n\".\n\nLa adici\u00f3n de desajustes cronol\u00f3gicos en el grupo de donantes solo mejora las posibilidades de todos de encontrar un donante, explic\u00f3 Nicole Turgeon, cirujana de trasplantes de la Universidad de Emory y doctora de McNeil.\n\nLEE: Adultos mayores, incluso de m\u00e1s de 80, pueden ser donantes de \u00f3rganos, seg\u00fan estudio\n\nTodos los cupones se coordinan a trav\u00e9s de las bases de datos de donantes vivos del Registro Nacional del Ri\u00f1\u00f3n. Al menos 36 cupones han sido distribuidos, y dos han sido canjeados. Un cup\u00f3n solo puede ser activado por la persona para la que fue designado inicialmente y caduca cuando el titular del cup\u00f3n fallece.\n\nLas tres primeras \"donaciones de cupones\" generaron 25 trasplantes.\n\nPara Delly y su abuela, el programa de vales fue la respuesta.\n\n'Un sue\u00f1o hecho realidad'\n\nEn septiembre, McNeil don\u00f3 su ri\u00f1\u00f3n a un extra\u00f1o.

Melania showed she knows how to play like a Trump and the President is likely none too happy about it.\n\nRecapping the Ricardel story requires going back to the first lady's trip to Africa in October. Ricardel clashed with the first lady's staff over travel arrangements as she accompanied Mrs. Trump and apparently behaved in ways that bothered the President's wife so much that she concluded that the White House would be better off without Ricardel.\n\nAlthough Mrs. Trump made her opinion known, the President did not act immediately. Despite the \"You're fired!\" character he played on TV, Trump is not someone who enjoys dismissing people face-to-face. If he went to Ricardel's superior, John Bolton, he likely met resistance. Bolton is as ornery in real life as Trump pretended to be on \"The Apprentice.\" So it was that the matter was left to fester.\n\nThe idea that Bolton tried to protect Ricardel makes sense when you consider her reputation. Like Bolton, Ricardel is regarded as a master of bureaucratic infighting who isn't shy about letting people know how she feels. She and Bolton made for a matched pair.\n\nIn an administration where intrigue consumes inordinate amounts of time and energy, the Ricardel-first lady tussle might have remained a standoff as long as Bolton was around to protect his second-in-command. However Bolton left for Asia on Sunday and Melania Trump apparently saw her opening.\n\nWith Bolton half a world away, the first lady took the unprecedented step of ordering the release of a statement expressing her opinion of Ricardel. \"...She no longer deserves the honor of serving in the White House,\" said Melania Trump's communications director.\n\nWith this unprecedented declaration, President Trump was cornered. (When Nancy Reagan was first lady, she quarreled with the White House chief of staff, who was forced out, but the conflict took place less publicly.)\n\nThe public nature of the first lady's statement put the President in an extremely awkward position. He couldn't find a way to look strong in the face of his wife's public call for a top aide's dismissal.\n\nConsider the choices Trump faced. On the one hand he could defy his wife. Given how she had crossed a bright-line boundary with her statement, the President had to believe she would escalate the conflict. And who, out of all the people in the world, would be more dangerous to Trump than his wife? The answer is obvious. No one.\n\nTrump's less-worse option was to get Ricardel out, and this is the action he chose. He attempted to save face by saying the deputy adviser would be transferred to an unspecified job, but no one should accept this fiction. The President caved.\n\nIf Trump feels the victim of pressure from his wife, it's because he has created in his marriage a perfectly Trumpian dynamic. As a man who believes that life is about winners and losers, Trump has long approached every human endeavor as a desperate battle for primacy. If you are not the boss, then you are being bossed, and for him this condition is unbearably humiliating.\n\nHumiliation is the name of Trump's game. When he calls people names, declares them to be \"low IQ\" or observes that a man like John McCain wasn't a hero because he was taken prisoner in Vietnam, he attempts to deprive others of their dignity. He also reveals that his own great fear is to be diminished in the same way.\n\nBeating Trump requires finding a way to turn the tables without lowering oneself. This can only be done by someone whose decency is fully established and whose status cannot be ignored.\n\nMelania Trump has distinguished herself from her husband by showing concern for the asylum-seeking families he separated at the border and developing an anti-bullying initiative. The goodness in these activities, both of which contrast with her husband's cruelty, gave her the standing to act against Ricardel.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn a week when midterm election losses continued to accumulate and criticism of President Trump's failure to attend an event honoring America's veterans grew, Melania Trump's challenge was perfectly timed. She added one more problem to his agenda -- one he could only resolve by allowing himself to be humbled.\n\nThe lessons in this episode are many. First, it's plain Mrs. Trump knows her husband's game and can play it. Second, the President can be beaten. Third, and most importantly, he's his own worst enemy, the victim of the concept that everything is about winning and losing and that defeat comes with humiliation. As a man who has always acted with this calculus in mind, he cannot trust that anyone will feel genuine concern for his feelings. The man who relishes humiliating others is destined to suffer it himself."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jane Merrick", "title": "May's fate in the balance as Brexit deal wobbles", "description": "From the moment she took over as Prime Minister more than two years ago, Theresa May must have known this day would come.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/opinions/may-fate-brexit-deal-merrick-gbr-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115103449-01-theresa-may-1115-parliament-grab-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:50:32Z", "content": "Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper.

The future of both the Prime Minister and the country depends on what happens in the next 24 hours.\n\nBritish politics is now no longer only divided between people who want to remain in the EU and those who want to leave.

Or it could be a sign that the world economy is sick.\n\nThe abrupt bear market in oil prices may have been sparked by a sharp drop-off in demand for energy, which powers the economy.\n\nInvestors were similarly spooked by oil's last major selloff , in late 2015 and early 2016. That dive to $26 a barrel led some to fear an imminent recession. That proved to be a false alarm.\n\n\"There are shades of this that remind me of the latter part of 2015,\" Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said on Wednesday.\n\n\"The question today is: Is oil again pretending to be that canary in the coal mine around slower global growth?\" Corbat said while speaking at the Economic Club of New York. \"Because if you look at supply-demand figures, nothing at all has materially changed in the last week or two.\"\n\nSupply shock\n\nAnalysts are divided over how much the oil selling is being driven by simple supply worries rather than a more alarming drop in demand.\n\nIt's clear that supply fears deserve at least some of the blame. Saudi Arabia and the United States are pumping record amounts of oil. US output alone is expected to spike by 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018.\n\nAll of that left the oil market brimming when US sanctions on Iran had a more muted impact than expected. Rather than carrying out its threat to zero out Iranian oil shipments, the Trump administration granted temporary waivers to China, India and six other countries.\n\nGlobal growth slowdown\n\nBut demand is also playing a role.\n\nThe International Energy Agency said on Wednesday that while US demand for oil has been \"very robust,\" demand in Europe and developed Asian countries \"continues to be relatively weak.\" The IEA also warned of a \"slowdown\" in demand in developing nations such as India, Brazil and Argentina caused by high oil prices, weak currencies and deteriorating economic activity.\n\nUS oil production has skyrocketed more than investors anticipated.\n\n\"The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated,\" the IEA wrote.\n\nIndeed, data published on Wednesday show that the economies of both Germany and Japan outright contracted in the third quarter. It's the first time that the Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, is shrinking since the third quarter of 2015.\n\nLast month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 GDP estimates for both China and the United States due to the trade war. The IMF expects global growth to slow to 2.5% in 2019 from 2.9% this year.\n\nDemand mostly to blame?\n\nAll of this helps explain why Ziad Daoud, chief Middle East economist at Bloomberg Economics, estimates that weaker demand was responsible for 85% of the decline in Brent crude since the October 3 high. The rest was caused by the supply shock.\n\n\"The lower oil price is reflective of reduced expectations for global energy demand,\" Daoud wrote in a report on Wednesday.\n\nBut the good news is that Daoud doesn't believe the oil market knows something the rest of the world doesn't. It's simply playing catch-up.\n\n\"We're seeing the symptom of slower global GDP growth, not a new shock to the world,\" he wrote.\n\nEd Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, agrees that crude oil does not appear to be a canary in the coal mine.\n\n\"I'm not particularly worried,\" Yardeni said. \"I don't think the price of oil is telling me that we have a sudden weakening in the global economy.\"\n\nYardeni noted that while S&P 500 profits and corporate spending got dinged by the oil rout three years ago, the economic expansion managed to continue.\n\n\"It was a calamity for anyone in the commodity business, but not for the global economy,\" Yardeni said.\n\nNicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said that he won't get overly concerned unless crude collapses much further.\n\n\"If it gets below $45, markets will pay much more attention,\" Colas said.\n\nGood news for drivers\n\nThe oil selloff thus far will cut both ways for the United States because the nation is both the largest consumer and producer of oil.\n\nRecall that the 2014-2016 oil plunge sparked dozens of bankruptcies and hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the oil patch. Major energy-producing states like Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma suffered.

It is people's lives, and it is upsetting that people are having their lives attacked just so this man can exercise his latest obsession.\"\n\nSo said Jane Fae, writer and campaigner for the rights of LGBT people and women, when I spoke to her on Tuesday about Emile Ratelband, the 69-year-old Dutchman who has embarked on a new venture to have his age legally changed to 49. Ratelband -- who describes himself as a \" positivity guru \" -- has heavily referenced the trans movement in his arguments, protesting: \"We live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender. Why can't I decide my own age?\"\n\nWell, lots of reasons. But when Fae, who is a trans woman, met Ratelband on the BBC morning news program \"Victoria Derbyshire\" to discuss them on Monday, Ratelband interrupted her so much that she was unable to finish many of her sentences. So I called her up to hear the rest of what she had to say.\n\n\"Emile talks of trans being a feeling, which it is, in the sense I describe,\" explained Fae during our chat. \"But underpinning that 'feeling' is a well-documented and defined phenomenon, recognized and researched by medical professionals for decades, affecting hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people.\n\n\"That is very different to a feeling expressed by a lone individual with a track record of pursuing one fad after another for a few months at a time, and piggybacking issues in an apparent attempt to raise his media profile.\"\n\nThis is indeed not the first time Ratelband, whose bid for youth has garnered worldwide coverage , has made a swift -- and shallow -- dive into a new venture. In 2003, Ratelband started his own political party, The Ratelband List , which was based on the model of the Islamophobic Dutch politician, Pim Fortuyn. The Ratelband List took part in the elections for the Dutch House of Representatives on January 22, 2003, but failed to win a single seat.\n\nSince then, nothing has been heard of the party. During the BBC interview, and in many others , he has consistently framed his urge to change his age as a choice, referring to his \"free will,\" and complaining that his chronological age of 69 was damaging his chances on the dating app Tinder\n\nJUST WATCHED NYT: Trump camp trying to 'erase' transgender definition Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NYT: Trump camp trying to 'erase' transgender definition 02:56\n\n\"I am not an old man, I am a wise man,\" he told Fae at the BBC. \"Always I have to defend myself, I have to lie about my age.\" Perhaps he is unaware of -- or unwilling to pay up for -- the upgraded version of Tinder, on which you can conceal your vintage.\n\nIt is incredibly obvious that Ratelband has given no serious thought to his proposal that people be designated a \"biological,\" rather than a chronological age. Reverse engineer his idea a second -- are 45-year-olds who aren't in great shape to be declared \"actually 65?\" And while he claims he would be happy to give up his pension if he legally became 49, would he be happy for those \"new\" 65-year-olds to claim one?\n\nAll of the prejudice Ratelband has complained of is theoretical, rather than born of lived personal experience. He has bemoaned the fact that it is harder for old people to get a mortgage (he has one), and a job (he has one of those too). He has seven children already and is expecting an eighth with a surrogate. \"For me, the following applies: not the burden of the woman, but the lusts of the children,\" he told the AD\n\nJUST WATCHED Caitlyn Jenner says she was wrong about Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Caitlyn Jenner says she was wrong about Trump 00:45\n\nIt is strange, also, that as someone so apparently exercised about the stigma older people face, he has made no effort whatsoever to tackle it so that others may benefit. Mortgage companies, for example, are most interested in the number of years you are likely yet to live, which would not change if one was assigned a new number. And the people who are stigmatized by age are mostly women . But Ratelband's solution to the problems of age, it seems, is simply not to be old. And his advocacy is focused exclusively on himself.\n\n\"He was someone I thought I might sympathize with,\" Fae told me. \"But (during the BBC interview) he very quickly moved into my space, effectively erasing me and Victoria, the whole studio thing was all about him. Every time I made a point, he reverted to his. That's his whole politics, it's about moving into someone's space and erasing them.\"\n\nRatelband's insistence on comparing his own situation with the trans movement is not just offensive. It highlights the inadequacies of his argument. It is not necessary to say that trans discrimination is \"like\" other forms of discrimination, because it has a nuance and well-documented history in and of itself. Furthermore, while changing his age would apparently lessen the prejudice Ratelband feels he faces, transitioning can have the exact opposite effect. People who transition are likely to face at the very least prejudice, and at worst physical violence . But the urge to do so is so strong, that people proceed despite this. \"I would have done anything and everything to transition, once I knew I could,\" Fae explained. \"It was overwhelmingly impossible not to.\"\n\nThis distinction seems utterly lost on Ratelband, who for all his protestations that he is a \"wise man,\" exhibits a depth of thought comparable to one of his political heroes: Donald Trump. He claims that Trump is a \"new\" kind of person, unrestricted by the limitations placed on previous Presidents.\n\nRatelband has conveniently ignored the administration's attacks on transgender people , instead gushing in an interview with the Washington Post that POTUS \"is just himself.\" \"Trump is the first one who is honest. He shows his emotion on Twitter, saying to everyone 'shut up.' He's a new kind of person.\"\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nTrump isn't \"new,\" though. And neither is Ratelband. Both represent a very old, tedious form of white male privilege whose response to not getting precisely what they want, no matter how inane, is to stomp their feet and talk over everyone else. Neither exhibits any shame as they claim victimhood for things which they are not victims of, and neither has any regard for the consequences of their actions for other people. An Arnhem court is expected to rule on Ratelband's case within a few weeks. Let us hope it tells him to start behaving like an adult and leaves his age unchanged."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Missing ballerina found dead in lake", "description": "Authorities are investigating the death of a St. Louis ballerina who was found dead in a rural Missouri lake, the state's highway patrol said.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/11/15/st-louis-ballet-dancer-found-dead-vpx.hln", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115072859-st-louis-ballet-dancer-found-dead-vpx-00000819-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:35:22Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Like other big retailers, such as Home Depot and Macy's this week, Walmart has been lifted by rising wages and low unemployment.\n\n\"Consumers remained in good shape,\" CFO Brent Biggs said on a call with reporters Thursday. \"Certainly, this kind of environment everybody likes.\"\n\nFacing tough competition during the holidays, Walmart is outfitting store workers with mobile checkout scanners to ring up customers on the spot. It is also adding detailed digital store maps to its mobile app to allow shoppers to quickly find aisles and products.\n\nExecuting a strategy\n\nWalmart has recently been operating a two-track plan designed for different customer segments.\n\nIt's offering cheaper and more convenient ways to buy groceries for its low-and-middle income base at stores, while scooping up high-end digital brands and retailers\u2014 including Eloquii and Bare Necessities last quarter \u2014 to draw wealthier shoppers online.\n\nWalmart's spread-out store base is its biggest competitive advantage to reach mid-income shoppers. 90% of the US population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart. It has poured investments into cleaning up those stores and ensuring items are in stock on the shelves.\n\nThe store base allows Walmart to offer time-pressed shoppers new options to choose from, such as delivery, curbside pickup and pickup in automated towers inside hundreds of stores.\n\nWalmart will expand curbside pickup to around 3,100 stores by next year and grocery delivery to reach 60% of the country.\n\n\"We feel that we get a good halo effect around it,\" Walmart US CEO Greg Foran said about the new improvements in online grocery.\n\nWalmart's clothing and toy sales gained last quarter, too. It has been growing its toy selection to pick up the market Toys \"R\" Us left behind when it filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\"Toys are going to continue to be a big focus for us,\" Walmart US CEO Greg Foran told reporters.\n\nThe company is taking several steps online.\n\nIt has redesigned its website to appeal to wealthier customers and convince top brands to sell on it. For example, Walmart announced a partnership with Advance Auto Parts last quarter for a dedicated storefront on the site.\n\nTo appeal to younger and wealthier shoppers in cities, Walmart last quarter relaunched Jet.com, the online marketplace it bought two years ago from Lore for $3.3 billion.\n\nJet is offering speedy grocery delivery and adding premium brands like Nike, Apple, Blue Apron and Bonobos that can't sell on Walmart's main site yet.\n\nWalmart does not need to beat Amazon ( AMZN ) online since it already gets close to $500 billion in sales from its stores.\n\n\"The race online is not to catch Amazon. That's like trying to chase a Ferrari on foot,\" O'Shea said. Instead, Walmart needs to become an alternative to Amazon. Here, it's fighting against resurgent retailers like Target, Best Buy, and Kohl's.\n\nBut it has a long way to go. Walmart has to ramp up the number of items it sells online while also finding a way to make money off them. Walmart mainly offers highly popular items right now, but those sales carry lower profit margins."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Katie Lobosco, CNN Business", "title": "NAFTA replacement gets one hearing before Trump signs a deal", "description": "President Donald Trump is set to formally sign a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement in just two weeks -- but the deal still needs to be approved by Congress before it can take effect.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/business/new-nafta-usmca-hearing/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181001155350-nafta-presidents-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:23:16Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington (CNN Business) President Donald Trump is set to formally sign a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement in just two weeks -- but the Republican loss of the House in the midterms means he'll need Democratic support to get the deal through Congress next year.\n\nAdministration officials have expressed optimism they'll be able to get Democrats on board, but comments from senior party figures at a hearing Thursday on the new trade deal suggested it will be an uphill battle.\n\n\"There are certainly some improvements in the USMCA over the previous NAFTA, but the jury is still out as to whether this deal meets my standard for a better deal for American workers,\" said New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell, currently the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade.\n\nHe called on the International Trade Commission to determine whether it will bring back jobs, boost wages and cut the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico -- as the Trump administration has promised.\n\n\"As claims start to be made about the miracles that the new NAFTA will bring, we are relying on you, this commission, the International Trade Commission, to tell it like it really is,\" he said.\n\nHis comments came at the start of a two-day hearing scheduled for Thursday and Friday by the ITC in Washington. The gathering offers a roadmap to issues lawmakers will consider, including the impact of the renegotiated deal on agriculture, industry and data privacy.\n\nRepresentatives from auto, agriculture, tech and retail, as well as labor and environmental advocacy groups, are scheduled to testify. Along with Pascrell, Michigan Rep. Sander Levin spoke early Monday.\n\nLevin, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year, argued that the changes made by the USMCA won't address the failure of the current NAFTA to require labor reform in Mexico, which he said has been the cause of job losses in the United States under the deal.\n\n\"Failure to rectify the basic flaw in and the major source of controversy over NAFTA 25 years ago will jeopardize support from the new House Democratic majority,\" Levin said.\n\nTrump and his counterparts Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico have agreed to sign the deal before December 1, when Mexican president-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador takes office. It's not yet clear exactly when or where the leaders plan to do the signing ceremony. All three are due to gather at the annual G20 world leaders summit in Argentina at the end of November.\n\nThe ITC will have until 105 days after the signing, or mid-March, to deliver its report to Congress on the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA. But there is no legislative deadline for ratification.\n\nSome Democrats have been hesitant to throw their support behind the USMCA, which was first announced at the end of September. Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, who's set to take over the House Ways in Means Committee next year, has said \"the bar for supporting a new NAFTA will be high.\"\n\n\"So much is unknown about what the Democrats want right now, but that will become more clear as the new members get sworn in,\" said Welles Orr, senior international trade adviser at Miller and Chevalier, and a former Assistant US Trade Representative under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nTrump's own negotiators have expressed optimism that Democrats would get on board with the deal, in part due to improved labor standards and environmental protections that have been worked in.\n\n\"I think it's going to pass. And I think it's going to pass with a substantial majority,\" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said at Trump's Rose Garden news conference announcing the deal.\n\nThe new trade agreement was precipitated by Trump's decision to get rid of the original NAFTA, which he's called the \"worst trade deal\" ever signed. Negotiators from all three countries began talks on updating it more than a year ago.\n\nThe draft deal, agreed in September, differs from the 1993 NAFTA deal in several key ways. With respect to labor and environmental standards, it requires that 40% to 45% of car and truck parts be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. Also, Mexico has committed to recognize workers' right to collectively bargain, and the three countries agreed to enforce rights recognized by the International Labor Organization.\n\nThe USMCA lists a number of issues that the three countries have committed to addressing, including over-fishing, illegal wildlife trade and logging.\n\nLabor groups like the AFL-CIO and environmental groups like the Sierra Club have expressed concern about how those new standards will be enforced -- and some Democrats agree.\n\n\"The enforcement is non-existent...You can have nice words but [if] there's no way to enforce them, it doesn't really do anything,\" said Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, earlier this week at an AFL-CIO event.\n\nChanges to enforcement could be made after the deal is signed, either in the legislative approval or in a side deal between the countries, Orr said. He added that he expects the deal to ultimately pass Congress.\n\n\"There will be fits and starts, but I bet they can find a way forward,\" he said.\n\nFormer Republican Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, now president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said he was optimistic that the new agreement will \"help maintain the competitiveness\" of the industry. The group represents represents Fiat Chrysler, GM and Ford.\n\nOne of the most notable changes in the USMCA has to do with the way cars and trucks are manufactured. In order for a vehicle to be free from tariffs, more of its parts will have to be made in North America.\n\nBlunt called the new rules of origin \"workable.\" But others from the auto industry said the new restriction is complex and would be costly to comply with.\n\n\"Automakers will need to invest in elaborate processes to ensure compliance with these rules,\" said John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers.\n\nBut the companies remain concerned about the existing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, which Blunt said drives up the cost of producing in the United States by $400 per vehicle. Trump put the tariffs in place earlier this year, arguing that the domestic industries need to be protected in the interest of national security.\n\nThe auto industry is also concerned about Trump's threat to impose new tariffs on imported cars and parts.\n\nThe tariffs \"would have a profound negative effect on the entire industry and the US economy as a whole, wiping out the benefits the USMCA might generate,\" Blunt said.\n\nThe USMCA included a side deal that exempts Canada and Mexico from any new tariffs the Untied States puts on autos in the future, as long as they import under a certain threshold."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Kieron Monks", "title": "Morocco to get Africa's first high-speed train", "description": "A $2 billion project will see 200-mph trains run from Tangier to Casablanca starting in 2018, and cutting the journey time by more than half.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/morocco-high-speed-tgv-trains/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170118100834-tgv-maroc-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:17:17Z", "content": "(CNN) French President Emmanuel Macron and Morocco's King Mohammed VI are expected to inaugurate Africa's first high-speed rail line on Thursday.

They will cut the journey time between the two cities by more than half -- to just over two hours. This is double the speed of South Africa's Gautrain , launched in 2012, which falls short of the criteria for high-speed rail.\n\nThe $2 billion project has been in development for a decade, funded by the governments of Morocco, France, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE.\n\nKing Mohammed VI and the Moroccan government expect the trains to deliver wealth and prestige for the country. But opponents claim they are an expensive folly.\n\nThe TGV high-speed train are being tested on Morocco's Atlantic coast.

Peugeot is thinking about creating a plant in Kenitra , and if the high speed train goes through this city it would create a logistics hub for them.\"\n\nThe new train line will impress foreign investors but they are likely to remain wary of Morocco, according to Riccardo Fabiani, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group.\n\n\"If you are a businessman deciding to install an operation in Africa and you are torn between Morocco and another country, this kind of modern world-class infrastructure could help tip the balance,\" he says. \"But there are other problems with the domestic economy.\"\n\nFabiani cites poor governance and corruption as major concerns, as well as \"human capital\" issues such as a severely under-performing education system . These issues reflect the priorities of a government which is comfortable with uneven development, he believes.\n\n\"The current authorities are replicating the colonial model of looking at some areas like Tangier and Casablanca but forgetting the rest of country,\" says the analyst. \"So there is world class infrastructure in one area and untarred roads in others.\"\n\nThe new train line could provide a boost to Morocco's auto industry. FADEL SENNA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNot all aboard\n\nSuch disparities have fueled the \" Stop TGV \" campaign, a coalition of activists arguing that the investment could be better used for failing public services.\n\n\"Morocco is a poor country and the top priority should be education,\" says Omar Balafraj, a leader campaigner and member of parliament for the Federation of the Democratic Left party.\n\nBalafraj tells a joke that he feels captures the folly of the project: \"A man meets a homeless man who is almost naked, and asks him what he needs. He answers: 'only a ring.'\"\n\nBut despite such reservations, the project is almost certainly too far advanced now to be stopped in its tracks."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author":

Bhutanese conjoined twins who were separated by doctors in Australia last week still want to be close to each other, nurses have told reporters.\n\n15-month-old sisters Dawa and Nima Pelden flew nearly 6,000 miles for the life-changing operation. They were born joined at the stomach.\n\nBhutanese twins Dawa and Nima insist on being near each other despite being separated.\n\nNurse coordinator Kellie Smith, who works on the twins' ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital, told reporters Thursday that the pair are never far from one another.\n\n\"We try and have them a little bit apart,\" Smith said, according to CNN affiliate Channel 7. \"But they manage to sort of bum shuffle back together and have their legs intertwined always.\"\n\nThe nurse added that ward staff initially tried putting the twins in separate beds but \"they didn't like that at all.\"\n\n\"They're in the one bed together and just happy playing with one another, and it's actually beautiful to see,\" Smith added.\n\n\"They like their mother close too. They're always looking for mum and she's never far away.\"\n\nThe 15-month-old twins flew nearly 6,000 mlies to Australia for the life-changing operation.\n\nGirls have followed 'the path that we set out for them'\n\nLead pediatric surgeon Joe Crameri said the girls were doing well six days after the operation.\n\n\"The girls have followed largely the path that we set out for them,\" he said, CNN affiliate Channel 7 reported.\n\n\"Like any surgical pathway, there has been a few bumps in the road, and there are a few bumps we're still smoothing out -- but with all the resources we've got here at the Children's Hospital ... we're making good progress at the current time.\"\n\nLead pediatric surgeon Joe Crameri said the twins were getting back to normal life by eating again and starting to move around.\n\nCrameri added that the sisters were \"getting back to a more normal life.\"\n\n\"They're back to eating, and they're starting to move around and the areas that we've repaired on their tummy wall seems to be holding up with the strain quite nicely.\"\n\nThe delicate procedure, carried out November 9, took more than six hours and involved about 25 surgeons, nurses and anesthetists, according to CNN affiliate 9 News.\n\nThe twins were born via cesarean section last year and are believed to be Bhutan's first conjoined twins. As well as issues with mobility and comfort, the twins had recently been losing weight, which was a concern to doctors, Elizabeth Lodge, CEO of Melbourne-based nonprofit Children First Foundation, which funded the operation said last month.\n\nThe girls' operation was estimated to cost about $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), according to 9 News.\n\n'Delightful to look after'\n\nNurse coordinator Smith said Nima and Dawa have been a delight to look after, and that their personalities were shining through.\n\nMegan Collins, another nurse on the ward, agreed that the pair were in good spirits.\n\n\"They're loving interacting with the nursing staff,\" Collins said.\n\nThe operation was estimated to have cost around $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), which was raised by Children First Foundation.\n\n\"We're now blowing bubbles and doing high fives, they love it when we're watching the Wiggles -- they'll do little dance moves with their hands and what-not,\" Channel 7 reported Collins as saying during a press conference.\n\n\"It's really nice to see them separated. But they're still really happy about wanting to be close to one another.\"\n\nDifficult surgery\n\nConjoined twins occur once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 70% are female, and they are always identical twins.\n\nScientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.\n\n\"The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThey were previously commonly referred to as \"Siamese twins,\" a name that originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. Never separated, they lived to the age of 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them.\n\nPhotos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

Su carrera y su historia familiar se moldearon en las calles de Albacete, las mismas que inspiran su tercer disco: \"Cuando el r\u00edo suena...\".\n\nSu nombre es Rozal\u00e9n, tiene 32 a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 nominada a los Latin Grammy en dos de las categor\u00edas principales: \"\u00c1lbum del a\u00f1o\" y \"Canci\u00f3n del a\u00f1o\".\n\nLa entrevista con Rozal\u00e9n la puedes escuchar a partir del minuto 3:45.\n\nRozal\u00e9n atraves\u00f3 su puerta violeta y lleg\u00f3 hasta Las Vegas, una ciudad en donde confiesa estar viviendo cosas \"surrealistas\", una ceremonia en la que so\u00f1aba estar y de las que sus nominaciones llegaron por sorpresa.\n\nSemanas antes de los Latin Grammy, Rozal\u00e9n abr\u00eda las puertas de su habitaci\u00f3n a Zona Pop CNN, el podcast de cultura pop de CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, para contar c\u00f3mo es que meses de entrevistas y de desnudar el coraz\u00f3n de su familia resultaron en la producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica que la llev\u00f3 a los premios m\u00e1s importantes de la m\u00fasica latina.\n\nLa puerta violeta\n\nEl sencillo de \"Cuando el r\u00edo suena...\" le dio a la cantante espa\u00f1ola una nominaci\u00f3n en la categor\u00eda \"Canci\u00f3n del a\u00f1o\", que comparte con artistas como: Mon Laferte, su compatriota Rosal\u00eda, Kany Garc\u00eda y uno de sus \u00eddolos personales, Jorge Drexler, y que m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de premiar una canci\u00f3n, reconoce el trabajo del compositor.\n\nEl tema habla de una \"liberaci\u00f3n tras una represi\u00f3n, la venda que se cae, una puerta que se abre para entrar en otra dimensi\u00f3n por fin amable. Es igualdad. Es feminismo\", seg\u00fan Rozal\u00e9n.\n\nUn tema fuerte que toca los matices de lo que es estar en una relaci\u00f3n abusiva.\n\n\"Lo primero que pens\u00e9 cuando me enter\u00e9 de las nominaciones \u2013aparte de llorar dos o tres d\u00edas\u2013, y que era lo que m\u00e1s me emocionaba, era c\u00f3mo es posible que una canci\u00f3n que hable de esto llegue hasta ah\u00ed. O sea, \u00bfeso qu\u00e9 significa? Pues que est\u00e1 pasando algo muy importante en cuanto a la lucha feminista y de las mujeres. Eso a m\u00ed me emociona el triple. Si hubiera sido otra canci\u00f3n, seguro que me alegrar\u00eda, pero con \u00e9sta estoy como muy, muy emocionada\", dijo Rozal\u00e9n a Zona Pop.\n\nPero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo reacciona el p\u00fablico a una canci\u00f3n que habla de una situaci\u00f3n tensa debajo del techo de su propia casa?\n\n\"Mucha gente llora mucho cuando escucha la canci\u00f3n, y que a la vez tiene ese punto de alegr\u00eda. Es una canci\u00f3n muy melanc\u00f3lica que te provoca algo como muy confuso. El estribillo es muy liberador, 'dibuj\u00e9 una puerta violeta y me liber\u00e9', y acab\u00e9 en un prado verde, feliz. En las estrofas estoy hablando de im\u00e1genes que son duras, en realidad, si uno las piensa. Y s\u00ed, provoca muchas cosas, no s\u00e9 ni c\u00f3mo ha salido, pero estoy feliz\".\n\n\"Cuando el r\u00edo suena...\"\n\nFueron dos a\u00f1os que le tomaron a Rozal\u00e9n entrevistar a sus familiares, escarbar entre los escombros de historias que databan de d\u00e9cadas, como con \"Justo\", una canci\u00f3n que cuenta la historia de su t\u00edo-abuelo desaparecido en la guerra civil de Espa\u00f1a (1936-1939).\n\nRozal\u00e9n dice que lo que le pasa con esta canci\u00f3n es \"algo muy brutal y yo llegu\u00e9 hasta a pensar que llevaba un fantasma. Yo quer\u00eda escribir la canci\u00f3n de nuestro desaparecido de la guerra sin imaginar ni de broma que lo \u00edbamos a encontrar\", explica.\n\n\"Llevo dos a\u00f1os entrevistando a mi abuela para escribirle a su hermano una canci\u00f3n. Y la m\u00fasica y la Asociaci\u00f3n por la Recuperaci\u00f3n de la Memoria Hist\u00f3rica me han llevado a descubrir la fosa com\u00fan donde se encuentran sus restos desde hace casi 80 a\u00f1os. En Arganda del Rey, con otros m\u00e1s de 200 soldados. Despu\u00e9s de vivir lo que ha supuesto para mi abuela y mi familia encontrar su nombre en un registro, saber d\u00f3nde llevarle una flor, una oraci\u00f3n...siento la responsabilidad de contar nuestra historia. Se cerr\u00f3 la herida, finaliz\u00f3 la etapa de duelo, se respira paz...\", cuenta la cantante.\n\nLa producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica supuso para Rozal\u00e9n y su familia una suerte de catarsis. El disco tambi\u00e9n naci\u00f3 en un a\u00f1o en el que la cantante dice no estar atravesando una de las mejores situaciones.\n\n\"Yo pas\u00e9 un a\u00f1o regular, por muchas historias, y ha sido el a\u00f1o donde yo compuse este disco. Bueno, de estar un poco perdida, de vivir cosas que no son bonitas, de decepciones, de reencontrarme con estas historias tambi\u00e9n familiares. Entonces, pues mira, al final siempre lo que uno dice: si no hubiera crisis, no evolucionar\u00edamos; y a m\u00ed, si no me hubieran pasado ciertas cosas as\u00ed tristes, pues no hubiera sacado este disco, ni hubiera aprendido un mont\u00f3n de cosas, as\u00ed que pues mira hasta de la tristeza hay que alegrarse\", dice la cantautora.\n\nLa tambi\u00e9n psic\u00f3loga est\u00e1 nominada en esta categor\u00eda junto a Pablo Albor\u00e1n, J Balvin, Chico Buarque, Jorge Drexler, El David Aguilar, Kany Garc\u00eda, Natalia Lafourcade, Luis Miguel y Monsieur Perin\u00e9.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo ha ayudado a Rozal\u00e9n la psicolog\u00eda para componer canciones? \u00bfQu\u00e9 otros secretos familiares revel\u00f3 en este disco?\n\nTe invitamos a que escuches la entrevista completa con Rozal\u00e9n en el episodio 76 de Zona Pop.\n\nSi tienes iOS, desc\u00e1rganos y suscr\u00edbete a trav\u00e9s de Apple Podcast: https://itun.es/us/xwHHib.c.

I don't know a parent who, after hearing about innocent people being hurt or killed, doesn't instinctively reach for their kids and long to never let go.\n\nThis feeling is especially strong when the violence was directed toward a group with whom your family identifies. What if it was us?\n\nMy family consists of conservative Jews who regularly attend a conservative synagogue, just like the Jews who were recently killed in Pittsburgh. Hate-filled trolls have repeatedly threatened violence against me, and my Jewish children, on social media. It's getting harder and harder to not think about the unthinkable.\n\nBut after the initial agony passes and we release our children from our immobilizing grips, their presence can actually help us work through these dark moments. Children have lots of questions and tend to be dogged pursuers of moral clarity. It's rarely enough for them to learn that something happened. They want to understand why it happened and will keep why-why-why-ing their way through each and every piece of information provided to them.\n\nAt the end of this road sits the biggest question of them all, the question not about the act of violence but about what would make someone do something like that in the first place. How does one help them make sense of hate?\n\nThis is not an easy task. Intense hate is, for most of us, a foreign emotion, one we have never felt.\n\nWe must talk to our children about it anyway, explaining to them why someone hates them, where this hate comes from and how it has been dealt with in the past. While this conversation should absolutely include an acknowledgment of all the other groups who are the target of it, the processing of hate best happens through particulars -- of a people, of a history, of a moment. In my family, this means viewing hate through a Jewish lens.\n\nBegin with the past\n\nThe Jewish holiday cycle rests largely upon a series of ancient stories in which Jews were persecuted for being Jewish and then, ultimately, prevail. During Passover, we remember when we were slaves in Egypt. During Purim, we remember when our lives were threatened in ancient Persia. And so on.\n\n\"They tried to kill us, we survived, let's eat,\" goes the old joke, a pithy summary of many Jewish holidays.\n\nWhen children receive a Jewish education, it's these stories, the Jewish communal memory, that take prominence. Is it strange to hear preschool children discuss the various ways in which one group of people can express their hatred of another? \"Sometimes the Jews want to stay but aren't allowed to, and sometimes the Jews want to leave and aren't allowed to,\" my son reflected at age 5. Yes, it's strange. But there's no Judaism without it.\n\nSo how does one take our history, in which hatred of the Jews is a leitmotif, and use it to help our children make sense of the present?\n\nShai Held, rabbi, Jewish theologia, and author of \"The Heart of the Torah,\" said stories of past persecution can help us understand how hate is, sadly, an inescapable part of the human experience.\n\n\"Any religious perspective on the world is going to emphasize that human nature is messy and complex and human beings are prone to hate,\" he said. \"There is oddly something helpful in knowing there is nothing new here. ... It allows you some degree of sobriety.\"\n\nAn incident of hate becomes a chance to discuss not just hate but the ways all of us contain within us the capacity for bad and good. No, we aren't ever likely to find a way to stop that bad from occasionally growing into violent hate in some people. But, if we pay attention, we will notice that expressions of hate are often met by expressions of love and compassion.\n\nIn nearly every ancient story of hate, there are non-Jewish people who fight on Jews' behalf. Last month, Jews saw non-Jews of all backgrounds join us in mourning and protest.\n\n\"I think it is always powerful to remind kids that if someone hates you, it doesn't mean everyone hates you,\" Held said.\n\nA reckoning with hate, when rooted in Jewish history, is also a reckoning with resilience. Yes, lots and lots of people have hated us, incensed by the mere fact that we are not exactly like them. But they didn't win. Held said parents could emphasize this against-the-odds survival of the Jews as a point of relief, if not pride, for children. \"Thousands of years of antisemitism has instilled in us a deep persistence,\" he said.\n\nConnect it to childhood feelings\n\nWe all, old and young, have an instinct to trace hate back to its source. Where does it come from? And how does it take shape?\n\nChildren (and their parents) might get some insight into how hate develops by studying the behavior of their younger siblings, cousins or friends. Wariness of all people and things unfamiliar begins to unfold in the early years of life, explained Fred Zelinger, a New York-based psychologist who previously worked in schools.\n\n\"We are wired to be uncomfortable with things that are different,\" he said. \"Most kids outgrow it past age 3, but some environments can make it flourish.\"\n\nIf a child is never exposed to other cultures or is told that these other cultures are bad, then that perfectly natural \"stranger danger\" can morph into something more menacing and permanent. This is particularly the case with people who have fragile self-esteems and seek to improve their standing by putting down or eliminating those who they see as a threat.\n\nA good way to show children how all this works is by deliberately modeling the complete opposite, explained Laurie Zelinger, child psychologist and author of \"Please Explain Terrorism to Me: A Story for Children.\" Speak kindly about other groups of people; eat in their restaurants; play alongside them at playgrounds; learn about and, when possible, celebrate their holidays; invite them over your house. This is especially important during moments of communal fear, when calls for diversity in speech are not often met by diversity in action.\n\n\"When people feel scared, they have an instinct to insulate their children and keep them away from anything they are nervous about,\" she said.\n\nFocus on the opposite\n\nThere's an underlying element of hate that will likely remain inscrutable to children -- and everyone else. When we hit the edge of our ability to process it, the best, and really only, place to turn to is toward the goodness the majority of us contain within.\n\nOut of all that was written in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, the one phrase that provided me with the most comfort was a declaration of the human capacity for good. \"May we redouble our efforts towards kindness and love,\" my rabbi wrote in an email, sent hours after the killings took place.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"One of the things that is striking about Jewish theology is that Jews are supposed to learn compassion and empathy from two places. We learn it from God's compassion, which is the positive model. And we learn it from our suffering in Egypt, which is the negative model. Whether you have a positive or negative experience, you are supposed to learn empathy,\" Held explained.\n\nLove is not, sadly, the only answer to hate. Vigilance, education, self-defense and self-care are all necessary, too. But it's our unyielding belief in human goodness that makes it all worth it. I believe most children already feel this, but it is up to us to help them understand it."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "5 claves del acuerdo del brexit para la salida de Reino Unido de la Uni\u00f3n Europea", "description": "Despu\u00e9s de 20 meses de tensas negociaciones, la Uni\u00f3n Europea y el Reino Unido alcanzaron finalmente un acuerdo sobre la salida brit\u00e1nica del bloque.

El borrador de 585 p\u00e1ginas del acuerdo es largo y complejo y contiene varias cl\u00e1usulas muy pol\u00e9micas.\n\nEs probable que tanto partidarios como opositores al brexit rechacen el acuerdo, aunque por razones muy diferentes, y no est\u00e1 claro si obtendr\u00e1 la aprobaci\u00f3n del parlamento.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los puntos m\u00e1s complicados? \u00bfC\u00f3mo ser\u00e1n resueltos?\n\nPuedes leer el documento completo aqu\u00ed (en ingl\u00e9s), pero para ahorrarte tiempo, hemos resumido algunos de los puntos claves.\n\nPeriodo de transici\u00f3n\n\nReino Unido saldr\u00e1 formalmente de la Uni\u00f3n Europea el viernes 29 de marzo de 2019, cuando dejar\u00e1 de participar a cualquier nivel en la toma de decisiones del bloque.\n\nSin embargo, bajo el proyecto de acuerdo, Reino Unido permanecer\u00e1 dentro del mercado com\u00fan del bloque y seguir\u00e1 estando sujeto a las leyes y regulaciones de la UE hasta acabar diciembre de 2020, mientras los dos bandos tratan de concretar una nueva relaci\u00f3n comercial.\n\nDurante este periodo, todos los \"instrumentos y estructuras regulatorias, presupuestarias, de supervisi\u00f3n, judiciales y de ejecuci\u00f3n\" existentes en la UE continuar\u00e1n aplic\u00e1ndose en Reino Unido, incluyendo fallos de la Corte de Justicia europea.\n\nEn los hechos, el periodo de transici\u00f3n otorga a las dos partes tiempo adicional para continuar las negociaciones. Si los 21 meses extras no son suficientes - y los cr\u00edticos sugieren que as\u00ed ser\u00e1 casi con seguridad - el periodo de transici\u00f3n se puede extender por un acuerdo conjunto antes del 1 de julio de 2020 y por un tiempo no especificado.\n\nFrontera con Irlanda y uni\u00f3n aduanera\n\nNo habr\u00e1 una frontera dura entre Irlanda del Norte, que es parte del Reino Unido, y la Rep\u00fablica de Irlanda, integrante de la Uni\u00f3n Europea, al menos a corto plazo.\n\nEn caso de que el periodo de transici\u00f3n se extienda m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del 2020, el borrador de acuerdo compromete a las dos partes a una soluci\u00f3n de \"respaldo\" que consiste en \"un territorio aduanero \u00fanico entre la Uni\u00f3n (Europea) y el Reino Unido\".\n\nEsa uni\u00f3n aduanera eliminar\u00eda todos los aranceles, los controles de las normas de origen y las cuotas y cubrir\u00eda todos los productos, excepto los pesqueros.\n\n\"Con este fin, el Reino Unido armonizar\u00e1 la pol\u00edtica comercial aplicable a su territorio aduanero con la pol\u00edtica comercial com\u00fan de la Uni\u00f3n\", dice el acuerdo.\n\nDurante este periodo, el Reino Unido adoptar\u00e1 lo que el documento nombra como \"igualdad de condiciones\", asegurando que las empresas del pa\u00eds no pueden socavar a sus competidores europeos, eliminando en los hechos la posibilidad de que el Reino Unido se transforme en un para\u00edso empresarial de estilo impositivo como el de Singapur, como deseaban algunos partidarios del brexit.\n\nBajo estas condiciones, se requerir\u00e1 que el Reino Unido acepte una serie de \"cl\u00e1usulas de no regresi\u00f3n\" que le impidan introducir nuevos est\u00e1ndares m\u00e1s bajos en regulaciones ambientales, laborales y sociales, incluyendo pol\u00edticas de salud y seguridad, as\u00ed como horarios laborales.\n\nAl formar parte de la uni\u00f3n aduanera, el Reino Unido estar\u00e1 obligado por todos los acuerdos comerciales de la Uni\u00f3n Europea. De manera controversial, esto significar\u00eda que pa\u00edses fuera de la UE, como Estados Unidos y China, tendr\u00edan acceso al mercado brit\u00e1nico con base en las condiciones establecidas en los acuerdos con la UE.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, una vez que la cl\u00e1usula de respaldo entre en vigor, solo podr\u00e1 ser removida por un acuerdo entre las dos partes, previniendo esencialmente que Reino Unido salga de la uni\u00f3n aduanera sin la aprobaci\u00f3n de la UE.\n\nMercados financieros\n\nLa ciudad de Londres ha jugado un enorme papel en las negociaciones del brexit, con los bandos a favor y en contra intentando aprovechar el estatus de la capital como el principal centro financiero del mundo.\n\nEse estatus ahora podr\u00eda estar en riesgo. Aunque muchas de las instituciones financieras de Londres se han preparado para la ausencia de un acuerdo para el brexit, el nuevo acuerdo no es nada positivo.\n\nEn el documento de 580 p\u00e1ginas, solo tres p\u00e1rrafos con poco m\u00e1s de 300 palabras est\u00e1n dedicados al sector financiero de Reino Unido.\n\nBajo el borrador del acuerdo, \"las entidades establecidas en el Reino Unido deber\u00e1n ser tratadas como entidades localizadas fuera de la Uni\u00f3n\". En la pr\u00e1ctica, es probable que esto resulte en que al centro financiero de Londres se le otorgue un nivel de acceso al mercado de la UE similar al dado a las empresas de Estados Unidos y Jap\u00f3n, en virtud de un acuerdo conocido como de \"equivalencia\", lo que ponen en peligro el atractivo de Londres para las compa\u00f1\u00edas financieras internacionales.\n\nLibertad de movimiento\n\nEl borrador del documento otorga protecciones a los m\u00e1s de 3 millones de ciudadanos de la Uni\u00f3n Europea en Reino Unido, y al m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de ciudadanos brit\u00e1nicos en pa\u00edses del bloque, para que puedan seguir viviendo, trabajando o estudiando donde lo hacen actualmente.\n\nDe forma crucial, \"a los titulares de un documento v\u00e1lido no se les requerir\u00e1 una visa de salida, visa de entrada o cualquier formalidad equivalente\" para los ciudadanos de la Uni\u00f3n Europea y el Reino Unido cuando crucen las fronteras nacionales dentro del bloque.\n\nLa libertad de movimiento se mantendr\u00e1 hasta que se alcance un acuerdo final y los ciudadanos europeos y brit\u00e1nicos que lleguen al estado de acogida durante el periodo de transici\u00f3n disfrutar\u00e1n los mismos derechos que los que llegaron antes del 30 de marzo de 2019.\n\nCl\u00e1usula de divorcio\n\nDe acuerdo con un sumario europeo del documento, el \"acuerdo no es sobre el monto de las obligaciones financieras del Reino Unido, sino sobre la metodolog\u00eda para calcularlo\".\n\nSeg\u00fan este razonamiento, el Reino Unido cumplir\u00e1 con todos los compromisos conjuntos existentes para los programas de la UE seg\u00fan se describe en el presupuesto de la UE para 2020, \"incluidos los compromisos pendientes a finales de 2020 y los pasivos que no se correspondan con los activos\".\n\nPreviamente esto se hab\u00eda estimado en cerca de 50.000 millones de libras (64.800 millones de d\u00f3lares)."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Uber driving golfer Adam Stephens challenges leaders at Australian Open", "description": "More accustomed to driving customers around in his Uber, Adam Stephens didn't expect to be driving his way through the field at the Australian Open on Thursday.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/15/golf/adam-stephens-uber-driver-golf-australian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115100532-adam-stephens-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:16:00Z", "content": "(CNN) More accustomed to driving customers around in his Uber, Adam Stephens didn't expect to be driving his way through the field at the Australian Open on Thursday.

Meantime, the administration is thinking about a cut to the defense budget to help deal with the ballooning federal deficit. But the report warns that Russia and China are bolstering their own military capabilities, possibly putting the US military in a situation where it would \"suffer unacceptably high casualties\" and \"struggle to win or perhaps lose, a war.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED New arms race brewing between US and Russia Replay More Videos ...

Bill Nelson's campaign and Democratic Party officials, who are looking to the courts to help them find votes to narrow the margin in Nelson's bid for re-election against Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott . The number of ballots in question is certainly less than the margin of votes separating Nelson and Scott. Scott led Nelson in the unofficial, pre-recount tally by more than 12,500 votes.\n\nIn his ruling Judge Walker said as many as 5,000 ballots could be impacted by the signature mismatch provision, however, it is unclear exactly how many votes were impacted by this decision.\n\nIn court, Democratic lawyers introduced examples of voters who were informed of the signature mismatch issue, but that notification came after the deadline to resolve the problem. Walker's ruling only offers relief to those voters who were \"belatedly notified.\n\nThe ruling is narrower than the wider relief that Democrats were seeking, which was to invalidate the signature-match requirement entirely. Florida law requires signatures on vote-by-mail and provisional ballots match the signatures on file for each voter. Attorneys for Nelson's re-election campaign argued that the signature-match rules violate the US Constitution and called for the judge to invalidate the law. Lawyers representing the state of Florida and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, along with others, argued that the law was valid and constitutional.\n\n\"There are dozens of reasons a signature mismatch may occur, even when the individual signing is in fact the voter. Disenfranchisement of approximately 5,000 voters based on signature mismatch is a substantial burden,\" Walker wrote in the order.\n\nHe added, however: \"Let this Court be clear: it is NOT ordering county canvassing boards to count every mismatched vote, sight unseen. Rather, the county supervisors of elections are directed to allow those voters who should have had an opportunity to cure their ballots in the first place to cure their vote-by-mail and provisional ballots now, before the second official results are fully counted.\"\n\nScott's campaign announced Thursday that they would appeal the ruling.\n\n\"We are immediately appealing this baseless decision and we are confident we will prevail in the Eleventh Circuit. Let's be clear- Bill Nelson's high-priced Washington lawyers went to court to argue against a process that they previously argued for,\" said Lauren Schenone, a spokeswoman for the campaign.\n\nMarc Elias, the lead lawyer for the Democrats, called the ruling a \"victory for the people of Florida and for the Nelson campaign\" on Thursday.\n\n\"The court's ruling impacts thousands of ballots, and that number will likely increase as larger counties like Broward add their ballots to the total pool which can be cured,\" Elias said in a statement. \"We are taking several steps to ensure the rights of every Floridian are protected, and this is one major step forward.\"\n\nWhile election officials have until Thursday at 3 p.m. to finish the machine recount on races within .5%, votes in the race for US Senate and agriculture commissioner will likely still be counted after the deadline because election officials have until Sunday at noon ET to finish the hand recount of any races within .25%. The election is not set to be certified until Tuesday, November 20 at 9 a.m.\n\nThe gubernatorial contest between Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is also being recounted, but the margin is wider -- nearly 34,000 votes. Florida Democrats are aware that margin will probably not be overcome in a recount. Still, Gillum withdrew his election night concession over the weekend with a message that every vote should be counted.\n\nWalker, during a more than five-hour hearing on Wednesday, teased that his decision would likely extend the deadline by days, not weeks. The judge also indicated that he was concerned about the idea of just letting the votes be counted without verifying the signatures, telling the lawyers that there was \"not a chance\" he was going to do that.\n\nUzoma Nkwonta, a lawyer for Nelson's campaign, clearly sensed on Wednesday that Walker would likely extend the deadline by a few days. But in his closing question and answer with the judge, he suggested that \"would probably be insufficient\" and said there would need to be \"reasonable notice\" for voters who want to validate their ballots.\n\n\"We believe that opportunity would take significantly longer than three days,\" Nkwonta said.\n\nWalker did not appear to agree with this view. \"At some point, isn't there some onus on the voter?\" Walker responded to Nkwonta.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "hnoami", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0629

Bill Nelson to keep his Senate seat.\n\nAppearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer projected confidence about Nelson's chances.\n\n\"Bill Nelson is -- is strong as could be,\" Schumer said. \"He believes, I believe, he's won a majority of the votes, and as long as they're counted, he will continue being senator from Florida.\"\n\nHistory says this is very unlikely and Republican Gov. Rick Scott will maintain his lead over Nelson. Indeed, there doesn't seem to be a precedent for the type of change Nelson needs to overtake Scott.\n\nScott holds a little more than a 12,000 vote lead over Nelson. That amounts to an advantage of about 0.15 percentage points, which is well within the 0.25 point margin needed for a manual recount required by Florida law. This margin may seem small, but for recount purposes, it is actually quite large.\n\nAccording to a FairVote database of statewide recounts from 2000 to 2015, the average recount moves the margin by 0.02 points. Nelson needs the margin to move by nearly eight times as much.\n\nThe recount with the largest shift was the Vermont Auditor of Accounts race in 2006. The margin shifted in that by 0.11 points, which is still less than what Nelson needs.\n\nIn terms of pure votes, it doesn't look any better for Nelson. The average recount from 2000 to 2015 shifted the result by 282 votes. You don't need to be a math wizard to know that 282 is considerably less than 12,000. The maximum change in the margin in any recount from 2000 to 2015 was 1,247 votes. That is far less than the change in the margin Nelson needs to overtake Scott.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, this 1,247 margin shift occurred in Florida in 2000. Democrat Al Gore was ultimately unsuccessful in that recount effort. Part of the reason he may have been unsuccessful was that the US Supreme Court effectively shut down a manual recount before it could be completed.\n\nEven if said recount had been completed and under the most favorable standard to Gore, the margin would have only have shifted by about 2,000 votes. In terms of percentage points, it would have been a shift of around 0.05 points. Again, Nelson's hill is considerably greater than that.\n\nVery few recounts actually turn losers into winners. Just 3 of the 27 elections (11%) examined by FairVote ended up with a different winner at the end of the recount versus the start of it.\n\nAll three of these recounts support the idea that Nelson has a tough row to hoe. One was the aforementioned Vermont Auditor of Accounts election in 2006. The other two are considerably better known.\n\nThe 2004 Washington gubernatorial election started with Republican Dino Rossi leading Democrat Christine Gregoire by 261 votes or 0.01 points. After a machine recount, Rossi's lead dropped to 42 votes or 0.002 points. A manual recount gave Gregorie the win by 129 votes or 0.005 points. All told, the margin shifted by 390 votes or a little less than 0.015 points. In terms of percentage points, Nelson would need a shift of 10 times that to emerge victorious in Florida.\n\nNelson shouldn't be anymore encouraged by Minnesota's 2008 Senate recount. Republican Norm Coleman headed into a manual recount up by 215 votes or a little less than 0.01 points on Democrat Al Franken. Franken ended up winning the recount by 225 votes or a little less than 0.01 points. That's a change of only 440 votes or less than 0.02 points. Like in the Washington example, Nelson would need a much bigger change in Florida to pull out ahead.\n\nOf course, recounts are tricky things. The sample size isn't so great as to say Nelson has no chance. Maybe something truly funky happened in Florida.\n\nHistory, though, is highly suggestive of the next senator from Florida being a Republican."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ben Simister for CNN", "title": "How do you follow a blockbuster Ryder Cup?", "description": "In September, the Ryder Cup headed to Paris for the biggest staging of the tournament in its 91-year history.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/15/golf/ryder-cup-rome-2022-guy-kinnings-spt-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115100041-ryder-cup-paris-grand-stand-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:59:43Z", "content": "(CNN) In September, the Ryder Cup headed to Paris for the biggest staging of the tournament in its 91-year history.

Ironman World Championship last month, setting a course record in the process, he found enough energy for one final special moment.\n\nBefore falling to the ground from exhaustion, the German proposed to his girlfriend Julia at the finish line.\n\nIt was the perfect ending to a special day for Lange, who became the first athlete in history to go under eight hours on the 140.6-mile Hawaiian course.\n\nIn doing so, the 32-year-old defended his crown in a time of seven hours, 52 minutes, 39 seconds.\n\n\"I achieved the biggest goal in my life for the second time and then to be engaged with the love of my life, it just blew my mind. I cannot think of a better situation or a better day,\" he told CNN's Patrick Snell.\n\nThe Ironman World Championship has been held in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, every year since 1978. It serves as an idyllic location for one of sport's toughest events.\n\nAthletes begin with a 2.4-mile swim around the harbor before setting off on a 112-mile bike ride. After swapping two wheels for a pair of running shoes, participants finish with a marathon -- 26.2 miles.\n\nJUST WATCHED The two-time world Ironman champ who proposed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The two-time world Ironman champ who proposed 04:00\n\n'Hardest race ever'\n\nDespite his record-setting time, Lange didn't even have the best start. He was way behind after the swim but made up ground on the bike ride, a feat he credits to calm weather conditions.\n\nA lack of wind made for grueling conditions in the marathon.\n\n\"It was probably the hardest race I ever did,\" Lange said. \"The marathon run was really hard because we had no winds. It was almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit over the asphalt [roads].\"\n\nLange credits his ability to push through the pain-barrier to a tough mental attitude and stays positive by being grateful for the opportunity to race in such an elite setting.\n\n\"It's incredible how far your mind can take you,\" he said. \"You really go through some dark places in the race and it's really important to get out of that dark place and stay in the moment.\"\n\nPatrick Lange won a consecutive Ironman World Championship at Kona, Hawaii.\n\nThe German proposed to his girlfriend, Julia, at the finish line.\n\nThe proposal\n\nThe German had kept his proposal plans a secret and used it as motivation during the months of preparation for Hawaii.\n\nThe thought of it drove him on during the final run.\n\n\"I mean, to be completely honest, when I met Julia it took me five seconds to figure out that she will be the love of my life,\" he said.\n\n\"I saved that tiny little extra energy to do the proposal.\n\n\"After I did it, and she said yes, all the pressure of months of training, all the exhausting racing, it just fell off at that moment.\"\n\nLange made up for a disappointing swim with a phenomenal bike ride.\n\nA lack of wind made the final marathon run an extremely hot affair.\n\nPizza-fueled diet\n\nLange trains up to 40 hours every week but explains that his vegetarian diet is just as important.\n\n\"I train so much that I also have to eat properly, to not lose weight and not lose muscle mass,\" he said.\n\n\"I eat a lot of pasta and make sure that I get enough carbohydrates into my system.\"\n\nHis now fiancee certainly helps when it comes to mapping out his preparation. As well as a constant source of inspiration, Julia is also an industry-leading health expert.\n\nFortunately for Lange, she doesn't believe in sacrificing too much.\n\n\"You stick to your own diet and just need whatever you feel fuels your body properly. So if it's pizza, go for the pizza. That's it.\"\n\n#betherecordbreaker\n\nIt could have been very different for both Patrick and Julia.\n\nThe German nearly quit the sport five years ago when he found himself without a sponsor.\n\n\"I'm just really proud that I trusted myself and that I found people that really believed that I could achieve my goals,\" the two-time champion said.\n\nIn tribute to Lange's phoenix rise, both he and Julia created #betherecordbreaker.\n\nThe social media campaign hopes to encourage others to achieve their potential.\n\n\"The idea behind that hashtag was not so much about Patrick himself but about the fact that if people just stick to their own dreams and follow them, they're able to achieve their goals,\" Julia explained."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author":

Officials have said it's hard to determine the number of missing, because some people may have evacuated and can't be reached with cell phone service unreliable due to the fire.\n\n\"There are a lot of people displaced and we're finding a lot of people don't know we are looking for them,\" Honea said.\n\nThe fire turned the hard-hit town of Paradise into ash and debris and also devastated the nearby communities of Magalia and Concow. Honea said three sets of remains were found Thursday in Paradise, three in Magalia and one in Concow.\n\nHonea has invited relatives of the missing to visit the sheriff's office in Oroville so authorities can collect DNA samples from them. The DNA will be used to help identify fire victims, Honea said.\n\n\"This is a daunting task. We feel really bad for the people who don't know what happened to their loved ones and our hearts go out to them,\" Butte County Sheriff's Investigations Sgt. Steve Collins said. \"We want to give them some answers.\"\n\nTroops, cadaver dogs and coroners involved\n\nThe somber search for the missing in Butte County is painstaking.\n\nIt involves 461 people and 22 cadaver dogs in Paradise, Magalia and Concow, authorities said.\n\nDozens of National Guard troops have joined the search effort, Collins said. Once they find the remains, with the help of forensic experts, the coroners are sent to recover them.\n\nTo enable searchers access to the destroyed structures, crews help move collapsed buildings and roofs out of the way.\n\nThe white overalls protect the rescue workers from ash and debris and help avoid contamination, Collins said.\n\n\"They are going to be searching vehicles that have been burned. They'll be searching residences that have been burned. Checking around the residences ... our mission is to find the victims from this fire, recover them and get them identified and notify the families to give them some answers.\"\n\nRoger Kelton, 67, wipes his tears while searching through the remains of his mother-in-law's home.\n\nThe search area is wide and spread out.\n\n\"It's not just the area; it's the number of homes, the number of trailers, the multistory buildings. All of that changes the complexity of this operation,\" Collins said.\n\nExperts are conducting targeted searches by first sending deputies to areas in which people have been reported missing. The number changes daily with more calls coming in.\n\n\"We're trying to follow up with those people who are calling in to find out if they've made any contact with their loved ones,\" Collins said. \"We're asking people to call us if they do come in contact with their loved one so that we don't spend time looking for somebody that's already found.\"\n\nHousing shortage\n\nFamilies who lost their homes in the fires are going to have a very hard time finding a place to live, Butte County Housing Authority Executive Director Ed Mayer said.\n\n\"We just had 10% of our county's housing stock erased in one day; it's hard to convey the significance of that,\" he said.\n\nA Walmart in Chico has a parking lot full of vehicles, including motor homes, in which people are living, often running the heat in their cars and trucks all night. Other people are staying in tents.\n\n\"It's been a week and people have been great, but I don't know how long it's going to last,\" Mayer said. \"Short-term, we are fine, but long-term we are not.\"\n\nOne of the selling points of Paradise was its affordable housing, but that's been erased, Mayer said.\n\n\"And there is nothing to replace it\" for low-income families, he said.\n\nSuspected outbreak of norovirus reported\n\nMore than 9,600 firefighters, including many from out of state, are battling wildfires across California.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which has destroyed about 9,700 homes and scorched 141,000 acres in Northern California, is one of several in the state. By Thursday, it was 40% contained.\n\nAdding to the misery for evacuees, officials reported a suspected outbreak of norovirus at a shelter in Chico. Evacuees showed some symptoms, but officials are waiting for test results for confirmation. The stomach bug causes vomiting, nausea and diarrhea.\n\nOther fires in the state\n\nIn Southern California, the Woolsey Fire -- which, like the Camp Fire, began November 8 -- has killed at least two people in Malibu. Authorities are trying to determine whether a third person found in a burned home in Agoura Hills died as a result of that fire, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire has burned more than 98,000 acres and destroyed more than 500 structures . It is 62% contained. More favorable weather conditions for firefighters are in the forecast.\n\nMore than 230,000 acres burned in California in the past week. That's larger than the cities of Chicago and Boston combined. And in 30 days, firefighters have battled more than 500 blazes, said Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to give the correct number of missing people in the Camp Fire."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Charles Riley, CNN Business", "title": "Uber losses accelerate; China makes an offer; Brexit chaos", "description": "Here's what you need to know about the markets before you start your business day.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/15/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115173723-brexit-eu-flag-house-file-1-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:50:56Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "London (CNN Business) 1.

The full 585-page draft withdrawal agreement is long and complex and contains several highly contentious clauses.\n\nWith both supporters and opponents of Brexit likely to provide strong opposition to the deal, albeit for very different reasons, it remains unclear whether it will get approval from the UK Parliament.\n\nWhat, then, are the major sticking points? And how might they be resolved?\n\nYou can read the full draft document here . But to help save you time, we've summarized some of the key points below.\n\nTransition period\n\nBritain will formally exit the EU on Friday, March 29, 2019, at which point it will cease to be involved at any level in EU decision-making.\n\nHowever, under the draft agreement, the UK will stay inside the bloc's single market and remain subject to EU laws and regulations until the end of December 2020 while the two sides attempt to iron out a new trade relationship.\n\nDuring this period, all existing EU \"regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures\" will continue to apply within the UK, including rulings made in the Court of Justice of the EU.\n\nIn effect, the transition period provides the two parties with additional time in which to continue negotiations. If the extra 21 months prove insufficient -- and critics suggest they almost certainly will -- the transition period can be extended, by joint agreement before July 1, 2020, for an unspecified period of time.\n\nIrish border and customs union\n\nThere will be no hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, and EU member the Republic of Ireland, at least in the short term.\n\nIn the event of the transition period being extended beyond 2020, the draft deal commits both parties to a \"backstop\" solution, consisting of a \"single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThat customs union would remove all tariffs, checks on rules of origin and quotas, and would cover all goods except fishery products. \"To this end, the United Kingdom will harmonize the commercial policy applicable to its customs territory with the common commercial policy of the Union,\" the agreement says.\n\nDuring this period, the UK will adopt what the document terms \"level playing field\" conditions, ensuring that UK businesses are unable to undercut EU competitors, effectively removing the possibility of the UK transforming into a Singapore-style low-tax business haven, as envisioned by some pro-Brexit supporters.\n\nUnder these conditions, the UK will be required to agree to a number of \"non-regression clauses,\" preventing it from introducing new, lower standards on key environmental, labor and social regulations, including such things as health and safety policy and working hours.\n\nWhile part of the customs union, the UK will be bound by all EU international trade agreements. Controversially, this would mean that countries outside the EU, such as the United States and China, would have access to the UK market under conditions set out in the EU's trade agreements.\n\nFurthermore, once the backstop has come into place, it can only be removed through the agreement of both parties, essentially preventing the UK from exiting the customs union without the approval of the EU.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nThe City of London has played an outsize role throughout Brexit negotiations, with both the pro- and anti-Brexit camps attempting to leverage the capital's status as the world's leading financial center.\n\nThat status could now be at risk. While many of London's financial institutions have been preparing for a no-deal Brexit, the new agreement is by no means advantageous.\n\nThroughout the entire 580-page document, a mere three paragraphs totaling fewer than 300 words are devoted to the UK's financial sector.\n\nUnder the draft agreement, \"entities established in the United Kingdom shall be treated as entities located outside the Union.\" In practice, this is likely to result in London's financial center being granted a level of EU market access similar to that granted to US and Japanese firms, under an arrangement known as \" equivalence ,\" potentially jeopardizing London's attractiveness to international financial companies.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nThe draft document provides protections for the more than three million EU citizens in the UK, and over one million UK nationals in EU countries to continue to live, work or study as they currently do.\n\nCrucially, \"no exit visa, entry visa or equivalent formality shall be required of holders of a valid document issued\" for EU and UK nationals when crossing national boarders within the bloc.\n\nFreedom of movement will be maintained until a final agreement is reached, and EU citizens and UK nationals arriving in the host state during the transition period will enjoy the same rights as those who arrived in the host state before March 30, 2019.\n\nUK divorce bill\n\nAccording to an EU summary document , the \"agreement is not about the amount of the UK's financial obligation, but about the methodology for calculating it.\"\n\nUnder this rationale, the UK will honor all existing joint commitments to EU programs as outlined in the EU budget until 2020, \"including outstanding commitments at the end of 2020 and liabilities which are not matched by assets.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Estados Unidos est\u00e1 en riesgo de perder una guerra con China o Rusia, advierten

Defensa Nacional (NDS, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump cuenta con recursos insuficientes y Estados Unidos corre el riesgo de ser derrotado militarmente por China o Rusia, de acuerdo con un reporte de un panel de expertos bipartidistas ordenado por el Congreso que fue dado a conocer el mi\u00e9rcoles.\n\nLa advertencia llega mientras el gobierno de Trump sopesa un posible recorte al presupuesto de defensa despu\u00e9s de un gran impulso en los ejercicios fiscales 2018 y 2019.\n\nAunque el reporte aplaude al gobierno por enfocarse m\u00e1s sobre Rusia

comisi\u00f3n juzga de forma inequ\u00edvoca que la NDS no cuenta con los recursos adecuados\", dice el reporte y a\u00f1ade que \"los recursos disponibles son claramente insuficientes para cumplir los objetivos de la estrategia, incluyendo el de asegurarse que el Departamento de Defensa pueda derrotar a una gran potencia rival al mismo tiempo que disuade a otros enemigos\".\n\nComo parte de sus esfuerzos para reducir el d\u00e9ficit fiscal, el gobierno de Trump ha dicho p\u00fablicamente que sopesa recortes al Departamento de Defensa despu\u00e9s de dar a los militares un gran impulso financiero.\n\nAunque Estados Unidos proyecta gastar unos 716.000 millones de d\u00f3lares en defensa durante el ejercicio fiscal de 2019, funcionarios de defensa dijeron a CNN que el gobierno est\u00e1 considerando recortar la cifra a 700.000 millones de d\u00f3lares para el siguiente a\u00f1o.\n\nEl reporte advierte que dadas las tendencias actuales en los esfuerzos de Rusia y China por

But later on Thursday, the PM vowed in a news conference to fight for her Brexit deal.\n\n\"Serving in high office is an honor and privilege,\" she told a room of reporters.\n\n\"It is also a heavy responsibility -- that is true at any time but especially when the stakes are so high. I believe with every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people.\"\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been leading Brexit negotiations with the EU, was the first Cabinet minister to quit, followed quickly by Brexit-backing Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey. Two junior ministers, two ministerial aides and the Conservative party's vice chairman also resigned.\n\nRaab, the second Brexit Secretary to quit in four months, said on Twitter he could not \"in good conscience\" support the deal.\n\nToday, I have resigned as Brexit Secretary. I cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU. Here is my letter to the PM explaining my reasons, and my enduring respect for her. pic.twitter.com/tf5CUZnnUz \u2014 Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) November 15, 2018\n\nIn the House of Commons, May urged MPs to back her plan. \"Voting against a deal would take us all back to square one,\" she said. \"It would mean more uncertainty, more division and a failure to deliver on the decision of the British people that we should leave the EU. If we get behind a deal we can bring our country back together.\"\n\nMay, who faces the uphill battle of winning Parliament's approval for the agreement, said she respected the views of those who had quit Thursday. She acknowledged that the Brexit process was \"uncomfortable\" and involved \"difficult choices.\"\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn slammed what he called a \"botched\" and \"half-baked\" deal, saying it \"represents a huge and damaging failure\" on the part of a government \"in chaos.\"\n\n\"The government simply cannot put to Parliament this half-baked deal that both the Brexit Secretary and his predecessor have rejected,\" he said.\n\nNigel Dodds, deputy leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party -- which May relies on to prop up her minority government -- was also damning in his assessment of the deal, saying the Prime Minister \"clearly doesn't listen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads the influential pro-Brexit European Research Group, openly asked May why he should not demand her resignation.\n\nHe said May had pledged that the UK would leave the Customs Union, that she would maintain the integrity of the UK and that it would leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice -- but that the deal did none of those things.\n\nConservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg heads an influential pro-Brexit group.\n\nMay had barely left the chamber following three hours of grueling questions before Rees-Mogg announced publicly that he was submitting a letter of no-confidence in May -- essentially an open call for the Prime Minister's own party to unseat her.\n\nIf 48 such letters are sent to Graham Brady, the party official who represents the interests of Conservative MPs, a leadership contest would be triggered.\n\nRees-Mogg wrote that the deal \"has turned out to be worse than anticipated and fails to meet the promises given to the nation by the Prime Minister, either on her own account or on behalf of us all in the Conservative Party manifesto,\" according to the Press Association.\n\nPerilous development\n\nThe day's drama began with Raab's unexpected resignation. Despite being a leading Brexiter he was thought to have been on board with May's plan.\n\nHis move triggered a series of resignations that imperil May's government. If more Cabinet ministers resign, it would make it hard for May to hold her administration together.\n\nIn her resignation letter, McVey said the draft agreement \"does not honour the referendum\" and that she could neither defend it nor vote for it.\n\nEarlier this morning I informed the Prime Minister I was resigning from her Cabinet pic.twitter.com/ZeBkL5n2xH \u2014 Esther McVey (@EstherMcVey1) November 15, 2018\n\nSuella Braverman, another staunch Brexiter who resigned as a minister, tweeted that she found herself \" unable to sincerely support the deal \" and that the concessions made \"do not respect the will of the people.\"\n\nThe Conservative Party's vice chairman, Rehman Chishti, also announced his resignation Thursday, citing May's performance in the House of Commons as one of the reasons. \"The UK in effect will be part of a system where it will be a rule taker without any say on the rules,\" he said.\n\nFormer UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who was a driving force behind Brexit, congratulated the former Brexit Secretary on his resignation, tweeting: \"Well done Dominic Raab, a few more and we will be rid of this duplicitous Prime Minister.\"\n\nWell done Dominic Raab, a few more and we will be rid of this duplicitous Prime Minister. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 15, 2018\n\nMay: 'Difficult choices'\n\nStanding outside Downing Street on Wednesday following the five-hour Cabinet meeting, May declared she had won the backing of her senior ministers. \"This is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead,\" she said.\n\nShe also spelled out the \"difficult choices\" the government faced. \"When you strip away the detail the choice before us is clear,\" she said. \"This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings us back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union, or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThursday's front pages reflected the difficulties ahead. The Financial Times predicted a \"backlash\" following the \"ferocious Brexit battle,\" while the Daily Mail focused on the Prime Minister's defiant tone with the headline, \"I stand to fight.\"\n\nThe Guardian, which had supported Remain, pointed to the divisions that May's Brexit plan had created under the banner \"a split cabinet, a split party and a split nation.\"\n\nAll sides 'still have a long road ahead'\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday called the draft agreement a \"very important moment. What we have agreed... is fair and balanced, takes into account the UK's positions, (and) organizes withdrawal in orderly fashion and ensure no hard border... and lays the ground for an ambitious new partnership.\n\nEU Chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said \"we had no doubt that Brexit was a lose-lose situation.\"\n\n\"Our work is not finished, we still have a long road ahead of us on both sides. We have no time to lose,\" he said, before handing the 558-page draft document to Tusk, who, in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with a reporter, said he had read \"almost everything\" in the document.\n\n\"I don't share the (British) Prime Minister's enthusiasm about Brexit as such. Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation and negotiations are only about damage control,\" said Tusk.\n\nHe said the agreement was now being analyzed by all member states and by the end of the week the EU 27 ambassadors would meet to share their views on it.\n\nIf nothing extraordinary happens, we will hold a #EUCO to finalise and formalise the #Brexit agreement on Sunday 25 November at 9h30.\n\n\n\nMy press statement this morning with @MichelBarnier: https://t.co/bjFQA9omHb pic.twitter.com/FtIsc7odHL \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) November 15, 2018\n\nThe commission intends to agree the framework by Tuesday, Tusk said, and a European Council meeting to \"finalize and formalize the agreement\" will be held on November 25.\n\nAntonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, welcomed the draft Brexit deal, but warned it was only \"the first step on a long road.\"\n\nFrench PM Edouard Philippe warned that Britain could still crash out of the EU without a deal. \"Nothing allows us to say at this stage that the agreement will ultimately be adopted. We must prepare ourselves for a potential outcome, which we do not want but which is on the table, that of an exit without an agreement,\" Philippe said Thursday.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that he was ''very pleased'' the EU and the British negotiators had reached a draft Brexit deal, even as he pointed out that Europe had not yet approved it."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Descubren un exoplaneta congelado a solo 6 a\u00f1os luz de la Tierra", "description": "Astr\u00f3nomos descubrieron un exoplaneta congelado tras veces m\u00e1s grande que la Tierra, orbitando alrededor de una estrella a solo 6 a\u00f1os luz de distancia.

El exoplaneta orbita la estrella de Barnard, la estrella solitaria m\u00e1s cercana a nuestro sol.\n\nEsto lo hace el segundo exoplaneta conocido m\u00e1s cercano a nosotros. Previamente, un exoplaneta fue encontrado orbitando en el sistema de tres estrellas Proxima Centauri.\n\nEl exoplaneta fue hallado despu\u00e9s de reunir 20 a\u00f1os de datos, incluyendo 771 mediciones individuales, a partir de siete instrumentos. El an\u00e1lisis que llev\u00f3 al descubrimiento es detallado en un estudio publicado el mi\u00e9rcoles en la revista Nature.\n\nDurante a\u00f1os, los astr\u00f3nomos pensaron que encontrar\u00edan un planeta alrededor de la estrella m\u00e1s cercana, pero este los evitaba.\n\n\"Lo m\u00e1s importante de este descubrimiento es la estrella anfitriona\", escribi\u00f3 en un email Paul Butler, coautor del estudio y astr\u00f3nomo de la Instituci\u00f3n Carnegie para la Ciencia. \"La estrella de Barnard es la 'gran ballena blanca' de los cazadores de planetas\".\n\nEl planeta, conocido como estrella de Barnard b, probablemente es poco iluminado por su estrella y un poco m\u00e1s fr\u00edo que Saturno.

Desde entonces qued\u00f3 cubierto por el hielo, ocult\u00e1ndolo de la vista, dijo la NASA.\n\nUn equipo de investigadores del Centro de Geolog\u00eda Gen\u00e9tica de la Universidad de Copenhague en el Museo de Historia Natural de Dinamarca detect\u00f3 el cr\u00e1ter por primera vez en julio de 2015.\n\nLos investigadores estaban inspeccionando un nuevo mapa de la topograf\u00eda bajo la capa de hielo de Groenlandia, creado por un radar capaz de penetrar el hielo, cuando notaron una depresi\u00f3n circular debajo del glaciar Hiawatha.\n\nSospecharon que se trataba de un cr\u00e1ter y pasaron los \u00faltimos tres a\u00f1os examinando datos de la NASA y trabajando con colegas en Estados Unidos para verificar su hallazgo, el cual fue publicado el mi\u00e9rcoles en la revista Science Advances.\n\n\"El cr\u00e1ter est\u00e1 excepcionalmente bien preservado y eso es sorprendente porque el hielo de los glaciares es un agente erosivo incre\u00edblemente eficiente que r\u00e1pidamente habr\u00eda removido las marcas del impacto\", dijo Kurt Kj\u00e6r, profesor del Centro de Geolog\u00eda Gen\u00e9tica en el Museo de Historia Natural de Dinamarca y autor principal del estudio.\n\nKj\u00e6r dijo que el impacto pudo haber ocurrido al final de la \u00faltima era glaciar, lo que lo har\u00eda uno de los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes del planeta.\n\nEl equipo planea seguir

researchers has verified the discovery of the first meteorite impact crater ever found deep beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nFound under the Hiawatha Glacier, the crater is about 1,000 feet (300 meters) deep and 19 miles (31 kilometers) wide, according to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe Hiawatha crater region shown with and without the Greenland Ice Sheet. Credit: NASA/Cindy Starr\n\nIt was likely formed when a half a mile (800 meter) wide iron meteorite struck northwest Greenland less than three million years ago. It was then covered in ice, hiding it from view, NASA said.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen's Centre for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark first spotted the crater in July 2015.\n\nThe researchers were inspecting a new map of the topography beneath Greenland's ice sheet created by ice-penetrating radar data when they noticed a circular depression under the Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "hnoami", "title": "\u0628\u0648\u0645\u0628\u064a\u0648 \u064a\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0634

The bad news is that the challenges and threats that are making his mood so dark are likely to get worse before they get better.\n\nThe President is angry at his rebuke from voters in the midterm elections . The oppressive prospect of action by special counsel Robert Mueller hangs like an immovable cloud over his White House. Staff chaos in the West Wing is producing lurid palace intrigue stories in the media that the President hates\n\nAbroad, he feuds with allied world leaders, and he's been so effective in implementing his \"America First\" policy that he's the odd man out at summits.\n\nAnd things are unlikely to improve quickly. Many legal observers expect new indictments to come soon in the Mueller probe, potentially bringing the investigation closer to Trump's inner circle in its final stages. The President fulminated over the probe on Thursday morning, calling it on Twitter \"A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n\nDemocrats are prepping a barrage of investigations that will make life in his White House a misery -- from attempts to seize his tax returns and probe his business dealings to investigations into key policy areas like immigration.\n\n\"He's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is letting off steam where he can. He's feuding with a former friend, Emmanuel Macron, mocking the French President's approval rating (at 29%, it is lower than Trump's) and the French jobless rate of over 9%.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller on Wednesday, the President betrayed his disturbed equilibrium, claiming that voter fraud had cost Republicans key races\n\n\"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again,\" Trump claimed, without evidence.\n\nNot the first President to feel this way\n\nTrump is not the first President to feel isolated, angry, rejected by voters or down in the dumps. Everyone who sits in the Oval Office feels that way sooner or later, though Trump's temperament is more volcanic than most.\n\nThe question for Trump is, what can he do -- other than a few restorative weekends on the golf course in Florida -- to improve his position ahead of a crucial period that will define opening chapters of his re-election campaign?\n\nOften when they are in trouble, Presidents engineer staff shakeups to bring in new ideas and energy. They go looking for wins in foreign policy, an area that pesky congressional foes can do little to disrupt.\n\nMore fundamentally, Trump could examine his entire political approach. While his strategy of division and tearing at cultural and racial divides helped him win the White House, it seemed to backfire in key House races. Failure to win back the suburbs could harm his hopes of winning a second term in 2020.\n\nIf Trump never gave another angry news conference or swore off explosive tweets, it's possible that his political situation -- and his 39% approval rating in the latest CNN poll -- would improve.\n\nAfter all he's kept many of his campaign promises. Unemployment is at its lowest point in half a century and economic growth is going gangbusters.\n\nAnd conservatives will thank Trump for decades for his two successful Supreme Court nominations.\n\nBut the President is so identified with convention-tearing tactics that it's probably impossible for him to change his style. It's probably too late as well, since he's made no effort to broaden his support base since taking office.\n\nTrump's tempestuous personality and unwillingness to be constrained also likely mean that another remedy available to other Presidents -- a hotshot new staffer to shake up operations in the West Wing -- is unlikely to work.\n\nHis first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, failed to impose order on Trump and was soon out the door. His successor, John Kelly, who is rumored to be on his way out, was soon drowned out by chaos.\n\nThe idea that Trump will look at election results, have some kind of political conversion and become a kinder, gentler President is also unthinkable.\n\nHe almost never admits he's wrong and he's been looking for people to blame for the GOP loss in the House.\n\nFor instance, the President listed GOP candidates who refused to accept his support -- or what he called \"the embrace\" -- at a post-midterm election news conference.\n\nA boost on the horizon?\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? 02:21\n\nSo what about a win on the world stage to boost the President's spirits?\n\nThere's not a lot of low-hanging fruit. US Middle East policy is in uproar since it's anchored on Saudi Arabia, which is being ostracized over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nStill, a breakthrough in a joint US and British diplomatic bid to end the war in Yemen would not just boost Trump's political prospects, it also would be a significant victory for humanity.\n\nTrump's hopes of a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have taken a dent, with Pyongyang angry at the lack of concessions by the US and new indications that it is pressing ahead with its missile program.\n\nLater this month, Trump will head to the G20 summit. Progress in defusing his trade war with China at his talks there with President Xi Jinping -- or even a ceasefire -- could be spun as a foreign policy victory.\n\nTrump is also expected to meet with Vladimir Putin at the summit in Argentina. But that's a potential political landmine, given allegations of Russian election interference that have produced unflattering media coverage of his chats with the Russian leader, which has infuriated the President.\n\nThe chances of significant wins at home also seem slim, given the gridlock that will descend on Washington when Democrats take the House gavel.\n\nBut Trump mused after the midterm elections that the new arrangements might be more conducive to deal-making than had a thin GOP majority materialized.\n\n\"This way, they'll come to me, we'll negotiate. Maybe we'll make a deal, maybe we won't,\" he said.\n\nTrump seemed like someone trying to convince himself as much as the reporters in the room. But it's possible there is common ground on issues like prescription drug prices or infrastructure.\n\nThere was actually a ray of light on Wednesday when Trump had Democrats and Republicans to the White House to sign a bill that represents a small step toward criminal justice reform.\n\n\"Did I hear the word bipartisan?\" Trump quipped at the signing ceremony.\n\nOnce the Democratic subpoenas start flying, however, the room for compromise might shrivel.\n\nSo Trump will have one final option -- elevate an enemy -- a device he has effectively used throughout his political and business career.\n\nHe could choose to stage a showdown over a year-end spending bill to wring more financing for his border wall out of Congress. Though it's not clear that the possible government shutdown that could result would help him politically.\n\nThere is an argument that Trump will actually profit from lining up against a Democratic-led House next year -- especially if Nancy Pelosi, whose approval ratings are worse than his, gets her old job back as speaker.\n\nWhen 2019 dawns, a flurry of Democrats are likely to begin

repeatedly detailed as must-haves in trade talks with Beijing, including addressing technology transfers and intellectual property theft, according to one of the people briefed. Instead, the proposal has been described as a rehash of previous commitments Chinese leaders have publicly announced, like selectively lifting tariffs.\n\n\"What they are offering is not new,\" this person said. \"I think the two sides remain at an impasse. The channels are now open again, but there's a lot of work to get to \u2014 whether it's a modest de-escalation or ceasefire.\"\n\nBeijing's proposal comes after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone on Friday to jump start trade discussions ahead of an expected meeting between the two countries' leaders. US President Donald Trump has said he will have a \"good meeting\" with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires later this month.\n\nAsked about the offer at a weekly news briefing in Beijing on Thursday, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng would only reiterate comments from earlier in the week that \"high-level communications on the economic and trade front have resumed\" following a phone conversation between Trump and Xi two weeks ago.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Toobin: What's more empty than a Flake threat?", "description": "CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin criticizes Sen.

We will continue looking,\" Mohammad Abdul Kalam, Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner said. \"We cannot force anybody to go back.\"\n\nInternational rights groups have fiercely objected to plans to return the Rohingyas, for fear they'll continue to face persecution or be confined to permanent displacement camps without freedom of movement or the right to a livelihood.\n\nBangladesh has repeatedly said that no one will be forced to go back to Myanmar, but with little information given to those living in a sprawling refugee camp at Cox's Bazar, the process has been steeped in rumor, fear and uncertainty.\n\n\"We are scared to return to Myanmar because if we go they will kill us,\" 51-year-old Rohingya refugee Majeda told CNN.\n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR), which is not facilitating returns but has assessed the willingness of those chosen to go back, said the conditions in Myanmar are not conducive for refugees to be repatriated.\n\nMore than 720,000 Rohingya fled into Bangladesh following a systematic campaign by the Myanmar military that began in August last year. A UN fact-finding mission described the assault, which included widespread reports of mass rape, murder and arson, as genocide. The Myanmar government has denied that its soldiers deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya.\n\nSixty-year-old Rohingya refugee Rahima Khatun in Cox's Baxar, Bangladesh\n\n'Terror and panic'\n\nThere was a heavier than usual army presence in the camp on Wednesday, with security forces stepping up checks on refugees and journalists.\n\nAs word spread that some refugees were on a list of more than 2,000 approved by Myanmar to return, several families went into hiding, fearing they would be forced back.

How can we go back to Myanmar without having justice?\"\n\nRights groups say Bangladesh has done little to allay the fears of refugees and aid workers that repatriations would be voluntary. There have also been reports of Bangladesh security forces threatening and physically beating refugees, raising concerns that they may be coerced into returning.\n\nKalam, the Bangladesh repatriation official, told CNN the allegations against security forces were \"unfounded,\" adding that \"we will only repatriate those who volunteer to go back.\"\n\n\"This is a clear case where the Bangladesh authorities are failing to protect the refugee population, by allowing rumors to spread or fester, said Matthew Smith, Chief Executive Officer of human rights group Fortify Rights. \"No refugee in Bangladesh should be forced into hiding because they think they will be forced back to Myanmar. Dhaka has responsibility to prevent that from happening.\"\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on Tuesday that \"we are witnessing terror and panic\" among the refugees \"who are at imminent risk of being returned to Myanmar against their will,\" and she called on the Bangladesh government to halt repatriations.\n\nWhat awaits returning refugees?\n\nMany Rohingya have said they are willing to go back but only under the right conditions. Rohingya leaders said these include the right to citizenship, the return of lands, and for military leaders to be held accountable for abuses.\n\n\"We were tortured, female members in our family were raped and children were burnt alive,\" 39-year-old Rohingya refugee Dil Muhammad told CNN. \"We don't want to go back until our demands are accepted.\"\n\nIt is unlikely that any of these demands will be met.\n\nThe stateless Rohingya have long been a persecuted minority in Myanmar that have been kept in apartheid-like conditions across Rakhine State, where they are subjected to restrictions on movement, medical care and even births . They are labeled as \"Bengali\" by many in the country who see them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\n\nAround 120,000 Rohingya remain sequestered in displacement camps around the state capital Sittwe following ethnic violence six years ago. Rights groups fear a similar fate will befall returning refugees.\n\n\"This inhumane arrangement must not be allowed to become the status quo among any Rohingya refugees who may return to Myanmar,\" Save the Children's Asia Regional Director, Hassan Noor Saadi, said in a statement.\n\nRohingya refugee Dil Muhammad in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh\n\nMyanmar officials said those who return to the country would stay in temporary \"transit centers\" before being moved into villages.\n\n\"Their stated addresses will be scrutinized and if found correct, they will be allowed to return to them,\" Union Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, Win Myat Aye, told reporters on Sunday. Those without homes would be settled in \"temporary residences located in areas nearest to their original homes.\"\n\nRohingya advocates question how refugees can go back to these areas as entire villages were destroyed by fire and expunged of its Rohingya population.\n\n\"Quite a lot of people are from places that don't exist anymore. So where are they going to go?\" said Chris Lewa, director of the nonprofit Arakan Project, which advocates on Rohingya issues.\n\nAdding to woes is a requirement by Myanmar that refugees sign up for a national verification card, otherwise they will not be permitted to travel out of the transit camp or apply for citizenship. Rights groups say refugees are reluctant to accept the cards , fearing it will strip them of their Rohingya identity.\n\nShelter buildings constructed at a Rohingya repatriation centre is seen in Keruntoli near Teknaf, in Bangladesh on November 12, 2018.\n\n\"Rohingya families were burnt out of their homes, their people watched loved ones get massacred, there was systemic rape, so just a few months later to demand that this population work with the authorities and particularly with respect to issues of identity, it's not on the cards,\" said Smith.\n\nNo meaningful changes\n\nBy restricting access to northern Rakhine, Myanmar has made it almost impossible for independent monitors, journalists or humanitarian aid groups to build a clear picture of the conditions Rohingya will return to.\n\nUnder a memorandum of understanding with the Myanmar government, the UNHCR and UN Development Fund (UNDP) were granted access to conduct initial assessments in 26 villages in Rakhine -- a tiny portion of the state.\n\nFrom reports of Rohingya who stayed following the crackdown, the picture is bleak.\n\nunder strict curfews and movement restrictions.

His most recent book is \" Darwin's Ghosts ,\" a novel centered on human zoos. He lives with his wife Ang\u00e9lica in Durham, North Carolina, and in Chile. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Are we forever doomed to be warriors, wired from birth to be belligerent? Or is there, deep inside our species, an equal propensity toward peace?\n\nI found a tentative answer to these questions that have vexed humanity through the ages when I was no more than a child growing up in Queens in the late 1940s. At about the time when it turns out that Donald Trump, a mile or so away, was taking his first steps in life, I found myself at the age of 7 or so, fiercely engaged in a street-level cult of war that he would might well approve of today, given his militaristic posturing and bellicose language.\n\nBut Trump's Queens was, in that era of rampant discrimination, almost entirely white , whereas I resided -- thanks to my Argentine father's work for the fledgling United Nations --in an apartment complex called Parkway Village, a multicultural, multinational, multiethnic enclave. And the most unlikely place in the world for any sort of conflict between children or adults, for that matter, to find fertile ground, because it was thought of as a unique experiment in diversity -- international, linguistic, racial -- supposedly projecting a utopian vision of planetary harmony.\n\nAlas, it was not harmony I sought as I roamed the gardens and open spaces of Parkway Village where confrontations had broken out between rival groups of the young sons of diplomats and staff, who were so fervently dedicated to amity among nations and cultures. The clashes had started with an insult of some kind, soon escalating to fists and stones and, eventually, sticks.\n\nThe pugnacious kids were recent immigrants to the States, perhaps eager to hold onto some form of nativist identity by bashing the heads of anyone who spoke strangely or looked different.\n\nThe camp I belonged to consisted of French and Latin American lads, with a Liberian and an Egyptian added to the mix, while our opponents came primarily from Scandinavia and England, vaguely replicating a divide between North and South that would be the source of so many toxic combats across the globe in the coming decades. Despite truces organized at afternoon teas by our horrified mothers, the fighting became ever more ferocious.\n\nOnly Roy, a sweet youngster from India -- a friend I have evoked before, in a story I wrote some years ago -- attempted to stop the mayhem. He would often step between the two bands, begging us not to hurt each other, an intervention that was met by mockery from both sides (well, something at least cruelly united us!). We turned his last name -- akin to Bahana -- into Banana. Roy was bananas, crazy for believing he could convince us to abandon the masculine pleasures of our antagonism.\n\nAnd yet, it was Roy who finally managed precisely that, though not in the manner he or we could have foretold. One afternoon, as I returned from school, ready to rally the troops for another round of United-Nations-at-war, my distressed father told me that Roy had died that morning of a heart attack during a dental operation. Dazed with grief and guilt, I wandered into the wide area behind our house where the other boys soon began gathering. We all just stood there quietly, our heads turned toward the ground, our innocence shattered, our games of death revealed as shameful and offensive.\n\nFrom that day onward, the battles ceased.\n\nIt was a way for the mourning child-warriors to honor the memory of the departed peacemaker, keeping our small comrade alive -- or at least his message of brotherhood. Roy had wagered that war was a failure of the imagination, stemming from the inability to feel the afflictions of adversaries as if they were our own. This fantastical possibility, that an enemy could turn into a friend, was made real for me a few months later, when Jens, the Danish ringleader of the rival gang, moved into the house next door to ours. We had soon become inseparable, the best of pals.\n\nI remembered Roy recently as I watched the clips commemorating the ceremonies that marked the end of the First World War. His vision of a humanity that need not be condemned to endless cycles of aggression was anticipated by a young British officer called Wilfred Owen, who died a mere week before the Armistice on November 11th 1918, one more senseless death among so many others senselessly wasted.\n\nThough only 24 years old when he was killed, Owen wrote some extraordinary poems about his wartime experience. In one of them, \"Strange Meeting,\" he eerily anticipated the impending end of his own life, speaking of \"the waste of war in its time.\" They are verses that today -- when humanity is assailed with similar stories of carnage, poisonous gas attacks and fears of apocalypse -- are just as painfully relevant as they were back then.\n\nIn that poem, Owen channels the voice of a soldier who strikes up an unnerving conversation with a dead man. Together, they mourn \"the undone years, the hopelessness,\" until the dead man reveals he was killed the previous day by the very soldier narrating this encounter: \"I am the enemy you killed, my friend... Let us sleep now.\"\n\nOwen was to sleep forever, without seeing the conclusion of the \"War to End All Wars,\" according to a phrase from H.G. Wells. As the interminable conflicts and victims of the next hundred years attest, nothing could have been further from the truth: we continue to slaughter each other as if the curse of Cain is ingrained in our DNA, as if we had learned nothing. Our leaders promise, as Trump did in France, to \"protect the peace\" while doing not nearly enough to really prevent war.\n\nWe live in a world ravaged by incessant strife and the rise of the extreme nationalism that led to the First World War that so many now swear never to repeat. It is true that new incarnations of my friend Roy intervene across the globe.\n\nJUST WATCHED Critics slam Trump for skipping veterans event Replay More Videos ...

What is lacking is the realization by us all that peace is a daily task, that must be carried out not by heroic, exceptional beings, but by every concerned parent and every vulnerable child.\n\nOnly when millions upon millions understand that struggle to be intimately theirs, will no more Wilfred Owens die, no more soldiers like him be sent to kill enemies whom they have never met and who could one day move in next door and become their best friends. Only then will Roy rest, effectively, in peace."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Cooper (literally) clowns Trump's claim", "description": "CNN's Anderson Cooper discusses President Trump's lack of evidence to support his voter fraud claim that voters went into their cars to change clothes and vote again.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/15/election-fraud-donald-trump-kth-anderson-cooper-ac360-sot-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114231709-kth-11-14-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T04:48:32Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Est\u00e1 abiertamente especulando sobre el reemplazo de m\u00e1s miembros de su gabinete, aunque hasta ahora no ha logrado ejecutar los despidos, dejando a esos funcionarios en un purgatorio.\n\nEn una fiesta de la noche electoral en la Casa Blanca, Trump dej\u00f3 a los asistentes inquietos cuando fue visto en un grupo con un posible reemplazo para su secretario general de presidencia, John Kelly, quien se encontraba inc\u00f3modamente en un rinc\u00f3n.\n\n\"S\u00ed, est\u00e1 enojado, casi contra todos\", dijo un funcionario de la Casa Blanca, se\u00f1alando que el estado de \u00e1nimo en la Oficina Oval es m\u00e1s sombr\u00edo de lo normal esta semana. Despu\u00e9s de casi un mes consecutivo de campa\u00f1a ante multitudes que lo adoran, el aplauso se ha silenciado y el presidente se ha retirado. La tempestad ha llevado a la especulaci\u00f3n desenfrenada dentro de la Casa Blanca sobre los destinos de otros miembros del personal de alto nivel, algunos de los cuales est\u00e1n empezando a planificar sus salidas.\n\nLos amigos del presidente lo describen como amargado por las p\u00e9rdidas electorales y preocupado por la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller. Se reuni\u00f3 el lunes con sus abogados para revisar una serie de preguntas escritas del fiscal especial. Algunos de sus confidentes de larga data est\u00e1n preocupados por su salud, creyendo que ha ganado peso y se ve mal.\n\nEl momento para la furia del presidente no podr\u00eda ser peor, considerando que la Casa Blanca se est\u00e1 dirigiendo hacia un territorio inexplorado con los dem\u00f3cratas asumiendo el control de la C\u00e1mara. Trump le ha dicho a algunos asesores que est\u00e1 ansioso por pelear, creyendo que puede eso proporcionarle un arma pol\u00edtica. Mientras tanto, el fiscal especial Robert Mueller est\u00e1 acerc\u00e1ndose cada vez m\u00e1s a emitir su informe sobre la investigaci\u00f3n de la trama rusa.\n\n\"\u00c9l sabe que est\u00e1 terminando.

Despu\u00e9s de que a Ricardel ni siquiera se le dio la dignidad de ser nombrada en la declaraci\u00f3n, que se refer\u00eda a ella solo como \"ella\", todos en el Ala Eeste dec\u00edan su nombre el mi\u00e9rcoles mientras la ansiedad se intensificaba sobre lo que significar\u00eda esta \u00faltima pelea para el estado de \u00e1nimo del presidente. M\u00e1s tarde el mi\u00e9rcoles, la secretaria de prensa Sarah Sanders emiti\u00f3 un comunicado confirmando que Ricardel dejar\u00e1 su puesto en la Casa Blanca, y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que Ricardel \"har\u00e1 la transici\u00f3n a un nuevo papel dentro de la administraci\u00f3n\".\n\nMIRA: \u00bfQui\u00e9n es Mira Ricardel y por qu\u00e9 Melania Trump la quiere fuera de la Casa Blanca?\n\nEn la \u00faltima semana, las relaciones deshilachadas y tediosas del presidente se han dejado al descubierto para que todos lo vean: est\u00e1 furioso con Kelly por un viaje a Par\u00eds que termin\u00f3 en una debacle de relaciones p\u00fablicas. Est\u00e1 culpando a sus asesores pol\u00edticos por perder la narrativa ganadora de las elecciones intermedias. Y fue sorprendido por el golpe que dio su esposa contra una de las mejores funcionarias del ala oeste, una se\u00f1al de que sus conversaciones privadas claramente no son funcionales.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de que su esposa orden\u00f3 que se publicara la declaraci\u00f3n el martes por la tarde, Trump estaba furioso de que lo que hab\u00eda sido un asunto interno de personal ahora fuera puesto a la vista del p\u00fablico, dej\u00e1ndolo a \u00e9l como un esposo al que mandan. El estado de \u00e1nimo del presidente era oscuro e intenso despu\u00e9s de lo que los funcionarios dijeron fue una ceguera por parte de los asistentes que no le informan.\n\nSin embargo, si el repentino inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico en Ricardel, una funcionaria detr\u00e1s de c\u00e1maras, sorprendi\u00f3 al presidente, los problemas subyacentes entre ella y la oficina de la primera dama no

But more than a decade after its grand opening, keeping the hotel's opulence in suitable splendor for the travel set is a full-time job for Manoj Kuriakose, an engineer from Kerala in southern India -- and an expensive endeavorfor the hotel.\n\nKuriakose and his team are tasked with the upkeep of the 2,000 square meters (6,560 square feet) of ornate ceiling adorned with 22-carat gold and silver leaves.\n\nThe gold leaf typically lasts for just four to five years, according to the palace, and so it's constantly being replaced.\n\nThe price of luxury\n\nAbout 50 gold leaves are needed to cover one square meter of ceiling, at an approximate cost of $100.\n\nKuriakose replaces about four to six square meters of gold a day, meaning the palace spends about $130,000 on gold leaf every year.\n\n\"Wherever you look, you can see the gold leaf and silver leaf,\" Kuriakose says.\n\nThe Emirates Palace cost more than $3 billion to build.\n\nThin sheets of pure gold are imported from Italy, then rolled, pressed and hammered between vellum, a fine parchment, until they become even finer.\n\nOnce the leaf is ready to be applied, the ceiling is prepared with a warm red base coat of paint.\n\nThen a special glue is used to apply the gold leaf.\n\nA new leaf\n\nThe Emirates Palace stretches more than one kilometer from east to west.\n\nThe team use their fingers to shape the delicate gold leaf.\n\n\"We fix the leaves one by one.

This month, a cheating scandal implicated a prestigious private school in Seoul's swanky Gangnam District, twin girl students, and their father, a senior school official.\n\nSuspicions rise\n\nAt a press conference at Gangnam's Suseo Police Station on Monday, officers displayed a host of yellow post-it notes and a small notepad filled with sequences of numbers. Beside them were several pages from an exam paper, clean except for a stack of numbers on the back pagje.\n\nReading from her report, investigation chief Jin Jeom-ok explained how police had been alerted to a potential cheating scandal at Sookmyung Girls' High School, a private institution which boasts more than 100 years of history and claims to send more students to SKY colleges, the Korean equivalent of the Ivy League, than any other. In the past, the school has produced many successful artists, businesswomen, and politicians, including the current first lady of South Korea.\n\nA student checks her exam room number before the annual College Scholastic Ability Test, a standardised exam for college entrance, at a high school in Seoul on November 23, 2017.\n\nIn late July, suspicion was aroused at the school when twin girls in the junior year shot up in school-wide rankings from 59th and 121st, respectively, to the very top. The fact that their father was a senior school administrator further fanned suspicion.\n\n\"(My daughter) came home crying and told me about what happened in school. They were shocked and felt betrayed,\" Lee Shin-woo, Sookmyung parent, told local media. \"Those students who were in (low positions) in the freshman year all of a sudden rose to the top. Then in the second semester, they won an award that only goes to the top 1%. Signs were there.\"\n\nSchool rankings affect university placements along with the CSAT results, and can spell the difference between a student getting their top choice school or not.\n\nLee and other parents demanded an investigation and began nightly candlelight protests in front of the school.\n\n\"Students were shocked that their teacher and the classmates that they trusted had leaked the answers,\" Lee said. \"The top students were especially disheartened.\"\n\nA student enters an exam room to take the annual College Scholastic Ability Test, a standardised exam for college entrance, at a high school in Seoul on November 23, 2017.\n\nJin, the investigator, said the twins' father, Hyun Gyung-yong -- against protocol -- knew the combination for the safe which held exam papers and answer sheets. There was no surveillance camera in the room with the safe, so no evidence that he accessed it. But police said Hyun repeatedly stayed late alone at the school without logging overtime.\n\nProtesting parents accused Hyun of taking the answer papers and copying or photographing them before providing to his daughters.\n\n\"(Other students) saw the twins study a small palm-sized notepad intensely just before the exam began. When they asked about it, the girls tried to hide it,\" Lee said. \"They saw them write the answers down on the exam paper, which looked like a sequence of numbers then filled in the answer sheet.\"\n\nMost South Korean high school students take two exams per semester. They are graded in relation to their classmates and then placed into one of nine brackets. The higher the bracket, the better the university they can gain early admission to. If students cheat their way up the rankings, the relative grading system means other children are inevitably bumped down to lower brackets.\n\nScraps of paper Suseo Police say were used to cheat in a school exam by twin girls whose father was a school administrator.\n\nSmoking gun\n\nBy August, there were enough complaints from parents that the school requested education authorities carry out an investigation. As accusations grew, police also opened their own case into the matter.\n\nOn September 5, police raided Sookmyung and the twins' home. They found Hyun had recently replaced both his work and personal computers and physically destroyed an old hard disk.\n\nIn the home however, police found what they believed is a smoking gun: on one of the girls' phones was a document containing several answers to the written exam, and it was dated before the test took place.\n\nThe girls allegedly failed to cover their tracks in other ways. On one part of the exam paper which involved complicated mathematical calculations they had just put the answers, without showing any work.\n\nThe family has continued to maintain their innocence. When asked about the clean exam paper, the twins' claimed to have done all the calculations in their head, while the note on the phone was simply filled with possible answers -- that they got them all correct was just a lucky guess.\n\nThe girls accused of cheating had the answers to several exam questions on their phone before the test, they said they were just lucky guesses.\n\nThe family's attorney said that police had failed to provide any direct proof of Hyun stealing the answers, but on November 6, a judge ruled there was sufficient evidence and issued an arrest warrant.\n\n\"We believe Hyun stole exam papers and answer sheets a total of five times and supplied them to his daughters,\" police said Monday after charges were laid. \"Investigators suspect the twins brought the notebook into the exam and copied the correct answers onto the back of the exam papers (before the test began).\n\nPolice are requesting prosecutors indict all three as co-conspirators on a charge of obstruction of business, which could bring with it up to five years in jail or a fine of $13,000. Though the twins have already withdrawn from the school, Sookmyung said in a statement they would be officially expelled and their exam scores nullified. A tribunal will also be held to remove Hyun from his position.\n\nAs attention now turns to the CSAT itself, Lee, the parent, said the Sookmyung cheating scandal is likely not an isolated incident.\n\n\"I was told it is customary for teachers and administrators and their children to be at the same school,\" Lee said. \"But today it was proven that such a custom (can be) a crime. So we demand an investigation.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education said the case \"damages the absolute value of academic achievement, which is fairness. It is a serious incident of corruption which crumbles the people's trust in public education.\"\n\nOfficials promised to clamp down on teachers and their children being at the same school, and to install security cameras in all school offices which store exam papers.\n\nAs for the twins, their attorney said they will plead not guilty at the trial, which will likely take place late this year or early next. Asked what they will do when all this is over, he said they \"will likely take the GED, or maybe leave the country.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Caroline Kelly and Barbara Starr, CNN", "title": "First woman passes special forces assessment on path to becoming Green Beret", "description": "A female soldier recently completed the Special Forces Assessment and Selection for the first time, making her a candidate to be the first woman to become a Green Beret, according to a US Army Special Operations Command spokesman.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/first-woman-green-beret-selection-test/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150505110846-us-special-forces-5-super-169.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:28:52Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) A female soldier recently completed the Special Forces Assessment and Selection for the first time, making her a candidate to be the first woman to become a Green Beret, according to a US Army Special Operations Command spokesman.\n\nThe woman, who has not been named due to the highly sensitive missions undertaken by the Green Berets, will next attempt the Special Forces Qualification Course, USASOC spokesman Lt.

But even they stopped taking her calls a month ago.\n\na predominantly Muslim ethnic minority in western China, are being held in camps across the region, according to a An estimated one million Uyghurs,a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority in western China, are being held in camps across the region, according to a US congressional report.\n\nThe Chinese government has never explained the disappearances, which began in 2017, nor said how many people are being held in the camps, which they insist are \"vocational training centers\" that local \"students\" are happy to attend.\n\nDefending his country's human rights record at a United Nations forum in early November, China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng said that his country had made \"remarkable progress\" in the past four decades , including \"lifting more than a billion people out of poverty.\"\n\nBut many other countries remain harshly critical of Beijing's record, especially in regards to the Xinjiang camps. More than a dozen states including Australia, Germany and the United States have called on China to dismantle the camps and release those detained.\n\n\"They are transformation centers, and they really are aimed at completely altering Uyghur culture and identity. It's kind of a surreal practice, I would say, that is definitely unprecedented in the 21st century,\" Sean Roberts, director of the International Development Studies Program at George Washington University, told CNN.\n\nHoja goes even further. She describes it as \"cultural genocide.\"\n\n'Brainwashed'\n\nBeijing has had a long and fractious history with Xinjiang, a massive, nominally autonomous region in the far west of the country that is home to a relatively small population of around 22 million in a nation of 1.4 billion people.\n\nAlthough the ruling Communist Party says Xinjiang has been part of China \"since ancient times,\" it was only officially named and placed under central government control after being conquered by the Qing Dynasty in the 1800s.\n\nThe predominately Muslim Uyghurs, who are ethnically distinct from the country's majority ethnic group, the Han Chinese, form the majority in Xinjiang, where they account for just under half of the total population.\n\nThis, however, is changing fast. According to government data , in 1953 Han Chinese accounted for just 6% of Xinjiang's total population of 4.87 million, while Uyghurs made up 75%. By the year 2000 the Han Chinese population had grown to 40%, while Uyghurs had fallen to 45% of the total population of 18.46 million.\n\nContinued economic development has led to an increase in skilled Han Chinese migrants. The provincial capital Urumqi, Xinjiang's largest and most prosperous city, is today majority Han Chinese.\n\n\"They named our homeland Xinjiang ... Uyghurs prefer to call it East Turkistan because our land was called (that) before the Chinese occupied,\" Hoja said, looking at the map of her home province. Xinjiang means \"new frontier\" in Chinese.\n\nIn the past decade, perceived \"Sinocization\" across Xinjiang has led to Uyghur unrest -- and bouts of bloody ethnic violence.\n\nThe region has also been braced by acts of terrorism, often directed at authorities. In reaction, the provincial government, which blames the terrorist attacks on independence-seeking Uyghur extremists, has greatly expanded its efforts to control the local Uyghur population.\n\nUnder direction of Xinjiang's Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, authorities have cracked down hard on the Muslim beliefs and practices of the Uyghur population, including face coverings and long beards , Quran study groups and preventing government employees from fasting for Ramadan.\n\nAnyone can be sent, under the flimsiest of reasons, to \"re-education camps,\" according to Hoja. \"When my brother was taken ... my Mum asked like, 'Why are you taking my son? What he do?' And the officer answered back, 'His sister's (in the US), is that not enough to take him?'\" she said.\n\nBut Hoja believes the real reason he was taken was simpler than that. \"They are targeted just because they are Uyghurs.\"\n\nUyghur journalist Gulchehra Hoja's brother and parents in an undated family photo\n\nHoja claims up to 40% of the province's Uyghur population, as many as four million people, could currently be held in the \"re-education camps.\"\n\n\"They are ill-treated there. They are tortured there. Even you cannot speak your own language in there, you are brainwashed,\" Hoja alleged.\n\n\"Every day before your meal you have to sing a 'red' (communist) song, and say thank you to (Chinese President) Xi Jinping or the Communist Party.\"\n\nIn defense of the government's policy, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV aired footage inside what they term \"vocational training camps,\" showing smiling Uyghurs learning Chinese and skills such as sewing.\n\nBut Hoja challenged the idea that her family was in such desperate need of vocational training that they should be taken to the camps.\n\n\"My aunt knows more than three languages, she is also retired from the Xinjiang Museum, so what kind of education does she need to take?\" she said.\n\n'The worst feeling in the world'\n\nMamatjan Juma, another Uyghur journalist working for RFA, said not knowing where your family was, or being able to help them, was \"the worst feeling in the world.\"\n\n\"Every day I think of them, the pain is there. Because it's just like a kind of virus, it's in your mind, the pain is there every night. They were in my dreams sometimes ... You cannot do anything,\" he told CNN.\n\nA former teacher from a big family in the Xinjiang city of Kashgar, Juma, said Chinese authorities took away two of his brothers in May 2017.\n\n\"My last brother, the third one, the youngest brother was taken away this year, in February. And since then I've lost contact with my Mom and two of my younger sisters,\" he said.\n\nAhmatjan Juma, a teacher and brother of Uyghur journalist Mamatjan Juma, who disappeared in Xinjiang in 2017\n\nLike Hoja, Juma feels that working as a journalist in the US has led to negative consequences for his family. From 2010, he began to receive calls from his brother trying to convince him to come home.

They don't have any facilities ... They don't have enough food,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese government claims its actions in Xinjiang, including the mass detentions and forced home stays by Communist Party officials, are designed to make the province more secure and prosperous.\n\nXinjiang Governor Shohrat Zakir, himself a Uyghur, told the state-run Xinhua news agency in October that since the crackdown \"Xinjiang is not only beautiful but also safe and stable.\"\n\nBut Juma told CNN Beijing is simply trying to \"Sinocize\" Xinjiang, remove the Uyghurs' culture and identity and make them more like the Han Chinese majority. \"They call it educate and civilize, but that's not the case,\" he said.\n\n'Critical location'\n\nWhile a large part of the Chinese government's crackdown in Xinjiang has centered on efforts to \"transform\" Uyghurs into model Chinese citizens, Roberts, the associate professor, said there may be ulterior motives for Beijing.\n\n\"If you look at the plans for (Chinese President) Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, Xinjiang is a critical location that will serve as the jumping off point for all economic expansion into Central Asia and South West Asia and really into Europe,\" he told CNN.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative, a signature policy of Xi's, plans to create trade corridors between Beijing and the rest of the world, through international infrastructure spending and diplomatic agreements.\n\nThe name references the Maritime Silk Road, which will run to Africa through South East Asia, and the Silk Road Economic Belt, which will connect Xinjiang to important partners such as Pakistan, Turkey and Russia.\n\n\"The Belt and Road is part of the reason that there's such an urgency to clean up the Uyghur population in Xinjiang at the present moment,\" Roberts said.\n\n\"What really concerns me is that, if it's really the last chance to try to transform Uyghurs, what's the next step if they decide that the Uyghurs can't be transformed into a passive benign minority that's loyal to the state?\" he said.\n\nDespite the threat of violence or abduction for her and her family, Hoja says she feels obligated to keep speaking out and working to raise awareness for the \"voiceless\" Uyghur.\n\nEven with everything that's happened, Hoja says, her dearest wish would be to return home, one day, to Xinjiang. \"It's my biggest dream ... everybody wants to go back home right?\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Sara Murray and Kate Sullivan, CNN", "title": "Text messages show Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks plans days before hack", "description": "Roger Stone exchanged text messages with his alleged WikiLeaks back channel about imminent \"big news\" harmful to Hillary Clinton's campaign six days before WikiLeaks released hacked emails from former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, according to new m\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/text-messages-roger-stone-wikileaks-hack/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181102163925-randy-credico-roger-stone-split-1102-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T01:43:39Z", "content": "(CNN) Roger Stone exchanged text messages with his alleged WikiLeaks back channel about imminent \"big news\" harmful to Hillary Clinton's campaign six days before WikiLeaks released hacked emails from former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, according to\u2026 [+4173 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) Roger Stone exchanged text messages with his alleged WikiLeaks back channel about imminent \"big news\" harmful to Hillary Clinton's campaign six days before WikiLeaks released hacked emails from former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, according to new messages released by Stone.\n\n\"big news Wednesday,\" Randy Credico, a progressive New York political activist and radio host, texted Stone on October 1, 2016. \"now pretend u don't know me.\"\n\n\"U died 5 years ago,\" Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, responded.\n\n\"great,\" Credico texted back. \"Hillary's campaign will die this week.\"\n\nStone provided the text messages in an effort to prove Credico was his source of information on WikiLeaks. The text messages appear to show Credico providing Stone with updates on Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and his document-dump plans just ahead of their public release in October. In some of the texts, Credico appears to indicate he has insights into Assange's plans through Assange's lawyer.\n\nCredico's messages came the same week Assange scheduled a news conference with much fanfare, promising an October surprise. Assange didn't deliver any dirt on Clinton during the press event, much to the dismay of her critics.\n\nBut days later, on October 7, WikiLeaks released the first batch of emails hacked from Podesta's personal account soon after The Washington Post published audio of Trump making disparaging remarks about women. The group would go on to release near-daily hacked emails in the closing weeks of the presidential race, altering the course of the campaign.\n\nStone has been a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone from Trump's campaign was involved. Mueller is looking into Stone's potential back channels to WikiLeaks and his communication with then-candidate Trump during the campaign as part of the probe.\n\nGrant Smith, Stone's attorney, provided CNN with copies of the messages, which were first reported by NBC News. \"I think these are completely vindicating of Roger,\" Smith said. \"It could not be any clearer.\"\n\nOn August 27, 2016 -- just days after Credico interviewed Assange for a radio show -- Credico texted Stone, \"Julian Assange has kryptonite on Hillary.\"\n\nWhile Stone made a number of public claims in 2016 that seemed to suggest he had advance warning of WikiLeaks' plans, he has denied having early knowledge of hacked messages that could be damaging to Clinton's presidential bid. He has said his statements during the campaign were based on public information and his back channel, Credico.\n\nCredico denied that he acted as Stone's intermediary with WikiLeaks and said his messages to Stone were based on Assange's public statements.\n\n\"It's two observers to a potential dump by Julian Assange. That's it,\" Credico told CNN.\n\nCredico also accused Stone of cherrypicking the messages he released.\n\n\"He's retroactively trying to invent something to cover his a--,\" Credico said.\n\nCredico has been interviewed multiple times by Mueller's investigators and has testified before the grand jury. He noted that he has handed all of his communications with Stone over to the special counsel. Credico said he also gave investigators permission to retrieve messages from his cell phone provider that were no longer available on his devices.\n\nCredico's attorney said Wednesday that he believed Mueller's investigators were finished questioning his client. After the latest text message release Wednesday, Credico said he wouldn't be surprised if Mueller's team followed up with additional questions.\n\nStone and Credico have a complicated history that spans more than a decade. Over the years, they've worked together on political campaigns and called each other friend. But it has been a rocky relationship, and at one point years ago, Stone started a rumor that Credico was dead.\n\nIn the released text messages, Credico repeatedly asks Stone not to name him as his connection to Assange. \"Just remember do not name me as your connection to Assange you had one before that you referred to,\" he texted Stone on September 18, 2016.\n\nCredico also texts Stone selfies taken outside of what appears to be the Embassy of Ecuador in London, where Assange has taken refuge, days before Assange held his Oct. 4 news conference promising the big reveal. Credico said he never made it inside the embassy on his trip."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump's favorite portraits of himself", "description": "Which Trump portraits does President Trump prefer?

He currently advises political and corporate clients in the United States, Africa and Latin America. You can follow him on Twitter @ArickWierson . The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nSomehow, some way, sooner or later -- we all knew it was coming. Hillary Clinton's name was going to re-emerge as a possible presidential contender for 2020.\n\nA recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled \"Hillary Will Run Again,\" by Mark Penn, Clinton's former longtime pollster, and Andrew Stein, former president of the New York City Council, sent the media into a bit of a frenzy over the weekend. They argued that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state would definitely be back in the 2020 mix -- perhaps not initially -- but certainly by the time the primaries are in full swing. Voters, they suggest, should not be surprised to see Clinton announcing her candidacy around the time of the Iowa caucuses, just as the candidate field is beginning to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nAs the news of the op-ed spread up and down the Acela Corridor, many Democratic insiders found themselves silently burying their heads in their hands. Penn's presage struck a chord among rank-and-file DNC staffers who still maintain a hardened belief that 2016 wasn't about a Trump victory, but a Clinton loss -- a defeat in a most spectacular fashion, brought on by her campaign's hubris.\n\nMeanwhile, the news that Hillary may run again suddenly put a skip in the step of some Republicans. Until Saturday, many had been hanging their heads low as the reality of the blue wave of the midterm elections, which reclaimed the House for the Democrats, sunk in.\n\n\"Dear God, please, yes,\" tweeted Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway upon hearing the news.\n\nAll of the emotions and excitement may be jumping the gun, however. Keep in mind that Mark Penn is not Hillary's spokesman, nor is Andy Stein. Their words should not be taken as any sort of announcement on behalf of Clinton.\n\nIt's also possible that the op-ed could be some sort of trial balloon, sanctioned by the Clintons, simply to take America's temperature and calculate the odds of one last hurrah before riding off into the sunset. Or it could be a canard -- a carefully placed article meant to throw off Republican strategists, forcing them to prepare for a possibility that they had all but written off.\n\nThe most likely scenario, however, is that the Wall Street Journal piece was simply the oeuvre of a pair of provocateurs -- two old partisans from the 1990s who are simply seeking to reclaim their space, and relevance -- in the current political environment.\n\nFor the good of the country and the Democratic party, we can only hope that Penn and Stein are just grandstanding, and that nothing more comes of this talk of Hillary in 2020.\n\nCNN's Chris Cillizza gave a perfectly honed accounting of all the reasons why, if you are a Democrat, or even a Republican or Independent who can't stand Donald Trump, the last thing you should be rooting for is a Hillary 2020 presidential campaign. We agree, but we think the Hillary question is bigger than just 2020 and the Democrats' shot at dethroning President Trump; we believe that her re-emergence onto the national stage has the very real potential to drive a schism so deep within the Democratic Party that Democrats would not only come up short in 2020, the party might also be irrevocably fractured in two. Clinton's candidacy would divide the it in a way that would make the current distance between the traditional free-trade wing of the GOP and Trump's base of loyalists seem like next door neighbors.\n\nIn 2018, we saw the progressive, Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic party and the more centrist factions, previously marshaled by Hillary Clinton, temporarily band-aid over their differences that were on full display in 2016 for the common good.\n\nBy agreeing to play nice with one another, they were able to take back the House and a handful of governor's mansions, providing the first real check on the Trump White House. But Hillary resurfacing as a presidential candidate would pick off that ugly scab, creating a toxic intramural dynamic that would infect the outcome of 2020 and well beyond.\n\nWe have also seen the demographic divide of the party come into clear view with the recent midterm elections. Women, people of color, LGBT people, and young candidates were elected at historic levels . It's clear that Hillary's election loss and Trump's divisive, us-versus-them leadership style helped, in part, unleash this trend -- which makes it all the more difficult to imagine Democrats turning back to her as their pick for 2020.\n\nMoreover, how could the party, which has been at the forefront of the #MeToo movement over the past year, possibly reconcile its role as champion of women with its endorsement of a candidate who many feel whitewashed her husband's womanizing?\n\nIf there is one takeaway from midterm election night, it's that the face of the new Democratic party is increasingly female, more diverse and, yes, younger.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe can't predict who will ultimately make a serious run for the Democratic nomination in 2020, nor who is most likely to come out on top. Yet, while Democrats should be encouraged by the midterm election results, it's clear that they are a long way away from identifying the right strategy and message to successfully oppose Donald Trump; losses in places like Ohio and Missouri suggest that the electoral college math will still be a tough nut to crack.\n\nDemocrats will need to not only find a better messenger, but develop a better message that is deeper than \"I am not Trump.\" If Clinton runs, many Americans will only see her candidacy as a personal vendetta or quest for redemption, not a move with the best interests of Democrats at heart.\n\nSo please, Hillary, don't do it."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Lilit Marcus", "title": "Is this the coolest brewery in Asia?", "description": "On Jeju Island, Magpie Brewing Co is changing the story of craft beer not only in South Korea but in all of Asia.

Short-sightedness increases dramatically with age; it affects over half of children aged 10, 80% of 16-year-olds and over 90% of university students in China.\n\nBut the Chinese government has the resolve -- and a five-year plan -- to eradicate poor vision and preventable blindness by delivering \"universal medical eye care for all.\"\n\nIt is a huge undertaking but worth doing, as treating myopia is more than just a health issue.\n\nQi gong master Liang Jian Sheng treats a short-sighted patient by transferring his energy to the young boy at a hospital in Guangzhou.\n\nMyopia costs the global economy around $3 trillion a year in health costs and lost productivity, according to a 2010 report. By 2050, nearly 50% of the world's population is predicted to have myopia, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nVision is the golden thread by which many of the UN's sustainable development goals can be achieved, including quality education, decent work and economic growth, and gender equality.\n\nChina should draw on the experiences of countries that have set an example on the issue.\n\nLearning from Rwanda\n\nIn Rwanda, during my tenure as minister for health and thereafter, we executed a plan that has provided all 12 million citizens with the option of accessing glasses. The glasses cost as little as $1.50 and are provided free for the poorest 20%.\n\nRwanda's history sets a precedent for such policy, not only in its ambition but also in its feasibility.\n\nThe key strategy was training nurses at regular health centers to deliver sight tests and prescribe glasses. In Rwanda, between 2012 and 2017, a three-day course trained about 2,800 nurses to perform eye exams nationwide and provide appropriate eye care, meeting a critical shortage of trained specialists to diagnose eye conditions.\n\nDr. Agnes Bingwaho in Butaro, Rwanda, with community health workers in January.\n\nRestrictions that had previously prevented other health workers from carrying out vision tests were removed so testing was not merely confined to ophthalmologists.\n\nThese professionals, working in Rwanda's health centers, have now distributed over 150,000 affordable glasses to those in need.\n\nBetween October 2016 and February 2018, about 103,500 of those who had their vision tested by nurses were referred to a hospital to receive custom glasses, have surgery or simply be given eye drops. Of those, about 34,500 were up to 14 years old, and 92,150 were 15 and above.\n\nRural problems\n\nAs in China, consistency of health care between rural and urban parts of Rwanda was an issue. To address this, the government set up 502 health centers with good access to all 15,000 villages across Rwanda. In each health center, four general nurses were upskilled to provide basic vision testing and eye care, alongside their other duties.\n\nChina faces a significant discrepancy between eye care in the urban areas, where most ophthalmologists practice, and the rural regions where approximately 42% of the population lives ; people there often live 50 miles or farther from the nearest town or city.\n\nLike Rwanda, China can also expand the types of providers who can deliver these screening programs in the countryside.\n\nDr Agnes Binagwaho working for the Rwandan Health Ministry in Kigali in 2010.\n\nIn nine out of 10 cases, all it takes to treat poor vision is a simple pair of glasses. According to Euromonitor, China is the largest manufacturer of eye glasses in the world and so is well positioned to make those gains; unlike Rwanda, it wouldn't need to import.\n\nThere could be economic benefits in doing so.\n\nTea farmers in a plantation in Assam, India, became 20% more productive when they wore a simple pair of reading glasses, according to a recent study by Clearly , an organization trying to tackle uncorrected poor vision across the world, which was published in the journal Lancet Global Health.\n\nAnd for those employees over the age of 50, their output increased by no less than 31% -- a larger productivity increase than has been recorded by any other health intervention known featured in peer-reviewed research.\n\nVideo gaming to blame?\n\nXi's recent focus on the myopia issue has caused some to suggest that children's obsession with video games, which keeps them indoors, is to blame.\n\nAlthough there is mixed evidence for whether near work itself leads to myopia, one factor in the development of myopia is the amount of time spent outdoors in the sunlight.\n\nWhile all potential causes of myopia should be examined and prevention is important, the challenge for China at this juncture is to get eye testing and affordable glasses to all those who need them.\n\nYoung people play video games on mobile phones in a cafe.\n\nThe potential for China -- one of the fastest-growing and most technologically advanced economies in the world -- is immense.\n\nThe country's commitment to this eye care revolution will translate into benefits well beyond the health sector and will help to promote literacy, education, the economic empowerment of families and the country as a whole.\n\nAs we implement and sustain these programs, Rwanda should continue to share its experience and learnings with China."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eli Watkins and Cheri Mossburg, CNN", "title": "Michael Avenatti arrested for domestic violence", "description": "Attorney Michael Avenatti has been placed under arrest for felony domestic violence and was being booked early Wednesday evening.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/michael-avenatti-arrest/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114175116-michael-avenatti-file-1010-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:38:19Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Attorney Michael Avenatti has been placed under arrest on suspicion of felony domestic violence and was booked early Wednesday evening.\n\nLos Angeles Police Department officer Jeff Lee said the domestic violence report was taken on Tuesday in West Los Angeles and the arrest was made Wednesday.\n\n\"We can confirm that today LAPD Detectives arrested Michael Avenatti on suspicion of domestic violence.

NTSB investigators hope the hearing will help them pinpoint the cause of the problem and prevent the catastrophic events from happening again.\n\nFocus on the fan blade\n\nInvestigators have zeroed in on the engine design and its history, which includes various design changes to address cracking and a 2016 engine failure involving another Southwest Airlines plane\n\nEngine manufacturer CFM International said at the hearing their CFM56-7B model failed its first certification test in the mid-1990s but ultimately passed a second certification test. Since then, engineers have made various design changes to prevent fan blade failures.\n\nAfter the engines were put into fleet service, \"some of those early engines, when we looked at the fan blades, it indicated the coating system was not staying intact as well as we had anticipated with the design change,\" said Mark Habedank, engineering leader for the CFM56 engine.\n\nThe company made a design modification, installing a piece of metal it called a \"shim,\" and adding lubrication.\n\nMore recently, inspectors discovered similar cracked blades in the same engine model installed on other airlines' planes, Habedank said.\n\nAfter the 2016 failure, CFM told operators to perform additional inspections of the fan blades.\n\nSouthwest, whose entire fleet is Boeing 737s, said the particular fan blade that failed had not met the requirements for additional scrutiny.\n\n\"At the time of the event, we had already inspected 603 engines,\" said Mark Wibben, an engineering manager at the airline. However, he said, \"We had no basis to prioritize these fan blades versus any other blades in our fleet.\"\n\nThe failed engine's last maintenance work was performed in June 2017, the NTSB reported. It was manufactured in 1997 and overhauled in 2012.\n\nCFM International is a joint venture between GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines.\n\nIn a statement sent Wednesday to CNN, GE Aviation said that CFM \"responded aggressively\" after the 2016 incident and worked closely with regulators to inspect some 350,000 fan blades in the CFM56-7B fleet. All the fan blades were cleared by mid-August 2018, the statement said.\n\nChaos in the cabin\n\nInterviews by the NTSB reveal new details about the frightening scene aboard the plane, which was carrying 144 passengers, three flight attendants and two pilots.\n\nThe first indication of a problem was a loud bang at 11:03 a.m, about a half hour after the plane took off from LaGuardia airport. The plane was flying at 32,000 feet when it banked steeply to the left and the oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling.\n\nWhile alarms sounded in the cockpit, the pilots struggled with equipment issues that prevented them from communicating with flight attendants, air traffic controllers, firefighters and each other, while also recovering from the steep turn and figuring out where they could land.\n\nIn the cockpit, the pilots worked to level out the plane and began descending. But they told investigators that while wearing their oxygen masks, they couldn't speak to each other.\n\nAfter finding the correct microphone switches, the pilots mistakenly believed the plane was on fire and asked an air traffic controller to route them to the Philadelphia airport.\n\n\"We're single engine descending have a fire in number one,\" one of the pilots said, according to the NTSB report.\n\nAt that point -- 11 minutes after the bang -- one of the pilots called back to the cabin to speak to the flight attendants. That was when the flight-deck crew first learned of the situation in the cabin, including an injured passenger, the NTSB report says.\n\nThe flight attendants were preparing to serve drinks when they heard the bang.\n\nOne flight attendant said that \"because of the pressure in her ears, she could barely hear anything, the cabin was loud and windy,\" the report said.\n\nA passenger's death\n\nA flight attendant discovered the harrowing scene in Row 14.\n\nRiordan, who was sitting in a window seat by the wing, \"had been pulled outside the airplane through the window,\" the report said.\n\nThe flight attendant \"grabbed onto the passenger and tried to bring them back into the airplane with assistance from [another flight attendant].\" Two male passengers helped and were eventually able to get the passenger back into the plane, the report said.\n\nA nearby nurse and another passenger performed CPR on Riordan as the plane landed. One of the flight attendants did not make it back to her seat in time for landing, \"so she sat on the aisle floor near row 4 or 5 and passengers held her down\" as the plane touched down in Philadelphia, the report said.\n\nThe communications problems continued after landing. One of the pilots described \"difficulty communicating with fire trucks on the radio and said the captain requested a discreet frequency.\" A pilot \"eventually yelled ... to the fire chief from the forward entry door,\" the report says.\n\nRiordan's family thanked the NTSB \"for their very important work\" in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"The most important thing now is making sure that the aircraft and engine failures that caused Jennifer's untimely and unnecessary death never happen again,\" the statement said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Nicole Gaouette and Elizabeth Landers, CNN", "title": "Trump picks handbag designer, Mar-a-Lago member to be envoy to South Africa", "description": "President Donald Trump has nominated handbag designer Lana Marks to be the next US ambassador to South Africa.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/trump-lana-marks-south-africa/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114164940-lana-marks-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:30:18Z", "content": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has nominated handbag designer Lana Marks to be the next US ambassador to South Africa.
