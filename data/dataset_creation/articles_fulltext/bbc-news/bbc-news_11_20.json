The Sun has a mocked-up picture of Mr Rees-Mogg in the captain's uniform telling his sidekick: \"Don't tell 'em your plan, Pike\".\n\n\"Who do you think you are kidding Mr Moggwaring?\" is a headline in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg himself continued the Dad's Army theme, telling reporters: \"I've always admired Captain Mainwaring.\"\n\n'Unable to count'\n\nThe Daily Express says Mr Rees-Mogg and his \"motley crew\" have retreated with tails between their legs, with not so much a bang as a whimper. In the words of Times sketch writer, Patrick Kidd, the plot may have run out of puff faster than a chubby boy on a cross-country run.\n\nAlso in the Times, Daniel Finkelstein says it's obvious that Mr Rees-Mogg and his allies have never been anywhere near the figure required to trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\n\"Here we have a group of people who plan to split the Tory Party, sack the prime minister, take the country to the brink, and yet appear unable to count to 48,\" he writes.\n\nHowever, the Daily Mail says more saboteurs might emerge.

The Spectator website thinks it's a shot across the bows, and one that comes with a message that if the Tories want to keep on governing, they need to change their leader as the DUP no longer trust this one.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sun says that of all the PM's Brexit miscalculations, her most suicidal would be to think the DUP was bluffing.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\n\"Why would the DUP topple the Conservatives and risk a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn?\" Telegraph commentator Philip Johnston wonders.\n\n\"What matters to the DUP,\" he says, \"is Northern Ireland's place in the Union and, provided that can be guaranteed, Labour can be led by Vlad the Imposter for all they care.\"\n\nThe Mail describes the DUP's failure to vote with the government as shameful.

would lead the firm with the same powers as Mr Ghosn.\n\nMr Ghosn was arrested in Japan on Monday after allegations of financial misconduct.\n\nAs well as Renault, he is also chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors and leads an alliance of the three carmakers.\n\nJapanese prosecutors say Mr Ghosn under-reported his income from running Nissan by 5bn yen (\u00a334.5m) over five years.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Renault said: \"At this stage, the board is unable to comment on the evidence seemingly gathered against Mr Ghosn by Nissan and the Japanese judicial authorities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the

deputy chief executive was a \"transitional governance\" measure \"to preserve the interests of the group and the continuity of its operations\".\n\nEarlier, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Mr Ghosn was \"no longer in a position\" to lead the carmaker in which the French state has a 15% stake.\n\nHe also said Renault's partnership with Nissan remained in the interests of both France and Japan and of both companies.\n\nNissan and Mitsubishi are both preparing to remove him from his posts.\n\nBut Mitsubishi Motors chief executive Osamu Masuko said the alliance would be difficult to manage without Mr Ghosn.\n\nNissan has a 34% controlling stake in the smaller Japanese carmaker.\n\nWhat has happened so far?\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, Nissan said an internal investigation prompted by a whistleblower had revealed \"significant acts of misconduct\" including \"personal use of company assets\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe announcement sent shockwaves through the automotive industry where Mr Ghosn, 64, is seen as a titan, responsible for a dramatic turnaround at Nissan in the early 2000s.\n\nNissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa said \"too much authority was given to one person in terms of governance\".\n\n\"I have to say that this is a dark side of the Ghosn era which lasted for a long time,\" he said, adding he was still debating whether Mr Ghosn was \"a charismatic figure or a tyrant\".\n\nWhat are the accusations?\n\nProsecutors later said in a statement that Mr Ghosn and senior executive Greg Kelly had conspired to understate Mr Ghosn's compensation, starting in 2010.\n\nMr Ghosn is accused of filing annual securities reports containing fake statements, which could mean up to 10 years in prison, or a fine of 10m yen, or both.\n\nFrom 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose the salaries of executives who earn more than 100m yen.\n\nJapanese prosecutors also said they had already raided Nissan's Yokohama headquarters, near Tokyo, as part of their investigation.\n\nThere has been no comment from Mr Ghosn or Mr Kelly.\n\nHow will this affect the Alliance?\n\nAs misconduct revelations emerged, the future of the car alliance led by Mr Ghosn remained unclear.\n\nHe has been credited with turning around both Nissan and Renault before becoming the linchpin of the alliance the companies later formed.\n\nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance sold 10.61 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2017, making it the number-one automotive group worldwide.\n\nNissan chief executive Mr Saikawa insisted the partnership would \"not be affected by this event\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "FA Cup: Charlton Athletic 5-0 Mansfield Town

Everything he touches turns to goals. Twelve in his past 11 games for club and country is an astonishing statistic for a winger. His composure for all three goals spoke volumes of his burgeoning self-confidence.\n\nIt was Stuart Armstrong, though, who dragged Scotland up by their bootlaces as the good feeling built up in Saturday's 4-0 win over Albania threatened to drain away with the Hampden rain.\n\nFollowing a first quarter dominated by the Israelis, the Southampton midfielder drove the hosts forward. His first foray almost brought a goal for Callum McGregor - a good hand from Ariel Harush denying him.\n\nBut shortly afterwards Armstrong burst into the box again. His shot was charged down but fell kindly for Forrest, who lashed it low beyond the keeper to begin the turnaround.\n\nForrest's second had echoes of the counter-attacking beauty of his second against Albania. Andy Robertson swept the ball forward, Steven Fletcher glanced it into the path of Ryan Christie, who did superbly to bring it under control before looping it towards Forrest, who slotted past Harush.\n\nAs impressive as the Scots were beginning to look, they could not begin to breathe easily until Forrest capped a wonderful evening with a delightful third, taking a deft touch from Ryan Fraser's pass before slamming into the net.\n\nBut just when it appeared Scotland might coast to victory, they gave Israel hope. Just as they had done when Brighton's Kayal curled in the early opener, they sat off the visitors, allowing Zahavi time and space to hammer the ball past McGregor from outside the box.\n\nThe Scotland keeper, though, pulled off an astonishing save with just two minutes to go, showing terrific reflexes to push Hemed's point-blank shot away and ultimately win the game.\n\nHemed could not get the better of McGregor in the closing stages\n\n'McLeish buys plenty goodwill' - analysis\n\nThere was an element of Jekyll and Hyde about this performance - at times brilliant, at others timid and wasteful. But the bottom line was always going to be the result.\n\nIt buys McLeish plenty of goodwill and delivers the top-of-the-table finish that could yet be the first step on the way back to a major finals.\n\nHe will know as well as anyone that this was the easy bit.

in the hope of finding solutions.\n\n\"Perhaps unsurprisingly, parental behaviours have received a great deal of attention,\" it says.\n\n\"Parents are widely considered to be the 'gatekeepers' to their children's food, and powerful shapers of their developing eating behaviour.\"\n\nParental feeding styles\n\nThe study notes that two types of parental feeding styles, in particular, play a role in how parents regulate children's eating habits:\n\nrestriction of food, which is thought to lead to weight gain because children overeat when the restriction is not there (the \"forbidden fruit\" effect)\n\npressure to eat, which is thought to make children with low appetites anxious, and compromise weight gain\n\nBut rather than dictate children's habits, the research suggests parents are \"responding to their child's emerging characteristics, not simply causing them\".\n\nThe researchers assessed data, from the Twins Early Development Study, of 4,500 sets of twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996.\n\nThey calculated a genetic score that sets out the likelihood of these individuals to have a higher or lower body mass index (BMI).\n\nThey then matched this score against parents' feeding reports, setting out whether they used restriction or pressure.\n\nThe study found those children with a higher genetic BMI score had higher reported rates of parental restriction and those with lower BMIs had higher rates of pressuring, suggesting parents were adjusting their strategies for each child.\n\nEven within families where non-identical twins differed in their genetic predisposition, parents were more restrictive with the twin who had a tendency to be of a higher weight and were more pressuring of the twin who tended to weigh less.\n\nWhat do the results show?\n\nLead author, Saskia Selzam, from King's College London, says: \"Our findings suggest that parents develop their feeding practices in response to their child's natural tendency towards a higher or lower weight.\n\n\"The way a parent feeds their child may also influence their child's weight to some extent, but our results challenge the prevailing view that parental behaviour is the major influence on childhood weight.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSenior author, Dr Clare Llewellyn from UCL, adds: \"These results show that parents are not the 'full story' when it comes to a child's weight, and blaming parents for being too controlling about feeding may be unfair.\n\n\"But it is unclear whether these natural 'go to' strategies are helpful, harmful, or of no consequence to a child's weight in the long run.\"\n\nDo parents have any impact on weight?\n\nMs Selzam says parents clearly have an impact, but not only in establishing learnt eating behaviours.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that feeding strategies aren't important.\n\n\"But the main point is how parents influence their children's BMI genetically.\n\n\"A lot of studies suggest it must be the parents that cause the weight gain, but we are showing that it's more complex than that.\"\n\nThe researchers say further study is needed to identify which feeding strategies are acceptable and how they work.\n\nThe study is published in PLOS Genetics."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "How the media became obsessed with gates", "description": "Journalists love to put a \"gate\" suffix behind scandals, but where did the habit come from?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-46279138/how-the-media-became-obsessed-with-gates", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/251E/production/_104420590_p06scfll.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:24:26Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nJournalists love to put a \"gate\" suffix behind scandals, be they big, small or just ridiculous.\n\nBut where did the habit originally come from?"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "UN environment chief Erik Solheim quits amid expenses row", "description": "The official was criticised for risking the UN's reputation by extensive use of expensive travel.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46281051", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/121E4/production/_104421247_4e68148d-3a67-425c-a885-c4915f06e830.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:22:47Z", "content": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Erik Solheim was the executive director of UN Environment UN environment chief Erik Solheim has resigned amid a row over his travel expenses.

But, it's also what they expected, and what they've always said about President Trump - he will be a true friend of the Kingdom.\n\nBoth sides want to draw a line under this major crisis - and global outcry. But as Mr Trump acknowledged, and Saudis know, it won't go away. Not for many in the US Congress, as well as for many others, including countries who will continue to call for greater clarity.\n\nMany Saudis say they don't believe their country's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, would have ordered such a despicable act. Many, who'd long been hoping to see their country move forward, have been shaken by this shocking murder, and regret it will cast a dark shadow for many years to come.\n\nIn the words of one prominent Saudi: \"It has brought Saudi Arabia ten steps back.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lindsey Graham, a senator from Mr Trump's Republican Party, has predicted strong bipartisan support in Congress for sanctions against Saudi Arabia \"including appropriate members of the royal family\".\n\nWhat does the statement say?\n\n\"The world is a very dangerous place!\", Mr Trump states, before holding up Saudi Arabia as an ally of the US against Iran.\n\nThe kingdom spent \"billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism\" whereas Iran has \"killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East\", it says.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mike Pompeo backed Mr Trump, saying \"it's a mean, nasty world out there\"\n\nThe statement also stresses Saudi investment pledges and arms purchases. \"If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries,\" it adds.\n\nWhile admitting the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was \"terrible\", Mr Trump wrote that \"we may never know all of the facts\" about his death.\n\n\"The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\"\n\nMr Trump later said he would meet Mohammed bin Salman at a G20 meeting in Argentina next week if the crown prince attended.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has backed his president, saying after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu that \"it's a mean, nasty world out there\" and that Mr Trump was \"obliged to adopt policies that further America's national security\".\n\nMr Cavusoglu said that co-operation with Saudi Arabia on the issue was \"not where we want it\".\n\nIn a statement, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she was shocked the president was not going to punish Mohammed bin Salman over the \"premeditated murder\" of Khashoggi.\n\nThe essence of America First\n\nBy Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter, Washington\n\nDonald Trump is a different kind of president, and nowhere is that more clear than in his foreign policy, exclamation points and all. His release on the death of Jamal Khashoggi is remarkable for many reasons, and not just its blunt language.\n\nThe president quickly tries to change the subject to Iran. He dismisses reports that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder with a maybe-he-did, maybe-he-didn't shrug. He cites the economic impact of $450bn in investment and arms sales to the Saudis, although much of that is little more than paper promises.\n\nPerhaps most jarring is his casual observation that the Saudis viewed Khashoggi - a permanent US resident - as an \"enemy of the state\" with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nMr Trump has distilled his \"America First\" worldview down to its very essence. Morality and global leadership take a back seat to perceived US economic and military security.\n\nHow will the statement play out internationally?\n\nWhat the take-away will be in the Middle East and beyond is a serious issue, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus.\n\nUS policy in the region is so closely aligned with that of two key individuals - Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel - that it is increasingly hard to see how the US can play a role as an independent arbiter, our correspondent says.\n\nMr Trump's narrow, interests-based approach will further dismay Washington's allies in the West, he argues, reinforcing those in Moscow and Beijing who are already applying a \"Russia First\" and a \"China First\" approach in international affairs.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted his disgust at the Trump statement, calling it disgraceful:"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Cheryl hits back at 'abuse' over X Factor performance", "description": "The singer says the the \"unbalanced negativity\" towards her performance on the show has been \"shocking\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-46282500", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15A7E/production/_104420788_cheryl.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:06:23Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Cheryl has hit back at the \"relentless abuse\" she says she's received over her performance on The X Factor.

Furthermore most games are broadcast live, reducing the value per game.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThe Swiss enjoy similar average match attendances to Scotland.\n\nAnd, according to Sports Business Daily, the multi-division Swiss Football League receives \u00a330.6m annual income from a range of TV deals.\n\nHowever, Switzerland face a more acute problem than either Scotland or Portugal in that the country borders three major football nations - France, Germany and Italy.\n\n'New deal mostly delivers for Scottish clubs' - analysis\n\nBBC Scotland's sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin\n\nThere was hope that the value of the new TV deal would reflect the new feel-good factor that's attached itself to Scottish football in recent years - the reality was always going to be very different.\n\nWhere once these offers were delivered on a hunch and a hope by people who knew the game, these days, young hotshot analysts with no knowledge of the game will crunch the numbers. If the computer says no, then forget it.\n\nJust ask those at BT Sport, who pushed hard to carry on what they'd started in Scottish football only for their corporate machine to say, 'no'. In fact I'm told their offer for an exclusive deal fell \"many tens of millions\" short of what Sky bid.\n\nOne club boss told me they were underwhelmed by what's been signed but others see it differently. The desire was to get more cash, fewer games and a greater say on kick-off times. The new deal mostly delivers on that.\n\nThe comparisons to deals signed by other leagues around Europe is also not as cut and dry as it seems. In Sweden, where almost all games are broadcast, they get much more in the pot but an average of around \u00a3100,000 per game. The Scottish deal delivers around \u00a3540,000 for each match covered.\n\nYes, chief executives and chairman want money in the bank but they also want bums on seats on a Saturday afternoon.

Scottish Police Authority, the body which oversees the national force, has reported a deficit of \u00a334m.\n\nAlthough this is a reduction from the previous budget, an Audit Scotland report warned that the SPA still faces considerable challenges.\n\nThe watchdog also expressed concern as to whether Police Scotland can meet its long-term strategic objectives.\n\nSPA chairwoman Susan Deacon said the report noted \"substantive improvements\" in the last year.\n\nBut auditor general Caroline Gardner said a funding package for the force's new Data, Digital and ICT strategy - which is estimated to cost \u00a3298m over the next five years - has yet to be agreed.\n\nAs a result, the report identifies \"a risk to both the timing of its implementation and the future financial sustainability of the Scottish Police Authority.\"\n\nConsultancy fees\n\nThe report also reveals that a total of \u00a34.3m was spent on consultancy fees in 2017/18 - more than double the \u00a31.9m spent in the previous 12 months.\n\nExpenditure on agency staff also soared to \u00a34m, compared with \u00a31.5m in 2016/17.\n\nThe report confirmed that Police Scotland's former chief constable, Phil Gormley, who resigned in February, received \u00a328,227 for untaken annual leave and a further \u00a354,137 payment in lieu of notice.\n\nMs Gardner said: \"Policing in Scotland continues to go through considerable change.\n\nImage copyright Police Scotland Image caption Mr Livingstone formally replaced Phil Gormley as Police Scotland's chief constable in August\n\n\"Progress has been made in key areas but there remains a substantial amount of work to do if the SPA is to achieve long-term financial sustainability and meet the challenges of modern policing.\n\n\"The scale, cost and complexity of the plans needed to deliver that transformational change should not be underestimated.\n\n\"It's vital that the SPA and Police Scotland develop comprehensive strategies for its future workforce, estates and ICT and clarify where the funding is coming from to make them a reality.\"\n\nThe report said seven new members had been appointed to the SPA and better budget monitoring had been put in place.\n\nBut it concluded that the national force, which replaced the old eight-force model in 2013, faced challenges to implement its Policing 2026 vision.\n\nIn particular it identified \"slow progress in developing workforce and estate strategies\" as factors that would restrict the SPA's ability to achieve long-term financial sustainability.\n\nThe combined Police Scotland and SPA annual budget for 2017/18 was \u00a31.2bn but the total overspend was \u00a334.3m.\n\nBritish Transport Police\n\nThe report found that the SPA's three-year financial plan was designed to balance the books by 2020/21 by streamlining processes, reducing bureaucracy and introducing new technology.\n\nAnd it noted members fees had increased from \u00a30.17m to \u00a30.24m as a result of additional time spent on transformation projects and covering for staff shortages at executive director level.\n\nThe auditor general also expressed concern over the proposed British Transport Police integration.\n\nThe original \"go live\" date of 1 April, 2019 was pushed back but a new date has yet to be set.\n\nConsultancy support surrounding the move cost the SPA \u00a3300,000 and a significant amount of staff time.\n\nImage caption Susan Deacon took up her post as chairwoman of the SPA in November last year\n\nThe report said: \"Given the range of transformational challenges facing the Scottish Police Authority and Police Scotland there is a risk that the ongoing uncertainty continues to absorb resources at the expense of wider strategic objectives.\"\n\nProf Deacon said major progress had been made in the last 12 months.\n\nShe said: \"This year's annual report and accounts, and Audit Scotland's independent report, demonstrate that substantive improvements have been made.\n\n\"I am particularly pleased that Audit Scotland has noted that the authority now conducts its business in an open and transparent manner.\n\n\"This was, quite rightly, an area of significant critical comment in the past.\"\n\n'Confidence and trust'\n\nBut the SPA chairwoman also said she did not underestimate the scale of the challenge faced by the SPA and the force.\n\nProf Deacon added: \"I am confident, however, that we are now putting in place the people and the practices needed to build a police service which is fit for purpose, fit for the future and which commands high levels of public confidence and trust.\n\n\"I am determined to ensure that we work tirelessly to drive continuous improvement and so ensure that the people of Scotland receive the very highest possible

Any escalation could hurt US and Chinese companies by raising production costs and the price for consumers.\n\nAnother was the prospect that America's central bank could raise interest rates to combat inflation and stop the economy from overheating. This makes it more expensive for companies to borrow and invest.\n\nWhatever is behind the latest stock market gyrations, it's worth remembering that the current bull market is the oldest in history.\n\nFor months some have warned that the US market is overvalued.

But I think that will be based on experience and mature discussion.\n\n\"It might well be that the view forms that my approach and SPS's approach currently is far too narrow, too conservative - with a small c - in that sense.\n\n\"But at the moment I think our approach is reasonable, and probably necessary, in order that we can establish some confidence going forward in the HDC decision-making process.\"\n\nAnnouncing the changes in October, Mr Yousaf said he was taking \"immediate action\" because \"improvements are absolutely needed\".\n\nHe said: \"I am determined that lessons will be learned, and that improvements will be made to home detention curfew to ensure that public safety remains paramount.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Downing Street's Larry the Cat gets a helping hand from police", "description": "The chief mouser enlists the help of a local officer to get out of the rain.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46280468/downing-street-s-larry-the-cat-gets-a-helping-hand-from-police", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1127F/production/_104417207_p06sbmb4.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:37:41Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nFew will be enjoying the rain in London today, let alone Downing Street's chief mouser Larry the Cat.\n\nHe was stuck outside on the steps of No 10 earlier, hoping someone would let him inside to dry off his fur.\n\nThankfully, a police officer came to his aid..."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Robbie Savage and Andrew Cole among claimants suing over payments", "description": "They accuse an investment firm of wrongly sharing commission with agents, who are also being sued.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-46274098", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BE15/production/_104416684_capture.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:36:51Z", "content": "Image copyright BBC/BBC/PA Image caption (Left to right) Robbie Savage, Danny Murphy and Andrew Cole Robbie Savage, Danny Murphy and Andrew Cole are among more than a dozen former footballers suing an asset management firm over payments to agents.

We are looking at options for reform, what's fair, what's feasible,\" he said.\n\nIt was also outlined that the cost of taking on the scheme would be the equivalent of what is spent today on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, CBBC and CBeebies.\n\nThe public can read and respond to the consultation in English here or in Welsh here.\n\nFuture option suggestions\n\nFour options were set out in a report, commissioned by the BBC, produced by Frontier Economics. They consisted of:\n\n1. Scrap free licence fees for over-75s\n\nThe report estimates that residual costs to shut down the concession would cost \u00a372m - or 10% of the cost of continuing with it.\n\nWhen the government introduced the free licence fee for over-75s in 2000, it was argued the benefits would (largely) go to poorer households. However, that argument has weakened with the improvement in living standards for the over-75s.\n\n2. Replace with a 50% concession for all over-75 households\n\nA 50% concession is in line with what's currently being offered to those with visual impairments.\n\nImage caption Lord Hall has announced the public consultation on the future of free TV licences for the over-75s\n\nIt estimates the cost to the BBC would be around \u00a3400m in 2021/22, which is 56% of the cost of reinstating the current concession - the extra 6% is due to admin.\n\n3. Increase the age threshold for eligibility\n\nRaise age threshold to 77\n\nAligns with increased longevity and reforms to state pension age but retains an arbitrary threshold.\n\nThe report estimates that it would cost \u00a3645m which is 87% of the cost of reinstating the current concession in 2021/22.\n\nThey note the vast majority of households containing someone older than 75 also contain someone over the age of 77 so relatively few households would lose out.\n\nRaise age threshold to 80\n\nThis would align with other pensioner benefits that begin at 80 such as the over-80s increase in winter fuel payments.\n\nThe estimated cost is \u00a3481m - that's 65% of the cost of reinstating the current situation.\n\nPeople over the age of 80 are more likely to live alone so this could help to target the concession at those who are most reliant on television for company.\n\n4. Means-test eligibility for the concession\n\nLink free TV licences to over-75s who get pension credit\n\nPension credit is a government-defined measure of need - so this would improve targeting of those at need of a free TV licence.\n\nIt's estimated this would cost \u00a3209m or 28% of the cost of keeping the current concession.\n\nLink free TV licences to anyone receiving pension credit regardless of age\n\nImproves targeting and would align with other benefits.\n\nThe estimated cost to the BBC is \u00a3327m - 44% as much as that of reinstating the current concession.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

In Scotland and Wales, specific programmes have been launched to speed up progress.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Health and Social Care Board conceded \"the waiting times experienced by many patients continue to be unacceptable\".\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care in England praised \"hard-working staff\" and said the extra money being provided to the health service in the coming years would put it on a \"sustainable footing\".\n\n'My mum is suffering'\n\nImage copyright Other\n\nCarol Johns has been battling to get her mother, Maria King, treatment since the spring.\n\nMs King, 84, has been experiencing painful and swollen feet, which has left her struggling to walk and has disturbed her sleep.\n\nHer daughter said she had experienced delay after delay in trying to get scans and appointments with doctors.\n\nOne appointment had to be cancelled because the hospital said it did not have enough doctors.\n\nShe has even tried to get treatment at other hospitals further away from her home in the Midlands and paid for a scan to be done privately.\n\nBut her mother is still waiting.\n\n\"I am very frustrated.

It means their wait for tests and scans is not counted in the 13-week wait target.\n\nIs this as bad as it has ever been?\n\nAnother way of looking at performance is to judge it on a nation-level rather than by local hospital service.\n\nIf you do that performance has sunk to its worst level in recent times.\n\nEngland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have failed to hit any of the three targets for more than a year.\n\nIt is the first time this has happened across the UK since targets started to be introduced more than a decade ago.\n\nThe last time any target was met on a national level was in August 2017 in Scotland.\n\nIn Wales, none of its three key targets has been hit for at least five years.\n\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents managers, said it was clear the system was facing \"significant strain\".\n\nWhich hospitals are struggling the most?\n\nIn England, 16 hospital trusts out of 131 missed all their monthly targets.

A lot of it. What to pack for a 210-mile jaunt to Selhurst Park next weekend, for example? How to get there? Where to stay?\n\n\"I cut my toothbrush in half to save on space,\" laughs Cunliffe, who says he is a \"middle of the pack runner who might finish in the top 20 at ParkRun\".\n\nSome trips have seen him accompanied by a support car, which he says makes life easier, though admitting a good night's sleep in a hotel bed is far better for recovery than the back of a van.\n\nCunliffe likes to stay off road when he can, even if he has to watch his footing on routes such as the Grand Union Canal and Pennine Bridleway, and is surviving largely on sports gels and carbohydrate powders to replace the 216,191 calories burned so far.\n\nThen there is the impact on his body. Even the shortest trip to Manchester City's Etihad Stadium was beyond marathon distance and upon reaching Palace he'll have chalked off 54 of the 26.2-mile landmarks.\n\nSome days he admits it's a struggle to get going again, and Cunliffe did harbour fears of a fractured foot after it ballooned in size and left him struggling to get his shoe on, but the runner says the mental challenge far outweighs any physical battle.\n\nAnd, of course, Cunliffe has the motivation of helping community charities across the country.\n\n\"My experiences left me with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression,\" he adds. \"Running was a major part of my therapy in overcoming this.\n\n\"I want to use that experience to benefit others, and football is the perfect way to unite people in this cause.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Teachers return after 'unruly pupils' dispute ends", "description": "Eleven Edinburgh teachers who were sent home without pay after refusing to teach eight pupils are returning to work.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-46275176", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3F5E/production/_104122261_kaimes976.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:57:19Z", "content": "Image caption The teachers were sent home from the Kaimes School in Liberton Eleven Edinburgh teachers who were sent home without pay over \"unruly pupils\" have returned to work after union and council leaders resolved the dispute.

Players, pundits and journalists from across the continent have their say.\n\nUkraine - 'Uefa's perfect idea'\n\nThe head of the Football Federation of Ukraine, Andriy Pavelko, called it \"Uefa's perfect idea\". \"Uefa has come up with the right motivation for teams which, through Nations League matches, have a chance and incentives to make it to Euro 2020.\"\n\nFormer captain Ruslan Rotan said: \"The tournament is advantageous to all teams taking part.

The piece likens the competition to a stroke of \"magic\" that has helped Uefa \"breathe life into the once-dead and devoid-of-all-intrigue friendly matches\".\n\nAnother top sporting publication in Russia, Sport Express, said the \"blockbuster\" victories for England against Croatia and Switzerland against Belgium made the competition worth watching.

It will attract the real masters of modern football - sponsors and TV channels.\"\n\nA year later, Italian publications show only modest enthusiasm for the Nations League (although most praise Italy's performance as \"encouraging\").\n\nBlog Numero Diez says \"it's too early to judge\u2026 but you can't thrash the potential of this new championship to showcase young talent\".\n\nFootball commentator Tancredi Palmeri is more enthusiastic: \"God bless the Nations League: out of the many ways people have recently tried to improve football, this one is the best.\"\n\nInternational managers - 'Klopp's view is selfish'\n\nIn response to Jurgen Klopp's remarks on the \"senselessness\" nature of the tournament, Turkish manager Mircea Lucescu said: \"Klopp will change his mind when he heads a national team. National teams should keep playing important matches. His statement is selfish.\"\n\nGermany manager Joachim Low oversaw his side's relegation to the second tier, but he is still in favour of the competition.\n\n\"For us, for me as national coach, the Nations League is a good invention because we play against top nations, because it's for something,\" he said. \"It is a competition.

He was on court for just 38 of the game's 48 minutes - the fewest in which he has scored at least 50 points.\n\nThat happened five days after he became the fifth-highest points scorer in NBA history, passing Wilt Chamberlain - who had 118 50-point games - as the Lakers beat the Portland Trailblazers 126-117.\n\nHere's four things that have gone wrong for the Cavs since their star man departed.\n\nThe form\n\nThe Cavs have had the wind taken out of their sails following LeBron's departure earlier this year\n\nThe Cavs reached four consecutive NBA Finals during James' second stint with them - and in 2016, they won the city's first major sports title since 1964, becoming the first team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the Finals as they beat the Golden State Warriors.\n\nBut life in 2018 is very different.\n\nA little over four weeks into the new season, Cleveland have lost 13 of their opening 15 games. As a comparison, they lost 32 out of 82 games last season.\n\nTheir two victories - against the Atlanta Hawks and the Charlotte Hornets - have come at home, meaning they have not won on the road since beating the New York Knicks last season on 9 April.\n\nCleveland are, unsurprisingly, bottom of the Eastern Conference. The Phoenix Suns, at the foot of the Western Conference, have managed one more win.\n\nThe coach\n\nFormer Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue was replaced by his assistant Larry Drew\n\nThe Cavaliers' troubles have already led to a change of head coach, with Tyronn Lue sacked on 28 October after a dismal 0-6 start.\n\nLue, promoted from assistant coach in January 2016, had made a remarkable start - becoming the first coach in NBA history to win his first 10 post-season games.\n\nHe then joined a select band of coaches to have led a team to the NBA Finals after coming in during the regular season - an achievement that culminated with that historic comeback against the Warriors.\n\nBut the Cavs' woes in the post-James era cost Lue his job, with assistant Larry Drew replacing him.\n\nMany Cavs fans hope Drew can do what Lue did when he stepped in - but their league standing shows the task is much harder this time.\n\nThe replacement\n\nForward Kevin Love has missed 45 games over the past two seasons because of injury\n\nWhen James left as a free agent, many expected team-mate Kevin Love to be traded before a complete roster overhaul in a bid to revamp the side.\n\nInstead, Love accepted a four-year, $120m contract extension - giving fans belief the Cavaliers still had a major point-scoring talent to lean on.\n\nHowever, Love - who has missed 45 games over the past two regular seasons - suffered another injury setback.\n\nHe had been averaging 19 points and 13.5 rebounds per game in the opening four games of the season, but has not played since and, on 2 November, the 30-year-old had surgery to sort out continuing problems with his left foot.\n\nFans of the Cavs have been used to Love's injury problems and this operation has been a success, but he now needs time to recover, with his fitness to be assessed in mid-December.\n\nEven the kit\n\nThe Cavs debuted their divisive new city jersey on 13 November\n\nEach year, NBA teams release limited quantities of their new 'City Edition' jerseys, allowing teams to pay tribute to their city and fans.\n\nThis year's design, however, has upset fans, the Cavs' typical wine-and-gold-coloured home jersey replaced by a neon orange and royal blue number.\n\nThe uniform pays homage to that worn by the Cavaliers in 1994 during the first season at their current home arena. But it has not gone down well.\n\nPaul Lukas graded each team's city jerseys for ESPN\n\nESPN graded the uniforms C-, with fans branding the design \"trash\". One fan stated: \"Not sure what's worse, this jersey or the Cavs this season...\"\n\nLuckily, the jerseys change every year and will only be worn at six games throughout the season.\n\nAnd, despite the criticism, the shirt's debut outing on 13 November saw the Cavs enjoy a 113-89 win over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nCould this mark the turning point of their season?\n\nLeBron James' return to the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland comes on Wednesday at 20:00 ET (Thursday at 01:00 GMT), when the Los Angeles Lakers face the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Lakers have won four of their last five games, with Cavs losing four out of five."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Southampton students' union president resigns in WW1 mural row", "description": "It follows a social media backlash over her comments about \"white men\" war casualties.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-46274283", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14E6B/production/_104411658_e9eca1cd-db47-46dc-98c3-edf9a7d11229.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:19:36Z", "content": "Image copyright University of Southampton Image caption Emily Dawes apologised after sending the initial tweet A student leader who sparked outrage by saying a mural dedicated to soldiers in World War One should be painted over has resigned.

When I was down at Chiefs I was helping to coach Taunton and I've been player-coach here at Sanix this season.\n\n\"It was one of the reasons I wanted to try to experience Super Rugby, because I knew I wanted to coach afterwards and it would be good for me to experience different competitions and just to see how things are done differently for myself further down the line.\"\n\n'He could be a fantastic acquisition'\n\nOne man who knows Parling better than most is his former boss, Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter.\n\nParling was the first Lion ever to play for the Chiefs when he joined in 2015 and was integral as they made it to the Premiership final for the first time in their history.\n\n\"I think he'll be a good coach,\" Baxter told BBC Sport. \"He's technically very, very aware and very proficient about a lot of the skills that are needed, particularly from a top-quality line-out forward.\n\n\"But his range is broader than that - he's got a very good knowledge of all aspects of rugby.\n\n\"He could be a fantastic acquisition, particularly in Australia. Talking to some Australian coaches, they feel they maybe lack a bit of detail sometimes in some of their application.\n\n\"That will be Geoff's bread and butter; some of the detail around how the forwards play, but also around the breakdown and attacking patterns and the reasons for doing things defensively.\n\n\"He'll be top quality at being able to get those ideas over and this could be the start of a very successful time for him.\"\n\nBringing rugby to Melbourne\n\nParling won 29 England caps and played in all three Tests in the British and Irish Lions' victorious tour of Australia in 2013\n\nMelbourne is a sporting city - the Australian Open, Grand Prix, Melbourne Cup and Boxing Day Test are just some of the major events that the city hosts.\n\nBut the only oval ball most people in town care about is of the Australian rules variety.\n\nThe Rebels are a relatively new concept. Founded in 2010, they famously made a young Danny Cipriani their first signing.\n\nIt has been hard-going since then - the club almost got the axe when Super Rugby was reshuffled to bring in sides from Argentina and Japan, but survived at the expense of Perth-based Western Force.\n\nTheir ninth-placed finish last season was their best in the division and they missed out on a first play-off place only on score difference.\n\n\"Last year was a bit of an amalgamation of the Force and the Rebels when the Force got cut, so it's probably a club that's still finding its identity in a way,\" continued Parling.\n\n\"It's Aussie rules mad. If you go to a playground there'll be a granny there and she'll say 'who's your footy team?' She'll have an Aussie rules top on too.\n\n\"Last year it was something like the third local player to debut for the first team, so lads are slowly coming through.\n\n\"It's trying hard to get the support of the local community and build rugby in Victoria.\"\n\nExperiencing Super Rugby\n\nParling began his family adventure after winning his third Premiership title - and Exeter's first - in 2017\n\nTwo years ago, England boss Eddie Jones said the Rugby Football Union should pay to send coaches down under to experience Super Rugby.\n\nBut since then nobody from England has taken up a first-team role with a Super Rugby side.\n\nEx-England coach Stuart Lancaster was linked with the Queensland Reds after the 2015 World Cup, while former Ireland and Lions star Ronan O'Gara is the only high-profile British or Irish coach in the competition at the Crusaders in Christchurch.\n\nSo could having some experience of coaching down under help Parling land a top job in England one day?\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" said the man who won two titles with Leicester Tigers between 2009 and 2015 and played in five Premiership finals in his career.\n\n\"Look at Rob Baxter and the team he's got down at the Chiefs. They're a good example of going to a club and building it.\n\n\"Sam Vesty and Phil Dowson are working with Chris Boyd at Northampton, so there are some good young English coaches there.\n\n\"I just think you've got to get the right owners and the right club to realise that sometimes there's a guy already in front of them who can do a decent job and just make sure they get the opportunity.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "What's gone wrong at Victoria's Secret?", "description": "A new boss has been named to lead the brand, which is grappling with declining sales.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46268408", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/549C/production/_104406612_hi050487823.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T08:46:24Z", "content": "Image copyright AFP Image caption Are consumers shunning the looks embodied by Victoria's Secret angels?

The share price has fallen more than 40% over the past 12 months.\n\n'Steady decline'\n\nEd Razek, the chief marketing officer of L Brands, recently provoked intense criticism following comments he made to Vogue magazine about transgender and plus-sized models.\n\nAnd this weekend, the New York Times declared Victoria's Secret a name in \"steady decline\", while the Wall Street Journal said the vision of sexiness defined by the Ohio-based retailer - known for its busty \"Angel\" models - had \"lost its appeal\".\n\nL Brands boss Leslie H Wexner said the new executives would be looking at \"everything\" as they focused on improving performance.\n\n\"I am confident that, under John's leadership, Victoria's Secret Lingerie, the world's leading lingerie brand, will continue to be a powerhouse and will deliver products and experiences that resonate with women around the globe,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nStill, with Victoria's Secret sales online and at comparable stores sliding another 2% in the most recent quarter, the obituaries being written for the retailer, which started in the 1970s, are unlikely to stop.\n\n\"They definitely need some change in their brand positioning moving forward,\" said Diana Smith, associate director of retail and apparel at market research firm Mintel.\n\n\"I think they're in a little bit of limbo at the moment.\"\n\nRevenue growth at lingerie stores is expected to rise only 1% annually over the next five years, according to research firm Ibisworld.\n\nThat's down from the more than 4% annual rate the industry enjoyed between 2013 and 2018 - and it's a big problem for L Brands, which currently captures more than 60% of revenues and has more than 1,000 Victoria's Secret stores in the US and Canada.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Singer Rihanna's Savage X Fenty lingerie has won fans for featuring models with all body types\n\nAnalysts attribute the slowdown in growth largely to competition from online upstarts, department stores and big retailers such as Gap, which are taking market share.\n\n\"Victoria's Secret is still the leader - and the strong leader- in terms of share,\" said Ms Smith. \"It's just that other companies are starting to provide more options and choices to women that weren't there in the past.\"\n\nCompanies such as Lively, ThirdLove or Rihanna's Savage X Fenty, have differentiated themselves by offering a wider range of sizes - including to the growing number of plus-size customers - or focusing on particular products, like no-wire bras.\n\nLower prices are also part of the appeal, which analysts say is likely to hurt Victoria's Secret's profit margins in the future.\n\nIbisworld expects the number of lingerie store operators in the US to grow at an annual rate of more than 4% over the next five years - more than three times the pace of the wider women's clothing business.\n\n\"These small niche operators are only going to continue growing and only going to continue to populate the industry,\" says Claire O'Connor, lead analyst at Ibisworld. \"They have a real shot at competing with Victoria's Secret.\"\n\n'They'll bounce back'\n\nVictoria's Secret's scale meant it has been slow to respond to some fashions, such as demand for bralettes and triangle bras, categories where sell-outs have increased more than 100% in the last three months, according to analytics firm Edited.\n\nBut Ms Smith and others warned that it's too soon to write off the brand.\n\n\"Most major companies go through this,\" said Ms Smith of Mintel. \"I think they'll bounce back.\"\n\nOn a recent Friday at a Victoria's Secret store in Brooklyn, New York, a long line snaked through tidy tables stacked with perfumes, pyjamas and lingerie.\n\nCustomers Sahara Jackson and Cheriyah Smith, both 17, who were stocking up on lip gloss, praised the brand's quality and offered up blank looks when this reporter mentioned some of the online competitors.\n\nAnd Shurla Kerr, 35, of New York, was dubious that customers have turned away from the sultry image the brand has championed.\n\n\"I think it's the sexiness, that's why people gravitate to Victoria's Secret,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhile Victoria's Secret's comparable sales are down 1% so far this year, that's an improvement over the 11% decline during the same period in 2017 and a less severe drop than some analysts had predicted.\n\nSince April, surveys suggest customer satisfaction has improved and the number of women aged 18-49 making purchases has jumped, according to market research firm YouGov.\n\nMore women are also hearing positive things about the company through advertising, media and word of mouth.\n\nTed Marzilli, chief executive of YouGov's data products division, said he thought the firm's image had taken a hit when the MeToo movement was at its height, but that effect has faded.\n\n\"I think reports of its demise were a little premature,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Rollercoasters & Slash at 2018 finale -

Mr Trump has described the group as a \"large caravan of people\".\n\nThey say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\n\nIn the run-up to the US mid-term elections, President Trump said many of the migrants were criminals, called the caravan an invasion, and ordered troops to the border. He also repeatedly suggested it was politically motivated.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption About 3,000 members of the caravan have so far arrived in Tijuana\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman and Justice Department spokesman Steven Stafford called the asylum system \"broken\" in a joint statement, noting their departments will continue \"to defend\" the policy.\n\nThey said the current system is \"being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year\", and supported Mr Trump's actions as \"legitimate and well-reasoned\".\n\n\"It is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled.\"\n\nWhat did the judge say?\n\nJudge Tigar, in his ruling, said current legislation made it clear that any foreigner arriving in the US \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival\" could apply for asylum.\n\nHe said Mr Trump's proclamation on 9 November was an \"extreme departure\" from prior practice.\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the president's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" Judge Tigar added.\n\nHe was responding in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nThey argued that Mr Trump's ruling was illegal.\n\nThe judge's restraining order comes into immediate effect and remains in place until a court hearing in December to decide on the case.\n\nWhat is President Trump's order?\n\nThe proclamation on 9 November says that anyone who wants to claim asylum in the US has to come in through official points of entry - and their cases will not be heard if they enter illegally.\n\nThe ban was to last 90 days or until the US reached an agreement with Mexico to turn back asylum-seekers.\n\nUnder US law, there is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants if they say they fear violence in their home countries - regardless of how they have entered the country.\n\nBut the Trump administration invoked the same executive power he used to justify his travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations last year.\n\nIt said the president had the power to \"suspend the entry of all aliens\" and to impose \"any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate on them\" if they were judged to be \"detrimental\" to US interests under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nA statement at the time said: \"We are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\"\n\nThere has been no response yet to the San Francisco ruling.\n\nWhat is the situation on the US-Mexico border?\n\nThe US website Politico reports that 5,800 troops sent to bolster defences on the border will be home for Christmas. It quotes Army Lt Gen Jeffrey Buchanan as saying they have an \"end date\" of 15 December.\n\nThe decision to send troops came at the height of President Trump's dire warnings about the caravan during campaigning for the mid-term elections - and he was accused of deploying active troops for political purposes.\n\nAbout 3,000 members of the caravan have so far arrived in Tijuana, the Mexican city bordering the US.\n\nThe city's authorities expect numbers to reach 10,000 in coming weeks.\n\nThe US temporarily closed the San Ysidro border point, its busiest crossing with Mexico, on Monday to install new movable wire-topped barriers.\n\nHow hard is it to win US asylum?\n\nClaiming asylum is a long and difficult process, and people need to prove they are fleeing, or fear prosecution or torture in their country. Economic migrants do not qualify for asylum.\n\nMost of them go through a process called \"credible fear\", in which an asylum officer examines their case. If the fear is determined to be credible, the individuals are referred to immigration courts. In negative cases, they are ordered to be removed.\n\nBetween October 2016 and September 2017, officials found 60,566 people to have credible fear among 79,710 cases, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Many of them remain detained during the process.\n\nAfter that, it can take years until a decision is reached. In March, the USCIS had 318,624 pending cases.\n\nSome 20,455 people were given asylum in 2016, according to the Department of Homeland Security."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/20 08:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3t0b6", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T08:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sign in to the BBC, or Register"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "I'm A Celeb Asperger's chat praised", "description": "Fans watched her speak about her condition with former EastEnders actress Rita Simons and other campmates.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-46272608", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13F1A/production/_104409618_hi050574254.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T07:58:10Z", "content": "Image copyright ITV Anne Hegerty has been praised for opening up about her Asperger's on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.

Brexit twists since then have taken the debate around unionist credentials to new heights.\n\nThe deal the UK government has negotiated with the EU sparked a backlash, amid claims it could damage the integrity of the union.\n\nIt has all come down to the proposal on the Irish border backstop, which aims to ensure frictionless trade and will come into effect if another solution can't be found as part of a wider trade deal.\n\nWestminster weight\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement says Northern Ireland alone would align with the EU single market in some areas, meaning new regulatory barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland -

another potential fracture in the union.\n\nThe MP Ross Thomson has been one of the most vocal, calling on Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell to follow cabinet colleagues and quit in protest at the government's plan.\n\nHe said \"no unionist\" could sign up to it -

It took nearly 18 months and a court case to prove them wrong.\"\n\n\"Firstly, there is clear evidence that naming the defendant serves to bring forward other complainants,\" he explains.\n\n\"In cases where it's often the word of one person against another, if four or five women come forward and make allegations against the same person, justice is more likely to be done.\n\n\"Secondly, it is extremely difficult to justify the identity of an accused being anonymised in serious sexual offences and not in other heinous offences such as murder, crimes of unspeakable cruelty to children and other offences of non-sexual extreme violence etc.\"\n\nStereotypes\n\nHe recommends the introduction of measures to combat rape myths and stereotypes that may influence the judgement of a jury.\n\nThese include myths that: rape only occurs between strangers; victims provoke rape by the way they dress or act; victims who drink alcohol or use drugs are asking to be raped; if complainant did not scream, fight or get injured, it was not rape; and that victims cry rape when they regret having sex or want revenge.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gillen review: 'Intimate details of my worst experience'\n\n\"Frustratingly, many people, men and women, still harbour unspoken views about appropriate behaviour for individuals according to their gender.\n\n\"These myths need to change, they need to be removed.\"\n\nSir John wants to see more robust action from judges in their directions to jury members, and interventions during cross-examination by defence teams if prejudicial questions are being asked.\n\nThere would also be educational materials for jurors, and a public and school campaigns \"to debunk these myths\".\n\nGreen Party MLA Clare Bailey, who co-chairs the assembly all party group on domestic and sexual violence, agreed with Sir John's recommendations for a cultural change on sexual violence.\n\n\"The cultural change may take generations to achieve, but the starting point must be to empower our young people through a mandatory relationship and sexuality education programme,\" she said.\n\nTrial by jury\n\nWhen it comes to the way trials are conducted, Sir John said \"a growing number of credible voices\" are questioning whether juries should be abolished in cases involving allegations of rape and other serious sexual offences.\n\nHe is not persuaded and recommends that the fate of defendants will continue to be decided by a 12-person jury.\n\nBut - in a major change - the accused would have right to apply for a judge-alone trial without a jury.\n\nThis would only be granted in \"rare circumstances\", for example, where a high profile case had received such widespread publicity it would be difficult for a defendant to receive a fair trial.\n\nThe judge also wants new legislation to tackle what he calls the \"menace\" of social media.\n\nHe says it is having a range of adverse impacts, including rendering the granting of anonymity to complainants null and void and destroying the reputations of accusers and the accused.\n\n\"Social media can render the granting of anonymity to a complainant a complete waste of time and that will put people off coming forward.\"\n\nCross-examination\n\nSir John makes 29 recommendations in this area, 11 of which would require new legislation.\n\nThere would be specific laws aimed at members of juries, and others targeting members of the general public.\n\nOther proposals include the pre-recording of the cross-examination of complainants away from the court room.\n\nThis would initially be afforded to children and vulnerable people, but would eventually extend to all complainants in cases of serious sexual offences.\n\nThere would also be measures to enforce current law prohibiting questioning of complainants about their previous sexual history, except in rare circumstances.\n\nSir John says this is needed to reduce \"the humiliating and distressing nature of cross examination in rape trials as well as protecting a complainant's right to privacy\".\n\nHe hopes to publish his final report before the end of 2019."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "From Brazil to Cambodia and bust-ups with McGregor along the way \u2013 the life of a UFC referee", "description": "UFC referee Marc Goddard tells BBC Sport about keeping the rules in the octagon, his MMA roots and clashing with Conor McGregor.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/mixed-martial-arts/46028639", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/CD82/production/_104101625_goddard_getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T06:29:00Z", "content": "Marc Goddard has been refereeing MMA bouts for 14 years A fighter to your right, their opponent on your left.

Inside that cage they'll do anything to win - render the other unconscious, force them to submit. Your job is to keep it within the rules, and save them from serious injury.\n\n\"This is fighting,\" explains Marc Goddard, one of the most well-respected referees in the Ultimate Fighting Championship and across the mixed martial arts scene.\n\n\"You are turning up to have a pre-arranged legal fist-fight with someone. The ethos is 'I have to stop my opponent by any means necessary'... within the confines of the rules.\"\n\nIt is the \"within the rules\" part that sticks with Goddard, a former professional himself, who says his rise to the top of the officiating pool began \"by complete accident\".\n\nThe Englishman has seen it all in a 14-year career in the middle - world title fights in front of 60,000 people, high-profile bouts across the world, a run-in with the most-recognisable name in the sport, Conor McGregor.\n\n\"I don't care who you are, I don't care where we are, I don't care what's at stake,\" Goddard tells BBC Sport. \"When I am doing my job, all I want the fighters to know is they're going to get a fair crack at the whip.\"\n\nHere, he talks BBC Sport through life in MMA, the pressures of being a referee, that fallout with McGregor and what comes next for UFC.\n\nHow does refereeing compare with fighting?\n\nGoddard's involvement in MMA began before the turn of the millennium \"in rings, on tatamis and open mats\", and he never predicted how popular the sport would become - let alone his own role in it.\n\nAn injury picked up at an event in 2004 paved the way for Goddard's future in the middle, stepping in to help out a promoter who had been let down by a referee.\n\nWhile admitting the buzz from officiating is \"not even close\" to the adrenaline rush lining up for a fight brings, Goddard says he was \"always a referee trapped in a fighter's body\".\n\n\"Fighting, unless you have done it, it is hard to explain the feeling you have and the stresses, strains and how long they live with you for,\" he adds.\n\n\"You sign a contract to fight somebody three, four, five months in advance, you are going to bed with that person every night, you are waking up with that person every morning.\n\n\"As a referee, we don't share the same type of feeling but, especially at the top, when you are stood in Las Vegas about to referee a world championship fight, yeah, you best believe you get a sense of occasion and you know where you are.\"\n\nVetting people's gods in Brazil\n\nGoddard's hectic schedule takes him all over the globe.\n\nHe has just returned from Brave17 in Lahore, the first big MMA event to be held in Pakistan, another unique atmosphere to add to the likes of Poland, Japan and Cambodia - though he says nothing compares to Brazil.\n\n\"British crowds are intense,\" he says. \"But Brazilians are fiercely intense, it's almost like a football crowd in Brazil - passion, almost primal. If I am refereeing Jose Aldo or Anderson Silva, these people are gods.\n\n\"When you are stood there in Brazil, vetting the people's gods, you don't want to make an error or a mistake.\"\n\nIntimidating, surely?\n\n\"Intimidation leads to panicked, wrong choices,\" adds Goddard, from Birmingham. \"There are some intimidating characters out there, but as a referee you are paid to not be intimidated.\n\n\"You will get criticised, make no bones about that, regardless of the sport - the man in black is the one everyone wants to shout at. That doesn't bother me, I am not a shrinking violet, it goes with the territory.\n\n\"My decisions are made on fairness and the appropriate action at the time. I thrive on procedures, that's why the role of referee suits me - we have a rule book, we know what's good and what's bad and we stick to it.\"\n\nClashing with McGregor\n\nMcGregor confronted Goddard in the ring at Bellator 187\n\nA high-profile clash with McGregor came at Bellator 187 in Dublin last year when the Irishman jumped into the cage, after team-mate Charlie Ward defeated John Redmond, and confronted Goddard.\n\nMcGregor later apologised, saying he \"overreacted\" as he thought the referee was trying to pick an unconscious Redmond off the floor.\n\n\"I knew it was him,\" says Goddard about McGregor's sudden arrival in the cage. \"I have known Conor since he was a young, fresh-faced boy making his debut in MMA. I have known his coach, John Kavanagh, for close on 10 years, he grew up in the same environment and competition, same events.\n\n\"I said my piece when it happened. I don't care who you are, where it is - I have got a job to do and nothing or nobody on earth, from an integrity standpoint alone, is going to get in the way of that.\"\n\nIt is not the first nor will it be the last time Goddard has encountered similar situations, recalling stories from Russia and Cambodia, but generally the referee finds fighters to be respectful.\n\n\"The thing with Conor, it first started when I told him to go and sit back down,\" he added, referring to the Irishman's outbursts outside the cage at UFC Gdansk a few weeks earlier.\n\n\"The idiots out there say I was only doing it because it's Conor. But everyone that knows me and knows what I am about, knows it harps back to fairness. It doesn't matter who you are, it's about the two guys that are in the ring.\"\n\nSo what makes a top MMA referee?\n\nGoddard was in charge of the UFC Singapore bout between Holly Holm and Bethe Correia\n\n\"You have to know your sport inside and out,\" says Goddard. \"Not always from being a competitor, because that doesn't translate - there are 1,001 fighters out there who I know would make horrendous referees.\n\n\"The qualities needed to be a ref are different. You need a finite attention to detail, integrity. For want of a better description, I don't take any abuse.\n\n\"I am very pragmatic - it's left or right, black or white, I don't like grey areas. Being a referee, decisiveness is a definite quality you need.\n\n\"Once you decide on something, or make a call, you can't waiver or falter, you have to command respect from people and you have to do that the right way, because respect and reputation take years to build and years to gain.\"\n\nInstinct also plays a huge part in Goddard's role - think Holly Holm's knockout of Bethe Correia in 2017, when the Englishman reacted quickly to block a follow-up punch from Holm with Correia already unconscious.\n\n\"I don't watch fights as they unfold,\" explains Goddard. \"Referees who come unstuck get caught watching fights and can't react quickly enough.\n\n\"I am always very conscious of the fact I am not there to watch the fight. I am reading the fight and have to read what's happening in real time, what's happened before that, is the fighter taking damage? Do I need to get close? Do I need to give space? Get ready to move?\n\n\"All of these things go round in your head and you've got to stay in the moment. A referee has to have that clarity of mind - one second too late and you're the dog's dinner, one second too early... you're also the dog's dinner.\"\n\nWhat next for UFC and MMA?\n\nGoddard still trains regularly in mixed martial arts, despite his hectic refereeing schedule\n\nFights like McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov's lightweight title bout in Las Vegas last month attract an audience beyond the MMA world, but with that comes scrutiny from outsiders - especially with UFC 229 ending in a mass brawl between the camps.\n\nGoddard says the sport does not need to give its detractors any more ammunition and maintains MMA is a positive experience, traditionally built on \"a core value of respect and etiquette\".\n\n\"Fighters, promoters, camps, referees, officials, everyone involved, we all have a collective responsibility to portray the sport in the correct way,\" explains Goddard. \"It's the fight business, it's the game. Certain things sell tickets and pay-per-views.\n\n\"They are all big boys and girls, and it's down to them how they conduct themselves. We can't tell them what to do. It's a sport, but there is entertainment involved, too. Sometimes a little bit of needle and razzmatazz is going to generate what the promoters and what the business side of it is looking for.\n\n\"It's not exclusive to MMA. Footballers, boxers, cricketers - you pick up the paper and there is a misdemeanour going on somewhere. But because it is a fighting art and we are battling a lot of misconceptions, something happens in our sport and it's always amplified. That's the way it'll be for a considerable time.\n\n\"If the UFC ever going to be on prime time TV, BBC One or ITV on a Saturday night? No, so let's not kid ourselves. By the same token, what is mainstream? Three, four, five years ago they wouldn't touch MMA, now look what's happened in the last few years.\n\n\"As a sport we have to take a good hard look at ourselves and make sure we move forward as one.\"\n\nAs for Goddard's involvement in the future of MMA, he's a long way from finished yet.\n\n\"I am human, I am not perfect, nowhere near it, I don't believe in perfection,\" he adds.\n\n\"Something I try to impress on would-be officials and guys I train is by wanting to be perfect you are setting yourself up with a disadvantage - perfection is not a destination, it is a journey.\n\n\"Every time I ref I am trying to be perfect, because that's what keeps me on my toes, but I never turn around and go 'yeah, that's perfect', because it's not.\n\n\"The day I get to perfection is hopefully the day I retire after a 25-year as an official - that's the aim, anyway.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "News Daily: Backstop backlash, migrant money and Airbnb ban", "description": "Your morning briefing for 20 November 2018.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46267188", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3024/production/_104242321_pa-28157715_e.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T06:13:21Z", "content": "If you want to get this briefing by email, sign up here 'Faith broken' Image copyright PA Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party helped keep Theresa May in office after the 2017 general election - agreeing to back her in key votes.

But the DUP is deeply unhappy at the draft Brexit agreement and on Monday sent a stark warning to the PM. Its 10 MPs refused to vote in favour of the government's Finance Bill - needed to enact the policies announced in the Budget. The message, deputy leader Sammy Wilson says, is \"Keep your side of the bargain\" - or else.\n\nWhat does the DUP dislike about the draft agreement? It's the backstop - effectively the position of last resort if future talks between the UK and EU fail. It would keep Northern Ireland aligned to some EU rules while the rest of the UK would be free of them. The party feels that amounts to breaking up the United Kingdom, which Mrs May promised never to do. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says once faith is broken like this between the two parties, it's hard to see how it could be restored.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brussels, the EU's remaining 27 members could agree the final draft political declaration on future relations with the UK on Tuesday.

The figure comes from UN agency Unesco, which says the money gives a huge boost, reducing child labour and making life better for girls in particular. But it warns too much is being \"skimmed off\" in transfer charges by finance companies. The industry, though, says prices would be lower if regulators allowed more competition.\n\nListings ban\n\nAirbnb has announced it plans to remove all homes in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank from its listings. The firm said it reflected a feeling that \"companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced\". The West Bank settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. It called Airbnb's move \"shameful\" and threatened legal action. Here's a brief guide to the settlement issue.\n\nPlus...\n\nThe stress of modern living is taking a toll people's sex lives, a survey for BBC Radio 5 Live has revealed.

The Daily Mirror believes the case raises serious questions for Justice Secretary David Gauke, calling his initial refusal to intervene when the Parole Board decided to release Worboys \"contemptible\".

investigators after she, or her lawyers, determined it was unnecessary as they were personal messages.\n\nWhat was the Clinton email saga all about?\n\nBefore becoming secretary of state, Mrs Clinton set up an email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years in office.\n\nShe did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government.\n\nShe said it was for convenience.\n\nAn FBI investigation concluded that Mrs Clinton should not face charges, but said she and her aides had been \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information.\n\nAre private emails illegal?\n\nIt is not illegal for White House officials to use personal email accounts for government business.\n\nHowever, under the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, government officials must forward any official correspondence to a work account within 20 days for preservation.\n\nIf this is not done reliably, the use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers and others who seek publicly available information.\n\nThere are also rules against sharing classified or privileged information on personal email accounts."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title":

to back his call for a no confidence vote.\n\nMeanwhile, ministers have had to accept Labour amendments to the Finance Bill after the DUP withdrew its backing.\n\nLabour said the government was \"falling apart in front of us\" after ministers accepted a series of technical changes to the bill to pass the Budget.\n\nThey were made after it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg said he had not given up hope of getting the 48 letters of no confidence in the PM needed to trigger a vote.\n\n\"What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit,\" he told reporters at a Westminster news conference.\n\n\"We have a government led by Remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible.\"\n\nHe said the 48 letter threshold might be reached next month when MPs get a \"meaningful vote\" on the withdrawal agreement.\n\nBut he added: \"I think (the time) is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election.\n\nMrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months.\n\nThe PM says her Brexit deal is the best the UK can get from Brussels and it will allow the country to take back

Lawsuits were filed.\n\nBut life remained tough for Toshiba and its US nuclear business Westinghouse was forced to file for bankruptcy protection last year.\n\nWestinghouse was sold for $4.6bn to Canada's Brookfield Business Partners earlier this year.\n\nTakata's deadly airbags\n\nTakata was an automotive parts manufacturer which was founded in 1933 by Takezo Takada.\n\nBut by 2017, under the stewardship of his grandson, Shigehisa Takada, the company had become mired in a global scandal over faulty airbags that were linked to numerous deaths and hundreds of injuries.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption A fault in Takata's airbags caused some to rupture when inflated\n\nTakata's troubles started when it began using a chemical called ammonium nitrate to quickly inflate airbags in vehicles.\n\nSome inflated with such force, they spewed shrapnel at drivers and passengers leading to injuries and in some cases, death.\n\nTakada was forced to recall millions of airbags which, along with a multi-million dollar wave of legal claims, forced the firm to seek bankruptcy protection and prompted the resignation of Mr Takada.\n\nThe company was bought by US-based Key Safety Systems earlier this year.\n\nKobe Steel's data scandal\n\nThe travails that emerged at Japan's third-largest steelmaker had potentially wide-reaching implications - Kobe Steel supplies its products to makers of cars, planes and trains around the world.\n\nIt came to light in October 2017 that some of Kobe's staff had changed or falsified data about the quality of some of its goods before they were shipped to customers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kobe Steel's chairman and chief executive Hiroya Kawasaki resigns\n\nKobe Steel revealed almost 700 instances of \"misconduct\" and admitted it had \"deep-seated issues\" around corporate culture and compliance, though no safety issues have been reported.\n\nAn investigation into the scandal this year found the firm's management style overemphasised profitability and suffered from inadequate corporate governance.\n\nTwo executives in Kobe's aluminium and copper division knew about the falsification of data but took no action and were subsequently fired.\n\nKobe Steel's chairman and chief executive Hiroya Kawasaki also resigned in April.\n\nNissan's emissions failure\n\nFollowing the \"dieselgate\" scandal that engulfed German carmaker Volkswagen, Japan faced its own emissions crisis.\n\nNissan admitted in July that some emissions and fuel economy tests for its cars sold in Japan had \"deviated from the prescribed testing environment\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe company also said that inspection reports had been \"based on altered measurement values\".\n\nNissan pledged to conduct a comprehensive investigation and said measures would be taken to ensure the situation did not happen again.\n\nThe scandal delivered a hit to Nissan's reputation but contrasts to the troubles at VW, where the firm was found to have falsified emissions levels by installing \"defeat devices\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Brexit blind dates: Prof Lord Winston and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace", "description": "She nicknamed the fertility expert \"Lord Embryo\" but did they get on talking Brexit over dinner?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46222586", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06s7615.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T03:16:47Z", "content": "Media caption Watch the best bits of Prof Winston and Aisleyne's date What happens when two strong-minded individuals from opposite sides of the Brexit debate sit down for dinner?

I'm Aisleyne. I work on TV but my main income is as a property developer.\n\nWhat are your views on Brexit? We need to be able to stand alone. We need to shut the borders because we're bursting at the seams financially and we need to fix our problems at home before we fix anyone else's problems. [Being in the EU] is like having a broken leg and trying to carry another person with a broken leg to the hospital. It's just not going to work.\n\nWhat was your initial impression of Prof Lord Winston? I thought: \"What a dapper gentleman, looking like Super Mario.\"\n\nImage caption Aisleyne and Robert met for the first time\n\nHow was your date? It was a pleasure to spend time with someone that's so educated and for me to still be able to hold a decent conversation and not feel out of my depth. I'm just in awe of him and all the work he's done with embryos - I saved him in my phone as \"Lord Embryo\".\n\nWhat did you talk about? The fact that he said all of his learned colleagues at [the hospital where he works] were already leaving the UK. That worried me a bit because I didn't think that was happening. I don't know if he was saying it for effect but he doesn't strike me as the type of person to lie.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"You're getting angry with me\".

When he thought I was patronising him [when saying: \"Thank you for your service,\" after he explained his work in the NHS]. He said: \"Don't patronise me,\" but it was really just a compliment, because I'd never want to hurt anyone's feelings.\n\nDid he convince you of anything? I still believe that we can stand alone and we do need to fix our problems but he has made me think that it needs to be a little bit more tailored. Before, I thought: \"[Let's just have a] hard Brexit,\" but he has made me realise the intricacies.\n\nDid you convince him of anything? Just that I was fabulous - I think he really did stop and listen to what I had to say, which was a huge compliment.\n\nImage caption Robert tried to ring his son, a Big Brother viewer, during the date\n\nWould you see him again? Yes - he took me to the House of Lords [since the blind date]. It was just fascinating. It was really eye-opening to see how the other half work. I just think he's an absolute delight and what a pleasure to now be friends with him - he's a really great person.\n\nDescribe him in three words: Genius, kind, learned.\n\nMarks out of 10 for the date: I really want to say 10. I left feeling like I wanted to know more.

Robert Winston, professor of science and society at Imperial College in London, where I work on reproductive medicine.\n\nWhat are your views on Brexit? I voted Remain. I see myself as a European. I've always felt that. Recognising what had happened to Europe, really from 1618 onwards, the time of the Thirty Years' War, it seemed to me obvious that we actually need some form of better coalition between European countries. I think one of the very real reasons for wanting to be part of the union is to have a peaceful Europe, which has been highly successful. What was remarkable in the Brexit debate was this was seldom actually recognised.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert tells Aisleyne: \"Don't patronise me\"\n\nHow was your date? The food was OK. The soup was good but you can't really talk and eat soup.\n\nWhat did you talk about? The NHS, trade, Theresa May.\n\nAny common ground? Not much.\n\nWhat did you disagree about? Everything - one of the things that is always a problem in arguments, and I hear it in the House of Lords in debates, is when someone says: \"I believe that so-and-so should happen'. The trouble is when you are arguing with or against belief, there is an emotional compound to it. That is a big problem when you are looking mathematically and rationally and in a dispassionate way. That's the problem with Brexit - it has polarised communities and individuals in a way I don't think anyone expected.\n\nWhat did you learn about your date? I learned a whole lot of things. I didn't know about her background, I didn't know who she was - I didn't know who I was meeting.\n\nWould you see her again? We are going to meet in five years' time, we've agreed - that's a firm commitment.

They would then understand if your behaviour or studies changed during that time.\n\nYou could try approaching another family member such as an aunt or uncle and ask them to speak to the parent.\n\nUltimately I feel having someone you could talk to who would help normalise all those feelings which are associated with loss, would help navigate an incredibly difficult time and help accept that this was not your responsibility.\n\nAnd then my sister found out\n\nAbout two years later, I got a text from my sister saying: \"Can I give you a call?\"\n\nShe was absolutely bawling her eyes out.\n\n\"Oh my God, dad's cheating on mum,\" she said.\n\nLike me, she'd got suspicious about his phone and seen the texts to \"Amos\".\n\nAt that point, I felt almost relieved to hear it.\n\nI decided to confront him over the phone.\n\n\"Me and my sister both know,\" I said. \"You need to tell mum, otherwise it's going to be very difficult for me to have any kind of relationship with you.\"\n\nHe was just totally silent.\n\nThen at the end of the call he said: \"Thanks for telling me.\"\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nThe note\n\nHe didn't speak to my mum straight away.\n\nHe didn't even talk to my sister about it, who lived at home at the time.\n\nAfter three months, he still hadn't told her.\n\nI was at the point where I really wanted to punch my dad.\n\nHe was driving me to the train station once, and I just went off on one in the car.\n\nThat night, he sent me a text: \"I'm leaving tonight, I've left a note in the wall clock. I've asked your sister to get it out on Friday.\"\n\nI kind of resent him for doing it that way.\n\nBut after three months of my sister having to live in a house with them both, I just didn't really care how he did it.\n\nBy the time I got to the house, mum had already opened the letter. And that was it.\n\nIt's a pretty horrible way to find out after 25 years of marriage.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nI don't really have any regrets about how it unfolded.\n\nI think that weirdly, I did everything I could.\n\nI didn't want to be the one that told my mum.\n\nShe's not angry with me for knowing all that time - in fact, she was mortified by the fact I'd had to go through that.\n\nMy advice\n\nI have two main pieces of advice for people going through this.\n\nFirstly, take a step back before doing anything rash.\n\nThere were a couple of times where the red mist descended for me - doing things like taking a shower just help me calm things down.\n\nSecond, it really helped me to be able to speak to someone privately.\n\nMe and my sister still get on each other's nerves, but it's definitely made our relationship stronger.\n\nThe hard thing is how dad's behaved since mum found out.\n\nHe'd not been paying her the maintenance and things like that, making life extremely difficult for her.\n\nLittle things like demanding my mum return a computer that he'd been given by her parents once for Christmas.\n\nI rang him and told him to stop - my sister got involved too.\n\nThe next day, he sent us both a text saying he thought it was best we don't stay in touch.\n\nMum and dad are getting divorced - and I think he's with the other woman. I'm still working on what relationship we might be able to have in the future.\n\nIf you need any help with family relationships, you can click the BBC Advice pages.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Reality Check: Can you be 'employed' for one hour's work?", "description": "How many hours do you need to work to be officially classified as \"employed\"?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46264291", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7512/production/_100907992_workpeoplegetty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:52:37Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Just how many hours do you need to work to be officially classified as \"employed\"?

The ONS extrapolates the findings to produce employment bulletins.\n\nThose selected to take part in the LFS are interviewed every three months for fifteen months before they drop out of the sample. Interviews are initially done face-to-face and follow-up ones are done by phone. The one exception is the north of Scotland where all interviews are done over the phone because of the distance involved.\n\nA person will need to have worked at least one hour in the two weeks before the interview with the ONS takes place to be classified as employed.\n\nIts most recent survey put the UK employment rate (of people aged 16-64) at 75.5% - very close to a record high.\n\nThe figures were welcomed by government, with Employment Minister Alok Sharma saying: \"The benefits of a strong jobs market are paying off.\"\n\nBut could people working very few hours be artificially boosting the headline employment numbers to make them look better than they really are?\n\nThe ONS told Reality Check that was unlikely because the overall number of people working so few hours \"is very low indeed\".\n\nThat is supported by its own figures.\n\nThe ONS data shows that the number of people usually working six hours or fewer a week is just 1.4% of the UK working population - or just over 400,000 people, which compares with a total of 32.4 million people in work.\n\nIn fact, that's a drop from 1.8% at the start of the century.\n\nSo, the share of people working very short hours has actually fallen, which suggests zero-hour contracts are not distorting the headline employment numbers.\n\nBut why does the ONS use one hour as the definition?\n\nChoosing whether to define someone as being in employment or not can be a bit of a conundrum, says Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies.\n\n\"Why pick one hour? Well, because if you put the bar higher, you might end up classifying people as unemployed even though they're working.\"\n\n\"You have to draw the line somewhere,\" he says.\n\nThe ONS definition is also an international one - drawn up by the International Labour Organization (ILO). By choosing to use the ILO's definition, the UK's employment data is consistent with other countries, making it easier to draw international comparisons.\n\nUPDATE 21 November: The ONS initially told Reality Check that the criteria to be counted as \"employed\" was one hour over two weeks. It subsequently told us that it had made an error and that the definition was in fact one hour over one week.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Grenfell father: 'I thought I'd lost my family'", "description": "A Grenfell survivor speaks to Newsnight about hearing the 999 call he made on the night of the fire.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-46269400/grenfell-father-i-thought-i-d-lost-my-family", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/106C6/production/_104407276_de32.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:47:15Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nA survivor of the Grenfell Tower fire has said it is \"important\" for people to know what it was like trying to escape from the burning building.\n\nMarcio Gomes is among the residents who have given evidence to Phase 1 of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry.\n\nParts of his 999 call - which lasted 30 minutes - were played during the public inquiry.\n\nReport by Katie Razzall, Sara Moralioglu and Rachel Price."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Love Island's Zara: Revenge porn victims need anonymity", "description": "The former contestant from this summer's ITV2 dating series says she's twice been victimised.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46209284", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14021/production/_104335918_zaragetty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:29:12Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Love Island contestant Zara McDermott has told BBC Radio 5 Live that revenge porn victims need to be \"given the option\" of choosing to remain anonymous.

I just cannot hear it,\" she says.\n\n\"It puts me in a state of distress, it makes me really anxious. My body feels there's danger - I need to leave or I need to protect myself.\"\n\nMargot has misophonia, which she describes as a brain dysfunction that causes common sounds to produce an intense emotional response - such as anger, panic, fear or distress.\n\nIn people with this condition, the part of the brain that joins our senses with our emotions - the anterior insular cortex - is overly active and wired up to other parts of the brain in a different way.\n\nThere are many possible trigger sounds, but some of the most common are related to food - crunching, slurping or sipping.\n\nMargot's trigger sounds include the crunching of crisps, whispering, clicking noises made with pens, keyboard tapping and one of the worst - knuckle cracking.\n\n\"My reaction to this one is really physical because it's one of the worst for me,\" she says.\n\n\"It makes me jump off my chair and I'll have to do something to make it stop, which is not the case with all of my other triggers.\n\n\"It's not like a sound you don't like, it's much more than that, it's completely different. It's something I feel in my stomach, like extreme anxiety. Or suddenly I feel overwhelmed, I can't think any more, it just takes over everything.\n\n\"If someone had a gun and they were pointing it at me, it would feel exactly the same.\"\n\nFind out more\n\nAccording to the British Tinnitus Association's website, trigger sounds tend to be \"human-generated noises that are under voluntary control\", such as sniffing.\n\nBut if Margot sniffs herself, that's different.\n\n\"I can stop doing it if I want, so it's not as threatening as someone else doing something that you can't control and you don't know how long it's going to last for,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Margot Noel Image caption Margot as a young child\n\nOne of her earliest memories is of her brother tormenting her by clicking his tongue.\n\n\"I'm about six or seven and it's a constant fight between us,\" she says. \"My brother knows that tongue-clicking is a problem for me, I've said it a few times, so now he has power over me and he's two years younger than me. If I annoy him, if I don't do something he wants, he will just start tongue-clicking.\"\n\nMargot's parents didn't understand how the noise was affecting her and so would tell Margot to \"grow up,\" and put up with it.\n\nNow they are older, Margot says her brother is much more understanding, but she is reluctant to complain if he makes a sound that is excruciating to her.\n\n\"I was having dinner with my brother yesterday. I gave him a gum after dinner and he was chewing it like a cow, it was horrendous, and I didn't want to ask him to chew less loudly, because people usually get offended,\" she says.\n\n\"They feel like it's an attack or a criticism when it's not, it's actually not. I'm the problem, but it's very difficult to ask people to make less noise because they always end up feeling like they can't be themselves around you.\"\n\nImage copyright Margot Noel\n\nAlthough she says she's had the condition all her life, she didn't realise it was misophonia until about three years ago.\n\n\"It was becoming clearer that I had a problem and I couldn't find what it was. Sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't have the right keywords on Google.\n\n\"One day I was really angry and I was crying, because I was watching an amazing play and I was just distracted the whole time by someone breathing like they were going to die, and I went back home, looked again, again, again and then I found it, and from that moment, to be honest, it was really great just understanding.\"\n\nMargot also discovered, via Google, that a study into misophonia was being conducted at Newcastle University and emailed the person in charge, Dr Sukhbinder Kumar, to thank him.\n\nHe wrote back, and soon invited Margot to take part.\n\nWhat is misophonia?\n\nAlso known as Selective Sound Sensitivity, misophonia is a strong emotional response to the presence or anticipation of a sound. There are three key emotional responses: anger, disgust and anxiety, with anger being the predominant emotion.\n\nThese intense emotions are accompanied by high levels of arousal - the fight or flight response. There is a release of adrenaline and a supply of energy to respond to the threat. This is typically experienced as a fast heart beat, rapid shallow breaths, tension, hotness, shakiness, and sweating.\n\nWork environments, such as open plan offices, can be a minefield of triggers. Tensions can develop within intimate relationships and couples can find it difficult to share normal activities together, as someone breathing or eating can become infuriating.\n\nSource: British Tinnitus Association\n\nThe trial was terrifying. She had to listen to some of her trigger sounds without reacting to them or even closing her eyes.\n\n\"I had wires all over my face, everywhere, and they were studying my reactions to the sounds and I just couldn't do all of it,\" she says.\n\n\"It wasn't that I gave up, because I told them I wanted to do it, but they said I had to stop because I was too distressed and it was confusing the results.\n\n\"I think I had to do six modules and I only did two, and after two I was just crying like I'd never cried before.\"\n\nImage copyright Margot Noel\n\nMargot found the trial so distressing because she could not use any of her usual coping mechanisms to escape the trigger sounds. In day-to-day life she wears ear plugs or headphones to block the noises out.\n\n\"I cannot live without music,\" she says. \"My headphones are on my ears all the time, even if there's no music in them - just ready to rescue me if something happens. Music for me feels very much like a protection.\"\n\nArtists such as Moby, David Bowie, Air, Diana Ross, Oasis and Daft Punk have become the soundtrack to her life, she says.\n\nMargot's anti-misophonia playlist:\n\nMoby - Inside\n\nMoby - One of these mornings\n\nMoby - Another woman\n\nAir - Talisman\n\nAir - La femme d'argent\n\nAir - Le soleil est pr\u00e8s de moi\n\nDavid Bowie - Ashes To Ashes\n\nDavid Bowie - Starman\n\nDavid Bowie - Drive-In Saturday\n\nTommy Tee - Aerosoul\n\nDaft Punk - Make Love\n\nDaft Punk - Emotion\n\nAphex Twin - Heliosphan\n\nRappin 4 Tay - Playaz Club\n\nDJ Mehdi - Signatune\n\nEven watching a film can be difficult.\n\n\"I hate, for example, the sound of people kissing. That disgusts me, I find it 'aargh!!'\" she says. \"One film out of two has people kissing passionately. Some films they don't make too much sound, but in others they do and I'll just have to cover my ears and wait for it to be finished.\"\n\nWhen it comes to her own relationships, however, misophonia has not caused any problems so far.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Margot explains how her brother tormented her by clicking his tongue when she was young\n\n\"I try to surround myself with people that are understanding,\" she says.\n\n\"For me it would be a major downer if I was with a guy and I told him, 'Can you stop cracking your knuckles?' and he made fun of me. That would be an absolute no no for me. I'd be like, 'Well, goodbye.'\n\n\"I think if people like you they just try to like all the little things about you, even the ones they don't really understand. If you really like someone you don't want them to feel uncomfortable, you want to make them happy.\"\n\nMargot is currently seeing someone and has a good social life, but says living with misophonia can be very isolating. She lives on her own, which she says is a \"dream,\" and works as a freelancer for advertising agencies.\n\n\"I'm quite solitary. I write a lot, alone, in my office, like a tortoise,\" she says.\n\nDr Sukhbinder Kumar says there is no scientifically validated method to cure misophonia, but that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some initial positive results.\n\nIt's also not clear how many people have the condition, he says, though he points out that one study conducted among undergraduates showed that as many as 20% had significant misophonia symptoms.\n\nMargot often doesn't tell people about her own symptoms as she finds they are not always sympathetic - and sometimes even think it's something she has invented.\n\n\"I just try to deal with it on my own without asking people to change their behaviour,\" says Margot.\n\nShe hopes the study she took part in will eventually lead to new treatments. But also looks forward to a day when more people know that the condition exists.\n\n\"If I could just ask someone next to me in the theatre, 'I'm sorry, can you just try to not do that noise, I have misophonia,' and they would be like, 'Oh I'm really sorry,'... That is what I'm hoping for more than a treatment - just being able to have that discussion with someone without them making me feel like I'm a freak.\"\n\nListen to Margot Noel speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Nissan shares fall on Ghosn arrest", "description": "Carlos Ghosn has been accused of \"significant acts of misconduct\", including under-reporting his pay package.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46271048", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A4C0/production/_102267124_gettyimages-611421510.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:24:56Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Nissan shares were down more than 6% in early Tokyo trade, following the arrest of the firm's chairman Carlos Ghosn.

It looks at their welfare and safeguards their livelihoods,\" she said.\n\n\"Islam holds women in high regard and as judges, we must return to its teachings and maintain worthiness using Sharia.\"\n\nHer greatest concern lies with Muslim men bypassing strict Sharia court procedures by marrying overseas.\n\n\"He wouldn't be bound by Malaysian law if he marries abroad. Some wives actually consent to this to protect their husbands but they don't realise how it works against them,\" she said. \"Our Sharia laws are in place to protect the interests of women and hold men accountable.\"\n\nWomen's groups like Sisters in Islam highlighted a \"severe shortage of female representation\" in the courts and a \"strong sense of patriarchy\" in the overall system.\n\n\"The Sharia legal context in Malaysia not only selectively discriminates against women, it vilifies them as the cause of social immoralities,\" said spokeswoman Majidah Hashim.\n\n\"State Islamic institutions... have done little to ensure women are accorded due justice.

How about a doctor who hadn't been to medical school? asks author Alison Green, and the creator of the workplace advice column Ask a Manager.\n\nWe tend to agree that most skilled jobs require some amount of formal training - and yet for one of the jobs that is most key to companies' success, we frequently throw people in with no training at all: managing.\n\nMany, many people get promoted into management jobs because they were good at something else. They were a good engineer or a good fundraiser, and so they're asked to manage engineers or fundraisers.\n\nThe problem is, the skills that it takes to manage people well are often a completely different skill set from whatever work the person was doing previously.\n\nImage copyright Alison Green Image caption We frequently throw people in to managing with no training at all, says Alison\n\nYou have to know how to set clear expectations, how to delegate responsibilities, how to check in on work as it progresses without micromanaging or being overly hands-off, how to hire great people and develop them, how to give feedback, how to have difficult conversations about performance problems and other tricky topics, how to hold people accountable without being a jerk, how to resolve conflict - the list goes on and on.\n\nIt's hard work, and it doesn't come naturally to most people - which is why most of us make a ton of mistakes as we're learning.\n\nAnd it's not that companies never provide any support. Some managers get sent to one- or two-day management training courses, where they're supposed to learn the basics. But a one- or two-day class just gets your feet wet; it shouldn't be the entirety of the support that new managers get - and yet it often is.\n\nOther managers don't even get a class; they're just thrown in and left to wing it, with little guidance or support from above.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Two-day courses are not enough to turn people into effective managers\n\nNo surprise, then, that there are loads of terrible managers out there:\n\nManagers who assign work without being clear about what they want, and who frustrate their staff when they keep sending it back for revisions, without having ever laid out a clear vision in the first place.\n\nManagers who won't address problems and let serious issues fester on their teams for months or even years because they want to avoid awkward conversations.\n\nManagers who who treat employees like wayward children.\n\nWeak managers, rude managers, waffling managers, tyrannical managers - there are so many different varieties of managerial incompetence.\n\nAnd yet the quality of managers has a direct impact on a company's bottom line - as well as on its ability to attract and retain great employees and to get the best results from them while they have them.\n\nBad managers drive away good people, and hold teams back from achieving what they otherwise could. So why, then, don't organizations put more of an emphasis on training new managers in how to do their jobs?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Learning to manage isn't a short process and one class isn't going to do it, says Alison\n\nPart of the answer is that employers simply don't value management enough as a skill of its own. They see someone who's good at their job function and assume they'll be good at managing people who do that job function too.\n\nThey don't sufficiently appreciate the skills it takes to make the transition to managing. Part of it, too, is tradition - if you're a manager who didn't get much training and had to figure it out on your own, it's easy to think that that's just how it works and others can do it too.\n\nAnd part of the explanation is time and money - it takes resources to train people to learn a new and complicated skill. Learning to manage isn't a short process and one class isn't going to do it - it's a long, ongoing process of learning, and it takes continuous support from more experienced managers who can mentor newer managers and weigh in and advise when new and complicated challenges come up, as they inevitably will.\n\nEmployers would do well to consider pairing new managers with more experienced colleagues - but doing that means valuing management as a skill in the first place. And until we do that, it's certain that bad managers will continue to flourish.\n\nFor more workplace letters from Alison Green and other contributors, download the World Business Report podcast."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Starting a national team in a country that doesn\u2019t exist", "description": "Somaliland is not is not a UN recognised nation but this has not stopped four men attempting to develop a national football setup.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46185221", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/10F49/production/_104294496_sapmivsomalilanddaurakhvledianistadiumgagra.imagecredit-kieranpender.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:07:37Z", "content": "Children at training at the Somaliland Football Academy Like most football-obsessed kids, those playing on the streets of Hargeisa dream of one day representing their country.

The problem is their country, officially at least, doesn't exist.\n\nSomaliland has everything you expect from a country. Its people have Somaliland passports and pay with Somaliland shillings. The Somaliland flag flies in the Somaliland Parliament. The president was democratically elected in a \"smooth and peaceful\" election.\n\nWhat it doesn't have is a Fifa-recognised international football team or the means to maintain one. However, that is something four Britons of Somaliland descent are determined to change.\n\nIn February, Ahmed Ali and Mohammed Saeed, both 26, from Birmingham, joined Abdisalam Ahmed, 22, and Hussein Adan, 26, from London to establish the Somaliland Football Academy in their parents' homeland.\n\n\"We think every young person should have the opportunity to play football,\" Ali, a former community coach and scout for West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City and now head of youth football and coach education in Somaliland, tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"In most other countries there's already some sort of structure in place whereas here the challenge was to build everything from the bottom up. The thing that excited us most was literally starting from grassroots football to one day forming a national team.\"\n\nThe quartet arrived with coaching backgrounds but to no facilities, no money and no players. As it is not a Fifa member, Somaliland does not receive international funding and its government, perhaps understandably, has other priorities.\n\n\"The four of us went to the sport ministry and said 'look, we'll do it for free. We'll do the whole youth development and coach education courses,'\" says Ali, who credits Ahmed Adare, the former justice minister and Somalia international, with helping to open doors.\n\n\"They said 'go ahead, let us know if there's anything we can help with. As long as it's not money.'\"\n\nThe Somaliland 'national' team Organised by London-based president Ilyas Mohamed, the Somaliland team played their first friendly fixture in 2014. A squad of mainly UK-based amateurs, including a PE teacher and hospital administrator, competed in the 2016 Conifa World Football Cup in Abkhazia, a partially recognised break-away region of Georgia. Playing against other de facto nations, autonomous regions and minority peoples, Somaliland lost three of their four matches, finishing 10th out of 12. Their one victory was a 3-2 win over the Chagos Islands, a diaspora team representing the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Though the squad included four players based in Somaliland, the government at the time claimed the team could not represent the 'country' and that the goal was to be accepted into Fifa.\n\n'We had 140 kids turn up on a seven-a-side pitch'\n\nSomaliland Football Academy founders Ahmed Ali (far left), Mohammed Saeed (third from right), Hussein Adan (second from right) and Abdisalam Ahmed (far right)\n\nCut off from international assistance, the average Somalilander lives on US$347 a year. One in 11 children do not survive to their fifth birthday and the average life expectancy from birth is 50.\n\nIn Hargeisa, Somaliland's capital, camels and donkey-drawn carts merge in traffic with battered taxis.\n\nThough it is attracting growing foreign investment, Somaliland is a place with plenty of challenges. Chief among them: proving it is a 'real' nation.\n\nAfter gaining independence from Britain, Somaliland unified with Somalia in 1960. As Somalia fell into civil war, Somaliland re-declared independence in 1991. Ever since, as Somaliland has strived to show the world it is independent, the world has looked the other way.\n\nCompared to Somalia, which suffers regular terrorist attacks, Somaliland is relatively stable and, though it may be poor, its people are proud.\n\nSomalilanders will tell you their 'country' is in the Horn of Africa, bordering Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia, with a small (pirate-free) coast on the Gulf of Aden. Ask the United Nations, or any government in the world, and they'll say Somaliland is an autonomous region in north-west Somalia.\n\nSomaliland's presence in the football world is similarly hidden. An unofficial 'national' team plays in Conifa (the Confederation of Independent Football Associations), but draws largely on players from the roughly one-million-strong diaspora in areas including the UK, US and Scandinavia.\n\nUntil recently, the region roughly the size of Uruguay, with a population of 3.5m, also had no structure for youth football, but that too is being addressed by the Somaliland Football Academy.\n\nFrom the academy base in Hargeisa, the four founders have self-funded travel across the country, training 132 coaches and recruiting 1,600 players.\n\n\"In the UK everything is set-up and you're just there to deliver a coaching session, but here it was literally at zero,\" Ali says. \"There were a lot of kids playing football in the streets but there weren't any organised teams.\"\n\nWhat wasn't lacking was a passion to play.\n\n\"We once had 140 kids turn up on a seven-a-side pitch\" Ali says. \"You'd have one kid come and the week after he'd bring six friends, and then they'd bring 20 friends and before you knew it you'd have hundreds of little ones wanting to play.\"\n\nAhmed Ali (right) was recently appointed head of youth football and coach education in Somaliland\n\nAdan, who moved to Somaliland in July 2017 and set up the All Star Sports Academy, now one of seven centres under Somaliland Football Academy, adds: \"The country loves football. Tell someone a team and they will tell you about any player in that team,\" Adan, who also works with schools to design and deliver physical education programmes, says.\n\n\"I was walking around the city and you see kids playing on street corners kicking around a bottle or socks wrapped into a ball.\"\n\n'It is about giving them hope'\n\nThe academy has established national leagues for boys at Under 13, 15 and 17 level\n\nThe academy has relied on donations. West Brom gave training equipment and a delivery from KitAid means somewhere in Somaliland youngsters are proudly wearing last season's Port Vale and Walsall shirts.\n\nWith astroturf pitches scarce and expensive, they have also had to be creative finding places to play, often utilising disused patches of dusty land.\n\n\"The boys will come to a pitch before the session and sweep the place to make sure there aren't any bricks or rocks. It's helped us - one, by not having to pay for facilities and two, the players put a bit of care into their local area,\" Ali says.\n\nWithin a year, the academy has established national leagues for boys at Under 13, 15 and 17 level. They also want to develop football for women and, at a recent girls' tournament, the Vice-President congratulated the winning team.\n\nThe academy works closely with Lions Gate, a sports centre set up by another Brit, Mohammed Yusuf, in one of Hargeisa's poorest areas. Established to combat gang violence, Lions Gate has trained former gang members to be coaches, referees and ground staff.\n\nYouth unemployment is high and many Somalilanders attempt the dangerous journey to Europe via Libya. One Unicef-funded study found those emigrating were typically young men, some as young as 14, and \"abuse and death are common\".\n\n\"We've had mothers crying and hugging us because we stopped their boys from trying to emigrate. We gave them hope and something to look forward to and we didn't even know it,\" Ali says.\n\n\"For some, coaching is about developing players to play in the Premier League but for us it's about giving them hope to keep going and not give up.\"\n\nThe diaspora-heavy Somaliland team is ranked 27th out of 40 Conifa members while Fifa ranks Somalia joint-sixth lowest in the world\n\nRecognition from Fifa seems unlikely but would not be without precedent. The organisation has 211 members, 18 more than the United Nations. In 2016, Gibraltar and Kosovo became Fifa's latest additions. Both have since claimed victories on the pitch, even if political recognition off it is missing.\n\nInstead, the academy is focused on recruiting and training more players and coaches, with the aim to build elite youth teams at Under 15 and Under 17 level.\n\nThe academy founders have seen enough talent to believe the place that claims Mo Farah as its own (his family live in Somaliland) can have a positive future on the pitch - if given the chance.\n\n\"Ninety-nine per cent of the players here are physically good. They can run and technically they are good because they have played a lot of street football.\n\n\"I think you can compare it a lot with the favelas in Brazil. There's a lot of raw players, there's a lot of raw talent, but they need a lot of coaching to fulfil their potential.\"\n\nThe players and staff of Somaliland Football Academy\n\nA team allowed to compete against other 'nations', even at youth level, could boost Somaliland's bid for international acceptance.\n\n\"We are trying to gain recognition and sport is the best way,\" Adan says. \"If I ask people in Somaliland 'what's the capital city of Egypt?' many can't answer. But if I ask 'who's the best player from Egypt?' they'll tell you 'Salah' immediately.\n\n\"Football is an international language and if we were producing talented players and they were making noise on the international stage, that would do Somaliland the world of good.\n\n\"The people of Somaliland are so passionate about their country. If there was a group of people representing Somaliland on the international stage, it wouldn't just be for the young people, it would be for everybody.\n\n\"I hope one day it does happen, but we've got a long way to go.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/20 00:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3s1c5", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Would you buy a handbag from Plada or Loius Vuitton?", "description": "From fake shops to copycat products, firms around the world are losing billions to copyright theft.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46224431", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F979/production/_104356836_zig_8464.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:04:58Z", "content": "Image copyright ZIGOR ALDAMA Image caption You've heard of fake handbags being passed off as luxury brands, but an entire store?

So what should they be doing to protect themselves?\n\nWhen two new luxury fashion boutiques opened in the Chinese city of Renhuai this summer, it was hard to tell they were fake at first.\n\nThe storefronts, which appeared to belong to the luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Prada, bore huge photos of models posing with legit-looking products while the shelves were packed with posh handbags and accessories.\n\nIt was only the misspelled branding that gave the game away. One shop called itself \"Loius Vuitton\", the other \"Plada\".\n\nThis is the world of intellectual property (IP) theft, which costs European companies alone about \u20ac60bn (\u00a352bn) in lost sales each year, according to figures from the EU's Intellectual Property Office.\n\nImage copyright ZIGOR ALDAMA Image caption Loius or Louis? Spot the difference at a fake Louis Vuitton store in Renhuai\n\nIn its most recent survey, 7% of EU citizens said they had intentionally bought counterfeit products in the last 12 months. But critics say this black market stifles the development of innovative young companies and costs jobs.\n\n\"There are also strong links between counterfeiting and organised crime and child labour,\" says Alex Newman, an intellectual property expert at law firm Irwin Mitchell.\n\nAuthorities closed down the fake Louis Vuitton and Prada shops in Renhuai within days, but other big brands operating in China have not been so lucky.\n\nIn 2016, for instance, Apple lost a trademark fight against a Chinese firm selling handbags and other leather goods using the name IPHONE.\n\nChina is among a number of countries regularly singled out as a source of IP theft, but businesses say the problem is global.\n\n\"We have seen copycats for many decades, first starting in the late 1940s and it is a continuous issue we deal with,\" says Roar Rude Trangb\u00e6k, a spokesman for Lego.\n\n\"The only difference is that today globalisation means that an issue that was once contained is now worldwide.\"\n\nImage copyright The Collective Image caption Aldi's yoghurt next to The Collective's product\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses says 9% of small British firms have had their IP rights infringed on more than one occasion, often by firms operating on UK soil. Typically this involved activities like trademark theft or patent infringement, although copying of products was the most common complaint.\n\nExamples include supermarkets producing goods that look just the same as branded ones and even have similar names. In August, for example, family sausage firm Heck and yoghurt maker The Collective both accused Aldi of copying their products.\n\nThe German discounter says that none of its customers have complained of being misled and it follows \"strict copyright guidelines\", but the two firms are still considering taking legal action.\n\nAmelia Harvey, co-founder of The Collective, tells the BBC: \"Their strategy is clear, they're taking cues from other brands and recreating; tricking the consumer into buying something that it isn't.\n\n\"As a challenger brand with a small team it's beyond frustrating.\"\n\nImage copyright Heck Image caption Is Aldi's packaging too similar to Heck's?\n\nMr Newman says supermarkets often get away with it by making \"tweaks\" so products aren't identical, \"leaving it open for them to argue that the differences are enough to avoid infringement\".\n\nSimilar problems beset the fashion industry, where allegations of copying are commonplace. In November, UK retailer Next reached a settlement with fashion brand Scamp & Dude over claims it copied the smaller firm's designs.\n\nNext was accused of a \"blatant infringement\" of an animal print top for children, with the garment even appearing to mimic a distinctive logo.\n\n\"Often by the time the design rights-holder gets round to doing anything, the accused company will be close to selling through the garments in question,\" Mr Newman says.\n\nImage copyright Instagram Scamp and Dude Image caption When small businesses take on big brands they often have to resort to social media for help\n\n\"It will then play for time until it can say, 'we've stopped selling this now' which leaves the company alleging infringement reluctant to spend the time and money taking them to court because the likely financial pay-out will often not justify the cost.\"\n\nTo protect themselves, firms should make sure they have registered trademarks and other forms of IP in any country they operate in.\n\nBut many still do not bother, says Sonali Parekh, head of policy for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). She blames lack of awareness and concern about the costs.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\n\"Then there's concern that if you file for a patent you will alert people to your design and they will tweak it then copy it,\" she says.\n\n\"But if you do nothing you leave your business even more exposed.\"\n\nObvious as it might seem, firms should also tell alleged copyists to stop, although about a third of firms whose IP rights are infringed make no attempt to take action, the FSB says.\n\nImage copyright Lepin Image caption Lepin plastic construction kits are close copies of existing Lego sets\n\nMr Newman says this is a mistake. Even if you don't ultimately sue, a legal letter demanding they cease and desist will often resolve the problem without going to court, and may even lead to a financial settlement, he advises.\n\nFor those operating in foreign markets, familiarising yourself with local IP laws - which vary significantly from country to country - is vital, although places like China are strengthening enforcement.\n\nIn November, for instance, Lego won 4.5m yuan (\u00a3503,000) in damages from Chinese companies that had sold copycat building sets under the name \"Lepin\".

For example:\n\nAn LG 60 inch TV was advertised at \u00a3799 by Amazon on Black Friday. By the end of December it was \u00a3150 cheaper\n\nA Sony Cybershot camera was on sale at \u00a3189 at Currys PC World on Black Friday. Later it was \u00a310 cheaper\n\nA Fitbit Alta activity tracker was advertised by John Lewis at \u00a399.99 on Black Friday. By March this had been reduced to \u00a339.99\n\nWhich goods tend to be cheaper?\n\nTrusted Reviews said it had found many items which had their lowest price on Black Friday 2017. These included:\n\nThe Dyson V6 animal wireless vacuum cleaner. It cost \u00a3179.99 on Black Friday 2017, its lowest ever price and a 45% reduction\n\nBose QuietComfort 25 headphones. They cost \u00a3159 last Black Friday, a 32% price reduction, and the lowest price until March 2018.\n\n\"While amazing deals are available before Black Friday, not every deal is always as good as it seems,\" said Nick Merritt, editor in chief of Trusted Reviews.\n\n\"That's why it's so important people find a trusted source of impartial information before taking the plunge. Doing so could save you hundreds of pounds.\"\n\nPrice-trackers\n\nOne way of establishing whether you are getting a bargain or not is to download a price-tracker.\n\nThis will give you a full history of how much has been charged for any particular item in the past.\n\nFor those who use Google Chrome, Trusted Reviews recommends Keepa, which tracks prices on Amazon. CamelCamelCamel does a similar thing for those who don't use Chrome.\n\nPrice Spy tracks prices across hundreds of retailers, including John Lewis and Argos. Idealo claims to track prices across 29,700 different shops in Europe.\n\nRetailer Apps\n\nAnother tool for bargain-hunters is a retailer's own app. Many of these will notify consumers when a price of a product has gone down, and by how much.\n\nWith a couple of clicks they can then purchase the item."}]
