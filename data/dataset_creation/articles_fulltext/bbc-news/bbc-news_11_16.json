But there's one thing they have in common: the alcohol in all of them is gin.\n\nImage caption The Lidl House of Hortus pop-up bar in Soho\n\nThe night is in fact to promote discounter Lidl's Christmas gin range.\n\nThe chain is banking on it contributing to a bumper Christmas - its sales of the spirit are already 40% higher this year than last.\n\nThis isn't just the fashion at Lidl, of course. Aldi's gin won joint silver (with Lidl's) at this year's International Wine and Spirits awards and Asda reports a mind-blowing rise of 76% in gin sales this year.\n\nLidl says 1.5 million more adults drink gin today than four years ago.\n\nAnd this week saw the launch of a \u00a34,000 bottle of gin. Available only at chic department store Harvey Nichols.\n\nGin's popularity isn't just found in a glass these days.\n\nEssence of gin runs through a startling list of products: body butter, scented candles and lip balms, tea bags, advent calendars, popcorn and gin-flavoured cheese and chocolates.\n\nAll this would have bemused the late Queen Mother's generation, for whom gin aperitifs marked the spirit's last high popularity mark sometime around 1970.\n\nJuniper, the defining aromatic that gives the drink its name, may not now even be discernible among the flavours featured. Roasted white sesame seeds, seaweed, hibiscus and sansho (Japanese pepper) have all been pressed into service for flavouring gin.\n\nImage caption Is there anything you can't put a gin theme on?\n\nHow has it come to this? And can it continue?\n\nThe answer to the first question is a simple policy tweak by the government. Before 2009, the law meant no distillery under a 1,800-litre (400 gallons) capacity would be granted a licence. It did this to try to stop small-scale hooch makers.\n\nBut then the government's tax collector, HMRC, at the urging of Sipsmith Gin, changed its policy to allow small, craft distillers \"as long as they had good business reasons and strong security could be evidenced to protect excised duty revenues\".\n\nThe number of stills rocketed. HMRC says there are currently 419 licensed distilleries in the UK; in 2009 there were only 113.\n\nImage copyright Nick Cook Image caption Nicholas Cook of the Gin Guild hasn't (quite) called peak gin\n\nTwo brands in particular stand out for whetting the trendsetters' appetite, says Nicholas Cook, director general of industry body the Gin Guild.\n\n\"Bombay Sapphire was a revolution at the time with its lighter, more botanical style and the other one was Hendrick's, which marked itself out with what were then novel botanicals, in the form of cucumber and rose.\"\n\nAnother trailblazing feature of the two brands were their \"inspirational, individual and stylish bottles\".\n\nBut with 500 gins in the UK alone, uniqueness on these two fronts is no longer enough.\n\nPeak gin, it seems, is nearing.\n\nA major report on the UK white spirits market, by market research firm Mintel, will be published in December. Its author, analyst Alice Baker, says gin is by far and away the fastest-growing of the white spirits with sales across the board up by around 25%.\n\n\"Gin could have another few years of growth - but then it could plateau. As with any trend, it has its limits.\"\n\nEven the Gin Guild comes close to acknowledging this although it's hardly going to call time on its own product. It prefers to say it is at \"peak brand\".\n\n\"It would be hard to enter the market now,\" admits Nicholas Cook. \"You'd be hard pushed to find room on a retailer or bartender's shelves.\"\n\nAnd although the Guild may not want to acknowledge it too strongly, its parent body the Worshipful Company of Distillers' annual debate, will in fact be: \"This house believes that the gin boom has reached its peak.\"\n\nBut it holds this in May, so we won't know what they think about that until then.\n\nImage copyright Scott Garfitt Image caption Pink gin is reborn\n\nIt is hard to see where next the gin market could go but Mintel suggests manufacturers distinguish themselves by using \"colour outside the bottle\".\n\nIn Lidl's House of Hortus pop-up a whole room was glowing pink, with those pinkish-type gins of pomegranate and rose on offer. Other rooms were also colour-themed.\n\nAnd Mintel says this could go even further. \"Pink rules now, but there are even ones that change colour. Social media users are a key target - vibrantly coloured gins lend themselves well to photos and videos and that sort of thing does help reach those precious under-40-year-old consumers.\"\n\nA short history of gin\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hogarth's Gin Lane: idleness, squalor and oblivion\n\nGin was invented in Holland in the 16th Century as a medicine, the English caught on to the \"Dutch courage\" habit when fighting with the Dutch in the Thirty Years' War\n\nKing Charles I gives the Worshipful Company of Distillers the sole right to distil spirits in London, partly to help English farmers by using surplus corn and barley\n\nMore royal help from King William III (a Dutchman), he actively encourages spirit production to raise money for wars. Gin becomes cheaper and more popular than beer\n\nOveruse of gin in the 1730s becomes a scandal as portrayed in Hogarth's Gin Lane - idleness, vice and misery, madness and death\n\nThe \"gin palaces\" of the Victorian era are built, bright and glamorous giving the new industrial working class a place to spend their money\n\nGin falls from fashion, becoming the province of the posh and elderly until in 2009 a change in the law makes it easier to open a distillery and the new boom is unleashed\n\nMeanwhile, all those who have joined in the gin party may like to consider what they can turn their hand to if the party is indeed winding down.\n\nAll those gin stills could be turned in a trice to another spirit.\n\nPaul Jackson, the founder and editor of the Gin Guide, expects it to be rum.\n\nAt least he won't be out of a job. He is currently laying out the pages for the first edition of the all new Rum Guide.\n\nMintel's Alice Baker agrees that rum could be a contender. \"It has the provenance potential - the story of which Caribbean island it originates from, and it doesn't dominate the drink, if you had the right sort of marketing campaign that could start to improve again.\"\n\nEither way, HMRC won't mind as it will still get its cut.\n\nIt takes a hefty payment from any spirit sold.

It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November.\n\nThe publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning.\n\nSome Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.\n\nMark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK \"half in and half out\" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament.\n\nBut Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to \"stop and reflect\", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's.\n\n\"All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray.\"\n\nIf there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would \"easily\" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying \"when pen comes to paper\" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Susana Mendon\u00e7a, BBC political correspondent\n\nWhen they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as \"collective responsibility\".\n\nBut the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in.\n\nThis apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an \"embryonic\" stage but will they get their tweaks?\n\nAndrea Leadsom thinks there's \"still more to be done\" and that they \"do still have more time\" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment.\n\nOn Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something \"winnable and supportable\".\n\nThe four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: \"What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for.\n\n\"I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with.\"\n\nAmong her concerns was that \"the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement\" with the EU, she said.\n\nShe added: \"I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal.\"\n\nThe cabinet \"gang of five\" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\n\nThe backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable.\n\nThe UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier\n\nAccording to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue.\n\nThe group's plans were described as a \"work in progress\", and a \"last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons\".\n\nThe deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.\n\nAhead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to \"tweaks\" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said \"nothing fundamental\" could change.\n\nOur correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter \"some kind of bargaining process\" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year.\n\n\"I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,\" he told Sky News.\n\nWhisky for May\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister told the Daily Mail the withdrawal agreement was \"not everybody's ideal deal\" but said her job was to make \"tough decisions\" and \"find a way through\".\n\nShe also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue.\n\nCommenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been \"a pretty heavy couple of days\".\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The PM says her husband is protective over her\n\nShe revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her \"rock\", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast.\n\nOn Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a \"social media blitz\" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics.\n\nMrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday.\n\nA No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Amber Rudd returns to the frontbench - she quit as home secretary in April over the Windrush controversy\n\nIn other developments:\n\nAmber Rudd was named as the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey who also quit over the deal\n\nStephen Hammond takes over from Mr Barclay as a health minister in the mini-reshuffle\n\nAnd John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara; while Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman\n\nDavid Davis, Brexit secretary before Mr Raab, pressed Mrs May for a looser deal with the EU, saying the US would be ready to start negotiating a free trade deal straight after Brexit if she ditches her plan\n\nOn Sunday, the pro-Brexit European Research Group plans to publish a seven-page summary of the 585-page draft agreement\n\nThe Chief Constable of Northern Ireland warned that \"anything that re-emphasises\" the Irish border presented challenges for policing and the threat of violence was not being exaggerated\n\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told his party that his government wants to build bridges rather than new borders.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit that Mrs May agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday has been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Small UK firms 'fed up' with Brexit turmoil", "description": "Small businesses owners give their reaction to the Brexit talks and the PM's draft Brexit agreement.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46238143", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AD9F/production/_104374444_brexit.leave.remain.signs.g.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:34:03Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images It's hard enough to run a small business at the best of times.

That's the sort of thing that they've delivered a number of times.\n\n\"With 20 minutes left to play in South Africa recently they were down 20-13 - that's an incredible turnaround to get up and win that game - but they have made a habit of doing it, albeit sometimes it's by a whisker.\n\n\"I'd like to think that we could be in the game but playing the All Blacks it's very hard to predict exactly how the game is going to go.\"\n\nWin the aerial battle\n\nIreland are without four key players for Saturday's match with scrum-half Conor Murray, centre Robbie Henshaw and flanker Sean O'Brien joined on the injury list by Dan Leavy, who was originally named to start.\n\nThe absence of Murray, who plays a crucial role in Ireland's kicking game, has created an opportunity for Kieran Marmion to impress the Ireland coach, while 6ft 10in Devin Toner has replaced Iain Henderson in the second row ahead of the anticipated aerial contest this weekend.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device The Rugby Social - All Blacks and retirement\n\n\"You need to starve New Zealand of the ball and I would start Dev as well,\" said Henry.\n\n\"Whenever you have got somebody who is six inches taller than everyone else - if the throw is spot on and he's jumping with two lifters - it's nearly impossible to stop him taking a banker ball every time and obviously he knows the options that they have inside out.\n\n\"I can't wait to see the aerial battle with Sexton on [full-back Damian] McKenzie and getting the boys chasing him down.\n\n\"You don't want to give the All Blacks the ball but McKenzie is short and yes he's brave but if Sexton's kicking is on the money we can get up and that's where Murray... If you had Murray on there I'd be a lot more confident.\"\n\nHenry's former Ulster and Ireland team-mate Darren Cave is also bullish about Ireland's prospects of toppling the All Blacks and believes that Schmidt will be hugely motivated to upset the world number one team.\n\n\"He's a Kiwi, he's a New Zealander, he will be beyond busting to beat these boys again,\" said Cave.\n\n\"A guy who played rugby in New Zealand, lived in New Zealand and a proud Kiwi his whole life, to beat them would be amazing.\n\n\"If New Zealand play really well they're impossible to beat but I'm backing this Ireland team at home.\n\n\"Sexton is probably the best fly-half in the world and I think he'll be better this week, and the team will be better too. I know we have beaten them before but if ever we were going to beat them I think it is this week.\"\n\nDarren Cave and Chris Henry were speaking to Gavin Andrews on BBC Sport NI's The Rugby Social"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Women's international: Wales 65-0 Hong Kong", "description": "Wales run in 10 tries to thrash Hong Kong and secure their second win of the autumn series at Cardiff Arms Park.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46193245", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/AB51/production/_104375834_cdf_161118_wales_hkong_women11.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:47:02Z", "content": "Lisa Neumann was one of four players to score two tries in the win over Hong Kong Women's international: Wales v Hong Kong Wales (48) 65 Tries: Joyce 2, Neumann 2, Lewis 2, Harries 2, Crabb, Lillicrap Hong Kong (0) 0 Wales ran in 10 tries to thrash Hong Kong \u2026 [+1024 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is not supported on this device Wales score 10 tries to thrash Hong Kong\n\nWomen's international: Wales v Hong Kong Wales (48) 65 Tries: Joyce 2, Neumann 2, Lewis 2, Harries 2, Crabb, Lillicrap Hong Kong (0) 0\n\nWales ran in 10 tries to thrash Hong Kong and secure their second win of the autumn series at Cardiff Arms Park.\n\nJasmine Joyce, Lisa Neumann, Beth Lewis and captain Sioned Harries led the way for Rowland Phillips' side with two tries apiece.\n\nDebutant Gwen Crabb and Siwan Lillicrap also crossed for tries in a convincing victory over a side ranked 23rd in the world.\n\nWales conclude their campaign against Canada in Cardiff on 24 November.\n\nPhillips' side had began the campaign with a 19-5 win over South Africa.\n\nWales head coach Rowland Phillips told BBC Sport Wales: \"I was really pleased with the result.

So strong there is a theory he is an alien.\n\nAlmost half a lifetime ago, Messi played against Porto at the Nou Camp - and has gone on to break countless records.\n\nThe record goalscorer for Barcelona (566), La Liga (392) and Argentina (65), the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has won 33 trophies with Barca.\n\nNow 31, and showing no signs of slowing down, Messi has scored 14 goals in 13 games in all competitions this season - and is the joint top scorer in La Liga with a goal every 87 minutes - despite being out for three weeks with a broken arm.\n\nBut how does he do it?\n\nOne potential explanation was raised on Thursday's BBC Radio 5 live Football Daily podcast by Spanish football writers Andy West and Guillem Balague - who have both written books on the Argentine.\n\n\"There is a theory that he is an alien. How else could he do it?\" said West. \"Barcelona defender Gerard Pique is a particular proponent of that theory.\"\n\nBalague added: \"On the alien theory, I wrote in my book that there are 11 things you need to be Messi and that is why he must be an alien. Only an alien can have that.\n\n\"The right family and football context - his family almost emigrated to Australia. Had he been born there would he be Messi? I don't think so. In Argentina, yes. You have to have the motivation, the ambition, the regularity of effort, commitment, sacrifice, confidence, leadership, emotional intelligence, the genes and you have to have luck.\n\n\"Put all that together and you get Messi. Why have there not been any more Messis? Because it is impossible to have all that together.\n\n\"He was a rock falling down a mountain, there was no stopping him and he would have destroyed whatever came in his way.\"\n\nHow did the best get better?\n\nLionel Messi has won the Pichichi (Spain's Golden Boot) five times. Only Telmo Zarra has won it more (six)\n\nMessi, who has set up 219 goals in 650 appearances for Barcelona, has played under six managers at the Nou Camp and is now the club's captain after the departure of Andres Iniesta.\n\nWest said: \"He has been open to adapting to new situations, new coaches, new team-mates, new playing positions and I think that is so important.\n\n\"If even the greatest player in history has to be open to changing the rest of us should be. He had to abandon the false nine role in which he scored 91 goals in a year [2012] because it stopped working.\n\n\"Consistently, every two or three years, he has taken on a new role, new team-mates. He hasn't chosen these. It hasn't been part of a big masterplan, he has had to react to circumstances.\n\n\"In the early days he was a dribbler - he could do other things as well, and I'm simplifying a bit - whose instinct was to get the ball and run as quickly as possible towards goal.\n\n\"The Spanish word 'pauza', where you just stop and take in the game - he didn't have that, he was a bit head-down. But you can see now how, over the years, he has developed other aspects to his game. He can still dribble but he has a much greater passing ability.\n\n\"He doesn't maybe still have the capacity to run past players from the halfway line, like in his famous goal against Getafe in 2007, but he can pass through teams. He is a more complete player and I think this is something we will see more of in the coming years.\"\n\nHow can you give Messi instructions?\n\nSuch is the influence of Messi at the Nou Camp, even manager Ernesto Valverde sometimes accepts his captain knows better.\n\nBalague said: \"Right now, Messi is the solution man. He understands the game in a way many don't.\n\n\"One thing that Valverde told me is that Messi delivers commentary on the bench. There was a game against Sevilla where he came on for the last half-hour and changed the game completely.\n\n\"Valverde started to point things out to Messi - 'You know Leo, you should... you... oh, do whatever you want.'\n\n\"He looked at him and thought 'what am I going to explain to this guy?'\"\n\nWhat does the future hold for Messi?\n\nThis picture of a mural of Lionel Messi as a kid was taken at Newell's Old Boys' sports complex as he returned to his home town to get married last year\n\nMessi is on a break from Argentina duty, having failed to win any senior trophies with his country in 128 caps, losing four finals. He is contracted until 2021 to Barcelona, and says boyhood club Newell's Old Boys are the only other team he could see himself playing for.\n\nWest said: \"Messi's story tells us that it would be foolish to try to predict what he will do in the future.\n\n\"The changes that have happened have been forced on him. We don't know how this Barcelona team is going to evolve. If Ousmane Dembele is going to become an important player then it will force Messi to change the way he plays.\"\n\nBut it could all have been so different...\n\nImagine Lionel Messi leading Como to victory against Barcelona in the Champions League final.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous but, according to Italian football journalist James Horncastle, things could have been very different for Messi.\n\n\"He found the right club, environment and education because that can so often stunt a player's development,\" he said. \"You always have to stimulate players' interest in the game.\n\n\"Fabio Capello tells a story when Juventus went to play Barcelona, he saw Messi and said: 'I want to take that player, I want him on loan'. Ultimately, he was frustrated.\n\n\"The president of Genoa claimed he had Messi on trial when he was at [now Italian fourth division side] Como and if Como signed him, the club would be champions of Europe and the world.\n\n\"It would have been interesting to see how he would have done under the tutelage of Capello and whether it would have worked out.\"\n\nMessi is unlikely to play in the Premier League now but Balague added: \"I asked Messi about people in England saying: 'You would not do so well on a cold, wet night in Stoke.'\n\n\"He said: 'They should have seen the pitches I played on in Rosario.'\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Unknown body buried in Clocaenog forest 'since 2004'", "description": "The unknown remains were found in Clocaenog forest in 2015 during a Wales GB Rally stage.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46243092", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A0D1/production/_91396114_11475061-312a-45d1-b5da-0298bf8f555a.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:15:17Z", "content": "Image copyright Facelab Image caption Police reissued a photograph showing a facial reconstruction of the man The remains of a man found buried in a remote forest in Conwy county three years ago are likely to have been left there between 2004 and 2010.

She knows there is a section in the road up ahead that is not surrounded by trees. But with little around her to help her get her bearings, she doesn't know how close it is.

He can't look at the footage, and deletes it, then keeps driving for hours once the fire is behind him.\n\nAt least 79 people were killed, many as they became trapped in their cars as the fire surrounded them.\n\nWithin only a day and a half of it starting, the Camp Fire destroyed more properties than any other fire in California before it.\n\nMore on the California fires\n\n\"Boys, this is paradise.\"\n\nThose are the words, according to local legend, that led to the small mill town gaining its name in the 1860s.\n\nWilliam Leonard and his crew are said to have just returned from delivering lumber to a mill when he sat down underneath a pine tree, looked out at the view, and spoke those words.\n\nOver time, Paradise grew to be a bucolic town of 27,000 residents, known for its cooler temperatures and slower pace of life among the trees.\n\nThere was the Gold Nugget Museum, that talked of the Native American prospectors who first settled the area.\n\nThere was the Black Bear Diner, with its all-day breakfasts and friendly sign (\"Welcome to Bearadise\").\n\nBut there were also those pines, the ones that William Leonard sat under in the 1860s, and the ones that played their part in the destruction of the town.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nConditions in California mean that if a wildfire ignites, it can spread at speed.\n\nThe state has suffered especially dry weather recently, and California Governor Jerry Brown has acknowledged the role man-made climate change has played in making those conditions worse.\n\nThis would be bad enough in itself, but the powerful winds - warm, dry air travelling from the east to the coast - have turned vegetation into tinder across the state. Areas like Paradise, which is at the bottom of mountains over which the winds barrel down, are especially at risk.\n\nThose winds helped whip up the Camp Fire and led it to jump canyons, roads and emergency fire-breaks that had been dug to try and stop the flames spreading. On the morning the Camp Fire swept through Paradise, there were gusts of up to 55mph.\n\n\"It was just so fast,\" Sorrell Bobrink says, still unable to understand how things got so bad, so quickly.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nA map of damaged properties in Paradise shows strange streaks, isolated pockets where the fire flashed by and left little damage.\n\nIn some neighbourhoods, one house would remain standing while all others around were destroyed. A rubber duck stood untouched even though the house in which it once sat no longer existed. While almost all of the interior of one shop was incinerated, cardboard boxes holding gas grills were left barely burned.\n\nHouses that suffered no damage at all are few and far between, however. So far, the Camp Fire has destroyed close to 12,500 properties and 151,000 acres. Ten days on, it continues to burn and it is unlikely to be fully contained until the end of the month.\n\nAs Paradise was lost, and two other large wildfires spread in southern California this week, Gov Brown said he refused to accept this was the new normal. \"This is the new abnormal,\" he said.\n\nBut in interviews, Camp Fire survivors would often cite other fires they or relatives had survived in recent times - the Carr Fire, the Thomas Fire, the Tubbs Fire, the Mendocino Complex Fire - each different in its own way, but which together signify a new sort of threat California must learn to live with.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images\n\nSurvivors are now scattered across the state - some in Red Cross camps, some in a temporary tent city that has popped up in the car park of a Walmart store in nearby Chico.\n\nMeanwhile, relatives of the roughly 1,000 people who are still officially listed as missing are now being asked to give DNA samples so police can match them to any remains that are found.\n\nPolice dogs trained in picking up the scent of bodies are being taken through the piles of ash where houses once stood.\n\n\"I will forever be changed, as so many thousands of others were,\" Tamara Ferguson says.\n\n\"Not by what was physically lost, but by the reminder that life changes quickly.\"\n\nThis piece was produced from original interviews conducted by BBC correspondents, affiliates and UGC staff and incorporates social media posts by survivors"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Police dance delights Russian viewers", "description": "A Siberian police dance routine has captivated Russian viewers.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-46225010", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AE3F/production/_104370644_hmm.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:06:06Z", "content": "Image copyright Russian interior ministry Image caption Mind how you go A group of Siberian police officers have become Russian internet stars after their dance routine was posted online.

It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.\n\nChris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.\n\nTransition\n\nThe transition period (which the UK government calls \"implementation period\") begins on 29 March 2019 and lasts until 31 December 2020.\n\nThe UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but this can only happen once and for a limited period.\n\nBoth the UK and EU must agree to any extension and the decision must be taken before 1 July 2020.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nMoney\n\nThe draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or \"divorce bill\") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.\n\nWhile no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least \u00a339bn and it will be paid over a number of years.\n\nPart of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net \u00a310.8bn.\n\nIf the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the \"divorce bill\" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.\n\nMoney remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.\n\nCitizens' rights\n\nThis is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.\n\nUK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.\n\nCitizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.\n\nAnyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.\n\nBritish citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues.\n\nNorthern Ireland/the backstop\n\nIf no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of \"a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom\" will be triggered.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.\n\nAs long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to \"level playing field conditions\", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.\n\nThe UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.\n\nThat upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nFishing\n\nThe agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.\n\nThe document says: \"The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.\n\nIt's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.\n\nLaws and disputes\n\nThe UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.\n\nA joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nIf the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.\n\nInstead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.\n\nThat is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.\n\nWhat else is in it?\n\nElsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.\n\nThere's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.\n\nEU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like \"Welsh Lamb\" or \"Parma Ham\" remain.\n\nAlongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Elvis Presley to get US Presidential Medal of Freedom", "description": "A White House ceremony will award the star and six other recipients the Medal of Freedom.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46233352", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0682/production/_104366610_hi000491254.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:53:14Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rock 'n' roll star is one of seven to be awarded the prestigious honour Singing legend Elvis Presley will be among the seven recipients at US President Donald Trump's first Medal of Freedom ceremony since taking \u2026 [+2220 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rock 'n' roll star is one of seven to be awarded the prestigious honour\n\nSinging legend Elvis Presley was among the seven recipients at US President Donald Trump's first Medal of Freedom ceremony since taking office.\n\nThe award is the highest honour a sitting president can bestow on a civilian.\n\nThe White House described Elvis as \"an enduring American icon\".\n\nAmong the other six recipients honoured at the White House on Friday were baseball legend Babe Ruth and late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nNFL hall-of-famers Roger Staubach and Alan Page were the other sporting icons honoured at the ceremony.\n\n\"America is blessed to have the most skill, passion and talent anywhere on Earth,\" Mr Trump said during his opening remarks.\n\n\"We are truly a great nation and we are a nation that is doing really, really well right now.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption US President Donald Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to retiring Utah US Senator Orrin Hatch\n\nRetiring Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and doctor, philanthropist, and humanitarian Miriam Adelson completed the list.\n\nThe president called Senator Hatch \"a great friend\", saying: \"He liked me right from the beginning and therefore I like him.\"\n\nMr Trump also joked with Justice Scalia's widow, Maureen, over the size of her family.\n\n\"You were very busy, wow,\" Mr Trump told her after naming the nine Scalia children. \"I always knew I liked him.\"\n\nThe nomination of Mrs Adelson, wife of billionaire casino magnate and Republican party donor Sheldon Adelson, drew some criticism.\n\nPublic Citizen, an American public interest group told the Guardian \"it was difficult to believe the decision to recognise Miriam Adelson was based on merit\".\n\nReacting to the award Mrs Adelson told reporters she was \"deeply humbled and moved by this exceptional honour\".\n\nClarifying the choices, the White House claimed it had followed the example of previous administrations' processes.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: I was at an Elvis concert\n\nThe views of \"the public, advisory bodies, the cabinet and senior staff\" were all taken into account in making the decision, spokeswoman Lindsay Walters stated.\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal are the joint highest civilian awards in the US.\n\nWhat is the Presidential Medal of Freedom?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Obama awarded 123 medals, the most of any president to date\n\nEstablished in 1963 by President John F Kennedy, it superseded the post-war Medal of Freedom\n\nThe highest awardable civilian honour in the United States\n\nTraditionally the medal is awarded for \"'meritorious contributions' to security, US national interests, to world peace... or other significant endeavours\"\n\nExceptional candidates can receive the award \"with Special distinction\"\n\nRecent recipients include ex-Vice-President Joe Biden and Prof Stephen Hawking\n\nElvis joins a lengthy list of musical stars to be awarded the medal, including Ella Fitzgerald, Bob Dylan, and Stevie Wonder.\n\nExplaining the posthumous award, the White House said: \"Presley defined American culture to billions of adoring fans around the world.\n\n\"Fusing gospel, country and rhythm and blues\" the star had created \"a sound all his own\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "All Blacks a 'massive challenge' -

He opened the boot to find the child surrounded by excrement. She was dirty, dehydrated, and weighed less than half what she should have.\n\nGuillaume Iguacel, the mechanic, said of the scene: \"There was a horrible smell, a smell of death in the car.

It emerged that she had initially failed to reveal two of her other pregnancies to her partner.\n\nDa Cruz said she had viewed S\u00e9r\u00e9na as \"a thing\" until she was 18 months old, when the baby smiled at her.

It was really hard to win this award, especially because of all the other players I was up against.\"\n\n2009 Didier Drogba - Ivory Coast and Chelsea (England)\n\nDrogba won the FA Cup, and also scored the goal that took Ivory Coast to the World Cup, in 2009\n\nAfter a disappointing start to the year, in which he was struggling for both goals and a place in Felipe Scolari's Chelsea side, Drogba saw his footballing fortunes vastly improve through 2009.\n\nHe would score 31 goals for the London club in the calendar year, with one of his most important strikes coming in the FA Cup final as the Blues rallied from a goal down to beat Everton 2-1.\n\nOn the international scene, he secured qualification for the Ivory Coast at the 2010 World Cup and Nations Cup finals.\n\nHe scored six times in five games in the Elephants' campaign, including the goal which would take them to the World Cup - an equaliser against Malawi in Blantyre.\n\nThe striker beat Toure, Eto'o, Michael Essien and DR Congo's Tresor Mputu Mabi to the BBC title.\n\n2008 Mohamed Aboutrika - Egypt and Al Ahly (Egypt)\n\nMatch-winner Aboutrika celebrates the moment Egypt become the 2008 Nations Cup champions\n\nAboutrika was an overwhelmingly popular winner, taking over half of the 155,000 votes cast as the talented playmaker beat compatriot Amr Zaki, Drogba, Eto'o and Emmanuel Adebayor to the prize.\n\nRegarded as one of the finest footballers to ever grace the continent, Aboutrika had a 2008 to remember - scoring the only goal of the Nations Cup final against Cameroon and winning the African Champions League with Al Ahly.\n\nCrucially for a man whose talents have seldom been seen outside the continent given the Pharaohs' failure to qualify for a World Cup during his playing career, the quiet Egyptian was on the global stage at the Fifa Club World Cup with the Cairo team for a third time.\n\n\"2008 was a tremendous year,\" Aboutrika told the BBC's African sports programme Fast Track. \"It was an opportunity for me and my team-mates to be a showcase for Egyptian football across the world.\n\n\"This prize is a wonderful present for me. It's an honour both for Egyptian football and for my club Al Ahly - I am very happy to be this year's winner of the BBC African Footballer of the Year award.\"\n\n2007 Emmanuel Adebayor - Togo and Arsenal (England)\n\nAdebayor scored home and away against Spurs in 2007, including the goal of the 2007-2008 season\n\nThe tall Togo striker was a popular winner, taking 42% of the vote ahead of an in-form Drogba, while also beating Essien, Freddie Kanoute of Mali and Eto'o.\n\nIn May 2007, shortly after ending his first full season with Arsenal, the Adebayor was rewarded for his bright performances - and goals against Manchester United at Old Trafford and AC Milan at the San Siro - with a new long-term deal.\n\nHe started the following season in fine style, helping to compensate for the departure of club legend Thierry Henry by scoring 13 times by the end of 2007 - and ultimately performing so well he would end up in the PFA Team of the Year.\n\nOne of his 18 strikes in the calendar year - the volley at the home of north London rivals Tottenham in September - would later be named as the best of the season.\n\n\"I'm greatly honour to be given this award in front of my people,\" Adebayor said upon receiving his award in Lome. \"It means a lot. All these years I have been working hard - and today I have been rewarded.\"\n\n2006 Michael Essien - Ghana and Chelsea (England)\n\nEssien was in imperious form for club and country in 2006, a year when Ghana debuted at the World Cup\n\nBecoming what was then the most expensive African footballer when signing for Chelsea for \u00a324.4m in August 2005, Essien began to repay the Stamford Bridge faithful in full the following year.\n\nHe quickly emerged as a complete midfielder, with strength in the tackle, an eye for goal and vast reserves of energy - qualities that enabled the Ghanaian to pip Aboutrika, Eto'o, Drogba and Angola international Flavio to the BBC prize.\n\nLess than a year after joining the Blues, Essien had helped them win the Premier League - and his form was such that he ended up on the 30-man shortlist for Fifa World Footballer of the Year.\n\nHis immense performances as Ghana reached the knockout stages at the Black Stars' first World Cup were a decisive factor in that recognition and the midfielder was conspicuous by his absence when missing the 3-0 second-round defeat by Brazil through suspension.\n\n\"I have been playing some good football and without the contribution of my team-mates at national team and club level, I couldn't have achieved this feat,\" Essien, who was handed the trophy by Abedi Pele in Accra, told BBC Sport. \"I am very delighted to have won the award as it is total recognition from fans across Africa.\"\n\n2005 Mohamed Barakat - Egypt and Al Ahly (Egypt)\n\nBarakat was part of the Al Ahly team that went a world record 55 games unbeaten in 2005\n\nBarakat became the first North African to etch his name on the BBC African Footballer of the Year trophy after an unforgettable year with Cairo giants Al Ahly.\n\nThe Egyptian side won their domestic league before lifting the African Champions League, with Barakat top scoring in the competition with seven goals - scoring a hat-trick against city rivals Zamalek in the semi-finals, and one more in the final against Etoile du Sahel.\n\nThe midfielder was also key to Ahly's world record run of 55 games without defeat, an achievement that surpassed the previous feats of South American duo Santos (Brazil) and Penarol (Uruguay).\n\nSeeing off Eto'o, Essien and Nigerian duo Obafemi Martins and Jay-Jay Okocha, the slender Barakat received his award during the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations - which Egypt would go on to win.\n\n\"This award will certainly lift the spirit and morale of the whole Egyptian team,\" he told the BBC. \"I know this award was won because of my form for Ahly, but the star of that team is not one individual but the team itself.\"\n\n2004 Jay-Jay Okocha - Nigeria and Bolton Wanderers (England)\n\n2004 was a year when Okocha scored the 1,000th goal in Nations Cup history\n\nOkocha retained the trophy after a year in which he exceeded his exploits of 2003, captaining Nigeria to third place at the Nations Cup and helping Bolton to eighth in the Premiership, their then highest finish.\n\nIn only his second season with the club, he assumed the captaincy and promptly led the Trotters to the League Cup final, largely thanks to two stunning free-kicks in the semi-final win over Aston Villa.\n\nHe took that form to the Nations Cup, scoring four goals - including the 1,000th in the history of the competition - to finish joint top scorer while also being named player of the tournament.\n\nSuch displays enabled him to top a shortlist comprising Eto'o, Martins, Ghana's Stephen Appiah and Drogba.\n\n\"I never thought I could win it again this year,\" Okocha told BBC Sport. \"I appreciate this one more because it's been more difficult to retain the award and I've put in a lot of hard work to see that I retain it. I'm very happy I accomplished it and I appreciate all the people who voted for me.\"\n\n2003 Jay-Jay Okocha - Nigeria and Bolton Wanderers (England)\n\nOkocha became an instant hero at Bolton in his first full season with the club\n\nOkocha's first full season in English football was good enough to earn him the BBC crown ahead of Eto'o (then playing for Real Mallorca) and Appiah.\n\nThe skilful playmaker's excellent run in the second half of the 2002-03 season earned him rave reviews and he finished as the club's joint top scorer.\n\nNone of his goals was more important than the 30-yard strike against Middlesbrough on the final day of the Premiership season, which helped his team win 2-1 and so stay in the division by just a point.\n\nBolton coach Sam Allardyce praised his \"outstanding abilities\" as the Nigerian quickly adapted to life in England after a disappointing spell with Paris St-Germain.\n\n\"I am delighted to receive this prestigious award and it has inspired me to do more,\" Okocha said. \"I want to thank those who voted for me. I have worked hard to be on the top and I'm going to continue working harder.\"\n\n2002 El Hadji Diouf - Senegal and Lens (France)/Liverpool (England)\n\nDiouf was in scintillating form as Senegal stunned defending champions France at the 2002 World Cup\n\nAfter a troubled start to his career, with numerous off-field problems hindering his development, El Hadji Diouf finally showed the extent of his talents in 2002.\n\nThe forward was in sublime form at the start of the year as he spearheaded Senegal's passage to their first Nations Cup final, where they were only beaten by Cameroon on penalties.\n\nFearing his profile and price would soar at the World Cup, Liverpool snapped up the then 21-year-old from Lens in the days before the tournament began - and the Reds were right to be worried.\n\nHe gave a masterclass in the opening game of the 2002 finals, as Senegal stunned France with a 1-0 victory before the Teranga Lions went on to reach the quarter-finals at their only World Cup to date.\n\n\"Some people may have negative things to say about me but I know that the fans believe in me and I will continue to play for them,\" Diouf told the BBC upon receiving his award in Johannesburg.\n\n2001 Samuel Kuffour - Ghana and Bayern Munich (Germany)\n\nKuffour won 16 major titles during his time with German side Bayern Munich\n\nSammy Kuffour achieved a rare feat by winning the trophy despite being a defender, a result of helping Germany's Bayern Munich to a hat-trick of titles in 2001.\n\nIn May, just days after clinching their third straight Bundesliga on the final day of the season, Bayern beat Valencia on penalties to win the Champions League, their first European crown in 25 years.\n\nThis more than atoned for the club's dramatic 2-1 defeat by Manchester United in the 1999 final, which famously featured Kuffour beating the ground in frustration at the final whistle.\n\nAt the end of the year, Bayern would win the Intercontinental Cup when beating South American champions Boca Juniors, with Kuffour scoring the winning goal in extra time.\n\n\"To be voted the BBC African Footballer of the Year is not an easy thing and it's a great opportunity for me,\" the Ghanaian, who beat Diouf and Sierra Leone's Mohammed Kallon in the voting, told the BBC. \"This award is for the whole African continent.\"\n\n2000 Patrick Mboma - Cameroon and Cagliari/Parma (Italy)\n\nMboma scored in final against Spain during the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000\n\nThe turn of the century witnessed a change in the BBC's award as Patrick Mboma won the last African Sports Personality of the Year - with the prize changing to African Footballer of the Year in 2001.\n\nThe Cameroon captain was rewarded after a hugely successful year in which his side not only won its first Nations Cup title in 12 years but also Olympic gold.\n\nThe Italy-based striker scored four times in the Nations Cup, including a goal in the final as the Indomitable Lions lifted the title after winning a penalty shootout to defeat co-hosts Nigeria on home soil.\n\nIn September, he hit another four goals as Cameroon won their first Olympic gold medal, beating Spain in a Sydney final which was also decided by spot-kicks.\n\nReflecting the nature of the BBC trophy at the time, Mboma finished above Ethiopian long-distance runner Haile Gebreselassie and Mozambique's Olympic gold medallist Maria Mutola in the voting.\n\n1999 Nwankwo Kanu - Nigeria and Arsenal (England)\n\nKanu, who left Inter Milan to join Arsenal in February 1999, became an instant hit with Gunners fans\n\nNwankwo Kanu won the BBC award for a second time in 1999, two years after his initial title, as he bounced back from a difficult period to play at the highest level once again - signed by English Premier League side Arsenal in February.\n\nThe tall striker had been diagnosed with a heart defect shortly after joining Inter Milan in 1996 and remained with the Italian giants for over two years after surgery, but playing just a handful of games during that time.\n\nIn his first full season with Arsenal, Kanu scored a legendary 17-minute hat-trick at Chelsea - clinching a famous comeback from two goals down to win 3-2 when he curled home a stunning winner in the final minute.\n\nSix months earlier, he had already earned the adoration of Gunners fans when showcasing his ability with a tasty backflick against Middlesbrough.\n\nThe Nigerian would net six Premiership goals that term, before firing 17 in all competitions the following season - including a strike that earned a Champions League draw at Barcelona.\n\n1998 Haile Gebrselassie\n\nGebrselassie won the 10,000 metres World Championship title four times between 1993-1999\n\nFor only the second time in history, the BBC prize was won by an athlete - as legendary Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie won the title.\n\nThis came after the athlete broke the world records in both the 5,000m and 10,000m.\n\n1997 Nwankwo Kanu - Nigeria and Inter Milan (Italy)\n\nKanu's return from a major heart operation to play for Inter in 1997 was warmly received by fans worldwide\n\nKanu signed for Inter Milan from Dutch side Ajax in 1996 and went on to win a historic Olympic football gold medal with Nigeria weeks later, the first time an African nation had ever won the prize.\n\nBut he was diagnosed with a hole in his heart shortly after and following successful surgery in November, he would not play for Inter for the whole of the 1996-97 season.\n\nIn April 1997, he returned to his club and a bright young player who had won the 1995 European Cup with Ajax received a second chance.\n\nHis first match came the following season, but he made just 11 appearances - scoring only once - and he was given only one more game prior to his February 1999 departure for Arsenal.\n\nHis prize as BBC African Sports Personality of 1997 was all about the strength of character he showed and the goodwill he gained when returning to the game after such a scare.\n\n1996 Emmanuel Amuneke - Nigeria and Sporting (Portugal)/Barcelona (Spain)\n\nAmuneke's (left) goal against Argentina made Nigeria the first African nation to win Olympic football gold\n\nEmmanuel Amuneke earned the BBC prize after scoring the goal that sealed one of football's most heart-warming victories, as a carefree Nigerian side won Africa's first Olympic football gold medal.\n\nImproving on Ghana's bronze in 1992, Nigeria won the competition with some thrilling play that saw off none other than Mexico, Brazil - searching that elusive first title and boasting Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos - and Argentina in the knockout stages.\n\nIn the final itself, Amuneke - who played every game for Nigeria during the tournament - slotted home in the 90th minute to seal a memorable fightback after the 1994 African champions had come from 2-1 down with 16 minutes left.\n\n\"We were the pride of the whole continent, since this was the first time that an African team had ever won a tournament this important,\" he later told Fifa.com.\n\nHis exploits caught the eye of Spanish giants Barcelona, who signed him from Portugal's Sporting Lisbon in December that year, but his career never fully recovered after suffering a bad knee injury in 1997.\n\n1995 George Weah - Liberia and AC Milan (Italy)\n\n1995 also saw Weah become the only African to be named World and European Footballer of the Year\n\nThe BBC award was just one of many that AC Milan's George Weah won in 1995 along with the African, European and World Player titles, and the Liberian is still the only African to have won Fifa's prestigious prize.\n\nHe beat Paolo Maldini and Jurgen Klinsmann in the voting, before earning further acclaim at the awards ceremony after spontaneously giving his Fifa medal to a moved Arsene Wenger, who had discovered and developed the striker's talent at Monaco.\n\nWeah was instrumental in Paris St-Germain's historic march to the 1995 Champions League semi-finals, finishing as the tournament's top scorer that year with seven goals - one of which came at the Nou Camp as the French side knocked Barcelona out in the quarters.\n\nHe also enjoyed great success with his nation in 1995 as Weah propelled the Lone Star to a maiden Nations Cup qualification, even if the following year's tournament debut would herald a first-round exit.\n\nAfter leaving Paris for Milan, Weah netted 11 goals as the league title arrived in his first year and he would surpass his tally the next season, when he scored his pitch-long wonder goal against Verona in 1996.\n\n1994 Zambia national team\n\nZambia, in green, won neutrals' hearts after reaching the Nations Cup final a year after the Gabon disaster\n\nIn April 1993, a plane carrying the Zambia squad to a World Cup qualifier in Senegal crashed off the coast of Gabon, killing all 30 passengers - including 18 of the country's best footballers.\n\nYet the greatest player in the country's history, Kalusha Bwalya, was not on the plane as he was making his own way to Dakar from Europe, where he played for PSV Eindhoven.\n\nThe 1988 African Footballer of the Year would lead an unlikely comeback as a young team went unbeaten in its remaining two Nations Cup qualifiers to reach the 1994 finals.\n\nOn Tunisian soil, a rebuilt side defied all the odds to reach Zambia's first final but they came unstuck against a Nigerian side containing Rashidi Yekini, Sunday Oliseh, Amuneke, Okocha and Daniel Amokachi.\n\nYet the way in which such a spirited Zambia team overcame incredible adversity to make their country proud was not forgotten by those who voted for the BBC award - nor by a grateful nation.\n\n1993 Frankie Fredericks\n\nFredericks won four Olympic silver medals during his career and remains Namibia's only Olympic medalist\n\nThe ever-popular Frankie Fredericks became the first athlete to win the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year award after becoming Namibia's first world champion, three years after the country achieved independence.\n\nCompeting at that year's World Championships in Stuttgart, Fredericks saw off Great Britain's John Regis and Carl Lewis to win in a then tournament record time of 19.85 seconds.\n\n1992 Ab\u00e9di Pel\u00e9 - Ghana and Marseille (France)\n\nGhanaian Abedi Pele (far right) won the Champions League with Marseille, beating Milan in the 1993 final\n\nAbedi Pele won the first BBC African Sports Star of the Year award in 1992 while playing for French club Marseille.\n\nHe was the heartbeat of the Ghana side that reached the 1992 Nations Cup final in Senegal, where they lost on penalties to Ivory Coast - with the Marseille man missing the decider through suspension.\n\nNonetheless, he was named the best player of the tournament after impressing with his penetrating play and unsurpassed tally of three goals.\n\nLater in the year, the Marseille star was celebrating once again as his French side recorded its fourth straight league title in succession.\n\nEven better was to follow as Pele, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli - all of whom had African roots - began a season that ended with Marseille's solitary Champions League title as they beat Milan in the 1993 final."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Watch: Alexander Zverev seals semi-final place with vital victory over America's John Isner", "description": "Watch the best shots from Alexander Zverev's win over John Isner at the ATP Finals in London, setting up a semi final showdown with Roger Federer.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/tennis/46239173", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:17:18Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Watch the best shots from Alexander Zverev's win over John Isner at the ATP Finals in London, setting up a semi final showdown with Roger Federer.\n\nREAD MORE: Zverev beats Isner to set up Federer semi-final"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Jadon Sancho: England star is Bundesliga player of the month for October", "description": "England and Borussia Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho, is named as the Bundesliga's player of the month for October.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46240105", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/14C41/production/_104375058_gettyimages-1058404866.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:14:11Z", "content": "The award is based on players' performance data and followed by a vote from fans and experts Jadon Sancho has been rewarded for his excellent start to the season by being named the Bundesliga's player of the month for October.

cyber kiosks to gather data from mobile devices has been delayed amid concerns the technology may be unlawful.\n\nThe force has invested thousands of pounds on the state-of-the-art devices, which can override passwords, and had planned to deploy them across the country from next month.\n\nBut experts claim the kiosks may contravene European law.\n\nWhat is a Cyber Kiosk?\n\nThe kiosk is a desktop personal computer designed and equipped with software solely for the examination of mobile data devices.\n\nThe technology was trialled in both Edinburgh and Stirling in 2016 using phones and SIM cards which had been legally seized by frontline officers.\n\nIn normal circumstances the devices would have been sent away to the nearest Cyber Digital Forensics team for analysis, a process that can take weeks\n\nThe trial did not collate the evidential value of the examinations as that was not in its remit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cyber criminals target individuals and businesses with elaborate online frauds\n\nAn advert for a similar portable device, manufactured by Cellebrite, states its purpose is to \"extract evidentiary data in a forensically sound manner\".\n\nThe technology allows officers to circumvent passwords or other security measures to access and extract data stored on mobile devices suspected of being used in cyber crime.\n\nThe commercial, which features a Hollywood-style voiceover, claims: \"Cellebrite makes digital data more accessible, more intelligent and more actionable than ever before.\n\n\"Wherever there is crime or terror we're there.\"\n\nWhy does Police Scotland need them?\n\nPhones now form a vital part of criminal investigations and forensic experts examine about 15,000 a year.\n\nThis is a labour intensive and time consuming process and it can take weeks to reunite people with their devices.\n\nSeized units will include those handed over voluntarily by victims and witnesses, as well as those obtained under the authority of a judicial warrant, statutory power or following a suspect's arrest.\n\nIn a submission to the justice sub-committee on policing Supt Nicola Burnett said the technology allowed officers to fast track investigations in the digital age.\n\nThe officer also said the kiosks allow evidence to be captured swiftly.\n\nShe concluded: \"It is imperative that Police Scotland embraces new technology to advance how we investigate crime and keep people safe.\"\n\nWhat do the critics say?\n\nSome experts fear giving officers the ability to bypass passwords on mobile phones to access data could be against the law.\n\nThe sub-committee heard significant concerns about the legal basis for the kiosks' use from both the Information Commissioner's Office and the Scottish Human Rights Commission.\n\nThey focused on the right to privacy, the type of personal data that can be accessed - such as biometric data - the legal basis for accessing it, and arrangements for data security.\n\nImage caption Clare Connelly, of the Faculty of Advocates, does not believe the technology complies with European law\n\nClare Connelly, of the Faculty of Advocates, does not believe the introduction of cyber kiosks is legally justified.\n\nShe said: \"We require an overview and a review of the laws around the search of all electronic devices and we need to make sure that that law matches modern technology and the conventions and privacy rights that individuals have.\n\n\"The proposed introduction of cyber kiosks has opened something of a Pandora's Box.\n\n\"The laws we have that govern search under statute were designed and passed at a time when the world was a very different world and storage of information was very different.\"\n\nMs Connelly said there real concerns over whether the gathering of data complies with Article Eight of the European Convention.\n\nShe also told BBC Scotland that while searches for cases involving child exploitation online involve scanning images stored on a device's memory, cyber kiosks can scan a \"much wider spectrum of information\".\n\nMs Connelly added: \"Therefore being able to curtail searches to make sure that the police only look at what they are looking for is extremely difficult.\"\n\nDavid Freeland, senior policy officer at the Information Commissioner's Office, told MSPs the legal basis was \"not sufficiently clear\".\n\nHe said: \"I'm not an expert in criminal law and we do need Police Scotland to spell out in this case what that is.\n\n\"Until that is there we can't be clear that it's lawful.\"\n\nHow has Police Scotland responded?\n\nDet Ch Supt Gerry McLean, the force's head of organised crime and counter terrorism, said the kiosks were an invaluable tool.\n\nHe said: \"What we are trying to do is give a better service to the public, to frontline officers and to the many people we come into contact with, day in and day out, when we are investigating crimes.\n\n\"We take their devices and it is some months before we are able to return them to them.\"\n\nMr McLean said the device can quickly establish if a phone is relevant to the matter under investigation.\n\nImage caption Det Ch Supt Gerry McLean said the technology is a valuable investigative tool\n\nAsked if it can bypass passwords, he replied: \"It has some capability to get past some of the security measures within smart phones but as technology changes that becomes limited.\"\n\nMr McLean said less than 10% of the smart phones examined by police are needed for the crimes under investigation\n\nOn the legality of the cyber kiosk devices, he said: \"We have a confidence and assurance about the legal basis.\n\n\"Those are laws that are usually conferred on us by a warrant issued by the court or on some statutory provisions on us.\n\n\"What that basically means is a law provided to the force through the Criminal Justice Act in Scotland that allows us to search people and seize items if they have been arrested for a crime.\"\n\nMr McLean said the policing landscape in Scotland was now \"very complex\" due to advances in technology.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nPolice Scotland had hoped to start using cyber kiosks next month but the force is now unable to put a timeline on the launch.\n\nThe Crown Office has yet to announce the legal position and the debate seems destined to run well into 2019.\n\nJohn Finnie, chairman of the justice sub-committee on policing, said it would now prepare a report for justice secretary Humza Yousaf based on the evidence it has heard\n\nHe confirmed the committee would also seek a response from Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone.\n\nImage caption John Finnie MSP will now write to the justice secretary and the chief constable\n\nAs it stands, Mr Finnie said: \"There is not a sound basis for Police Scotland to roll out this programme.\"\n\nHe also said the law must prevent the force examining phones \"simply on a fishing exercise\" and said lessons could be learned from the row surrounding stop-and-search.\n\nMr Finnie added: \"Everything suggests there should be a code of practice put in place in respect of this.\n\n\"Longer term we need to look at legislative changes because the technology that we all carry around in out pocket contains a wealth of information.\n\n\"The last thing anyone wants is any collateral intrusion.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "A watchdog finds it was acceptable for a police driver to knock

household name and it was a big promotion for him.\n\nBut he also described the 46-year-old as ultra-loyal, having never rebelled against the government.\n\nVicky Ford, a fellow Tory MP and a friend of Mr Barclay, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he is known for listening \"very, very hard and getting things done\".\n\nMr Barclay, who is said to be a close friend of Theresa May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell, is married and has two children.\n\nRead more\n\nMeanwhile, Amber Rudd has been named the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey, the second senior minister who

Then her boyfriend dumped her and her coach left his role.\n\nFor five months after February's Games, she thought it was, perhaps, the point to call time on her short-track speed skating career.\n\n\"I went through a period where I thought 'I hate it',\" she told BBC Radio 5 live's Friday Sports Panel. \"I didn't see the point in what I was doing.\"\n\nTriple world champion Christie was the poster girl for Team GB and had been tipped to win multiple medals in Pyeongchang. Instead, an ankle injury was her only token from a Games she will almost certainly want to forget.\n\nBut, nine months on, the 28-year-old is back on the ice - happier and stronger than ever.\n\n'I just don't know what I'm doing' - losing motivation\n\nThe Olympics hasn't been Christie's friend to date. Her Sochi 2014 campaign ended in three disqualifications, and four years later she fell in the 500m final and 1500m semi-finals - damaging ankle ligaments in the latter - and was disqualified from the 1,000m heats.\n\nShe had expected to return from South Korea an Olympic medallist - instead, she was left questioning what her future held.\n\n\"My ankle was so bad and I was still in pain from the other injuries I'd suffered last year, and I'd get on the ice every day and think 'I just don't know what I'm doing',\" Christie said.\n\n\"I didn't believe I could turn it around, my ankle was never going to get better - did I really want to go through another four years of this?\n\n\"It was really hard, and that didn't happen after Sochi, so I did find it really hard losing my motivation because I have never been like that.\"\n\nFeeling alone\n\nChristie posted an emotional tribute to her coach Nicky Gooch on Instagram\n\nIt hasn't been the easiest of years for Christie. After the disappointment of the Olympics, two big departures from her close circle left her feeling isolated.\n\nFirst, her boyfriend - Hungarian speed skater Shaolin Sandor Liu, who won his country's first-ever Winter Olympic gold medal in Pyeongchang - ended their relationship. By text message.\n\nThen, Nicky Gooch, Christie's coach and Lillehammer 1994 Olympic bronze medallist, was made redundant as a result of UK Sport funding cuts.\n\n\"The person I've always been closest to, who I've worked with for 12 years, was Nick my coach and he left,\" she said.\n\n\"I did feel very alone which didn't help, and that's why it probably took longer, but I have built new relationships now, I've worked with the sports psychologist, and without all that, I wouldn't have been able to get to where I have got right now.\n\n\"The final straw for me was the boyfriend, I lost my whole support network.\n\n\"You need that support, but a lot of it comes from yourself, you choose whether you're going to win or not based on the decisions you make and the way you approach things.\"\n\nSwitching focus\n\nWhile motivation mostly must come from within, Christie did receive some help along the way.\n\nDuring and following the Olympics, she received hundreds of messages of support - many of which were from children. And that, she says, gave her the boost she needed to continue.\n\n\"Children have this untainted view on life where they haven't been told to think a certain way and they have not been affected by the world yet,\" she said.\n\n\"They were all saying 'don't give up', 'you're my hero' and things like this, and for me, I didn't have a good enough reason to show them to give up.\n\n\"I just kept going everyday for that, and now, I'm back to a place where I can do it for myself again. I'm enjoying it, I'm happy and I'm getting stronger again, and so it has been worth it.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Christie returned to competition as part of the British mixed relay team at the opening World Cup event of the season.\n\nYet, while she didn't compete in the individual events in Calgary, Canada, she came home with a much clearer focus.\n\n\"I went to a competition and had all these younger skaters come up to me asking why I wasn't racing, telling me I was one of the best skaters in the world,\" she said.\n\n\"I thought to myself 'that is true' - it doesn't matter what happens every four years, I have got 10 World Championship medals, I'm a 10-time European champion, so I'm now focusing on what I have done, what I have succeeded in, rather than the one event that didn't go right.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Romford fire: Luxury car showroom blaze treated as 'suspicious'", "description": "Several vehicles, including two Land Rovers, a BMW and a Mercedes, were destroyed in the fire.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46238998", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:16:40Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Image copyright LFB Image caption A showroom and warehouse were destroyed in the blaze\n\nA huge fire which ripped through a luxury car dealership in east London is being treated as suspicious, the Met Police said.\n\nAround 125 firefighters spent almost nine hours tackling the fire at Imperials on the High Road, Chadwell Heath, on 3 November.\n\nSeveral vehicles, including two Land Rovers, a BMW and a Mercedes, were destroyed in the fire.\n\nNobody was injured but the showroom and a warehouse were \"completely damaged\".\n\nDue to the scale of the fire, which was first reported at 22:14 GMT, nearby properties were evacuated as a precaution.\n\nDet Sgt Andy McAlister said: \"It was sheer luck that officers came across it when they did before anyone in neighbouring residences was harmed.\"\n\nImage copyright LFB Image caption According to Imperials' website, it sells \"prestige\" cars such as BMWs, Land Rovers and Lamborghinis\n\nFirefighters worked through the night and brought the blaze under control by 07:20 the following morning.\n\nThe Met Police has been working with London Fire Brigade (LFB) investigators who say the cause of the fire is now being treated as suspicious."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Scotland v South Africa: Durability & discipline key, says Greig Laidlaw", "description": "Scotland must \"meet fire with fire\" against South Africa, while keeping cool heads, says captain Greig Laidlaw.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46240502", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/F449/production/_104373526_laidlaw.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:13:28Z", "content": "Greig Laidlaw kicked five conversions in last weekend's rout of Fiji at Murrayfield Autumn Test: Scotland v South Africa Venue: Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh Date: Saturday, 17 November Kick-off: 17:20 BST Coverage: Watch live on BBC Television, listen live \u2026 [+1733 chars]", "fulltext": "Greig Laidlaw kicked five conversions in last weekend's rout of Fiji at Murrayfield\n\nAutumn Test: Scotland v South Africa Venue: Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh Date: Saturday, 17 November Kick-off: 17:20 BST Coverage: Watch live on BBC Television, listen live on Radio Scotland & online; text commentary on BBC Sport website & app\n\nScotland must match South Africa's formidable power at Murrayfield on Saturday and keep cool heads, insists captain Greig Laidlaw.\n\nThe visitors came from behind to beat France last weekend following a narrow loss to England.\n\n\"Any time you meet South Africa, you have to meet fire with fire but we also need to hold discipline,\" Laidlaw said.\n\n\"We don't want to give them opportunities to kick to touch and get their driving game going.\"\n\nSouth Africa have won each of the past five meetings with the Scots, but Laidlaw's side have won nine of their last 10 matches at Murrayfield.\n\n\"I've been involved in some of those defeats and I know why we've been beaten,\" the scrum-half said.\n\n\"I've spoken about that with the players this week and we've done that really well as a team in the last few years.

But once handovers have happened, serious questions will remain about the pressure on the care market. Earlier this year, Allied blamed low fees from local authorities for some of their financial woes.\n\nCouncils themselves warn of a \u00a33.5 billion shortfall in funding for adult social care by 2025. And campaigners describe the care system as failing.\n\nThe government has promised a green paper on the long term funding of social care by the end of the year.

What does Brexit mean?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBrexit - short for \"British exit\" - is the process of the UK leaving the EU (European Union).\n\nThe EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work.\n\nThe UK had a referendum in June 2016 where it voted to leave the EU, which it's been part of for more than 40 years.\n\nBut the exit didn't happen straight away - it's happening on 29 March 2019.\n\n2. What is the Brexit deal?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish)\n\nAfter Brexit was voted for, negotiations started between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe negotiations are over the \"divorce\" deal. This is a withdrawal agreement which sets out how exactly we leave the EU - not what will happen after we leave.\n\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May presented that deal. Here are some key points:\n\nPayment: The UK will pay \u00a339bn to the EU to cover what it owes\n\nTransition period: Between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 nothing much changes to allow the UK and EU to strike a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust\n\nImmigration: EU citizens and their families can continue to move to the UK freely before 31 December 2020\n\nTrade: There won't be any changes to trade in the transition period\n\nNorthern Ireland: Neither the UK or the EU wants there to be a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (here's why). But in the deal, there's an agreement for a backstop.\n\n3. What is the backstop in Brexit?\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThis has been one of the biggest sticking points of the whole thing.\n\nNeither the UK or the EU want a visible or \"hard\" border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with guard posts and checks.\n\nSo they've agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - that's just another word for a deal to make sure a hard border never happens.\n\nIt would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\n\nThe backstop would only be introduced if a trade deal between the EU and the UK isn't sorted out during the transitional period.\n\nBut this bit is controversial. Some people say it means the UK would still be tied to EU rules while others don't like the idea of Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK.\n\n4. When will Parliament vote on the Brexit deal?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOn 25 November, the prime minister will try and get European leaders to officially back the deal.\n\nIf approved, she then has to take it to MPs for a vote in Parliament.

assuming the case proceeds - is how much power a president has in determining which reporters get to have, and keep, access to the White House.\n\nAn administration has discretion to limit the number of passes it gives out, but the balancing of executive power and press rights gets trickier when government officials try to take media credentials away.\n\nWhat did the judge say?\n\nJudge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by Mr Trump last year, said Mr Acosta's constitutional rights outweighed the White House's right to have an orderly news conference, the Washington Post reported.\n\nHe also criticised the Trump administration's decision, saying that the process was \"so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me... who made the decision\".\n\nHe also called Mrs Sanders' statement claiming that Mr Acosta had inappropriately touched an intern \"belated efforts [that] were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process\".\n\nBut in court documents, the White House argued that the decision was made in order to preserve White House decorum and it did not claim impropriety towards the intern.\n\nJudge Kelly added that the White House was required to restore his White House access, but is under no obligation to call on him during questions.\n\nA hearing on the case is scheduled for next week, but it is unclear if the White House will once again seek to strip Mr Acosta's access, or allow him to resume his work as CNN's chief White House correspondent.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nIn a statement, CNN said: \"We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days.\n\n\"Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\"\n\nMrs Sanders said the judge \"made clear that there is no absolute first amendment right to access the White House\" and that her office planned to \"temporarily reinstate the reporter's hard pass\".\n\nBen Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that the White House's attempts to silence Mr Acosta had backfired.\n\n\"The White House surely hoped that expelling a reporter would deter forceful questioning, but the court's ruling will have the opposite effect.\n\n\"The freedom of the press is a bedrock principle, and our democracy is strengthened when journalists challenge our leaders rather than defer to them.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Being young and transgender in a Scottish school", "description": "How LGBTI curriculum will help trans school pupils in Scotland", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-scotland-46240742/being-young-and-transgender-in-a-scottish-school", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/131ED/production/_104371387_p06s0d0m.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:45:35Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nAaron Gallagher, who identifies as a man, left school early after facing transphobic bullying.\n\nThe Scottish government has now pledged to include Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex people's stories in Scotland's curriculum.\n\nAaron gives his perspective on how these new measures will affect young trans people in schools."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Brexit: Can Theresa May get her deal through the Commons?", "description": "The Commons numbers are not looking good for Theresa May, writes the BBC's Peter Barnes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46239782", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0B0B/production/_104372820_brexit_voting_blocs_in_parliament_640-nc.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:42:46Z", "content": "The Brexit deal which has been negotiated by the UK and the EU is expected to be agreed at a special EU summit on 25 November.

It was a close first set which probably decided the match.\"\n\nZverev's time to arrive on the big stage?\n\nWith the 'big four' of Federer, Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray all in their 30s, Zverev has long been identified as the young player most likely to fill the void when they retire.\n\nThe 21-year-old is yet to make a meaningful impact in the Grand Slams but, after adding eight-time major champion Ivan Lendl to his team, has reached the last four at the O2 for the first time.\n\nNow, with Federer and possibly Djokovic standing in his way, back-to-back victories over the weekend would announce his arrival to a wider audience.\n\nAfter showing mental resilience to edge past Cilic in his opening match, Zverev knew any victory against Isner would guarantee his place in the last four, despite being outclassed by Djokovic in his second.\n\nAs with the Cilic match, he delivered on the big points against the American to win a match in which there was little between the two players.\n\nIsner out-served and knocked out\n\nZverev delivered an 143mph ace to wipe out a set point at 6-5 - the only break point of the first set - and went on to earn a hold which took the opener into a tie-break and ultimately proved pivotal.\n\nIsner knew he had to win to stay in the tournament, with a two-set victory his only hope of reaching the semi-finals, but mistimed a forehand into the net on Zverev's second set point.\n\nThe 6ft 10in American's game is unsurprisingly built around his massive serve but he was outgunned by Zverev, who had a faster serve speed, higher first-serve percentage and more aces.\n\nAnd, after Zverev took his first break point at 4-4 in the second, victory was quickly wrapped up with a hold to love and allowed him to start thinking about facing Federer.\n\n\"I'm unbelievably happy to be in the semi-finals,\" Zverev said. \"I've had such a good run over the last year.\n\n\"John was such a tough opponent and the last two matches could have gone either way for him.

Behind the doors, there are makeshift wardrobe rooms where costume ladies busily adjust outfits amid racks of bright clothes. Or you might find a room filled with rows of tightly-packed, brightly-lit mirrors where the stars will do their make-up and hair.\n\nImage caption Members of the wardrobe department work on the dancers' outfits\n\nImage caption What Tess Daly's dressing room lacks in glamour, it makes up for in historic charm\n\nSound equipment is stacked in one corridor, and piles of empty kit cases are in another. Hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly have the pick of the dressing rooms, but they are hardly grand (even if Claudia does have a grand piano stored in the corner of hers).\n\nDame Darcey Bussell seems to have drawn the short straw and is in one of the broom closets, which just about has room for a nice chair to give the illusion of luxury - but not much else.\n\nImage caption Faye Tozer and Giovanni Pernice during a break from rehearsals\n\nThe professionals must make do with shared dressing rooms - one for men, one for women - which will be cramped and hot come Saturday night.\n\nAnd the celebrities? They don't even have dressing rooms. Presumably the wardrobe rooms and corridors will suffice. Luckily they aren't precious.\n\nSteps star Faye Tozer says: \"In Elstree we've all got our own lovely modern dressing rooms and here it's a bit makeshift, but it brings everyone together. This is the entertainment biz - we've all changed in a toilet.\"\n\nBouncy dancefloor and the smell of history\n\nAnother big difference between Elstree and Blackpool is the Tower Ballroom's sprung dancefloor. Watching the group dance rehearsals, you can see it wobble.\n\n\"You feel a bit like, 'Ooh, my belly!'\" says Karen Clifton, who's partnering Casualty star Charles Venn. \"We're not used to having a bouncy floor in Elstree, but that's the beauty of Blackpool.\"\n\nImage caption The judges' outfits waiting on a rack in a corridor\n\nThe beauty of the Blackpool venue isn't confined to the floor.\n\n\"There's a lovely decadence to this place,\" says Venn. \"You can see it in the architecture and the building - it feels historic.\n\n\"The seats, the walls, the smell, everything feels like you're going back in time, and I love things like that myself. I feel like I'm walking into history.\"\n\nHow Strictly squeezes in\n\nAlthough the ballroom itself is larger than its Elstree studio, the service lifts are very small - meaning local crew members have to carry most of the equipment up the stairs - and it doesn't have the usual big back doors, so any large props used in the dances must be built in the ballroom itself.\n\nOn Friday morning, workmen were putting the finishing touches to platforms made to look like piano keyboards, which will be used in Joe Sugg's dance, and a big wooden fish and chip booth (Pashley's Plaice) was waiting in the wings.\n\nImage caption More sewing is done in the props area next to the dancefloor\n\nA fibreglass donkey was standing alone in a backstage corridor, and a giant stick of Blackpool rock lay on the ground behind the dancefloor - waiting, apparently, to be ridden by a celebrity.\n\n\"We have very small doors and we have very large props, so a lot of stuff has to be made in the ballroom because it doesn't fit through the doors,\" Jones says.\n\n\"The props are big because the ballroom's so big. Everything just gets enlarged when you come here.\"\n\nImage caption A corridor contains the show's sound equipment\n\nSome items are transported from Elstree, but the judges' desk and the plush booth where Claudia chats to the dancers are actually kept in Manchester, and are brought out of storage once a year for the Blackpool special.\n\nDespite the logistical headaches, Jones says it's worth it. \"We're so proud to come up and do our show from up here each year,\" she says. \"I personally love coming here, and I get goosebumps when I walk into that ballroom.\"\n\nYou might also like:\n\nWhat is Blackpool anyway?\n\nImage copyright Miramax/Kobal/Shutterstock Image caption A Blackpool ballroom was recreated for Jennifer Lopez's film Shall We Dance?\n\nIf you're not a ballroom dancing aficionado, you may not realise how big a deal Blackpool is as the traditional home of dancing competitions.\n\nIn the 2004 Hollywood film Shall We Dance?, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, one of the characters, Bobbie, says with awe that Lopez's character Paulina was a Blackpool finalist.\n\n\"What's Blackpool?\" asks one of the men.

There's now even a spin-off dance festival in Shanghai - still with Blackpool in its title.\n\nGiovanni Pernice says dancers around the world dream of coming to the resort. \"Everybody knows about Blackpool,\" he says.\n\nFellow pro Pasha Kovalev competed in Blackpool before joining Strictly. \"Blackpool is a Mecca for ballroom dancing,\" he says. \"Thousands and thousands of dancers come here every year.\n\n\"Every single dancer, every year I remember growing up - you wanted to get to Blackpool at some point in your life.

In the case of the British operation in Russia, it processes and transmits data to London where final decisions on visas are made.\n\nWhile working for the company in China, Vadim got married and when he was posted back to Moscow in late 2015 he encountered problems in getting his family back with him.\n\nHe believes that along with the harassment of other members of his family in Russia, this was part of a ploy by the Russian Security Service - the FSB - to try to get him to collaborate with them.\n\nIn April 2016 he said he was approached by someone who offered to make the problems go away. He was asked to co-operate with the FSB and signed a document indicating that. He says the individual said they wanted information on the operations and IT network of TLScontact including a \"network map\".\n\nVadim claims he complied with requests and soon after noticed intrusions into the IT system. Further meetings and requests followed. Vadim claims he then made a series of attempts to leave Russia but was stopped and warned.\n\nHe was also asked to report on visa applications of certain people of interest. He believes the access would have allowed the FSB to monitor the flow of information and analyse the patterns of successful applications in order to understand better how to secure visas as well as gather personal information of those applying.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHe says he was eventually asked to create an electronic \"backdoor\" allowing access to the visa centre network of the British consulate. He believes the type of access that the FSB was trying to engineer might allow them to potentially monitor details provided in Russia and intercept the details being transferred between Russia and the UK.\n\nVadim claims he got his family out of the country at this point and then left Moscow in September 2016 without carrying out the request. He travelled to the US and requested political asylum.\n\nHe says he tried contacting a public hotline for MI6 when he arrived in the US but never heard back. He also says he contacted a person in the British embassy in Moscow but with no response as was the case when he tried to contact TLScontact.\n\nIn March 2018, two operatives of Russian military intelligence (the GRU) are alleged by Britain to have come to the UK to poison Sergei Skripal with Novichok nerve agent.\n\nThey travelled on valid visas. There is no direct evidence linking their applications to any subversion of the visa system in Russia. Officials in the UK have suggested they received legitimate visas based on the false documentation including passports they provided and have played down any possibility that the system was subverted.\n\nVadim's claims do suggest there is a long standing interest in attempting to monitor, track and potentially subvert the process of issuing visas for individuals from Russia trying to come to the UK.\n\nIt is impossible to verify all of his claims but Western security sources say they are consistent with the behaviour and activity they would expect from the FSB.\n\nThe Bellingcat organisation - which has conducted numerous investigations of Russian activities - say they have seen further documentation which they say supports the story. The Home Office in London says that the ultimate decision for the issuing of a visa is in London and does not rest with the contractor."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Tom Hardy made a CBE by Prince Charles", "description": "The star of Venom and Mad Max: Fury Road is honoured for services to drama at Buckingham Palace.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46238743", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10F33/production/_104372496_hardy2_pa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:12:59Z", "content": "Image copyright PA Image caption Hardy became an ambassador for the Prince's Trust in 2010 Film star Tom Hardy has been made a CBE for services to drama by Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace.

For a UN representative to hold public meetings, to seek out their concerns, mattered.\n\nSome of the gatherings were packed - hundreds of people took the opportunity to be heard.\n\nWhat emerged for Philip Alston was an astounding disconnect between what he heard at those meetings, backed by other research he'd done, and the discussions he held with the ministers who oversee the very system causing such hardship for many people.\n\nSome will ask why the UN is looking at poverty in the UK - one of the world's richest nations. The answer, said Prof Alston, is that the government has supported these UN investigations in other countries, and couldn't therefore oppose the legitimacy of his visit here.\n\nThese harsh criticisms of the government's approach to the poor may not make their lives better immediately. But their daily struggles have appalled the UN, and in time, that might matter.\n\nThe approach to benefits was \"punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous\", Prof Alston said.\n\nHe gave the example of \"draconian sanctions\" which shut people out from the benefits system for weeks or months at a time, sometimes for minor infringements such as missing an appointment.\n\nMany of the \"harsh\" policies could be ended \"overnight\" at little cost, he claimed.\n\nThese included the delay of five to 12 weeks before Universal Credit was paid, the single household payments which give more leverage to controlling or violent partners, and the two-child limit for benefit claimants.\n\nProf Alston compared this limit to China's notorious one-child policy and said it was \"a perfect way to punish families\".\n\nWelfare changes have disproportionately affected women, especially single parents, he said.\n\n\"If you got a group of misogynists in a room, and said guys, how can we make this system work for men and not for women, they wouldn't have come up with too many other ideas than what's already in place.\"\n\nHe also warned that the poor would \"bear the brunt\" of the expected impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and said the fall in the value of the pound had already cost low-income families \u00a3400 a year.\n\n\"In my meetings with the government, it was clear to me that the impact of Brexit on people in poverty is an afterthought,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Jaywick, Essex, pictured in 2015, was one of the towns visited for the UN report\n\nProf Alston's report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva next year.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"We completely disagree with this analysis.\"\n\nShe said that household incomes have \"never been higher\", income inequality has fallen and there are one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010.\n\nIt is not the first time the UK has been criticised by UN special rapporteurs, who are independent human rights experts appointed for fact-finding and monitoring missions around the world.\n\nIn 2014, urban planning expert Raquel Rolnik said the \"bedroom tax\", which meant social housing tenants with spare rooms had to pay more rent or move somewhere smaller, undermined the right to adequate housing.\n\nOn that occasion, ministers said her report was a \"misleading Marxist diatribe\" and made an official complaint to the UN."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "William Goldman, Butch Cassidy screenwriter, dies at 87", "description": "The two-time Oscar-winner wrote All the President's Men, The Princess Bride and many other films.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46238747", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C3D9/production/_104373105_goldman1_getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:08:46Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images William Goldman, screenwriter of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men, has died aged 87.

The last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day.\n\nIf Mrs May loses she will continue to be prime minister until the leadership contest is over but she won't be allowed to take part in it.\n\nShe could opt to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister.\n\nIn either circumstance, her version of Brexit, as set out in the withdrawal agreement and future relationship document, would be in doubt.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something \"extraordinary\" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be.\n\nSebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor who currently holds the revolving EU presidency, told Die Presse: \"The next week will be intense, because of course it will be crucial if there is a majority for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister May. In any case, as the EU Presidency, we have made all the preparations to move forward swiftly.\"\n\nMPs reject the deal\n\nSo let's say she survives the attempts of her own colleagues to oust her and gets her deal signed off in Brussels - then there is the small matter of the \"meaningful vote\" promised to MPs.\n\nAs things stand, with dissent from her own backbenchers, anger from her partners in the DUP, and Labour and the rest of the opposition lined up to vote against it, the numbers do not add up to getting her withdrawal agreement through.\n\nThere is rumoured pressure for her to allow a free vote of all Conservative MPs - a highly unusual move which would involve suspending collective cabinet responsibility.\n\nHer predecessor David Cameron allowed his ministers to campaign for Leave or Remain as they saw fit during the referendum - but a vote in the Commons is a different matter.\n\nDowning Street has said there will be no free vote.\n\nAnd if the past three days are anything to go by, the PM will continue to hammer home her message that the public wants Parliament to \"get on with it\" and hope that is enough to win MPs over.\n\nShe will try to present MPs with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between her deal or no deal in the hope enough waverers will be frightened into backing her.\n\nLabour will be using every weapon in their Parliamentary armoury to ensure other options are put to the vote.\n\nIf MPs do reject the deal we are into full scale constitutional crisis territory. Britain would still be on course to leave the EU on 29 March - it's the law - but all sorts of possibilities come into play that could cause delays and renegotiations.\n\nAnother referendum\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt would be one way out of her bind if the deal is voted down, but the PM has repeatedly ruled out going back to the public to ask for their say on the deal, and her Leave-supporting critics feel the same way.\n\nProminent pro-Remainers from both sides of the House - including Tory Dominic Grieve and Labour's Chuka Umunna - alongside the Lib Dems and Greens and a growing public campaign for a \"people's vote\" think differently.\n\nBut unless Mrs May performs a shocking U-turn, or there is a new prime minister, it would be down to Parliamentary manouvering to get a vote on it, which might not pass, although Labour has not ruled out backing a referendum.\n\nTime is also running out to hold a campaign before Brexit day, so Article 50 might have to be extended, something Brussels might agree to, but a lot would depend on the proposed question on the ballot paper.\n\nGeneral election\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Would Theresa May risk another general election?\n\nThis is Labour's preferred outcome. It they win they would have to ask for an extension to Article 50 to give them a chance to go to Brussels and negotiate their version of Brexit.\n\nMrs May is unlikely to be keen on trying to get backing for another election, given her experiences last year, but in the current climate it feels like almost anything is possible."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'Loving mother' dies in Peterculter farmhouse fire", "description": "The 66-year-old woman died in the blaze in Peterculter, on the outskirts of Aberdeen.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-46239702", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/153C0/production/_104367968_peterculterfatal.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:48:52Z", "content": "Image copyright JASPERIMAGE A 66-year-old woman described as a \"loving mother\" has been named as the victim of a house fire on the outskirts of Aberdeen.

With almost 30 novels under her belt, she says his rules don't work for her.\n\nOther writers have come up with their own lists - sometimes tongue-in-cheek - to help would-be scribes.

Fiction that isn't an author's personal adventure into the frightening or the unknown isn't worth writing for anything but money. Never use the word then as a conjunction - we have and for this purpose. Substituting then is the lazy or tone-deaf writer's non-solution to the problem of too many ands on the page. Write in third person unless a really distinctive first-person voice offers itself irresistibly. When information becomes free and universally accessible, voluminous research for a novel is devalued along with it. The most purely autobiographical fiction requires pure invention. Nobody ever wrote a more autobiographical story than The Metamorphosis. You see more sitting still than chasing after. It's doubtful that anyone with an Internet connection at his workplace is writing good fiction. Interesting verbs are seldom very interesting. You have to love before you can be relentless.\n\nIn the week that a new book of his essays, The End of the End of the Earth, is published, Franzen has managed to get everyone talking about him on a medium he isn't even on.\n\nBut he's no stranger to controversy. When his book The Corrections was chosen to feature in Oprah Winfrey's book club, he derided her selection of his novel and was subsequently disinvited from appearing on her show.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Oprah Winfrey was derided by Franzen for choosing one of his novels for her book club\n\nHowever, Franzen's fans have defended his list.\n\nOne Twitter user wrote: \"There aren't plenty of writers as good as Franzen. And the ones I can think of... nope, mostly not on twitter. Or the internet at all\".\n\nAnd author Sandra Newman thinks much of what Franzen has to say in his tips are actually useful.\n\n\"I love making fun of writing advice. But I feel we should do it from a place of humility,\" she tweeted.\n\n\"We give advice because we care. That caring somehow tends to turn into self-importance. On examination, it's almost always vacuous. This isn't being Franzen. It's being human.\"\n\nBy UGC Hub & Social News"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Sturgeon urged to back 'good' Brexit deal", "description": "A senior UK government minister says Ms Sturgeon should \"listen to what Scottish business is saying\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46236769", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/139C7/production/_104372308_pa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:42:07Z", "content": "Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Lidington was speaking to journalists during a visit to Edinburgh A senior UK government minister has urged Nicola Sturgeon to \"listen to what Scottish business is saying\" and back the draft Brexit agreement.

It will give us clarity, certainty, we can plan, we can count on investment, we can decide upon jobs staying in Scotland.\n\n\"The way in which to put prosperity and jobs in Scotland at risk is to prolong the uncertainty rather than to take the ambitious, good, compromise deal that is on offer.\"\n\nScotland's external affairs minister, Fiona Hyslop, accused the UK government of \"blackmail\" over the draft agreement.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Lidington predicted the prime minister would \"decisively\" defeat any challenge to her leadership\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May was hit by a series of resignations on Thursday - most notably that of her Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab.\n\nMr Raab warned that the draft agreement represented a \"very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom\" because of the controversial \"backstop\" provisions that are designed to guarantee an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nIf a trade deal is struck in the future which gives the whole of the UK deep access to the EU single market - or if a technical solution is found to keep the border frictionless - the backstop would not be needed and Northern Ireland would be no different than Scotland or anywhere else in the UK.\n\nBut if it ever has to be activated it would give Northern Ireland better access to the EU's single market than Scotland or any other part of the UK.\n\nMs Sturgeon has claimed that this would give Northern Ireland a major competitive advantage by in effect allowing it to remain in the single market after Scotland and the rest of the UK leave.\n\nShe has said that the SNP's 35 MPs would oppose any agreement that does not include customs union and single market membership for Scotland, and has called on the UK government to \"return to the negotiating table\" to secure a better deal.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Sturgeon has pledged to oppose any Brexit deal that does not include single market and customs union membership\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell has faced calls to resign over the deal from his Scottish Conservative colleague Ross Thomson, who argued that \"no Unionist\" could support the backstop proposals as they would be a political gift to the SNP.\n\nBut Mr Lidington insisted that the deal \"defends the Union\" as it had prevented Northern Ireland being \"hived off\".\n\nHe added: \"I think it's an exaggerated fear. Neither the UK, nor the Irish Government, nor the EU 27 want the backstop ever to be used.

But away from the courtroom, some survivors of one of the 20th Century's greatest horrors are ambivalent about the tribunal's legacy, reports George Wright from Phnom Penh.\n\nLike many 60-year-old men in rural Cambodia, Srei Than can often be found relaxing and drinking beer with friends outside his home. But when he locks eyes with Soy Sen, who lives a short motorcycle ride away down a dusty lane, he quickly looks away.\n\n\"Whenever I see him, he walks away,\" Sen says.\n\nThere's good reason for this.\n\nIn 1974, when Sen was just 14, Khmer Rouge guerrillas took control of his hometown in Takeo province, to the south of the capital, Phnom Penh. It was a year before they would topple the US-backed government and unleash a four-year reign of terror across the country.\n\nSen was sent to Kraing Ta Chan prison by the radical communists. He believes it was down to his father being a local official in the district they had just captured.\n\nUpon entering the prison, Sen quickly realised the horrors that were unfolding there, including murder, torture and cannibalism.\n\n\"I was climbing a palm tree in the afternoon and from the top I could see two children being taken away,\" Sen told the tribunal in 2015.\n\n\"They usually waited for me to bring down the palm juice, but that day I heard\u2026 the sound of the cracking of children against a palm tree.\"\n\nOne of the most brutal guards at the prison was Than, better known by his alias \"Small Duch\". His namesake, a man known as Duch, ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture prison in Phnom Penh and was sentenced to life by the tribunal in 2012.\n\nHe recalls an event that has stuck in his mind ever since. One day, Sen says, Than ordered him to clear up an area after he had just committed a horrific attack on two female inmates.\n\n\"He was so cruel... he tortured me,\" Sen said on Friday. \"One day he raped two women with an M-79 missile by putting it inside them.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Cambodians pray for Khmer Rouge victims in Takeo province\n\nKraing Ta Chan was a prison focused on during the second trial of Khmer Rouge second-in-command Nuon Chea and head of state Khieu Samphan. Due to the defendants' old age, the litany of charges against them were split across sub-trials to ensure a verdict on some crimes could be reached.\n\nOn Friday, the pair were convicted of crimes against humanity and genocide. Both were given new life sentences to add to those they were already serving after the first trial, which concluded in 2014.\n\nSome victims' groups and the court's international backers speak of the importance of the tribunal in bringing leading Khmer Rouge to justice over the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians. But the tribunal has faced widespread criticism over government interference, the length of the trials and the fact only three people have been prosecuted in more than a decade.\n\nPrime Minister Hun Sen, himself a former Khmer Rouge commander, has been outspoken in his opposition to further trials of mid-ranking cadre, claiming it could result in a return to civil war.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan have been given multiple life sentences\n\nOne of the common frustrations among victims is the fact lower-level Khmer Rouge like Srei Than have never faced any kind of justice for the crimes they allegedly committed, with victims and perpetrators often living alongside each other.\n\nSpeaking just after seeing Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan sentenced, Sen - who was a civil party at the court and travelled to Phnom Penh for the verdict - was fairly apathetic about the decision.\n\n\"It's taken a long time. Now the verdict has come out but I'm not satisfied,\" he said. \"We do not see any compensation for the victims. They had already been sentenced to life once, what's the point?\n\n\"It's not going to heal the deep wounds they inflicted upon us.\"\n\nHowever, Sen did say that testifying at the court had released much of the anxiety he harboured regarding former Khmer Rouge still living near his home.\n\n\"Before, I felt scared for my safety but not anymore. Before, I did not dare to point fingers because of my worries but after the [tribunal], I have stopped worrying.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The court has a mixed legacy - it has convicted three Khmer Rouge officials in 12 years\n\nWhen I interviewed Than in 2014 about the heinous crimes he stands accused of committing at Kraing Ta Chan, he denied them point blank. When he appeared at the tribunal in 2015 - the only witness to require his face be blurred on camera due to the accusations against him - Than rejected Sen's claims that he was responsible for raping women and killing children. But he did appear to show signs of remorse.\n\n\"At that time, I was young and I do not remember\u2026 the activities or any bad things that happened,\" Than told the court. \"I don't remember everything and that's why I feel hopeless in myself.\"\n\nSen is in no doubt that he would have liked to see his former tormentors at Kraing Ta Chan face justice for the crimes they committed - including Than and another guard responsible for the murder of his father. However, this is a hope he gave up on a long time ago.\n\n\"We really want this but it's never going to happen.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Semi-final would cap brilliant year for England - Southgate", "description": "England are intent on reaching another semi-final to cap off a \"brilliant year\", says manager Gareth Southgate.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46234808", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/13DF4/production/_104369318_lingard-sancho-index.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:09:50Z", "content": "England have won nine of their 16 games in 2018 England are determined to reach another semi-final to top a \"brilliant year\", says manager Gareth Southgate.

but the hosts' onslaught in the closing stages was in vain.\n\nIt was a disappointing note on which to end Wales' inaugural Nations League campaign, which had started so promisingly with September's 4-1 demolition of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBut that result, as well as last month's 1-0 triumph in Dublin, was put in perspective by a second defeat against a thoroughly well drilled Danish side.\n\nGiggs' risk\n\nThis was the most important match yet of Giggs' burgeoning tenure, and his response was to name an extremely attacking, adventurous line-up.\n\nBale and Aaron Ramsey returned after missing last month's win in the Republic of Ireland, though Giggs still kept three of his fledgling attacking talents - David Brooks, Tyler Roberts and Tom Lawrence - in a side seemingly designed with defence a mere afterthought.\n\nIt was a risky approach, evident inside three minutes as Christian Eriksen - who scored both goals when Denmark beat Wales in September - was given too much space before firing a 20-yard shot narrowly over the bar.\n\nDenmark players congratulate with Nicolai Jorgensen after he scored his side's opening goal\n\nUndeterred by that warning sign, Wales began to wrestle control of the tie and poured forward in search of the opening goal.\n\nBale was the first to threaten with a curling effort saved by Schmeichel, before James Chester headed a glorious opportunity wide from Brooks' cross.\n\nBrooks was at the heart of almost every Welsh attack, reproducing his sparkling club form with Bournemouth as he glided across the pitch and looked to unpick the Danish defence.\n\nBut it was another forward surge from the hosts which led to their undoing.\n\nDenmark pinched possession near their own penalty area and broke at pace, Thomas Delaney then spread the ball to the right wing, where Yussuf Poulsen's perfectly weighted pass allowed Jorgensen to slot the ball between Wayne Hennessey's legs.\n\nThe second half followed a similar pattern to the first, with Wales the aggressors and creating more chances - only to fall foul to another sucker punch.\n\nThis time it was Middlesbrough's Braithwaite, allowing the ball to bounce before unleashing a swerving effort into the top corner to seal victory, despite Bale's swift response.\n\n\"I'm proud of the lads because they kept going to the end and excited me and excited the crowd,\" said Giggs.\n\n\"We need to learn the other side - the discipline that Denmark are so good at.\n\n\"I've enjoyed the Nations League. They've been good games. It's gone right to the last game for us where we could have won it.\"\n\nNations League proves its worth\n\nWales will now remain in the second tier of the Nations League, and this encounter illustrated the value of the new competition.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Wales didn\u2019t take chances - Giggs\n\nIt had initially caused confusion for those trying to decipher its structural intricacies, but the equation was a simple one for Wales on this occasion.\n\nWin and promotion to the top tier would be theirs, along with the guarantee of a play-off to qualify for Euro 2020, should they fail to reach the tournament during the regular qualifying process.\n\nLose, as was their fate, and it was Denmark who claimed those prizes.\n\nThis was the kind of high-stakes scenario Uefa had hoped for when European football's governing body devised the Nations League, which was designed in part to replace the many friendly matches in the international calendar - considered by many to be meaningless.\n\nThe rewards on offer made for a wholehearted encounter at Cardiff City Stadium, with both sides as committed as they would have been for a major tournament fixture.\n\nWhereas friendly matches of the past had little or no significance, Denmark's jubilant celebrations and Wales' dejection demonstrated how the Nations League has been a shot in the arm for international football.\n\nMan of the Match - David Brooks (Wales)\n\nEven in a losing cause, the elegant Bournemouth playmaker was the best player on the pitch, creating several chances for his team and himself\n\nWales v Denmark - the stats\n\nWales have now lost two of their last three competitive matches at the Cardiff City Stadium (W1); they had only suffered two defeats in their previous 14 such games at the ground prior to this.\n\nWales have lost back-to-back home games in all competitions for the first time since September 2012, when they lost three in succession.\n\nWales have conceded as many goals in their last four international games (eight) as they had in their previous 13 combined.\n\nGareth Bale has been directly involved in seven goals in his five appearances for Wales in 2018 (five goals, two assists).\n\nThere were just 84 seconds between Martin Braithwaite putting Denmark 2-0 ahead and Gareth Bale pulling one back for Wales.\n\nNicolai J\u00f8rgensen's goal

Theresa May really needs support in Parliament\n\nThe draft EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May is set to be signed off by European leaders at an emergency summit on 25 November.\n\nBut if Mrs May survives as PM she faces a battle to get MPs to back it in a House of Commons vote.\n\nMrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit deal, or even openly hostile to it.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against the deal, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it.\n\nThe vote is expected to take place around 7 December.\n\n2. There have been some key resignations\n\nTransport Minister Jo Johnson, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey - along with more junior ministers - have all resigned over the Brexit deal in the last week.\n\nThey followed a flurry of other resignations in July - among them ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis.\n\n3. May has lost a number of people quickly\n\nLooking back, Mrs May's tenure actually got off to a relatively strong and stable start.\n\nShe had no resignations in her first 475 days as prime minister, before Michael Fallon was forced to resign as defence secretary in November 2017.\n\nFormer prime minister David Cameron, by contrast, had David Laws leave his post as chief secretary to the Treasury over expenses claims after just 10 days.\n\nIn just over a year, however, Mrs May has lost eight ministers, taking her level with Mr Cameron in just half the time.\n\nThe only recent prime minister to come close to her rate of resignations is Gordon Brown, who lost five ministers in three days in June 2009 after a poor showing in local and European elections.\n\n4. Some departments are hit more by resignations\n\nSome departments appear more likely to experience resignations than others.\n\nOf the 32 cabinet ministers who have quit since 1997, six have been work and pensions: Andrew Smith and David Blunkett under Tony Blair, Peter Hain and James Purnell under Gordon Brown, Iain Duncan-Smith in David Cameron's cabinet, and Esther McVey under Mrs May.\n\nThere have already been two Brexit secretaries, despite it only being a Cabinet position since July 2016.\n\n5. The pound has been rocky\n\nIf you'd bought \u00a310 worth of dollars at the beginning of the day on Thursday, you'd have got $12.99 in return. By the end of the day it would have bought you $12.77 - a difference of 1.7%.\n\nThe resignations of Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and other more junior ministers appeared to have a bigger impact than those of Boris Johnson and David Davis over the summer.\n\n6. The Brexit vote had a bigger impact on the pound\n\nHowever, neither of the two rounds of resignations was as significant as Britain voting to leave back in June 2016, though - the pound dropped more than 10% between 21.40 BST and midnight.\n\n7. If May survives, there are still many hurdles to jump\n\nThe draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the EU, due to be signed off by European leaders next month, is just the beginning of the process of leaving.\n\nThe deal needs to be backed by UK Parliament, voted for by the European Parliament and approved by the EU Council before the UK can officially leave on 29 March 2019.\n\nHowever, the agreement is not a trade deal - details of that have yet to be hammered out. That is set to happen during the transition period, if all goes as planned.\n\nHowever, if Mrs May loses the vote in Parliament, the UK enters uncharted territory. The PM may seek to renegotiate with the EU, but most expect her time in Downing Street to end.\n\nThere could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nThis would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year.\n\nBut if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.\n\nUnless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister.\n\nBy Dominic Bailey, Tom Calver, Daniel Dunford, Mike Hills, Tom Housden, Daniele Palumbo, Lucy Rodgers, Sandra Rodriguez Chillida and Irene de la Torre Arenas."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Renault appoint Thierry Koskas as ultimate boss", "description": "Renault has appointed Thierry Koskas as the ultimate boss of its Formula 1 programme.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46237433", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/6B54/production/_104367472_thierrykoskasindex.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:48:34Z", "content": "Thierry Koskas (right) talking to Renault managing director and team principal Cyril Abiteboul.

That is the promise of a recent teacher recruitment drive.\n\nThe story of Dean Barker and Mark Wilson, the quiet success of England's autumn, is demonstrating that the promise has substance.\n\nWilson was rumbling around the football pitch as a burly 12-year-old when Barker, the head of PE at Kirkbie Kendal School in Cumbria, first suggested he may be more suited to the oval ball.\n\n\"The school was football dominated, all my mates had clubs around the area so there was a big emphasis on that,\" remembers Wilson.\n\n\"Mr Barker was mad into rugby though. I was quite a big lad in year seven, he put me down that route and invested his time in me.\"\n\nWilson had never picked up a rugby ball before. A late starter to the sport then, he has also been a late starter to the Test game.\n\nHe made his international debut at 27, getting a shot when England, depleted by the demands of the British and Irish Lions tour, toured Argentina in summer 2017.\n\nThis autumn, with coach Eddie Jones' options at number eight decimated, Wilson has made his second and third Test starts against South Africa and New Zealand respectively.\n\nFew had him picked as a possibility to step in. A pre-autumn BBC Sport vote named nine candidates who could step in at eight as a result of the absences of Billy Vunipola, Nathan Hughes and Sam Simmonds. Wilson was not one of them.\n\nThe four per cent knew... Wilson was not listed as one of England's number eight candidates in a BBC Sport vote in October\n\nBut his relentless industry and excellence has made him one of the strengths of England's autumn.\n\nIt has been what Wilson has been doing his entire career, living out Kirkbie Kendal's motto of 'care, courtesy, consideration' - as well as, crucially, hard work.\n\n\"I was never talented and Mr Barker would be the first one to say that. But he was always pushing me and never let me get into my comfort zone,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"I was playing football on a Sunday and going to play rugby after and I was burning myself out, which meant I was no good at anything.\n\n\"He said 'you've got to put all your eggs in one basket or you'll get nothing'. It was quite hard - all my mates were footballers - but I'm glad he told me to.\n\n\"I've always wanted to please him. I'm very grateful for what he's done for me.\"\n\nWilson's route into the England team has been very different to that of Vunipola, whose series of injuries has helped open the door for him.\n\nAfter Vunipola's rugby ability earned him a scholarship into a world of boaters and public school traditions at Harrow as a teenager, he made his Premiership debut while still in the sixth form.\n\nEngland's autumn Tests All matches at Twickenham 3 November Beat South Africa 12-11 10 November Lost to New Zealand 16-15 17 November Japan 24 November Australia\n\nHe represented England at various age-grades and, when his contract expired at Wasps at the age of 20, he was the subject of an intense bidding war that involved most of England's top clubs and was eventually won by Saracens.\n\nIn contrast, with few of his state school class-mates sharing his enthusiasm for rugby, Wilson relied on Newcastle's academy programme and Cumbria county rugby to develop his game.\n\nWhen he left school, it was without a contract. He started a university course, but during his second year was invited to first-team training with the Falcons. He has never left.\n\nDean Richards has been his coach there since 2012 and earlier this week Wilson - in his more accustomed role of flanker against Japan on Saturday - picked the brains of one of England's great back rowers over coffee.\n\nWilson (left) has adopted the low-slung socks that were a trademark of his Newcastle boss Dean Richards\n\n\"All through my career he has been making sure I brush up my skills as an eight so he's kept me on the straight and narrow with that,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"Dean Richards and forwards coach John Wells changed the whole culture of the place when they came in. They are winners at the end of the day. Dean hates losing.\n\n\"When I first started out Newcastle were guilty of being at the bottom and being happy with a win here or there. We celebrated massively when we got a victory.\n\n\"When he came in we had this whole culture change of when we won, we wanted to kick on again the following week. It's taken a few more years than he expected but his influence has been fantastic.\n\n\"It's why I wear my socks down, a homage to him.\"\n\nThat mentality was evident when Newcastle launched a relentless 39-phase injury-time attack to upset French big-spenders Montpellier in the Champions Cup in October.\n\nJones was at Kingston Park to watch the Falcons' key forward that day and, just as when Baxter spotted a pre-teen Wilson bustling around a football pitch, clearly saw something he liked.\n\n\"I've always liked the physical challenge in rugby,\" says Wilson. \"The feeling of being uncomfortable and backs-against-the-wall defending for your mates is the part I love the most.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Premiership: Saracens v Sale Sharks", "description": "Team news as Saracens host Sale Sharks in Saturday's Premiership fixture at Allianz Park (13:00 GMT).", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46199394", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/15370/production/_104369868_chriswyles2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:41:44Z", "content": "Chris Wyles has made 253 appearances for Saracens, and scored two tries as Sarries beat Exeter in the Premiership final in May Gallagher Premiership Venue: Allianz Park Date: Saturday, 17 November Kick-off: 13:00 GMT Coverage: BBC local radio and the BBC Spor\u2026 [+923 chars]", "fulltext": "Saracens have picked up a try-scoring bonus point in six of their seven Premiership games this season\n\nGallagher Premiership Saracens (21) 31 Tries: Rhodes, Lewington, Tompkins, Kpoku Cons: Spencer 4 Pen: Spencer Sale (13) 25 Try: McGuigan Con: Du Preez Pens: Du Preez 6\n\nSaracens needed a late try to beat Sale Sharks, as they continued their 100% start to the Premiership season and moved back to the top of the table.\n\nConverted tries from Mike Rhodes, Alex Lewington and Nick Tompkins put Sarries 21-6 up before Byron McGuigan replied.\n\nRob du Preez then kicked four penalties to put the Sharks four points ahead.\n\nBut Joel Kpoku's score edged Sarries back in front and, after Du Preez missed a kick to level the scores, Ben Spencer's penalty settled the match.\n\nDespite being shorn of several regular starters because of international commitments and injury - which prompted winger Chris Wyles to come out of retirement - Saracens seized control of the match during a five-minute period in the first half despite being down to 14 men.\n\nRugby Weekly Union podcast - listen and subscribe here\n\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.\n\nWill Skelton was sent to the sin-bin for a late tackle but, after South Africa international Du Preez's second penalty of the day had made it 7-6, Tompkins offloaded to allow Lewington to touch down in the corner and the centre then picked up Wyles' grubber kick to cross himself.\n\nSale, buoyed by McGuigan's score just before the break, dominated the majority of the second half to fight back and, with the north Londoners doggedly defending their try-line, scored 12 unanswered points through the boot of debutant Du Preez.\n\nBut Saracens managed to relieve the pressure and replacement lock Kpoku crossed with six minutes remaining following a driving maul from a line-out in the corner.\n\nSale had a chance to draw level three minutes later from another penalty but Du Preez missed a tough kick from wide on the left, meaning the visitors had to settle for a losing bonus point.\n\nVictory for Saracens extends their unbeaten run to 18 matches in all competitions and Mark McCall's side are now five points clear of Exeter Chiefs, who travel to Bristol Bears on Sunday (15:00 GMT).\n\nSaracens director of rugby Mark McCall:\n\n\"We're really chuffed with the character the team showed.\n\n\"We had a real mix of experienced players who have not played much and younger players who have not played at all.\n\n\"Everyone knows how many people aren't here on international duty or injured.

But the stability may not last, analysts said.\n\n\"As long as 'no deal' remains as likely as it is, there is a risk of a sterling depreciation spiral that is self-intensifying,\" said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, a foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank.\n\n\"Sterling volatility has woken up from its 100-year slumber and is likely to remain reactive.\"\n\nWhy does sterling fall on Brexit nerves?\n\nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pound was a barometer for the prospects of the UK economy.\n\n\"Every time we see a likelihood of a bad Brexit risk... the currency sells off,\" Mr Khalaf said.\n\nThe fall in the pound on Thursday which was the largest percentage fall in the currency since the vote to leave the EU in June 2016, when the pound slumped by 9.1% against the dollar.\n\nThat move was even greater than the slump on 21 October 2008, when the then governor of the Bank of England. Mervyn King, said the financial crisis meant the UK economy was heading into a recession.\n\nJames Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA Investment Management, told the BBC's Today programme that there were some \"interesting fundamentals\" affecting the pound at present.\n\nAmong them are the slower economic growth in the UK than the EU and the US, which means that interest rates in the UK may not rise as quickly as those in other parts of the world. This makes the pound less attractive to investors.\n\nWhat is happening to the stock market?\n\nThe FTSE 100 share index lost ground on Friday, ending 0.3% lower at 7,013.88, while the FTSE 250 - which is generally regarded as a closer barometer of the UK economy - also fell 0.4% to 18,589.09.\n\nMr Khalaf said the index of the biggest 100 companies on the stock market was protected from bigger falls by companies with large international operations.\n\n\"If you look at the headline performance of the market, the benchmark index, it hasn't really moved,\" said Mr Khalaf.\n\nFor instance, the biggest companies in the index, Shell and HSBC, both have large overseas operations that generate revenues in currencies such as dollars and euros which are worth more as the pound falls.\n\nWhat is happening to individual share prices?\n\nDuring Thursday, shares in companies that are heavily exposed to the UK economy saw the biggest falls, with housebuilders and banks being particularly hard hit. Royal Bank of Scotland fell over 3%, housing firms Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey fell over 2% and 1% respectively while Barratt Developments lost 0.5%.\n\nMr Khalaf calls such companies the \"Brexit beasts\" - ones which are more closely linked to the UK economy.\n\nHe gave the example of Lloyds Banking Group which was making a loss in 2011 and now makes billions of pounds of profits but is trading at a lower share price.\n\nRBS is also being knocked by the possibility that if there was a general election and the Labour party took power, the bank could be fully nationalised.\n\nWhat do businesses say?\n\nBig businesses have been generally supportive of the draft Brexit agreement published on Wednesday.\n\nThe CBI's Chairs' Committee - the body's most senior policy-making committee - said it represented \"hard-won progress\".\n\nIt said the agreement had two essential economic benefits which must be achieved: avoiding a no deal cliff edge by delivering transition, and opening a route to a good long-term trade deal.\n\n\"The real life implications for people and regions across the UK are what really matter. Business urges all involved to assess the way forward on this basis,\" it added in a statement.\n\nEarlier, Warren East, chief executive of engineering company Rolls-Royce, told the Today programme that time was running out and that any deal was better than leaving the EU without an agreement.\n\n\"I would, as a business leader, like to see politicians on both sides of the fence get on and negotiate a practical deal that works for business,\" he said.\n\nEyes are on businesses such as Rolls-Royce, which operate a \"just-in time\" model where parts arrive in the UK from across the EU as they are needed.\n\nThe head of the Co-operative Group has warned that availability of fresh food from both the UK and abroad could be hit by a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSteve Murrells told BBC Radio 5 live that stockpiling was not an option as \"there is not enough chilled capacity to do it\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Scotland v South Africa: Springboks good enough to win World Cup - Alan Solomons", "description": "South Africa have \"every prospect\" of winning next year's World Cup, says former Edinburgh coach Alan Solomons.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46235365", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/13552/production/_104368197_roux.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:26:55Z", "content": "Imposing South Africa hooker Malcolm Marx was a try-scorer in September's win in New Zealand Autumn Test: Scotland v South Africa Venue: Murrayfield Date: Saturday, 17 November Kick-off: 17:20 BST Coverage: Watch live on BBC Television, listen live on Radio S\u2026 [+1840 chars]", "fulltext": "Imposing South Africa hooker Malcolm Marx was a try-scorer in September's win in New Zealand\n\nAutumn Test: Scotland v South Africa Venue: Murrayfield Date: Saturday, 17 November Kick-off: 17:20 BST Coverage: Watch live on BBC Television, listen live on Radio Scotland & online; text commentary on BBC Sport website & app\n\nSouth Africa have \"every prospect\" of winning next year's World Cup, according to former assistant coach Alan Solomons.\n\nRassie Erasmus's side take on Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday following a win in France and a loss to England.\n\nIn September, they beat Australia at home and won away to New Zealand for the first time since 2009.\n\n\"This is a side that is well prepared and coached to their strengths,\" Solomons told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"South Africa have certain key men right through the spine of the team.

Play begins on Saturday 15 minutes earlier at 04:15 GMT.\n\nA special innings\n\nBefore the series, Root called on his side to be \"bolder\" and more \"courageous\" on the subcontinent and exemplified the merits of that positive approach in a truly outstanding knock, one of the best of his career.\n\nHe used his feet well and demonstrated fine shot selection - sweeping and reverse sweeping only full or wide deliveries and not getting into trouble with pre-meditated strokes that proved the undoing of others.\n\nEven after Ben Stokes, who moved down to five to allow Root to bat at four, fell for a duck, the captain stuck to his convictions, putting on 74 in just 83 balls with Buttler.\n\nThe game was still in the balance once Buttler and Moeen Ali (10) were dismissed to leave the tourists six down and 173 ahead, but Root firmly pushed it England's way, rotating the strike and hitting two towering sixes to help his side add 128 runs in the afternoon session.\n\nResuming on 98 after tea, Root reached three figures with perhaps the streakiest shot of his innings, edging through third man for four before ripping off his helmet and yelling in delight to celebrate only his second hundred this year.\n\nHe carried on in the same fashion, surpassing Nasser Hussain's previous mark of 109 for the highest score by an England captain in Sri Lanka, before missing a ball that straightened with a slightly tired stroke to be trapped plumb in front.\n\nIf you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote.\n\nLive by the sweep, die by the sweep\n\nJos Buttler found the reverse sweep to be both productive and his undoing\n\nThis was the most obvious day of Root's tenure as captain that England looked like his team, playing the way he wants and incorporating the calculated risk that has made the one-day international side so successful.\n\nAs always such a positive approach comes down to execution. Get it wrong and it looks reckless. Get it right, as Root did, and you can confound the opposition into making mistakes.\n\nAfter Leach was out lbw on review to Dilruwan Perera for just one, Burns and Jennings batted superbly to quickly erase the 46-run first-innings deficit, Burns proving especially adept at judging length to attack the spinners.\n\nIt forced Sri Lanka to become more defensive, with stand-in captain Suranga Lakmal reluctant to put more than two fielders in close around the bat - something Root, Buttler and Foakes took advantage of later on - while the hosts were also only able to bowl two maidens all day.\n\nEngland were far from flawless. Jennings swept at one that was too short and edged the ball off his body to first slip, while Buttler similarly tried to reverse sweep a delivery that Akila cannily sent down much slower and shorter than the previous ball and undercut it onto his stumps.\n\nBurns and Stokes simply missed deliveries that straightened, but then wasted England's two reviews on clear lbw decisions, when Moeen and Adil Rashid could have used them later to be reprieved for being hit outside the line and an inside edge respectively.\n\nHowever, England's boldness has paid off overall.\n\nFine Foakes impresses again\n\nBen Foakes has a Test average of 71, admittedly after just four innings\n\nFoakes showed there was another way to play on this pitch though, generally standing more upright and going back to work the ball square on both sides, albeit also hitting a mighty six over mid-wicket to pass 50.\n\nSpeaking on The Cricket Social, ex-England all-rounder Zafar Ansari said his former Surrey team-mate had remodelled his technique after watching Australia's Steve Smith during last year's Ashes series.\n\nAfter his fine century on debut in Galle, this has been another confident knock from the 25-year-old, staying calm even when Akila dismissed Root and Sam Curran in consecutive balls to help England add 23 more vital runs before bad light intervened, shortly followed by heavy rain.\n\nTogether with his superior ability behind the stumps to Buttler and Jonny Bairstow, Foakes is putting himself in the reckoning to be England's long-term Test wicketkeeper.\n\n'England will win from here' - analysis\n\nSimon Hughes, the Analyst, on The Cricket Social: \"England are going to win. I can't see Sri Lanka getting more than 200.\n\n\"I think England's spinners will have learned from today and I don't think Sri Lanka will sweep as well.\"\n\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew in Pallekele: \"It really has been a remarkable day's cricket.\n\n\"You would fancy it will end tomorrow one way or another. Having started the day backing Sri Lanka, I am switching my odds around as England should have enough on the board now.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/16 11:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31lt9xp1", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Award for wartime flight trainer returned to service", "description": "Tens of thousands of pilots trained in a tiny, mechanical flight simulator which has been restored.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46222826", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/261C/production/_104365790_mediaitem104365787.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:01:29Z", "content": "Image copyright Techworks Image caption The GAT-1 gave trainee pilots a sense of how to control and fly a plane A project to restore early flight simulators has won an award for the best computer conservation project.

Every year, millions of pilgrims including tribal communities, Muslims and Christians, undertake a rigorous 41-day fast and embark on a barefoot pilgrimage to the temple which located in the dense forests of the Western Ghats.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sabarimala is dedicated to the deity Ayyappa in the form of an eternal celibate in penance\n\nThe temple is dedicated to the deity Ayappa in the form of an eternal celibate in penance. Therefore, traditionally only men, very young girls or post-menopausal women enter the temple.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a five judge bench of India's Supreme Court struck down the restriction on women of \"menstruating ages\". The four male judges delivered a majority verdict on the grounds of gender discrimination and because it wasn't an \"essential practice\" of the denomination.\n\nIndu Malhotra, the only woman judge on the bench, disagreed with the majority verdict.\n\n\"Issues of deep religious sentiments should not be ordinarily interfered by the court... Notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion,\" she said in her dissenting opinion.\n\nObserving that women's right to worship Lord Ayappa was not violated as there are a thousand other Ayappa temples without restrictions on women. Justice Malhotra added the court must not interfere unless approached by an aggrieved person from the denomination.\n\nObjections notwithstanding, the verdict was widely celebrated as a progressive step by an activist judiciary in ensuring women's \"right of worship\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Many of the protesters against women entering the temple are women themselves\n\nThen, something unexpected happened.\n\nIn town after town in Kerala, tens of thousands of women hit the streets protesting against the verdict. This spread across India with marches in Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and internationally in the UK, US and Canada.\n\nSensing the pulse, India's leading Hindu nationalist organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), who were initially in favour of the judgement, did a flip-flop and were eager to be seen supporting the protests.\n\nThe main opposition Congress party also joined the bandwagon. Consequently, multiple party-led protest marches and some incendiary statements followed.\n\nImposing a liberation\n\nKerala is not a place where women are voiceless. It has historically been a matrilineal society where women have controlled and inherited property for centuries. The state has the highest literacy rate in India and its social indicators are comparable to developed countries.\n\nThe protesting women feel that no one cared to understand their worldview. They feel that those with privilege and a voice are imposing a \"liberation\" that these women do not seek.\n\n\"The authorities misread the situation by looking at this issue through a colonial prism,\" says Anjali George, who pioneered a social media campaign in favour of the temple's ban on women.\n\n\"This has effectively contributed to a situation where people are losing faith in the ability of the system to protect their religious rights and traditions.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hinduism comprises a diverse set of cultural practices and traditions\n\nHinduism is an umbrella term for a staggeringly diverse set of cultural practices, traditions and systems of worship.\n\nWhile the celibate Lord Ayappa at Sabarimala does not see women devotees of a certain age, the same deity is worshipped in a married form in other temples by both women and men.\n\nAnd it's not only women who are barred from some temples.\n\nThe Kamakhya Temple in the northeastern state of Assam bars men from entering during the auspicious time when the goddess menstruates.\n\nCreating artificial homogeneity\n\nHardly a dozen among the few millions of temples in India have gender-based entry restrictions.

It makes a massive problem for Alex McLeish. Who will play right-back?\n\nCallum Paterson has played there, but not for a long time, or will he revert to a back three and have James Forrest play right wing-back? That's what I'm thinking now.\n\nShould he have called up another right-back? I think he should have. We are now left with a void in that area.

Dates: 9-24 November Coverage: Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary and in-play video highlights on all games on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and via the BBC Sport website & app; live text commentary on all England & Ireland games, plus selected other matches\n\nWhen former South Africa captain AB de Villiers used his autobiography to dispel widely-circulated myths about his childhood sporting prowess, it disappointed one or two.\n\nThat was not because tales of his brilliance at practically every sport were false - but because it revealed a cricketing genius to be, well, human.\n\nYes, he could hit 31-ball centuries in international cricket, but he wasn't playing golf off scratch. Nor did he hold South African national records in swimming and athletics.\n\nBut delve a little deeper into South African cricket and you might just find a person of unimaginable talent.\n\nOne who is an international sportswoman. One who has the academic world at her feet. And one who can both write and sing songs with the apparent talent of a chart-topping artist.\n\nLaura Wolvaardt, who will line up against England in the Women's World T20 on Friday, really is a little bit special.\n\nThe cricketer: A debut at 16 & breaking through on the global stage\n\nWolvaardt, an opening batter, was just 16 when she made her debut for South Africa against England in February 2016.\n\nIn only her second match, she scored her first international half-century, against a bowling attack that, 17 months later, led England to World Cup glory.\n\n\"In many ways, it was a good thing I made my debut at 16 because you don't really realise what is at stake,\" recalls Wolvaardt, now 19.\n\n\"I was, though, pretty nervous. My feet were not moving properly and I wasn't singing the anthem very nicely.\n\n\"The World Cup, a year later, helped me to settle in - that was a great experience.\"\n\nIn that World Cup, Wolvaardt shot to prominence. Having warmed up for the competition with a run-a-ball 149 against Ireland, she averaged 65 in her side's run to the semi-finals in England.\n\nOnly three international players scored more runs than her in the 2017 season, and all three were from India, who played five extra matches over the same period.\n\nThe student: A career in medicine or international cricket?\n\nWolvaardt continues to plunder runs and has almost 500 of them in the 50-over game in 2018.\n\nDespite having a lean time of it in the first two matches of the World T20 - she is yet to reach double figures - Wolvaardt remains a real threat to England's hopes of securing a semi-final place in today's decisive meeting.\n\n\"Batting is just my favourite thing to do; it's my hobby,\" said Wolvaardt. \"Whenever I'm busy with exams or something and I have an hour off, I go and bat because that's what I like to do for fun.\n\n\"I train at a place really close to my house and I just give the coach a call and then we hit a few balls to relieve some stress.\"\n\nBut what happens when batting - and playing for your country - gets in the way of academic progress?\n\nWolvaardt graduated from high school - Parklands College in Cape Town - with seven distinctions out of seven.\n\nShe is enrolled in a six-year medicine degree at Stellenbosch University and knows juggling her studies with top-level sport is difficult, and might eventually prove impossible.\n\nNot too long ago - perhaps even when Wolvaardt made her debut - the choice would have been a no-brainer: playing women's cricket in South Africa didn't pay the bills into adulthood.\n\nHowever, it is a sign of the ever-increasing popularity and professionalism in the women's game that such a decision is becoming harder to make.\n\n\"A few years ago it was always medicine, because that's the stable career path and traditional decision,\" said Wolvaardt, who is midway through a gap year in which she has concentrated solely on her cricket.\n\n\"In the last few years, cricket has presented me with some really great opportunities and the amount that it has grown in the last two years has been amazing.\n\n\"It really helps my decision to know that women's cricket actually has a really big future now. It's getting harder and harder to decide.\"\n\nThe singer/songwriter: 'Shades of Katie Melua'\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Laura Wolvaardt performs 'Fall in love again' in a school musical production\n\nThe Women's World T20 is being held in the West Indies and there will be one particular piece of luggage accompanying Wolvaardt around the Caribbean islands of St Lucia and, if they reach the final four, Antigua: a ukulele.\n\nWolvaardt is a keen singer and songwriter. Her voice is so good that her old school still hosts a music video in which she stars on their Youtube channel, with vocals that are Katie Melua-like in their delivery.\n\n\"I think there are a few music videos on there that my school posted in grade nine,\" said Wolvaardt. \"I can't take them off and it's really embarrassing.\n\n\"I enjoy playing a guitar and I sing a little so I enjoy making my own music at home but it hasn't been getting the attention it deserves lately.\n\n\"It's nothing serious though. I'm a person who goes for the safe options. I doubt I would go and get my own studio somewhere and take a big risk like recording an album.\"\n\nThe person: 'Academically astute but socially awkward'\n\nWith so much natural talent in so many different areas, it would be easy for Wolvaardt to lose focus.\n\nThat, however, doesn't appear to be a problem, according to South Africa's media relations officer Sipokazi Sokanyile.\n\n\"Like all brilliant people who are academically astute, she's a bit socially awkward,\" says Sokanyile.\n\n\"I would probably describe her as being like the quintessential California surfer girl. Home to her is right on the beach.\n\n\"It's difficult to get to the heart of her because she's very humble and doesn't really like to blow her own horn.\n\n\"She prefers to get to know other people. You find when you're interviewing her, she'll ask you questions instead.\n\n\"She's obsessed with cricket and, in particular, batting. She has to be dragged out of the nets, to the point where she gets really upset.\n\n\"She does, however, hate practising her fielding, which is surprising because she's brilliant at it. She's taken some brilliant catchers and made some incredible stops in the field.\n\n\"She's almost like Jonty Rhodes in the field.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Albania v Scotland: Alex McLeish confident of right-back solution", "description": "Scotland boss Alex McLeish says he has a plan to cope with having no natural right-back in his squad to face Albania in the Nations League.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46223859", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/17DB3/production/_104351779_15087150.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T07:27:03Z", "content": "Callum Paterson and Kieran Tierney are two options at right-back in Albania Nations League League C, Group 1: Albania v Scotland Venue: Loro Borici Stadium, Shkoder Date: Saturday, 17 November Kick-off: 19:45 GMT Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland; live t\u2026 [+2502 chars]", "fulltext": "Callum Paterson, left, and Kieran Tierney are two options at right-back in Albania\n\nNations League League C, Group 1: Albania v Scotland Venue: Loro Borici Stadium, Shkoder Date: Saturday, 17 November Kick-off: 19:45 GMT Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland; live text commentary on BBC Sport website\n\nScotland head coach Alex McLeish is \"confident\" with his plan to cope with the lack of a natural right-back in his squad against Albania in Shkoder.\n\nKilmarnock's Stephen O'Donnell and Ryan Jack of Rangers - who can both play the role - are among eight players to have withdrawn from the Nations League game.\n\nMcLeish was speaking ahead of the withdrawal of Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney, who has played on the right.\n\n\"We have the players to cope, but we'll keep that close to our chest,\" he said.\n\nCallum Paterson has played right-back for Hearts but has been in scoring form in a forward role for Premier League side Cardiff City.\n\nHe could, therefore, be pressed into service in attack for Scotland in the absence of Hearts' on-loan Norwich City man Steven Naismith and Celtic's Leigh Griffiths.\n\n\"There's no doubting Callum's versatile and has a chance in different positions,\" McLeish said. \"His form's been great for Cardiff and, wherever Neil Warnock's used him, he's been effective for them.\"\n\nMcLeish suggested that, when he tried Paterson in a forward role against Mexico in the summer, his players had \"kept throwing in short crosses instead of hanging them up for him\".\n\n\"When he's playing for Cardiff, he's playing to a particular strength,\" he stressed.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device McLeish looks 'far and beyond' for Scotland talent\n\nMcLeish will also have to rethink his central midfield, with Aston Villa's John McGinn having joined Fulham's Kevin McDonald in withdrawing from the squad.\n\nCallum McGregor has been used in a deeper role in recent games for Celtic in the absence of former Scotland captain Scott Brown and McLeish thinks he could do the same for the national team.\n\n\"He's the type of player that can play anywhere in the midfield - wide or in the central areas,\" he said. \"It's not gone unnoticed where he's been playing.\"\n\nMcLeish's side head to Albania looking to recover from a loss to Israel - and a friendly defeat by Portugal - that leaves Scotland and Saturday's hosts three points behind group leaders Israel, who travel to Hampden for Tuesday's final game.\n\nThe head coach said he had thrown the floor open to the players at a squad meeting to suggest ways of improving the side.\n\n\"They're young guys, they don't have all the answers - I'm 59 and I still don't have all the answers,\" McLeish said. \"But we try and learn and keep all that information inside your head going forward and use that experience as best we can.\n\n\"We have two really big games ahead of us.

But the US has also made it clear that there will be no sanctions relief until \"complete denuclearisation\".\n\nTalks appear to have stalled since then, and discussions aimed at setting up a second summit between both leaders failed to materialise.\n\nLast week Mr Kim's aide, Kim Yong-chol, was supposed to travel to New York and meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nBut the BBC understands that the meeting was cancelled after the State Department discovered that the North Koreans did not get on the plane as planned.\n\nHowever, the US still maintains that another summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump will take place early next year."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "California wildfires: Number of missing leaps to 600", "description": "Seven more bodies have also been found in northern California, taking the state-wide death toll to 66.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46230927", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06rx3ty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T03:23:10Z", "content": "Media caption Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise The number of people missing in northern California's devastating wildfire has leapt to more than 600, and seven more bodies have been found, according to local authori\u2026 [+218 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise\n\nThe number of people missing in northern California's devastating wildfire has leapt to more than 600, and seven more bodies have been found, according to local authorities.\n\nThe missing persons' list has doubled since earlier on Thursday.\n\nThe Camp Fire, the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze, has killed at least 63 people.

Some of the pages have more than 150,000 followers.\n\nEach post is being shared with the same photo - what appears to be a line of young women wearing blue uniforms, each carrying a baby.\n\nThere are no links to sources or published articles.\n\nThe use of the photo has led to confusion and outrage among social media users. One wrote: \"What a shame is this? What are the reasons to this outcome? What is wrong with our moral standards?\"\n\nOthers have doubted whether it is true, and they are right to be sceptical.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Government figures suggest in Kenya the teenage pregnancy rate has been falling\n\nThe photograph first appeared in an online CNN article and it is not of mothers at a school in Kenya.\n\nCNN has confirmed to Reality Check that the photograph was taken in Tanzania of young women walking children to a day care centre.\n\nThis same photo has been attached to a range of posts, all making similar claims about pregnancy in Kenyan schools.\n\nSome posts claimed 19 out of 30 girls in the class were breastfeeding. Others said it was 21 out of 30 girls.\n\nWe also looked into the school frequently named in the posts and found that Chabera Mixed Secondary, Nyanza does not exist.\n\nWe asked a local reporter for the BBC to go to the area to check, and although there is a secondary school in Chabera, it has a different name and there was no evidence to support the claims.\n\nFacts about teenage pregnancy\n\nThe recent debate in Kenya about the rates of teenage pregnancy has been clouded by social media posts such as these.\n\nBut there is widespread concern about the issue.\n\n\"Teenage pregnancy is not a new phenomenon in Kenya,\" says Elizabeth Muiruri, of Save the Children. \"However, the recent media coverage of several girls who delivered during the three days of primary exams that transitions them to high school has been alarming.\"\n\nThe BBC has interviewed schoolteachers and education and health officials in Kisumu county and neighbouring areas in the western region. They expressed concern at what they said was a rise in the number of teenage pregnancies, including girls under the age of 15.\n\nThey cited the causes as high levels of poverty, a lack of sex education and gender inequality.\n\nBetween July 2016 and June 2017, the Kenyan ministry of health recorded almost 350,000 pregnancies among young women aged between 15 and 19.\n\nThis counts pregnant women who go to health facilities for pre-natal and ante-natal care, so does not capture those who do not seek help at a hospital, which means the overall figure could be significantly higher.\n\nAnd, according to the last Kenyan government health survey conducted in 2014, 18% of women aged between 15 and 19 were mothers or pregnant with their first child.\n\nBut to compare teenage pregnancy over time and across countries, the United Nations uses rates per 1,000.\n\nAccording to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which uses Kenyan health survey data, the rate for births among women aged 15 to 19 was 96 per 1,000 women in 2014.\n\nBut this data also clearly shows a significant falling trend in pregnancy rates, from a high of 153 per 1,000 in 1989 - a drop of one-third.\n\nThis can be attributed to sex education in schools, better awareness of contraceptives and improved prosecution of perpetrators, says Fredrick Okwayo, an adviser at the UN Population Fund.\n\nHowever the absolute number of girls involved is still \"huge\" and \"in some cases this leads to the affected girls to miss their opportunities in life\".\n\nHow does Kenya compare?\n\nSome other African countries, including Nigeria and Tanzania, have higher rates, according to data compiled by the World Bank, while South Africa has a lower rate. All have shown significant declines over the past 30 years.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence to suggest increasing teenage pregnancy rates in Kenya, and levels comparable with other African countries, there is no doubt that the issue is of great concern to many in Kenya and has prompted government action.\n\nThe next government health survey aims to determine the extent of the problem in more detail and whether the most recent claims of a rise in pregnancies is borne out.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Greenpeace activist has 'no regrets' over New Zealand protest", "description": "Sara Howell swam in the path of the world's largest oil exploration vessel - but ended up in court.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46222685", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06rx2ry.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:52:02Z", "content": "Media caption Sara Howell said she felt empowered after facing off with a 21,000 tonne ship A climate activist arrested for swimming in front of the world's largest oil exploration ship during a Greenpeace protest has \"no regrets\".

Most of the Vietnamese community were deported, and the 20,000 who remained were all killed.\n\nWhy is the genocide verdict significant?\n\nThe Khmer Rouge's crimes have long been referred to as the \"Cambodian genocide\", but academics and journalists have debated for years as to whether what they did amounts to that crime.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Cambodia has become known for \"the killing fields\", a reference to the scale of slaughter that took place there\n\nThe UN Convention on Genocide speaks of \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\".\n\nSo prosecutors at the tribunal tried to prove that the Khmer Rouge specifically tried to do that to these groups - something some experts, including Pol Pot biographer Philip Short, say they did not.\n\nDuring the trial, a 1978 speech from Pol Pot was cited in which he said that there was \"not one seed\" of Vietnamese to be found in Cambodia. And historians say that indeed a community of a few hundred thousand was reduced to zero by deportations or killings.\n\nApart from being targeted in mass executions, Cham victims have said they were banned from following their religion and forced to eat pork under the regime.\n\nThe verdict today may not end the debate completely, but victims groups have long waited for this symbol of justice.\n\n\"They brought suffering to my relatives\" 72-year-old Cham Muslim Los Sat, who lost many family members, told the AFP news agency at the court. \" I am really satisfied with the sentences.\"\n\nWho were the Khmer Rouge?\n\nLed by Saloth Sar, better known as Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge was a radical Maoist movement founded by French-educated intellectuals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Pol Pot (left) had a vision of Cambodia as a classless agrarian utopia\n\nThey sought to create a self-reliant, agrarian society: cities were emptied and residents forced to work on rural co-operatives. Many were worked to death while others starved as the economy imploded.\n\nDuring the four violent years they were in power from 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge tortured and killed all those perceived to be enemies - intellectuals, minorities, former government officials - and their families.\n\nThe scale and brutality of the killings - many of them meticulously documented by officials - means the regime remains one of the bloodiest of the 20th Century.\n\nThe regime was defeated in a Vietnamese invasion in 1979. Pol Pot fled and remained free until 1997 - he died under house arrest a year later.\n\nWhy is this tribunal controversial?\n\nThis could be the final decision of the tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC).\n\nEstablished in 2006 with both Cambodian and international judges, it has so far only convicted three people for the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime at a cost of $300m (\u00a3232m).\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption I survived Khmer Rouge torture prison\n\nIn 2010 it convicted Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Duch, who was in charge of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre and prison in Phnom Penh.

Some supermarkets are encouraging customers to bring their own containers.\n\nMorrisons and Tesco offer shoppers the option to have raw meat and fish weighed at the counter which can then be placed into their own containers. Tesco is also trialling in-store recycling machines which will pay customers for every plastic bottle returned.\n\nIn September, Lidl announced it would no longer be using black plastic for its fruit and veg range. Black plastic can't be easily scanned by recycling machines, which makes the process complicated.\n\nIt's not just the major retailers doing their bit. Local stores like The Clean Kilo supermarket in Digbeth, Birmingham class themselves as \"zero-waste supermarkets\".\n\nImage copyright The Clean Kilo Image caption The Clean Kilo supermarket allows customers to fill up their own containers\n\nShoppers bring in their own containers, which could be \"an old margarine tub or an old washing up liquid bottle\" says co-founder Tom Pell.\n\nContainers can be filled with products like pasta, cereals, rice and crisps. Your shopping is weighed and customers are charged accordingly.\n\nTom says shoppers should try to choose items with recyclable packaging.\n\n\"Quite often you'll get biscuits that are individually wrapped and have another big wrapper around them and then come in a multi-pack. It's those situations where it's almost ridiculous,\" he tells Newsbeat.\n\nDo you need a receipt?\n\nMany shops are no longer automatically tearing off a receipt at the till. Now, you're often asked if you actually need a receipt.\n\nProof of purchase is obviously necessary for those panic buys during lunch breaks that need to be returned.\n\nBut lots of high street stores now give the option to have a receipt emailed instead of a printed one.\n\nSome stores do still automatically roll out extra long receipts or multiple receipts including offers and vouchers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do you really need a printed receipt?\n\nIt's a lot of paper, which often goes to waste and some of it is not recyclable.\n\nThermal receipts are the ones on shiny paper which is coated with a substance called bisphenol A (BPA) or alternatively BPS.\n\nBoth substances have been banned from other plastic products because they can be harmful when ingested in large amounts. Thermal receipts end up in the bin because they can't be recycled.\n\nHow far has your food travelled?\n\nFood miles is the distance food has travelled to get to your plate. The further food has travelled, the greater the impact on the environment.\n\nThis is because of the pollution from carbon dioxide emissions, which comes from the vehicles transporting the food.\n\nBuying food from stores which stock products from local farmers can keep your food mileage down.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do you know where your oranges have travelled from?\n\nShould you stay or should you go?\n\nOne way to cut down the mileage when you're shopping, is to stay indoors. Online shopping eliminates car trips and carbon emissions by using one delivery van for multiple shoppers. But....\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Add items to shopping basket, add more items, choose free delivery, click checkout\n\n....anyone who's ordered clothes online will know, many parcels arrive as a plastic bag.\n\nInside, each item is usually individually wrapped in another plastic bag. The package will also contain a large, often A4, paper receipt with various thermal labels. You've probably noticed there'll also be other papers thrown in - promotional flyers, offers, samples, etc.\n\nGreen is the new black\n\nInstead of buying new clothes, think about second hand options and recycling your unwanted outfits.\n\nFashion bloggers and influencers are all over our timelines wearing a new outfit for every post #outfitoftheday. That's a lot of clothes, but where do they end up?\n\n\"At the moment in the UK, 50 trailers of clothes go to the UK landfill every single day. We're talking a vast amount,\" says Jack Ostrowski, the founder and CEO of the reGAIN app.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption #outfitoftheday #instafashion #lookoftheday\n\nWith the reGAIN app, you can recycle unwanted clothes in exchange for discounts for many different retailers.\n\nThere are lots of other apps which fashion bloggers use to sell their second hand clothes, like Depop and Poshmark.\n\nMany councils also have information about your local textile bank to recycle clothes.\n\nJack Ostrowski told Newsbeat the aim is to create a circular fashion shopping habit - \"so people can buy but then actually find a way of recycling. Rather than throwing clothes into the bin they can either be reused or recycled or upcycled\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042\n\nTheresa May has made a 25-year plan to protect the environment. \"In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls,\" she said.\n\nThe Prime Minister has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Wimpy Kid author: I can't get my kids off Fortnite", "description": "Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid has made him one of the world's most successful children's authors.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46197139", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1100D/production/_104354696_kinney.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:19:00Z", "content": "Image caption Jeff Kinney has written 13 books in the series, sold in 140 countries He's one of the world's most successful children's authors - selling 200 million copies of his Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and meeting three US presidents along the way.

Books are seen very much as a treasured object.\"\n\n'Another seven books'\n\nKinney came up with the idea for his Wimpy Kid books in 1998, taking eight years to show it to a publisher.\n\nBut now, two decades on, he believes he has another seven books in the series still in him.\n\n\"I am aiming to write 20 - that's my hope,\" he says, adding that it's made easier by his choice to freeze his characters in time.\n\n\"I realised around book five,\" he says, \"that these are cartoon characters, so they don't have to age.\n\n\"People don't want cartoon characters to change. Bart Simpson has been around for 25 years - and still going strong.\"\n\nImage caption Kinney owns a book shop as well as writing the Wimpy Kid series\n\nKinney juggles writing with the day-to-day running of a book shop in Plainville, Massachusetts, where he lives.\n\nHe says he decided to open it because the town \"needed a facelift\".\n\nIt's since been visited by top authors such as David Walliams - whose work he says he admires.\n\nKinney is also working to develop the Wimpy Kid books into an animated series.\n\n\"I have written two episodes so far,\" he says. \"I am trying to get at the truth of childhood and to make it as deep as it can be considering it's a cartoon TV show.\"\n\nAnd there perhaps lies the key to his books' success.\n\n\"The root of it all is childhood experiences,\" he says, overjoyed that his work is read across the globe.\n\n\"We have a lot more in common country to country than we might think. We share the same childhood in many ways all over the world.\n\n\"It's really excited me over the past few years, that kids in Turkey, China and New Zealand all see something in my books.\"\n\nThis has then fed back into his work.\n\n\"In the past, when I first started writing the series, I would have told a Thanksgiving story or a Christmas story,\" he says, \"but they aren't inclusive so I try to avoid that now - perhaps make it a birthday one instead.\"\n\nImage copyright L\u2019OSSERVATORE ROMANO Image caption Kinney says the image of Pope Francis reading his book is one of his favourite photos\n\nKinney himself is Catholic, and says he was left \"stunned\" after being sent a photo of the Pope holding one of his books after it had been translated into Latin.\n\n\"I love that photo,\" he says, saying such moments - alongside meeting US Presidents Barack Obama and George Bush - are \"weirdly out of joint\" with family life in small-town America, where he continues in his fruitless attempts to reduce his children's use of technology.\n\n\"It's common sense when they have been on their screens too much - you can tell when it's too much,\" he says.\n\n\"But banning is a problem for kids because of the social side of things - imagine if you knew your friends were talking and you were missing out? That's hard.\"\n\nHe may be losing the battle with his own children but at least he can rest assured that his Wimpy Kid series is keeping other parents' kids from reaching for their phones and tablets - and perhaps sparking a love of reading that they can carry into adulthood.\n\nFollow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Flybe loss 'would be catastrophic' for Cardiff Airport", "description": "The airline's 14 destinations are \"crucial\" to increasing passenger numbers at Cardiff Airport.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46225146", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D147/production/_97957535_flybe175.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:18:32Z", "content": "Image copyright Flybe Image caption Flybe officials said in 2017 that Cardiff Airport was \"central\" to its five year growth plan Losing Flybe from Cardiff Airport would be \"catastrophic\", it is claimed, with ministers urged to safeguard routes.

This month marks the anniversary of the first intake in the 1860s and the riot that the reaction to their studies caused a year later.\n\nSophia Jex-Blake led the women's education charge in Britain, but faced opposition to her aspirations from an early age.\n\nJex-Blake wanted to be a doctor in a time when it was unthinkable for a woman to be one. She wanted to change that and eventually, she did.\n\nBorn in Hastings, she was privately educated and was initially stopped from attending college by her parents.\n\nBut determined to pursue her education, a life campaigning for women's rights was apparently destined.\n\nAfter a period of study in Edinburgh, Jex-Blake travelled to the US in 1865 to learn more about women's education.\n\nHere she met Dr Lucy Sewell, an activist for health and social reform, and resident physician at the New England hospital for women. This meeting, alongside time spent as an assistant at the hospital inspired Jex-Blake to chase her dream of being a doctor.\n\nThe fight was just starting.\n\nShe was refused entry to Harvard on gender grounds, a rejection letter read: \"There is no provision for the education of women in any department of this university.\"\n\nResolute, her American quest for education continued, but she was forced to return to England following the death of her father.\n\nWith bleak prospects for women's education at home, Jex-Blake looked north to Scotland, where a more enlightened view on education was percolating.\n\nIn March 1869 after much internal strain, Edinburgh University approved Jex-Blake's application, but it was eventually rejected by the university court on the grounds the university could not make the necessary arrangements \"in the interest of one lady\".\n\nImage copyright Google\n\nUndeterred by her latest setback, a campaign carried in The Scotsman newspaper called on more women to join her. The story gathered attention and more women joined her cause, pushing to study medicine in Edinburgh.\n\nThey became known as the Edinburgh seven.\n\nIn November 1869, the women passed the matriculation exam and were admitted to the university medical school.\n\nThe university charged them higher fees and the women, led by Jex-Blake were forced to arrange lectures for themselves due to a loophole whereby university staff were permitted but not required to teach women. This was just the start of the problems they would face.\n\nSurgeon's Hall riot\n\nJo Spiller, of Edinburgh University, believes it was a tense time at the university.\n\n\"The institution was very divided. The votes on whether to continue with the women students were very close and there are some archival diaries of students who were really horrified about how the women were being treated,\" she said.\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday 18th November 1870, we walked to the Surgeon's Hall, where the anatomy examination was to be held. As soon as we reached the Surgeon's Hall we saw a dense mob filling up the road\u2026 The crowd was sufficient to stop all the traffic for an hour. We walked up to the gates, which remained open until we came within a yard of them, when they were slammed in our faces by a number of young men Sophia Jex-Blake\n\nLittle more than a year later - tension would turn hostile with the Surgeon's Hall riot on 18 November 1870.\n\nA mob of more than 200 people pelted the women with mud and rubbish as they made their way to sit an anatomy exam. The abuse was unwavering until a supporter hurriedly unbolted a door to get them inside.\n\nFollowing the incident, Jex-Blake wrote: \"On the afternoon of Friday 18th November 1870, we walked to the Surgeon's Hall, where the anatomy examination was to be held.

There was a lot of support but as the weeks and months went on and the women did very well, there started to be a growing opposition to them - a very powerful opposition.\"\n\nAs students sat the exam, the mob shoved a sheep into the hall, causing chaos.\n\nIt is said the professor in charge of the exam remarked: \"The sheep can stay, it is clearly more intelligent than those out there.\"\n\nThe fracas would become known as the Surgeon's Hall riot and it was the beginning of the end of this chapter of educational equality.\n\nImage copyright Spillerjzy (CC)\n\nNewspaper coverage swayed public opinion in favour of the women, but at the university discrimination grew, they were denied access to wards and blocked from graduating with degrees.\n\n\"Edinburgh became the focus of a national debate - especially after the Surgeon's Hall riot - that became pivotal. Ultimately, it was too much for the university to handle,\" according to Ms Spiller.\n\n\"They struggled on and got all the teaching they needed, but they just couldn't get the university to let them sit the exams they needed. They just ran out of options.\"\n\nFocus on legislation\n\nKnocked down by the status quo once again, Jex-Blake was undeterred and continued to force change.\n\nThe battleground was shifted to London where she continued to campaign, and in 1874, Jex-Blake played an important role in setting up the London School of Medicine for Women.\n\nAccording to Ms Spiller: \"The momentum gained over those four years in Edinburgh became unstoppable.\"\n\nAided by Jex-Blake's efforts, the Medical Act followed soon after, allowing the medical licensing of all people, regardless of gender.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Malala Yousafzai continues to fight for female educational rights having survived a Taliban assassination attempt as a 15 year-old\n\nJex-Blake finally received her degree when she was awarded an MD in Berne, Switzerland. Many of the Edinburgh seven were forced to Europe to pursue their studies.\n\nTaking advantage of new legislation, she returned to the British Isles and sat exams with the College of Physicians in Dublin, and became one of Britain's first female doctors.\n\nEventually Jex-Blake returned to Edinburgh - becoming Scotland's first practising female doctor.

So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass).\n\nYou may also like:\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Women's World Twenty20 highlights: New Zealand beat Pakistan by 54 runs", "description": "Two-time finalists New Zealand record their first Group B victory with a 54-run win over Pakistan to end a seven-game losing run in the T20 format.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/cricket/46231264", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:29:25Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Two-time finalists New Zealand record their first Group B victory with a 54-run win over Pakistan to end a seven-game losing run in the T20 format.\n\nWATCH MORE: World T20 - Wigs, dance moves & a 'team hat-trick'\n\nAvailable to UK users only."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Flu vaccine delays for over-65s 'resolved by weekend'", "description": "Patients and GPs have been frustrated by shortages caused by the staggered supply of the new vaccine.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46226393", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A2DF/production/_104359614_m7150525-flu_vaccine-spl.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:28:48Z", "content": "Image copyright Science Photo Library GPs and patients frustrated by a shortage of the new flu vaccine for over-65s are being told the final delivery batch will arrive by Saturday.

Just tell me one thing, he asked. Should it be wide enough for tanks to roll down, like ours?\n\nThere are lots of these sorts of anecdotes about Chinese investment going round Port Moresby these days, and this dark joke points to some of the anxieties here as Beijing's influence grows.\n\nRising investment\n\nDriving around Port Moresby ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, my local guide points out all the projects the Chinese have helped to build for the event. Roads, venues - even the bus stops have been built with Chinese money.\n\nThe impoverished nation is hosting the meeting that brings together world and business leaders, with trade talks high on the agenda.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinping arrived on Thursday for a state visit ahead of the summit.\n\nBut China's interest here isn't new.\n\nIn the last decade the scale of Chinese aid and investment across the Pacific has increased substantially, as the Lowy Institute's recent studies show.\n\nAccording to the institute's Pacific Aid Map, China's aid spend in Papua New Guinea (PNG) totalled $20.83m (\u00a315.99m) in 2016. A year later it was three times that amount.\n\nLet's put this in context.\n\nAustralia still spends far more in Papua New Guinea than China does - 70% of the country's aid comes from its former colonial ruler.\n\nPapua New Guinea is the poorest member of Apec and around 40% of the population live on less than $1 a day, according to the UN.\n\nLocals tell me that Australia has historically invested in areas like education and providing training for better governance.\n\nChina meanwhile is investing in areas that Papua New Guinea says it desperately needs right now: infrastructure.\n\n\"China has built us roads, bridges, and they'll continue doing that,\" executive director of the Papua New Guinea Business Council Douveri Henao tells me.\n\n\"And it's not just in PNG. The ambition is right across the Pacific.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A bus stop donated by China in downtown Port Moresby\n\nIt's all part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, a multi-billion dollar programme aimed at connecting China to the rest of the world through trade and investment.\n\nIt's President Xi Jinping's baby - but that same Chinese ambition is what's thought to be behind Australia's commitment of a $1bn Pacific fund last week to invest in infrastructure and counter China's growing influence here.\n\nAlso, critics of China's aid and investment policy in Papua New Guinea tell me that often the problem with Chinese money here is that there's no transparency in how the funds are disbursed and who they go to.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Apec: The summit held on a boat off Papua New Guinea\n\nPart of the problem is the lack of governance and high levels of corruption within Papua New Guinea itself. But the other issue is that Beijing often spends the cash first - and asks questions later.\n\nThis often leads to unnecessary and wasteful projects, when the money could have been used for other more pressing needs in the country like healthcare.\n\nAid becomes political\n\nThere are economic and diplomatic reasons why Beijing is investing in the Pacific.\n\nPapua New Guinea for instance is home to many natural resources including rare earth minerals, and the Pacific Island nations are home to a third of the world's supporters of Taiwan - something analysts say China would like to influence.\n\nBut it's China's longer term strategic ambitions that are raising the biggest questions.\n\n\"What you're seeing now is the geopoliticisation of aid,\" Jonathan Pryke, of the Lowy Institute told me.\n\n\"The big fear of countries like Australia and the US is that Beijing's end game is to set up a permanent military base somewhere in the Pacific in the next twenty to thirty years. That's why you've seen Washington and Canberra react the way that they have to increasing Chinese influence in the Pacific.\"\n\nPapua New Guinea sits a few thousand kilometres from Guam, a US base.\n\nA recent report from the US Department of Defense on China's military power highlights how it is entirely plausible that the Chinese army will want to \"extend its operations beyond the first island chain, demonstrating the capability to strike US and allied forces and military bases in the western Pacific Ocean, including Guam.\"\n\nMost analysts, including the Lowy Institute's Mr Pryke, don't actually believe this will happen.\n\nBut it's enough of a threat to convince the Americans and the Australians to pay far more attention to the Pacific.\n\nThat is why it won't just be China splashing the cash at Papua New Guinea this week. The US, Australia and Japan are all likely to come bearing gifts for the Pacific island nation when they visit Port Moresby for Apec.\n\nPapua New Guinea is now the latest battleground in the tussle for economic and political influence between China and the West."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "How 'miniature suns' could provide cheap, clean energy", "description": "Is much-heralded nuclear fusion finally ready to fulfil its promise of abundant energy for all?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46219656", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D97B/production/_104357655_gettyimages-520222808.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:07:48Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Our sun is a huge nuclear fusion reactor.

Can we mimic its energy-making process on earth?\n\nWe're just five years away from harnessing almost unlimited power from \"miniature suns\", some start-ups say: nuclear fusion reactors that could provide abundant, cheap and clean energy.\n\nIn a world of global warming caused by our addiction to fossil fuels, there is an urgent need to find sustainable alternative sources of energy.\n\nIf we don't, the future looks decidedly bleak for millions of people on this planet: water and food shortages leading to famine and war.\n\nNuclear fusion has long been heralded as a potential answer to our prayers. But it's always been \"thirty years away\", according to the industry joke.\n\nNow several start-ups are saying they can make fusion a commercial reality much sooner.\n\nWhat is nuclear fusion exactly?\n\nNuclear fusion is the merging of atomic nuclei to release masses of energy and it has the potential to address our energy crisis.\n\nIt's the same process that powers the sun, and it's clean and - relatively - safe. There are no emissions.\n\nBut forcing these nuclei - deuterium and tritium, both forms of hydrogen - to fuse together under immense pressure takes huge amounts of energy - more than we've managed to get out so far.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Nuclear fusion produces huge amounts of energy, but it's difficult to achieve and control\n\nReaching \"energy gain\", the point at which we get out more energy than we put in, has been tantalisingly elusive.\n\nNot any more, fusion start-ups say.\n\n\"This is the 'SpaceX moment' for fusion,\" says Christofer Mowry, chief executive of General Fusion, a Canadian company aiming to demonstrate fusion on a commercial scale within the next five years.\n\n\"It's the moment when the maturation of fusion science is combined with the emergence of 21st Century enabling technologies like additive manufacturing and high-temperature superconductors.\n\n\"Fusion is no longer '30 years away',\" he maintains.\n\nImage copyright TOKAMAK ENERGY Image caption Plasma glow inside Tokamak Energy's latest nuclear fusion reactor\n\nThe science behind the idea has been proven, says Wade Allison, emeritus professor of physics at Keble College, Oxford. The challenge is more practical.\n\n\"The timescale we can't be sure about, but the basic science is solved and the problems are technical ones to do with materials,\" says Prof Allison.\n\nWhy is it so difficult?\n\nA major challenge is how to build a structure strong enough to contain the plasma - the very high-temperature nuclear soup in which the fusion reactions take place - under the huge pressures required.\n\nExhaust systems will \"have to withstand levels of heat and power akin to those experienced by a spaceship re-entering orbit,\" says Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA),\n\nRobotic maintenance systems will also be needed, as well as systems for breeding, recovering and storing the fuel.\n\n\"UKAEA is looking into all these issues, and is building new research facilities at Culham Science Centre near Oxford to work with industry to develop solutions,\" says Prof Chapman.\n\nSo what's changed?\n\nSome private energy firms reckon they are surmounting these practical challenges faster through the use of new materials and technologies.\n\nOxfordshire-based Tokamak Energy is working on spherical tokamaks or reactors that use high temperature superconductors (HTS) to contain the plasma in a very strong magnetic field.\n\nImage copyright TOKAMAK ENERGY Image caption Tokamak Energy is trying to build cheaper, more compact fusion reactors\n\n\"High temperature\" in the context of this branch of physics means a distinctly chilly -70C or below.\n\n\"They've been by far the most successful to date,\" says Jonathan Carling, the firm's chief executive.\n\n\"A spherical tokamak is a much more efficient topography, and we can drastically improve the compactness and the efficiency. And because it's smaller, it can be more flexible, and the cost to build is also lower,\" he says.\n\nThe company has built three tokamaks so far, with the third, ST40, built from 30mm (1.2in) stainless steel and using HTS magnets. This June it achieved plasma temperatures of more than 15 million C - hotter than the core of the sun.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nThe firm hopes to be hitting 100 million C by next summer - a feat Chinese scientists claim to have achieved this month.\n\n\"We expect to have energy gain capability by 2022 and be supplying energy to the grid by 2030,\" says Mr Carling.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] is working with the newly-formed Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) to develop Sparc, a doughnut-shaped tokamak with magnetic fields holding the hot plasma in place.\n\nFunded in part by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a fund led by Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, the team hopes to develop fusion reactors small enough to be built in factories and shipped for assembly on site.\n\nThese private ventures are challenging Iter [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], the flagship international fusion project involving 35 countries.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Iter nuclear fusion reactor will not be completed until 2025\n\nIter, which also means \"the way\" in Latin, is building the biggest experimental fusion facility in the world, but it doesn't expect to fire up until 2025, and any commercial application will come a long way after that.\n\n\"Different Iter members have different levels of urgency for using fusion as part of a clean energy future,\" a spokesman tells the BBC.\n\n\"Some clearly expect to have fusion electricity to the grid before 2050; for others the roadmap is in the second half of this century.\"\n\nThe new kids on the block think they can do better.\n\n\"With the new HTS magnet technology, a net-energy fusion device can be much, much smaller - Sparc would be about one sixty-fourth the volume and mass of Iter,\" says Martin Greenwald, deputy director of MIT's plasma science and fusion centre.\n\nSmaller size means lower costs, leaving the fusion field open to \"smaller, more agile organisations\", says Mr Greenwald.\n\nBut all parties seem to agree that the work of Iter, Culham and the private sector is complementary.\n\n\"In the end, we all share the same dream of fusion-powered electricity as a core part of a clean energy future,\" says the Iter spokesman."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/16 00:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31lt8lgm", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'How Amazon helped me transition to a woman'", "description": "Sophie Roberts is a software developer at the tech giant who came out at work in October.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46153007", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3C54/production/_104244451_sophie-twov-photo1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:04:49Z", "content": "Image copyright Sophie Roberts \"I knew from a young age that I wasn't the same as the other children,\" says Sophie Roberts, a 34-year-old Amazon software developer based in Edinburgh. \"I realised at around 14 or 15 that I was transgender but I wasn't comforta\u2026 [+4517 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Sophie Roberts\n\n\"I knew from a young age that I wasn't the same as the other children,\" says Sophie Roberts, a 34-year-old Amazon software manager based in Edinburgh.\n\n\"I realised at around 14 or 15 that I was transgender but I wasn't comfortable at that point in my life in being out about it.\"\n\nIt was 20 years later that she took the decision to come out at work.

We review the availability of accommodation on a weekly basis and will move families to a more suitable place if appropriate.\n\n\"There is a plan for the family to move in to a privately rented home, however, like any other move where more than one family is concerned, we have to wait for the current tenants to move out before this family can move in.\"\n\nPolly Neate, CEO at housing charity Shelter, said: \"Hit by budget cuts and a lack of affordable homes, overstretched councils are struggling to keep homeless families within local communities.\n\n\"To put an end to this, the government needs to ramp up efforts to build more social housing to give families the chance of a decent and permanent home.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Missing Sandra Gant: Family 'have to accept she died'", "description": "There have been four murder arrests but no charges since Sandra Gant disappeared 15 years ago.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-46210499", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7E95/production/_104350423_sandra_gant.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:01:21Z", "content": "Image copyright Family Photo Image caption Sandra Gant went missing after she and two friends went for a drink at a house with a man they had just met.
