But according to Silver, all of that could change soon.\n\nSilver spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday about his expectation that the NBA will have a woman head coach soon. According to Kevin Draper of the New York Times, Silver hopes that the NBA will become the first major professional men's sports league in the United States to employ a female head coach.\n\n\"We are very focused on a woman being a head coach in our league,\" Silver said, per the New York Times. \"I am very confident it is going to happen at some point.\"\n\nSilver named San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon, Washington Mystics guard and Washington Wizards player development assistant Kristi Toliver, and Seattle Storm star and newly-appointed Denver Nuggets basketball operation associate Sue Bird as likely candidates to break the NBA's glass ceiling.\n\nLongtime San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich has high praise for assistant coach Becky Hammon.

The ban comes as peak harvest season picks up at some of the nation's busiest romaine farms in states like Arizona.\n\n\"At this time, no common grower, supplier, distributor, or brand of romaine lettuce has been identified,\" the CDC added.\n\nLettuce-related outbreaks are starting to feel like a wintertime tradition. Seven months ago, another E. coli outbreak in romaine killed five people and sickened nearly 200 more. A year ago, one person was killed in another leafy-green outbreak that made 25 people ill. Here's why this keeps happening:\n\nThere's only one way that romaine gets contaminated with E. coli\n\nTim Richter, right, walks past workers on a tractor as they plant romaine lettuce at the EG Richter Family Farm in Puyallup, Washington. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren\n\nE. coli is a broad species of gut bacteria (you have some of it in your intestines right now), but the strains that public-health investigators have discovered in sick people's feces recently are not the kind that keep us healthy. Instead, the E. coli in question \u2014 called O157:H7 \u2014 can make people develop bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, and kidney failure. In severe cases, the gut poisoning can kill. It's most dangerous for elderly adults and children.\n\nAn E. coli outbreak in lettuce can only mean one thing: The leaves have poop on them. The feces could come from livestock in a farm close to where lettuce grows, or they could come from washing the lettuce in water that's not clean. The contamination could also come from one of the countless people who touch the lettuce before it reaches consumers' mouths.\n\nRead More: What is E. coli?\n\nIt's pretty easy for bits of contaminated soil to get lodged into the folds of lettuce leaves. Although washing your produce at home can help reduce the chances of infection, it won't eliminate your risk of getting sick. That's probably why fresh produce accounts for nearly half of all foodborne illnesses in the US.\n\nE. coli bacteria of the O157:H7 strain. Janice Haney Carr/CDC via AP\n\nAn easy way to reduce your risk of getting sick, though, is to cut down on the number of hands that touch your leaves before you eat them.\n\nTim Richter, a romaine farmer in Puyallup, Washington, told the Associated Press that he encourages his customers to buy their own romaine heads and then wash and chop them at home, rather than buying pre-chopped bags of lettuce. That way, the leaves touch fewer hands, knives, and countertops as they go from soil to table.\n\nRichter, left, and his son, Timothy Richter, check a planting of romaine lettuce at their EG Richter Family Farm in Puyallup, Washington. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren\n\nThere's probably nothing inherently bacteria-prone about romaine lettuce as compared to other fresh leafy greens. Outbreaks probably just affect more people and are easier to notice when tied to a leaf that's commonly consumed. Lettuce is one of the most common veggies on American plates, and romaine's share of the market has been growing steadily since it was introduced in the late '80s. Romaine and leaf lettuce account for well over 60% of per capita lettuce consumption across the US, according to the USDA.\n\nUncooked leaves are not the deadliest thing on the menu this Thanksgiving\n\nPeople infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli can develop \"severe abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea, which may become bloody within 24 hours,\" according to the Merck Manual.\n\n\"People usually have severe abdominal pain and diarrhea many times a day. They also often feel an urge to defecate but may not be able to,\" the manual says. In severe cases, the illness can lead to kidney failure.\n\nThere's typically no fever involved, and there isn't much that otherwise healthy people can do about the infection besides staying hydrated. It can take anywhere from one to eight days for the illness to pass.\n\nPre-mixed salad moves down the assembly line at Earthbound Farms plant in Yuma, Arizona. AP Photo/Alfred J. Hernandez\n\nFresh produce is the most common source of food contamination, but food poisoning from meat and poultry is more deadly.\n\nTaken together, meat and poultry account for 29% of the foodborne illnesses that kill people, while produce (fruit and vegetables combined) accounts for 23% of deaths.\n\nIn fact, veggies are not even the worst source of E. coli infections \u2014 beef's track record is equally bad. Vegetable row crops (mostly leafy greens) and beef each account for roughly 40% of E. coli cases across the country, according to a 2013 CDC report.\n\nChicken and other poultry can also get people really sick \u2014 the birds are commonly a source of listeria and salmonella infections. This Thanksgiving, a salmonella investigation is underway for raw turkey that has sickened more than 160 people and killed at least one.\n\nAP Photo/Matthew Mead\n\nThe good thing about meat is that correct preparation involves an easy \"kill step\" \u2014 cooking it to a high temperature ensures you won't sick. But there isn't a step like that for fresh greens. That's why the CDC urges travelers not to eat fresh salad or unpeeled fruits in developing countries, where night soil (i.e. human manure) might be used as fertilizer, and water used to rinse fruits and veggies may not be clean enough to drink.\n\nFortunately, these contamination concerns are less of an issue in the US. Americans consume, on average, nearly 25 pounds of lettuce per person each year. So a couple dozen cases of food poisoning this fall (while miserable for those infected) are still a drop in the proverbial salad bowl."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kevin Webb, provided by<br><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><img src=\"//imgs.sfgate.com/graphics/partners/businessinsider/article_header.gif\" border=\"0\"></a>", "title": "The PlayStation 4 will be cheaper than ever before this holiday \u2014 but that's not the only hot gaming deal Sony has - mySanAntonio.com", "description": "mySanAntonio.com The PlayStation 4 will be cheaper than ever before this holiday \u2014 but that's not the only hot gaming deal Sony has mySanAntonio.com Sony.

Part of that process is known as the \"seven minutes of terror.\"\n\nIf all goes well, the golf-cart-size lander will be the first robot to touch down on Martian soil since NASA's nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, which landed there in August 2012.\n\nRead more: 13 incredible facts you probably didn't know about the red planet\n\nScientists hope that InSight's two-year mission will probe Mars in ways they've only dreamed of until now.\n\n\"All of our past missions have really been surface missions,\" Robert Braun, NASA's former chief technologist, told Business Insider. \"InSight's a very different mission in the sense that it is peering into the past by studying, really, the interior of Mars. In doing so, we're going to learn about Mars, but also about the early history of the Earth.\"\n\nFirst, however, InSight will have to get safely to the surface.\n\nHow InSight may survive '7 minutes of terror'\n\nAn animation showing NASA's InSight Mars probe in the \"seven minutes of terror\" entry, descent, and landing phase. NASA Langley Research Center/YouTube\n\nGetting to Mars is relatively easy.\n\nThat's because modern rockets are safer and more reliable to launch than ever before. In fact, the vehicle that sent InSight toward Mars \u2014 an Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance \u2014 has had only one partial failure since its debut in 2002.\n\nLanding on the red planet, however, is one of the most challenging tasks an aerospace engineer can accomplish. About a third of robots sent there never make it.\n\n\"Although we've done it before, landing on Mars is hard, and this mission is no different,\" Rob Manning, the chief engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a video. \"It takes thousands of steps to go from the top of the atmosphere to the surface, and each one of them has to work perfectly.\"\n\nRead more: NASA's Mars lander is just days from reaching the red planet \u2014 here's how to watch the InSight landing live\n\nThe Martian atmosphere is about 1% as thick as Earth's. But that's still plenty of air to completely destroy a spacecraft like InSight, which will be moving at about 12,300 mph when it arrives at the red planet.\n\nNASA tries to take advantage of the Martian atmosphere by putting its robots in an entry capsule with a heat shield. This helps reduce the spacecraft's speed while also protecting it from 1,500-degree-Celsius temperatures \u2014 hot enough to melt steel \u2014 caused by plowing through the thin Martian air.\n\nLockheed Martin/YouTube\n\nHowever, striking the atmosphere at anything other than the perfect angle \u2014 about 12 degrees, Manning said \u2014 can end a mission. Any shallower than this, and an entry capsule will \"skip\" off the atmosphere and out into deep space. Any deeper, and a robot gets vaporized.\n\nThis phase \u2014 when an entry capsule detaches from its mothership and descends \u2014 is sometimes called the seven minutes of terror. This is because NASA can't \"hear\" from its spacecraft for roughly seven minutes, and it won't know if a landing has succeeded or failed until a radio signal arrives (or doesn't).\n\nThis time around, though, NASA is trying something new: It sent two briefcase-size satellites called MarsCubeOne with Insight. Both cubesats are trailing the lander en route to Mars, and they'll help relay landing data home.\n\n\"They'll be broadcasting that back to Earth so we know what's exactly happening at each step of the entry, descent, and landing process,\" Tom Hoffman, the InSight mission's payload manager, said during a press briefing in October.\n\nAn engineer tests the solar arrays of NASA's Mars Cube One satellite, or MarCO. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nOnce InSight plows through enough of the Martian atmosphere to not burn up, its entry capsule will deploy a big supersonic parachute, then discard the heat shield seconds later.\n\nInSight's dangerous journey isn't over at this point. The robot still has to deploy three landing legs and use radar to calculate how close it is to the ground \u2014 NASA can't control the robot remotely in real time because it takes light (and radio signals) about 15 minutes to travel to and from Mars.\n\nAbout a mile above the surface of Mars, InSight will drop out of its protective capsule, fire its retro-rocket engines, and try to touch down without crashing or tipping over.\n\nHow InSight will probe the ancient secrets of Mars \u2014 and Earth\n\nA cutaway illustration showing what scientists think the interior of planet Mars might look like. NASA/JPL\n\nInSight will try to land in a region known as Elysium Planitia, which is a relatively flat place close to the Martian equator. If the robot safely lands and unfurls its two circular solar panels, NASA will begin its mission in earnest.\n\nLike InSight's nearly identical predecessor mission, the Phoenix Mars Lander, the probe won't move locations. But unlike Phoenix, which dug for water in Martian soil for a few months in 2008, InSight hopes to last for two Earth years.\n\nDuring that time, it will perform the first \"checkup\" of the 4.6-billion-year-old planet.\n\n\"InSight's goal is to study the interior of Mars and take the planet's vital signs, its pulse, and temperature,\" NASA said on its mission website. \"To look deep into Mars, the lander must be at a place where it can stay still and quiet for its entire mission. That's why scientists chose Elysium Planitia as InSight's home.\"\n\nNASA plans to land its InSight robot at Elysium Planitia near the Martian equator. NASA; Business Insider\n\nOnce InSight is powered up and in communication with Earth, one of its first tasks will be to unfurl a robotic arm.\n\nInSight will use that robotic appendage to place a dome down on the Martian surface. The dome will contain six extremely sensitive vibration-detection devices called seismometers.\n\nSeismometers on the Earth and the moon (Apollo astronauts deployed some on the lunar surface) have recorded earthquakes and moonquakes, which helped scientists figure out the internal structure of those rocky worlds. On Mars, NASA researchers hope to accomplish a similar feat.\n\nWhenever a meteorite strikes Mars, or there's a landslide, or a big blob of magma suddenly shifts, or there's tectonic movement, InSight's seismometer should detect such vibrations. The devices can even record seismic activity from all the way across the planet.\n\nOver time, data about marsquakes could reveal hitherto unknown information about the internal structure of the planet.\n\nOne of the most challenging tasks InSight will attempt, though, is drilling a heat probe deep into the ground. The probe will slowly drill down and stop every so often to heat up. Then a sensor will detect how long it takes that warmth to dissipate.\n\nAn artist illustration of the InSight lander on Mars. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe probe is expected to dig 16 feet down \u2014 far deeper than any previous Mars mission has ever reached with scoops, shovels, or drills.\n\n\"When we get down that deep, we'll get away from all of the temperature variations of the surface,\" Suzanne Smrekar, the mission's deputy principle investigator, said during a press briefing. \"That tells us about the heat coming out of the planet \u2014 that energy that's available for driving geologic activity.\"\n\nBack on the surface, InSight will also use a sensitive radio science experiment to see how subtly Mars shifts during its two-Earth-year-long orbit around the sun. Such data should tell researchers what is going on in the deepest parts of the planet's core.\n\nThe lead scientists on the InSight mission to Mars, Bruce Banerdt, speaks during a press conference on October 31, 2018. NASA/Bill Ingalls\n\nThe ultimate goal is to figure out how Mars formed and what happened to the planet since then. Scientists know that Mars once generated an atmosphere-protecting magnetic dynamo, as Earth still does today. But the Martian core's dynamo eventually shut down and the planet's protective shield faded, which allowed the sun to blow away Mars' atmosphere and oceans of water.\n\nIn probing that history, scientists think we're bound to learn about our own planet's origins.\n\n\"Earth ... is a big planet that holds a lot of heat, a lot of energy, and it's been very geologically active over its entire history. So most of the record of the early processes that formed the Earth have been erased,\" Hoffman said. \"We'd like to have a planet that's just a little bit calmer and that can retain that that evidence.\"\n\nThis makes sedate Mars, which is similar to Earth but has remained almost frozen in time, the perfect place to go looking."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "John Haltiwanger", "title": "There are nearly four times as many jihadist militants today than on 9/11, and the 'war on terror' has been a 'terrifyingly expensive failure'", "description": "There are nearly four times as many jihadist militants across the world today as there were on September 11, 2001, according to a new report.

The project also found the war has contributed to approximately half a million deaths.\n\n\"The war on terror may have elements that were successful, namely no major attack on the US homeland since 9/11; however, we don't know for sure whether and how the entire gamut of US policies worked,\" Crawford said, calling for more analysis by the US government about the \"effects and effectiveness of its policies\" in this regard.\n\nCrawford also noted that \"we can't kill all actual or potential terrorists without harming civilians,\" adding, \"for every civilian the US and its allies unintentionally kill, it has not made friends\" in war zones.\n\n'Killing one extremist can actually produce more extremists by activating family or acquaintances'\n\nBrandon Valeriano, the Donald Bren chair of armed politics at the Marine Corps University, told INSIDER the CSIS report \"demonstrates something Gen.

US DEA\n\nCocaine production in Colombia, the world's largest producer of the drug, has more than quadrupled since 2012, according to the DEA's most recent National Drug Threat Assessment. (Peru and Bolivia are the world's other main cocaine producers, but combined they produce less than Colombia.)\n\nBooming production kept cocaine moving out of South America at \"elevated levels\" in 2017, the DEA said.\n\n\"In 2017, at least 84% of the documented cocaine departing South America transited the eastern Pacific,\" the DEA report states.\n\nRead also: Billions of dollars of cocaine are smuggled into the US by sea every year, and the Coast Guard says it can only stop one-quarter of it\n\n\"Shipments around the Galapagos Islands increased to 17 percent of overall flow in 2017, up from four percent in 2016 and one percent in 2015,\" it adds. Of the remaining 16%, the report said, 9% goes through the western Caribbean and 7% through the eastern Caribbean.\n\nThe rise from 4% to 17% is likely not a single-year phenomenon, according to Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA.\n\nAuthorities in Ecuador seized 5.5 metric tons of cocaine and arrested 20 men on a freighter off the country's coast, May 11, 2017. Diego Fuentes Acosta/Twitter\n\n\"The Galapagos has always been a staging area,\" Vigil said, especially after traffickers shifted to the eastern Pacific in response to more law-enforcement focus on Caribbean routes.\n\n\"I think it was much higher than that,\" Vigil said of previous estimates. \"I think they miscalculated the amount of cocaine going through the Galapagos,\" he added, suggesting the increase to 17% reflected an attempt to compensate for not paying much attention to the area over the past decade.\n\nUsually a large ship like a freighter or a commercial fishing boat, what Vigil called the \"mothership,\" will approach the Galapagos with a load of drugs or fuel that would be distributed to smaller vessels heading north.\n\nThe Galapagos and the surrounding waters are \"very safe\" for traffickers, Vigil added. \"Even if you have surveillance there [by] Coast Guard cutters or whatever, they're going to pick it up\" and can abort smuggling operations.\n\n\"There's no better staging area, because it's close to South America; they can loiter there,\" Vigil said. \"It's a big fishing area. They can always say they're fishing. They're in tune with any kind of enforcement shift\" around the islands, whether it's by the US Coast Guard or Colombian authorities.\n\nSuspected smuggling routes in the eastern Pacific Ocean in 2016. Adam Isacson/US Southern Command\n\nMost of the cocaine being staged in the Galapagos originates in Peru or Bolivia, Vigil said, but travels over sea or land to Ecuador, of which the Galapagos Islands are a province. From Ecuador, that cocaine mostly leaves through the ports of Esmeraldas or Manta.\n\nEcuador has been seen as a major transshipment point for cocaine for some time. But given a lack or resources, it can only search about 3% of the shipments coming out of those ports, Vigil said.\n\nUS law-enforcement ties with Ecuador withered under former President Rafael Correa. His successor, Lenin Moreno, has been more open to working with the US, agreeing in April to allow the DEA and Customs and Border Protection back into the country.\n\nThe US touts at-sea interdictions as a way to undermine cartels\n\nThe Coast Guard cutter James interdicts a low-profile vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean, October 22, 2018. US Coast Guard\n\nTraffickers \"may use a variety of routes, and that's a tactical calculus ... that these transnational criminal organizations make,\" Capt. Jeffrey Randall, commander of the Coast Guard cutter James, said on Thursday during a drug offload from the James in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.\n\n\"Some of them may choose to go that route. Some of them may choose to go a shorter route,\" Randall said of trafficking around the Galapagos. \"It all depends on how that individual cartel or individual drug-trafficking organization chooses to move their narcotics.\"\n\nNow read: Drug cartels make billions in the US, but somebody else is doing the selling\n\n\"But you can't do that without some sort of logistics change, so there's a network at play there,\" he said. \"Dismantling that network is what's key to reducing the overall flow.\"\n\nThe US government has touted at-sea interdictions as a way to undermine trafficking organizations.\n\nThe Coast Guard has said its seizures between 2002 and 2011 and information gained from them contributed to the extradition of 75% of Colombian cartel leaders, as well as to the 2014 capture of Sinaloa cartel chief Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.\n\nA Coast Guard Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron crew demonstrates warning shots fired at a non-compliant boat, off the coast of Jacksonville, September 24, 2009.

That means you can summon Siri and ask it to summon Google Assistant using your voice.\n\nIt goes like this: \"Hey Siri, OK Google.\" Siri will then open the Google Assistant app, at which point you have to say \"OK Google\" again to start asking questions or issuing commands to Google Assistant. It's not perfect and it feels a bit like a workaround rather than an actual feature, as you have to say three phrases to get to Google Assistant versus the single phrase for Siri or Google Assistant on Android devices.\n\nTo get this to work, you'll need to update to the latest version of Google Assistant via the iOS App Store. You might get prompted to \"Add Google Assistant to Siri,\" in which case you tap \"Add to Siri\" and add the Google Assistant summoning phrase of your choice. Otherwise, you'll need to go to Siri's settings in iOS and tap \"Add OK Google to Siri\" manually.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nIn the past, in order to summon Google Assistant on iOS devices using your voice, you needed to open the Google Assistant app or tap a shortcut on the widgets screen.\n\nThis is incredibly useful for anyone who uses iOS devices and Google devices. It's incredibly useful even if you don't own Google devices, as you can now use Google Assistant as your main voice-activated assistant instead of Siri. In general, this workaround to access Google Assistant with your voice helps break down the wall that Apple builds around its products and ecosystem, and gives iOS users more access to things that aren't Apple.\n\nOverall, Google Assistant is smarter and more useful than Siri. It's more capable in almost every single way. Funnily enough, the most useful thing that Siri now does is to summon Google Assistant \u2014 without Siri, there would still be no way to summon Google Assistant with your voice."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Gina Heeb", "title": "'Playing with fire:' Economists warn the fallout of Trump's trade war is showing up and that things could get a lot worse", "description": "The Trump administration has placed import taxes on hundred of billions worth of products so far.

Giuliani also said Mueller asked the president whether he knew at the time about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and two Russian lobbyists said to have offered kompromat on Clinton.\n\nGiuliani did not elaborate when Axios asked about specific questions the special counsel asked Trump, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment from INSIDER. But his revelations indicate Mueller is homing in on the period from June to August 2016, arguably the most pivotal time in the 2016 campaign season.\n\nMueller has long been focused on the Russia-backed campaign to hack into the DNC and distribute stolen emails via the Russia-linked hacker Guccifer 2.0 and the pro-transparency group WikiLeaks.\n\nTrump has had no known contacts with WikiLeaks or Russians connected to the hack. But as a candidate, he expressed support for the group. He also famously made a public appeal directly to Russia during a press conference on July 27, 2016, saying he hoped Russians would be \"able to find\" the 33,000 emails Clinton deleted from her private server.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., have both faced questions about their involvement in the Trump Tower meeting.

Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction charges earlier this year and is cooperating with Mueller.\n\nWhen news of the meeting surfaced in July 2017, Trump Jr. said it was focused on Russian adoptions \u2014 an issue related to the 2012 Magnitsky Act \u2014 and did not involve campaign business.\n\nIt later emerged that Trump Jr. took the meeting after he was offered dirt on Clinton and that it was pitched to him by the British music publicist Rob Goldstone as \"part of Russia and its government's support\" for Trump's candidacy.\n\n\"I love it,\" Trump Jr. replied.\n\nGetty/Somodevilla\n\nTrump and his lawyers have said the president had no knowledge of the meeting at the time. But at least three Trump associates, including Giuliani, have hinted that he may know more about it than he's letting on.\n\nIn May, the Senate Judiciary Committee released testimony from Trump Jr. and Goldstone that raised additional questions about whether Trump knew about the meeting in advance, and if so, how much.\n\nObservers have pointed to a series of phone calls Trump Jr. made and received on June 6, 2016, after he got the offer.\n\nBefore taking the meeting, Trump Jr. told Goldstone he wanted to make sure it was legitimate and \"just speak to Emin first,\" referring to Emin Agalarov, the Russian pop star Goldstone worked with and pitched the meeting on behalf of.\n\nAfter talking to Goldstone, Trump Jr. got a phone call from Russia that lasted a minute or two.

Foreign policy and national security experts also feel Trump has greatly embellished the extent to which the US needs Saudi Arabia as a partner.\n\n\"The crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone,\" Trump said in the controversial statement. \"In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\"\n\nThe president in his statement also touted the purported economic benefits of the US partnership with Saudi Arabia, making inaccurate claims about US arms sales while emphasizing low oil prices.\n\n'We are being played'\n\nAaron David Miller, who helped shape US policy in the Middle East for decades while serving as an adviser to six secretaries of state, told INSIDER that Trump's statement was \"astonishing.\"\n\n\"I worked for Republicans and Democrats through five administrations, and there has never been such a statement,\" Miller said, accusing Trump of \"draining\" US foreign policy of \"any moral or ethical principles.\"\n\nIf put in the same position as Trump, Miller does not believe any of the administrations he advised would have done anything that \"would fundamentally undermine the relationship\" between Washington and Riyadh, but they would have at least signaled to the Saudis they \"cannot have carte blanche to trample all over American interests and have us continue to support them.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nMiller, who's now the vice president and Middle East program director at the Wilson Center, said Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed have succeeded in \"bamboozling\" the president. \"We are being played,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is an \"important security partner,\" Miller said, but not a true American ally as Trump said given it doesn't share US values.\n\nWith that said, the strategic partnership between the US and Saudis that dates back to the 1940s has begun to crumble in recent years.\n\nFor decades, the US has provided security, while the Saudis have provided oil. But the US no longer needs Saudi oil, Miller said, as the shale revolution has made it virtually energy independent.\n\nIndeed, it's the US, not Saudi Arabia, that is now the world's largest crude-oil producer.\n\n'Saudi Arabia needs us a lot more than we need them'\n\nAt the end of the day, Saudi Arabia now needs the US \"a lot more than we need them,\" Gen. Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, told CNN on Tuesday in response to the president's statement.\n\nClark said that the Saudis \"need\" US protection but the US no longer needs their oil, adding that though it might be \"inconvenient\" in the short-run for the US government to take actions that hurt the royal family there's also important strategic value in upholding American ideals.\n\n\"If we're going to have America in the world that we want to see, we have to stand up for our values, and we have to put those values up front,\" Clark said. \"We need to help the Saudis come in our direction. And calling it like it is on this would help them.\"\n\n'We've allowed the US-Saudi relationship to get out of control'\n\nMiller said Trump's obstinate support for Saudi Arabia is linked to his desire to be fundamentally anti-Obama.\n\nThe president felt his predecessor undermined two historically key partnerships with his policy toward Saudi Arabia and Israel and has been \"determined to show that these are our core partners in the region and we are going to build policy around them,\" Miller said.\n\n\"I've had meetings with Jared Kushner and they are clearly relying on the Saudis for their regional strategy,\" he added.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Trump's first trip abroad involved visits to Riyadh and Jerusalem. In the past, presidents often traveled closer to home, visiting neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico, on their initial foreign trips.\n\nMiller said what's required moving forward is more balance in terms of US policy in the Middle East, contending the Trump administration needs to take advantage of the leverage it has over the Saudis in the region. This would involve cooperating with Iran when it serves US interests, but standing against it when it doesn't.\n\n\"We've allowed the US-Saudi relationship to get out of control... and Khashoggi's murder is just the most extreme manifestation of a relationship that's out of control,\" Miller said.\n\nA composite image of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Here's how it might survive '7 minutes of terror' and make incredible discoveries about the red planet \u2014 and Earth, too.\n\nIt won't be easy \u2014 the atmosphere on Mars is about 1% as thick as Earth's, which provides enough friction to burn up a spacecraft but makes it difficult to slow down enough for a safe landing. Only about one-third of missions launched to Mars survive a landing; the United States is the only country to have successfully landed anything on the red planet.\n\nAccording to NASA, the InSight lander will enter the Martian atmosphere at about 12,300 mph. It will only have about six-and-a-half minutes to slow down to about 5 mph, which it will do by using a parachute and firing descent thrusters. If everything goes according to plan, the spacecraft is expected to land on a flat, stable surface at Elysium Planitia \u2014 a broad Martian plain with few rocks or boulders \u2014 shortly before 3 p.m. EST on Monday.\n\nInSight's design, including its heat shield and parachute, is very similar to that of NASA's Phoenix spacecraft, which successfully landed near Mars' north pole in 2008. But InSight will have more mass when it enters the Martian atmosphere than Phoenix did, which makes the landing more challenging. The new spacecraft is also expected to touch down at a higher elevation than Phoenix did, which means it will have less atmosphere to rely on for slowing down.\n\nHowever, InSight has a stronger parachute, better avionics, and an improved heat shield \u2014 which is designed to take a beating from possible dust storms \u2014 to help counter these challenges.\n\nThe InSight mission is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. InSight, which lifted off from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base in May, was the first interplanetary rocket that NASA has launched from the West Coast. The lander was accompanied by two small, Mars-bound satellites that are collectively called Mars Cube One.\n\nRead more: A tiny satellite bound for Mars just snapped a picture that makes the red planet look puny and insignificant\n\nOnce on the ground, InSight will stretch out to 20 feet long and weigh nearly 800 pounds. It'll be powered by two 7-foot-wide solar arrays.\n\nTo measure marsquakes (which are similar to earthquakes but, of course, not on Earth), the lander will use a robotic arm to set down a packet of seismometers, which can record any ground vibrations from meteorite impacts, tectonic movements, volcanism, or other seismic activity. This data could help scientists decode the internal structure of Mars, including to what extent its core is solid or liquid.\n\nAn illustration of NASA's InSight Mars probe about to land on the Martian surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe lander is supposed to collect data on Mars until at least November 2020. NASA hopes to use this information to draw new comparisons between the interiors of Earth and the red planet.\n\nEventually, the research could be used to learn more about which types of Earth-like exoplanets may support alien life.\n\nHow, when, and where to watch NASA's live InSight landing coverage\n\nOn Monday, NASA will be relying on other spacecraft and radio telescopes on Earth to monitor InSight's radio signals and determine when it reaches the red planet. The lander's design should allow it to touch down safely around 2:54 p.m. EST.\n\nThe landing won't be captured on video, but NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory will broadcast live views of mission control, along with updates, expert commentary, and animations showing every step of InSight's descent.\n\nYou can watch the event live with NASA JPL's stream below starting around 2 p.m. EST on Monday:\n\nIf the feed above doesn't work, try NASA's YouTube channel or NASA TV."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Lucia Moses", "title": "Glamour ending its regular print publication shows how dire the math has become in magazine advertising \u2014 even for former cash cows", "description": "Cond\u00e9 Nast said it would no longer publish a monthly print edition of Glamour, but would publish occasional print issues.

Now it's become the latest casualty of the shift to digital reading from print.\n\nThe glossy-magazine publisher announced this week that it would no longer publish a monthly print edition of Glamour. The move was preceded by the hiring of experienced digital editor Samantha Barry as editor-in-chief in January and a cutback in the annual frequency from 12 to 11 issues.\n\nBarry said the move was intended to follow Glamour's readership, which she said was 20 million digitally and growing. But that's far from the whole story.\n\nAt 2.2 million copies, Glamour still has a huge circulation in print. That was fine when print advertising was robust enough to pay the bills. But declining print-ad revenue and advertiser demand to reach engaged audiences has forced many big-circulation magazines to cut unprofitable circulation. Other magazines that in recent years have cut back the circulation they'd guaranteed advertisers include Time, Family Circle, and Reader's Digest.\n\nThe ad declines have hit different magazines in different ways. Luxury advertisers are still wedded to print. But the mass fashion and beauty advertising Glamour relied on is largely moving to the web.\n\nMediaRadar, which tracks ad spending across media, found that for the first 10 months of 2018, fashion advertisers spent 16% less in print than they had a year ago, while their digital spending grew 60%. For its part, Glamour's print revenue declined 24% in the first 10 months of the year, MediaRadar founder and CEO Todd Krizelman said.\n\nThere's new competition for these ad dollars.\n\nSnap won 150 fashion advertisers so far this year, almost all of them new over 2017, by MediaRadar's count. YouTube grew its fashion advertising 20% on the same basis, to 408 advertisers. \"There are clearly new people you're fighting against,\" Krizelman said.\n\nThe Glamour shift also shows the challenges that legacy publishers face to get their expenses in line with revenue. Cond\u00e9 Nast is still known in the industry for high production costs. With losses estimated at $120 million last year, the company is looking hard for places to cut expenses, selling or closing magazines that aren't core to its future and consolidating staff. At the same time, like other publishers, it's pushing paywalls hard at titles like The New Yorker and Vanity Fair.\n\n\"You do have a notion across Cond\u00e9 Nast that the magazines were built so rich in salaries and perks and production costs,\" said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at Poynter. \"It's very hard to dial that back quickly. And with these magazines, their circulation is too large. If you're having to spend more to keep that base up, and the added expense of postal and delivery, you can be losing money on some of those units.\"\n\nThe print trends are sobering and are not likely to reverse anytime soon.

The annual award, funded by the Anthony and Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation, honors innovators under the age of 40.\n\nEach year, more than 220 million tons of plastic is produced around the world, according to Unesco, and BioCellection says more than 80% of that is not recycled.

It is also narrower in focus than existing alternatives, which take in other types of plastics in addition to polyethylene.\n\nWang said her company makes four products, ranging from $1,600 per metric ton to more than $12,000 per metric ton, and she expects to have a demonstration unit out by the middle of 2019. By then, Wang hopes to have a better idea of the costs involved, she said, adding that she would like to secure a commercial partnership by 2020.\n\n\"This technology can become the pillar of what would enable people around the world to mine landfills for plastics as a new carbon source,\" Wang said after receiving the Pritzker award. \"We don't have to drill for oil anymore to make the things around us.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Rob Price", "title": "Facebook's outgoing policy and comms boss says he's to blame for hiring PR firm that tried to smear company's critics (FB)", "description": "Facebook 's outgoing policy and comms boss says he's to blame for hiring an opposition-research firm.

Audi took the prize in 2016 and 2017, and, if anything, the competition has stiffened since. Consumers are more demanding than ever of the technology and connectivity features in their vehicles.\n\nAs we said last year, if you aren't aiming for state-of-the-art, particularly in the luxury realm, you're falling behind. A really great infotainment system makes car ownership a pleasure; a poor system makes it a chore.\n\nSafety first\n\nCar companies have to tread carefully with how they control the use of connectivity in vehicles. Both Consumer Reports and JD Power have recounted frequent owner complaints about balky systems.\n\nOur methodology for choosing an Infotainment System of the Year hasn't changed since 2016. We consider a great system to be one that performs all its functions relatively seamlessly and with as much of an intuitive interface as possible.\n\nRight now, voice-recognition technologies are still at an early stage, but we certainly appreciate when a manufacturer's setup works as advertised and isn't clunkier than the more dangerous manual-entry-of-info modes. We also appreciate it if an infotainment system is part of a carmaker's business case for its vehicles and its technology.\n\nReliability, ease of use, precision (especially when it comes to navigation), and the ability of a system to be operated while driving without endangering anyone were top criteria for our choice \u2014 which involved debate and discussion all year long among senior correspondent Matt DeBord, senior transportation reporter Ben Zhang, and deputy executive editor Cadie Thompson.\n\nThis year's finalists were:\n\nApple CarPlay\n\nAudi MMI-Virtual Cockpit\n\nFCA Uconnect\n\nGeneral Motors MyLink/IntelliLink/Cue plus OnStar\n\nTesla Infotainment System\n\nThe big winner\n\nCarPlay integrates with infotainment systems from numerous automakers. Daimler\n\nApple CarPlay is our Infotainment System of the Year winner for 2018!\n\nYou might consider this an odd choice, given than CarPlay isn't a stand-alone infotainment but rather an iPhone software interface for cars. It typically has to integrate with an automaker's in-vehicle system by being plugged into a USB port.\n\nBut the truth is we now routinely use CarPlay to benchmark proprietary infotainment systems, especially when it comes to ease of use. And CarPlay is portable; it can be used in multiple vehicles from different manufacturers. We often found CarPlay to be a handy tool when we encounter a poor user interface. Plug in CarPlay, and it's smooth sailing from there.\n\nSiri is better than the majority of voice-recognition setups we test, and being able to use Apple Maps or Google Maps through a smartphone is often more effective than relying on the in-dash navigation software.\n\nRead more: Acura ELS Studio 3D is Business Insider's Car Audio System of the Year\n\nAccessing your media, stored on your iPhone or streamed, is also easier through CarPlay. And best of all, if you like aspects of your vehicle's infotainment system but prefer some CarPlay functions, you can toggle back and forth.\n\nWhat really gave CarPlay the crown this year, though, was an observation that both Matt and Ben have made about younger drivers. They genuinely don't like it when CarPlay isn't available \u2014 that is, no matter how good an automaker's own system is, if CarPlay isn't on the menu, they're disappointed \u2014 and they might consider that a deal breaker.\n\nBen is younger than Matt, who isn't as infotainment-centric, and Ben considers it a negative if an automaker doesn't provide CarPlay integration. Other, younger staffers who've reviewed vehicles for Business Insider have been even less tolerant of a no-CarPlay situation.\n\nIn fact, this has become such a thing that we're now adding Android Auto testing to our reviewing process, to be fair to the other major technology actor in this space.\n\nBeyond the degree to which CarPlay lets motorists use their iPhones more safely, the technology suggests to us that Apple will become more deeply involved in the user interface of automobiles going forward. What CarPlay currently does is fairly modest, but in the coming years Apple could remake the entire dashboard. We're looking forward to what the company comes up with.\n\nThe runner-up\n\nAudi's MMI-Virtual Cockpit remains a force to be reckoned with. Hollis Johnson\n\nWe certainly can't overlook Audi's MMI system. As we said last year when it took the prize, it's the gift that keeps on giving. It does everything well, from managing audio to providing superb and accurate navigation powered by Google Maps. It also has Bluetooth integration along with Audi Connect 4G LTE connectivity and a cluster of apps.\n\nAnd it does all this without being a touchscreen system! A central infotainment screen emerges from the dashboard, but you use a knob, buttons, and a touchpad to access the menus and features. In practice, it works flawlessly, and thanks to the way it's organized, you won't be taking your eyes off the road as often as with touchscreen-style systems.\n\nAudi MMI running Apple CarPlay. Hollis Johnson\n\nWhat puts MMI into \"hard-to-catch\" territory is the Virtual Cockpit feature, available on most Audi models. Virtual Cockpit impressively transforms the main instrument cluster into a customizable digital screen.\n\nIt can, for example, display the navigation map and send the traditional gauges to the corners of the screen. This means a driver's eyes are front and center much of the time, rather than darting between the road ahead, the infotainment screen, and the instruments (as well as the rearview and side-view mirrors).\n\nAudi's MMI-Virtual Cockpit system is a remarkable setup that has helped Audi rise to the top tier of the US luxury market, previously ruled by the big three luxury automakers: Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.\n\nFor the record, the other three infotainment systems we considered this year are also quite excellent. Of particular note is Uconnect, which is often overlooked and somewhat underrated for how effective it is."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Shayanne Gal and Walt Hickey", "title": "The most Googled Thanksgiving recipe in every state", "description": "Americans generally eat the same things on Thanksgiving but there are major differences.

This is the same reason why people will publicly support a politician and \u2014 when worse and worse behavior is revealed \u2014 they don't change their mind, but instead they actually double down.\n\nWhy does this happen? Why do we hold onto our beliefs even when there's a ton of evidence that we're wrong?\n\nBitcoin value as of November 21. Markets Insider\n\nThe money messages that control our lives\n\nWhen it comes to money, people rarely ever want to admit they were wrong \u2026 and I don't blame them. So much of who we are and how we measure our worth is tied up to money.\n\nThat's not a judgement on individuals, either. In fact, a lot of our beliefs around money come in the way of \"money messages\" \u2014 the beliefs and values surrounding finances so deeply embedded in our society that we don't even realize they're guiding our attitudes and behavior.\n\nWe typically absorb these messages as kids from our families, but they can really come from anywhere.\n\nHere are a few money messages people commonly believe \u2014 and a better way to approach them:\n\nMONEY MESSAGE: \"I can't get a raise in this economy.\"\n\nBETTER MESSAGE: \"I can get a very large raise if I show my boss that my work is invaluable to the company.\"\n\nMONEY MESSAGE: \"I can't afford that.\"\n\nSOLUTION: \"Yes, I can afford that expensive purchase. I just need to figure out how.\"\n\nMONEY MESSAGE: \"The best way to save money is to cut spending.\"\n\nSOLUTION: \"There's a limit to how much I can save, but there's no limit to how much I can earn.\"\n\nMONEY MESSAGE: \"This cryptocurrency / stock is the hottest investment to get rich quick!\"\n\nSOLUTION: \"There's no such thing as a get rich quick scheme. The only way to be rich is to scale up my earnings and invest for the long run.\"\n\nRelated: My portfolio just lost $75,000 in 12 days \u2014 here's why I'm not worried at all\n\nEach of these money messages are so ingrained in our thinking that we don't realize that they're there. They become a part of our identity and guide our behaviors surrounding them.\n\nAnd if you don't realize they're there, they can become dangerous and lead you down paths you didn't necessarily even want to follow just because you thought you must.\n\nKeep your identity small\n\nThink about some other messages you've told yourself:\n\n\"I should follow my passion.\"\n\n\"I should hook up with a lot of people before I settle down.\"\n\n\"I work hard, so I deserve this nice apartment.\"\n\n\"My kids should take care of themselves after they graduate from college.\"\n\nNotice that some of these messages aren't necessarily bad. However, they still can prevent us from doing the things we love and living our Rich Life.\n\nInvestor Paul Graham once said, \"keep your identity small.\"\n\nOnce something becomes part of your identity, it's hard to change \u2014 even if all evidence tells you that you should.\n\nRelated: I'm convinced a mistaken belief that keeps people from building wealth can be dismantled with 5 minutes of simple math\n\nMany people who get caught up in things like cryptocurrency investing, politics, or religion don't keep their identity small. They become \"crypto\" people, Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians \u2014 publicly! Once that happens, they're tied to it. They've publicly tied their identity to someone or something, and it would be psychologically devastating to change their minds now.\n\nI don't mind identities.

Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult,\" Hyde-Smith says in a video reportedly taken on Nov. 3. Her campaign later said the footage was \"selectively edited\" and the comment was a \"joke.\"\n\nMississippi is home to several historically black colleges and universities \u2014 and Republicans across the country have pushed measures that make it more difficult for college students to vote. The NAACP filed a lawsuit last month charging that a majority white county in Texas intentionally limited early voting on campus at Prairie View A&M University, a historically black college, to disenfranchise young black voters, who overwhelmingly support Democrats.\n\nThe voter suppression \"joke\" struck a particular nerve during midterm elections in which, on the one hand, there have been accusations of systematic disenfranchisement, and on the other, unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. Both have played a central role in escalating partisan divisions undermining public trust in the country's electoral process.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, a 2014 Facebook post surfaced showing Hyde-Smith posing in a Confederate hat at the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library. She commented on the post: \"Mississippi history at its best!\"\n\nEspy has condemned Hyde-Smith's comments and called her \"a walking stereotype who embarrasses our state\" and during Tuesday's debate said she had \"given our state another black eye.\"\n\nRead more: Outgoing GOP state legislatures are cramming through conservative laws before they lose power\n\nWhile Hyde-Smith expressed regret for her comments during the debate, apologizing to \"anyone that was offended\" by them, she also went on the attack, arguing that her comment was \"twisted\" and \"turned into a weapon to be used against me.\"\n\nEspy jumped on Hyde-Smith's defense, arguing that the remarks spoke for themselves.\n\n\"No one twisted your comments,\" he said. \"It came out of your mouth. I don't know what's in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\" On Tuesday, Walmart, AT&T, and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer asked Hyde-Smith to return their campaign donations because of her \"public hanging\" comments.

Solis/AP Harnessing national politics Espy and his allies are hoping that the anger and embarrassment many Mississippians feel about Hyde-Smith's comments will energize the state's black voters and some white voters into Espy's camp. Espy has received backup from national politicians, including two African-American Democratic senators, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who traveled to the state in recent days to campaign for him. But he's also been dogged by his own issues, defending his work as a lobbyist for an African dictator and corruption charges he was acquitted of in the early 1990s. Meanwhile, Hyde-Smith has done her best to make the race a choice between a liberal Democrat who she says is out of step with Mississippi's conservative electorate and Trump's agenda. The former state agriculture commissioner opened and closed the debate by encouraging viewers to attend two rallies the president will hold for her on the eve of the runoff.\n\nBoth Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to replace retiring Sen. Thad Cochran last April, and Espy, who served as agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, received just over 40 percent of the vote in the Nov. 6 race, while a third candidate, far-right Republican Chris McDaniel received 16 percent of the vote in a deep red state that Trump won by nearly 18 points.\n\nWhile most observers believe Hyde-Smith will pull out ahead next Tuesday, some private polling has shown the race narrow to single digits, with the Republican ahead by just five points.\n\nPerhaps in a sign of Republicans' concern about Hyde-Smith's ability to defend herself, Republican Roger Wicker \u2014 Mississippi's senior senator \u2014 was sent out to answer reporters' questions after the debate, even though Espy answered his own post-debate questions."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Graham Rapier", "title": "This picture of hellish LA traffic shows why we need a transportation revolution", "description": "54 million Americans are expected to hit the road this week for Thanksgiving travel.

The quality stays consistent, but you can save hundreds of dollars just by choosing to order this weekend rather than the next.\n\nFor instance, Bear Mattress is offering $125 off any purchase totaling more than $500 with the code \"HOL125\" and $225 off purchases of $1,200 or more with the code \"HOL225\" at checkout from now until November 27. Plus, every mattress comes with two free premium cloud pillows.\n\nWe've waxed poetic on why Bear is a great option for those with an active lifestyle before, but the details can be winnowed down to the following:\n\nThe Bear Mattress starts at $540 for a twin size normally and clocks in at $840 before any discounts for a queen size. It's made with premium graphite gel-memory foam and Celliant technology so it's not too firm and not too soft. It's supposed to be a particularly great option for those who want cooling comfort (ie. maybe you sleep hot) and have active lifestyles. The contouring pressure relief and core support should support all body shapes and types of sleepers.\n\nWhy is it good for active lifestyles? The Bear Mattress cover is woven with Celliant, which redirects the body's natural energy back as infrared light for faster recovery, more energy, better endurance, and increased performance. It calls Tom Brady's Under Armour pajamas with the same infrared technology to mind.\n\nWhy is it good for cooling comfort? While graphite gel foam adapts to your needed support and comfort, the graphite gel particles promote a cooler night's sleep.\n\nYou'll get a 100-night, risk-free trial in your home, free shipping, easy returns, and a 10-year warranty. And if you care about things like this, it's made from eco-friendly materials. Plus, 1% of every sale goes to Good Sports, an organization dedicated to giving all kids the benefits of sport and physical activity.\n\nIf you want an inexpensive, high-quality mattress that will let you sleep cooler and perhaps even recover faster after physical exertion, you might want to shop Bear Mattress' Black Friday sales while the deals last."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Walt Hickey and Shayanne Gal", "title": "How rich people do Thanksgiving different than the rest of us", "description": "The wealthiest 20% of Americans mostly eat the same stuff as the rest of us, but their Thanksgivings do have a few unique twists.

A National Trust survey found that kids aged 10 to 16 spend fewer than 15 minutes engaged in \"vigorous outdoor activity\" each day.\n\nAnd when the winter weather rolls in, most kids get outdoors even less, \"despite indisputable developmental benefits of outdoor play.\"\n\nBut why? Why do kids spend so much less time outdoors when the weather gets cold? Do we worry they'll get sick? Or that they won't know what to do for fun? Or that they'll simply be too cold?\n\nOn closer inspection, reduced outdoor play during winter seems more a problem of our own making than it is due to colder temperatures.\n\nDr. Robert Murray, pediatrician, author, and board member of Action for Healthy Kids, an organization dedicated to pediatric health and the promotion of outdoor play, put it this way: \"Our culture has developed a fear of changing seasons, but there's no distinct indoor or outdoor season.\" He added that each day provides an opportunity for \"the quality 'kid time' needed to explore, create, build relationships, and accept new challenges without parental direction\" while playing in the outdoors.\n\nGranted, outdoor play during the winter requires a bit more effort than outdoor play during the spring, summer, or fall. You can't just push your kids out the door when it's freezing cold or snowing. But with a bit of extra effort, the outdoors in winter can be as enjoyable and beneficial for kids as the warmer seasons.\n\nDr. Murray told Business Insider that he sees the reduction in outdoor time during the winter as an issue of perception and inconvenience.\n\n\"The colder months can make getting kids outdoors a hassle for parents,\" Murray said, \"as they fear [for their child's] safety and have mixed feelings about exposing their children to the cold weather. With well-insulated caps, mittens, gloves, socks and appropriate layers, kids can get outdoors too and enjoy some fresh air.\"\n\nRead more:We ask our kid the same question at the dinner table every day \u2014 and it helps both his thinking and our parenting\n\nAnd if you're not sure if your child is well enough equipped for outdoor play during the winter, Dr. Murray has a radical idea ... just ask how they feel. \"They'll let you know when they're cold!\" he said.\n\nIt takes longer to get my five-year-old son into his boots, snow pants, coat, hat, and mittens during winter than it does to dress him in shorts and sneakers during the summer, but I've got an extra few minutes to spare to make sure he can enjoy the benefits out outdoor play even in the depths of winter.\n\nWhat's a parent to do when the winter weather truly is too severe for outdoor play, with subzero temperatures, howling winds, and driving snow? Dr. Murray recommended indoor activities that foster an appreciation for the outdoor winter environment.\n\n\"Screen time is inevitable these days,\" he said. \"So finding ways to enjoy it for short periods of time with your kids is a win-win. Scroll through Pinterest and browse through YouTube to find fun activities kids can do and own\" once they get back outside.\n\nAnd once the weather permits, get the kids away from those screens and out the door!\n\nI know that's what we'll do with our son this season."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sponsor Post", "title": "5 spending traps to watch out for this holiday season", "description": "The winter holidays can be a notoriously hectic shopping season.

In fact, research shows that the average consumer spends around $1,000 during the winter holiday season.\n\nBut this time of year doesn't have to be a frantic spending fest \u2014 it can be about saving money too, especially if you're able to pair a strong dose of willpower with a close eye for all the subtle ways stores and websites entice you to spend more.\n\nIf you're feeling apprehensive about overspending this holiday season, we have you covered. Here are a few tips to help you keep your budget under control this holiday season.\n\n1. Think twice about gift sets.\n\nGift sets and baskets can be appealing once you set your eyes on them \u2014 the packaging tends to be attractive (especially given that you won't need to do any wrapping yourself), and the price point usually feels right given all that's included. But the truth is, gift baskets can also be filled with extras that aren't adding much value. This season, consider forgoing the gift basket in favor of buying one nice item you know the recipient will enjoy.\n\n2. Watch out for misleading signs.\n\nAs you're out shopping for holiday gifts, one of the most important pieces of advice you can follow is to pay attention to all of a sign's details, especially if a deal seems too good to be true. You may notice a huge \"$19.99\" sign beside a display of sweaters and think you've found the deal of the day. But upon closer examination you may see the small print \"starting at\" or \"from\" that lets you know those sweaters aren't as inexpensive as you thought.\n\nThe same goes for the eye-catching sale signs that are plastered on store windows amidst snowflake decals and other holiday imagery. You may feel compelled to pop in to buy some gifts, but once inside, you may find only a few items are actually on sale. Before making a purchase, always make sure the sale you're after truly applies.\n\n3. Know that stores are designed to entice you to spend more.\n\nRetailers know you're most likely to look at the items in front of you, so they place their most profitable products at eye level and in the front of the store. And the songs you hear playing? Those can have a big influence on your purchasing decisions. Calming music encourages you to slow down and spend longer in the store, and upbeat holiday tunes get you into the seasonal spirit where you're more likely to spend.\n\nBe careful when you head to the checkout area as well, because this part of the store tends to be stocked with enticing snacks and small products that catch your eye as you wait in line. But as much as a bag of holiday candy or a candle might lure you in, consider whether you actually need the item before dropping it into your basket. Your best bet for managing overspending amid tricky store design is to head out with a budget and a plan, and buy only what you came for.\n\n4. Keep an eye out for free shipping minimums.\n\nNearly all online shoppers plan to take advantage of free shipping offers. But even if a website displays 'free shipping' in big bold letters across the top of every page, it's not always a guarantee. Some retailers only eliminate shipping fees once your purchase exceeds a certain amount, so pay attention to the details. And don't forget about Free Shipping Day, when thousands of retailers offer free shipping with a guaranteed delivery date. This year it's on December 14.\n\n5. Resist being tricked by subtle web design techniques.\n\nWebsites use all sorts of design techniques to get you to spend more, such as suggesting items based on your previous purchases, alerts that highlight low inventory of an item you're interested in, and huge sale banners. Video ads with emotional appeal and heavy use of the color red \u2014 a color associated with urgency and attracting attention \u2014 are particularly common around the holidays, too.\n\nAll these tactics encourage you to buy more, and might lead you to make purchases you don't need. Your best bet is to write out a list, search for exactly what you need, and try not to stray. Remember that with the right mindset, the holidays can be a time for also adding to your savings. Your bank account will thank you \u2014 and there's no better present you can give yourself.\n\nPut your savings to work and earn a 2.00% promotional interest rate and 0.57% Annual Percentage Yield when you open an eligible Citi\u00ae Savings Account with a minimum $25,000 balance and qualifying activities.

Instead, their reasoning challenges some of the basic principles of how people should be allowed to share information online, with implications which go far beyond just Facebook, which is why we have chosen to appeal.\"\n\nBenckert, the associate general counsel for EMEA, added that it was an important point of principle for Facebook.\n\nShe said: \"For example, under ICO's theory people should not be allowed to forward an email or message without having agreement from each person on the original thread.\n\n\"These are things done by millions of people every day on services across the internet, which is why we believe the ICO's decision raises important questions of principle for everyone online which should be considered by an impartial court based on all the relevant evidence.\"\n\nThe ICO's 27-page penalty notice can be read here. In summary, the ICO said Facebook failed to protect users by allowing developers access to data without clear and proper consent between 2007 and 2014.\n\nThis allowed Kogan and his company GSR to harvest information, which was ultimately weaponized by Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 presidential election in the US.\n\nEven after the breach was discovered in 2015, the ICO said Facebook did not take sufficient action to ensure those who held the data deleted it.\n\nAn ICO spokeswoman said: \"Any organisation issued with a monetary penalty notice by the Information Commissioner has the right to appeal the decision to the First-tier Tribunal. The progression of any appeal is a matter for the tribunal. We have not yet been notified by the Tribunal that an appeal has been received.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Scott Davis", "title": "NBA POWER RANKINGS: Where all 30 teams stand after a wild first month", "description": "The NBA season is nearly a quarter complete.

Despite that, another \"Robin Hood\" movie is in development from Sony, this time focusing on the love interest, Marian, played by Margot Robbie, who takes up Robin Hood's cause after he dies.\n\nIn 2014, Disney acquired a Robin Hood-inspired spec script called \"Nottingham & Hood,\" which had a \"a 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' tone,\" according to Deadline.

We have five \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"Transformers\" movies because they're massive hits worldwide despite abysmal reviews. But there's nothing about the \"Robin Hood\" and \"King Arthur\" brands that make them uniquely appealing considering the performance of the most recent examples.\n\nMaybe Hollywood will finally get the hint after this week."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Peter Sarnoff", "title": "Verizon will begin supporting new messaging standards in 2019 (VZ)", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nVerizon announced that it will begin supporting the Rich Communications Services (RCS) messaging standard in early 2019, per The Verge. RCS is generally seen as an upgrade to the SMS text-messaging standard, as it allows mobile carriers to offer many of the same features as messaging apps, including group chat, high-resolution photo sharing, and emojis.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nVerizon won't be the first US carrier to adopt the standard, as Sprint and US Cellular also fully support RCS messaging in the region, along with limited support from T-Mobile.\n\nVerizon's impending compatibility is promising for RCS' uptake among consumers, as adding more carriers is crucial for the new standard's functionality and appeal. That's because adding interoperability between more carriers enables more users to communicate with each other regardless of their network provider.\n\nFor instance, a user on Sprint will be less likely to use RCS in general if people they normally communicate with are on networks that don't support the standard. Verizon's large subscriber base\u2014 the company boasted 154 million subscribers as of Q3 2018 \u2014 opens the standard up to a swath of new consumers, likely improving the chances more consumers will adopt the standard in the US going forward.\n\nSince more consumers are expected to adopt the standard following Verizon's compatibility, businesses would be wise to tap the standard to communicate with consumers. Here's why:\n\nRCS is poised to become more consumers' go-to messaging platform. Roughly 60% of consumers prefer to have their favorite communications functions built natively into their smartphones, as opposed to accessing them via third-party apps, and RCS enables many of the same features and functionality as third-party messaging apps.\n\nIt enables brands to communicate with consumers on their native messaging platform with smarter and more engaging tools. RCS Business Messaging enables brands to use AI-driven chatbots, present suggested replies, and leverage media such as GIFs and photos in branded messages for business-to-consumer conversations. None of these capabilities are available over the SMS standard, for comparison.\n\nAnd RCS users are steadily growing. As of November 2018, there were 172 million global monthly active users (MAU) on RCS, which is up 8% from 159 million in January 2018. Moreover, users are expected to reach 342 million by the end of 2019, according to GSMA."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "John Haltiwanger", "title": "The key differences between Ivanka Trump's and Hillary Clinton's email controversies", "description": "White House senior advisor Ivanka Trump is under fire for sending hundreds of messages related to government affairs via a personal email account.

Moss, a Washington, DC-based lawyer specializing in national security, said there are \"obvious distinctions\" between the \"severity\" of the two controversies.\n\n\"We know now how much classified information had spilled into the various e-mails sent and received by Hillary Clinton, and the risk to national security that existed as a result of that was not imaginary or overblown,\" Moss told INSIDER. \"It was a serious breach of protocol and anyone else would have had their security clearance revoked.\"\n\nBut Moss added that we know all of this because there was an \"an exhaustive two-year government investigation into the matter.\"\n\n\"No such investigation has occurred yet with respect to Ivanka's e-mail practices, so we do not yet know just how reckless she was (or, conversely, was not) compared to Hillary Clinton,\" Moss added.\n\nRead more: Ivanka Trump 'was the worst offender in the White House': Ivanka reportedly discussed government affairs using her personal email address\n\nAs Moss noted, Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, and was only the second person in that position to ever use e-mail and the agency \"had not yet really contemplated how to address the situation.\" In this context, there are some reasons to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt in terms of her dubious email practices.\n\n\"Ivanka's actions, particularly coming in the wake of a presidential election in which her father obsessed over Hillary's e-mail practices, were not merely hypocritical but bordered on inexcusable lack of awareness,\" Moss said.\n\nBetween the \"lock her up\" chants and Trump's desire to see Clinton prosecuted, Moss added that it's \"beyond absurd\" for \"Ivanka to arrive at the White House in that environment and claim with a straight face that she did not realize she could not rely exclusively on a private e-mail account to conduct official business.\"\n\nThere have already been bipartisan calls in Congress for the first daughter's emails to be investigated.

The FDA first revealed that romaine had been linked to an E. coli outbreak on April 10, and it soon after advised people across the United States to stop consuming romaine lettuce in all forms.\n\nRomaine lettuce sales plummeted by 44.9% in the week ending on April 28 compared to the same period a year before, according to Nielsen data.\n\nFor the four weeks ending on May 19, sales were down 41.4% compared to the same period in 2017.

In January, Consumer Reports was advising shoppers to avoid the lettuce, due to another E. coli outbreak that experts say is likely a precursor to the current outbreak, as the bacteria shares a genetic footprint.\n\nAll in all, romaine lettuce sales dropped by more than 15% in the first 40 weeks of 2018, a period ending on November 3, compared to the same period in 2017. That accounts for more than $71 million in lost sales in Nielsen-tracked channels.\n\nIf the earlier outbreak is the guide, things are only going to get worse. It's likely that sales will undergo another drop of more than 40% this week with the CDC advising against buying any type of romaine lettuce. Restaurants and grocery stores have already thrown out their romaine lettuce. This Thanksgiving Day, salads across the country will be romaine-free.\n\nHowever, even when romaine is declared safe again, sales are unlikely to immediately recover. The CDC declared romaine lettuce safe to eat in mid-May. However, romaine sales never turned positive in 2018 following the April outbreak, with sales compared to the same period from 2017 remaining in the red week after week. The week after the CDC announced romaine was safe to eat again, sales were down 27.8%.\n\nDespite the rough year, Bill Marler, an attorney who specializes in food poisoning cases, says there's no clear reason why romaine has been at the center of two major E. coli outbreaks.\n\n\"I think it's just, romaine's getting a bad draw,\" Marler said. \"It could have just as easily happened to other kinds of lettuce or other types of leafy greens, such as spinach.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Andy Kiersz", "title": "Here's how much more the typical baby boomer makes than the typical millennial in every US state", "description": "Older workers in the US tend to make more money than younger workers, but the extent of the income gap between generations varies among states.

These troops, deployed in addition to the more than 2,000 National Guard personnel already present at the southern border, have been hardening ports of entry and securing key crossing points. Around 11 miles of concertina (razor) wire has been put down since their arrival, the Department of Defense revealed Monday.\n\nThe migrant caravans have clashed with authorities in other countries in incidents that led President Donald Trump to suggest that troops might open fire on migrants who throw rocks, a position from which he has since backed away. The odds that border personnel will encounter violence is reportedly low, but not nonexistent.\n\nA leaked internal Department of Homeland Security document said the risk is \"minimal,\" according to The New York Times. \"C.B.P. assesses the likelihood of violence directed against C.B.P. personnel along the border is minimal,\" the document reads.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly, who signed the memo approving the new authorizations, argues that there is \"credible evidence and intelligence\" that the arrival of the migrants \"may prompt incidents of violence and disorder.\"\n\nThe military's border mission, initially designated \"Operation Faithful Patriot\" but later referred to only as \"border support,\" has drawn a significant amount of criticism since it began late last month, as critics have repeatedly called the deployment of thousands of active-duty troops to the border a political stunt, especially given the legal limitations on what they can do on US soil.\n\nThe Pentagon has pushed back against such accusations, with Secretary of Defense James Mattis saying \"we don't do stunts in this department.\" The new protection authorizations would certainly expand the mission for deployed troops, giving them the ability to intervene in the event that CBP personnel came under attack.\n\nAs migrants begin pouring into border towns, the military has been at a loss about what the next step is for the active-duty troops at the border.

For the time being, the mission at the border has not changed.\n\nIn response to questions about the use of deadly force, Mattis further explained that DHS has not made a request for the use of lethal force, stressing that troops are not even carrying firearms.\n\n\"Relax.

He was also recently named to Forbes' \"30 Under 30\" finance list.\n\nSamani started programming at age 11, but he didn't think he was born to be an entrepreneur. He went to New York University to study finance and thought he would climb the corporate ladder on Wall Street. But after college, he realized his passion was really in high-growth technology businesses and startups.\n\nIn 2013, Samani cofounded his first company, Pristine, which built Google Glass software for surgeons. Though Google Glass was not a well-received consumer product, it was an interesting tool for certain types of workers, Samani said.\n\nDespite raising over $5 million in venture capital and hiring about 30 employees, Samani ended up finding a new strategy for Pristine after Google halted consumer sales of Google Glass in 2015.\n\nIn March 2016, Samani stumbled upon Ethereum, which opened the next chapter in his life and eventually led him to the world of crypto investment. Samani said he was drawn to Ethereum because of its open-source platform.\n\n\"I felt the pain of platform risk when Google literally pulled the rug out from under me,\" he said. The idea of having an open platform where this couldn't happen was appealing to him.\n\nHe spent hours learning about cryptocurrency and launched Multicoin Capital in August 2017.\n\n\"In our early days, we were really hustlers,\" Samani said.\n\n\"When we were raising early capital, we had no brand, no track record, and no operational infrastructure,\" he added. \"We reached out to everyone in our networks, our friends, our families, our friends' friends, and the network of other entrepreneurs.\"\n\nMulticoin Capital has grown fast since then. The crypto fund now has $75 million in assets under management and is backed by mainstream investors like Marc Andreessen, the Andreessen Horowitz partner, and David Sacks, the former PayPal exec and Yammer CEO.\n\nHere's Samani's best advice for aspiring entrepreneurs:\n\nFind your passion and follow it.\n\nTo Samani, passion is the thread running through his entrepreneurial journey and supporting his working 15 to 20 hours a day.\n\n\"Follow your passions, even if starting a company is grueling and hard,\" he said. \"There are going to be days that you feel everything is going wrong. The way you will make it through this is by fixating on what you are really, truly passionate about. So, find your passion, and figure out how to do that 20 hours per day.\"\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help.\n\n\"People in the entrepreneur world come from all different majors. If you need help with meeting investors, thinking about financial modeling, and recruiting, just ask these people. Even if they are not the right person to help you, they will probably know somebody who is.\"\n\nBe thankful and gracious to the people around you.\n\n\"The entrepreneur community today is so robust and helpful. Reach out to make those people help you, and then return the favor as hard as you can. Sometimes you won't be able to return a favor, but at the very least reach out and let them know you're grateful. I just considered it as my personal mandate to pay it forward. I cannot repay a lot of help, so I pay it forward to the next batch of entrepreneurs. Be thankful, and let them know you are appreciative, and pass it forward.\"\n\nSee also:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Daniel Keyes", "title": "Target just set new digital record \u2014 at a price (TGT)", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \" E-Commerce Briefing \" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

The retailer's digital sales rose 49% YoY, the strongest performance it's ever reported in the metric, Target CFO Cathy Smith said on the company's earnings call.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThis is an acceleration from the 41% YoY increase it posted in the metric a quarter prior, and more than doubles the 24% YoY growth it saw a year ago in its fiscal Q3 2017. The channel still only accounts for 6% of Target's total sales, but that's up from 4.2% from the comparable period a year ago.\n\nCEO Brian Cornell attributed the growth to Target's efforts to make its online shopping seamless, selection attractive, and fulfillment options convenient, he said on the earnings call.\n\nBut Target's gross margin dipped during the quarter, and the increase in digital sales was chiefly responsible. It dropped to 28.7% from 29.6% in Q3 2017, and the biggest contributing factor was the cost of fulfillment for its surging digital sales, Smith said. Higher digital sales growth is extremely valuable, but if Target can't handle its rising order volume without costs rising to problematic heights, the e-commerce boost may be more trouble than it's worth.\n\nTarget needs to find ways to minimize its digital fulfillment costs, especially for the holiday season.In its fiscal Q4 2017, Target brought in over $1.8 billion in digital sales, a tremendous volume to handle. If that total grows even 40% in 2018, it'll surpass $2.5 billion, which could be extremely costly for Target to handle, particularly because it's offering free two-day shipping with no order minimum to drum up business for the holidays.\n\nThe retailer is working to automate and optimize its inventory, but those efforts to better handle fulfillment are in their early stages, Cornell said. In the meantime, Target will need to look to its less expensive existing options, which may be possible because its ship-from-store volume more than doubled in Q3, while other options held steady, COO John Mulligan said on the call.\n\nHe also added that in-store pickup accounts for 15% of Target's digital volume, and both of these options can be more affordable for Target because they shave off parts of the delivery process. If its free two-day shipping holiday offering proves extremely popular, Target may find its fulfillment costs reaching new heights, but it will welcome the accompanying digital growth."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Hillary Hoffower", "title": "The 25 US states with the highest sales tax, ranked", "description": "Your Black Friday and Cyber Monday purchases may cost a little more if you live in a state with high sales tax.

He went from waiting tables in college to founding Setter, a company that manages home maintenance projects. The startup announced a $10 million Series A, led by Sequoia Capital and NFX, in November.\n\nSteckel told Business Insider that he gained many of the skills he uses today from that early restaurant gig \u2014 the most important one being how to negotiate between customers, clients, and employees.\n\n\"If you actually think about the structure of a restaurant, you have a very similar environment to a marketplace,\" Steckel told Business Insider. \"The language you use with a customer is very different than the language you use in back-of-house with the kitchen staff.\"\n\n\"In front-of-house, the lights are warm and low, in the back they're fluorescent and bright,\" he said. \"You get back into the kitchen and you have to negotiate with the kitchen on behalf of your customer. Then you also have the bartenders who are busy trying to serve all the other waiters, so you have to negotiate with them to make sure your customers are getting what they need.\"\n\nRead more: Here's what it takes to make $100,000 a year as a waiter in NYC\n\nThat constant push and pull is similar to what Steckel said he faces at Setter. The Toronto-based company, founded in 2015, pairs customers with \"home managers\" to take charge of their home maintenance and repair projects. Whenever the customer needs their plumbing fixed, their walls painted, or their yard landscaped, for example, Setter contacts vendors and contractors, negotiates a rate, and arranges the appointment.\n\nThat's a lot of moving parts.\n\n\"You're kind of changing gears with your language, your ability to negotiate, and you're using all your skills at the same time,\" Steckel said.\n\nOf course, restaurant patrons are usually less anxious than a homeowner in need of a new countertop. Home maintenance is naturally stress-inducing for most people, Steckel said, while diners typically don't get upset unless something goes wrong.\n\nBut regardless of the situation, a good worker puts their customers' fear at ease by anticipating problems and taking action to correct them, Steckel said.\n\n\"No matter how good your restaurant is, at some point the food is going to be cold or it's going to be late,\" he told Business Insider. \"You don't just go to a table to your customer and say the food's late. You say, hey, here's something to snack on, the kitchen is a little behind, and I'm going to offer a solution.\"\n\nSteckel learned from his restaurant gig that if you're proactive about fixing a problem, customers will remember how you helped them more than they'll remember the problem itself. That leads to them having a better experience and being more likely to come back.\n\n\"If you have the ability to take a deficiency and turn it into an opportunity to add value to the customer's life, we've found their loyalty,\" he said.\n\n\"So in effect, when something goes wrong, it's an opportunity to have a better relationship.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Rachel Green", "title": "Almost half of US retailers will drop the signature requirement (MA)", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \" Payments Briefing \" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

According to a testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, 90% of Americans seek outside software and tax professionals to complete their taxes.\n\nBut even outside of the complexity that is the ever-changing tax system in the United States, there are a number of differences in the tax system that other countries benefit from.\n\nSo many countries around the world offer interesting and innovative tax cuts that citizens of the United States don't benefit from. And, according to CNBC, at least 12 countries pay notably less in taxes than Americans do.\n\nHere are 10 countries that offer tax cuts, breaks, and incentives that are not available in the US.\n\n1. The United Kingdom exempts some of your income from taxes\n\nAlthough not necessarily a tax cut, the United Kingdom exempts the first \u00a311,850 (which is roughly $15,500) made from taxes.\n\nThis means that regardless of how much you make, this first \u00a311,850 you make lands in your bank account completely tax-free. This is not the case for individuals in the US.\n\n2. New Zealand taxes its workforce less than the US does\n\nNew Zealand's method of taxation follows the \"broaden the base, lower the rates\" (BBLL) philosophy. This means that the country taxes its average workforce exponentially less than other countries, including the United States.\n\nThis implementation was a result of the sweeping elimination of deductions and write-offs that occurred in the 1980s. But it has led to New Zealand being one of the lowest-tax countries in the world while still being able to collect more tax as a percentage of GDP.\n\n3. Japan's government has automated most of their tax collection process\n\nJapan's system is mostly automated. Flickr/PhillipTaylorPT\n\nWhat is so innovative about Japan's tax structure isn't so much its tax rates, but its forward-thinking way of conducting tax filing and collection. In Japan, the government has essentially automated 80% of tax collection for households across the country.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the American tax filing and collection system, which collectively costs Americans nearly nine billion hours each year.\n\n4. Malaysia has some tax breaks for expats.\n\nWith a MM2H visa, expats can open a bank account in Malaysia and transfer as much money as they'd like, tax-free. Expats also don't have to pay income tax. Malaysia is also known as one of the countries with the lowest personal income tax rates, which is 27% at its absolute highest.\n\n5. The Bahamas doesn't tax individuals on their income\n\nCitizens of the Bahamas are not taxed on their individual income because of the high profits made from tourism. There are only capital gains taxes, capital transfer taxes, and estate taxes.\n\n6. Singapore doesn't have a foreign income tax\n\nSingapore makes this list because of its lack of foreign income tax, something many Americans would very much like to see incorporated into the US tax system. Even if your income is being paid into a Singapore bank account, don't expect it to be taxed.\n\n7. Panama has some tax breaks for those who are retired\n\nPanama is a great country for retirees as some of the more notable tax cuts Panama has to offer are reaped by the retired. This is a result of Panama's Pensionado Program.\n\nThis retirement program persuades retirees from \"Panama-friendly\" countries to enter and obtain residency as long as they show that they make at least $1,000 per month in pension for life.\n\nOnce accepted, residents can indulge in a one-time tax break for imported goods (up to $10,000). They will also get in-country perks including a percentage off entertainment, airline tickets, domestic travel tickets, energy bills, hotel stays, hospital bills, and more.\n\n8. Hungary has a fairly low corporate tax rate\n\nHungary also has investment incentives. iStock Hungary is a tax haven for corporations \u2014 it is one of the lowest-rated corporate tax companies in the world. That's thanks to its current corporate tax rate of 9%. In addition to this, big businesses also benefit from corporate tax incentive in the form of investment incentives and equipment incentives to bring more business to Hungary at lower costs.\n\n9. Canadian families with children can benefit from lowered tax rates\n\nFamilies with children benefit from exponentially-lowered family tax rates in Canada. The country also has some of the lowest tax rates for families around the globe.\n\nFamilies with children \u2014 especially low-income families \u2014 benefit from these tax breaks, which is unlike anything American families experience.\n\n10. Many countries implement a value-added tax system\n\nThe value-added tax (VAT) is a common system of taxation implemented across 160 countries in the world.The United States is one of the most notable countries that doesn't implement this system.\n\nThis system of taxation takes into consideration profits made compared to the costs required to get there. It's a consumption tax that is placed on the added value of a product or service instead of the entire product or service itself.\n\nIt's a progressive system of business taxation that gives businesses across the country more breathing room throughout the taxation process. It takes into account the fluctuations in the market and the changes in manufacturing costs so that businesses don't lose out.\n\nSome countries that implement the VAT tax include Canada, China, Russia, Poland, and Ireland."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Katie Warren", "title": "The president of a company that designs private plane interiors says ultra-wealthy clients no longer want their private jets to look like private jets", "description": "Ultra-wealthy private jet owners no longer want the interiors of their aircraft to look like a private jet.

Like Champagne, Calvados has to be grown in a certain region in order to be called Calvados, and that region is Normandy in northern France.\n\nCalvados first lives as an apple cider, made by fermenting apples. It is then distilled and aged in oak casks, where it is required to remain for at least two years to be properly classified as Calvados under the AOC (appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e).\n\nThe 30&40 team tell us there are around 400 Calvados producers in the region, each of whom has their own special combination of apple varieties and ageing processes.\n\nHow does it differ from Cognac?\n\n30&40 Calvados. 30&40\n\nFirstly, the ingredients are different.\n\nCognac is made from distilling white wine and therefore grapes, while Calvados is made from cider and therefore apples \u2014 a fundamental that B\u00e9jot claims works in their favour.\n\nWhile you might not be able to tell from tasting it that Cognac originates from wine, it's impossible to miss the appley notes and aromas in Calvados, which gives people a sense of familiarity with the agricultural product, B\u00e9jot says.\n\nIn order to abide by the AOC, Cognac must be made from 90% Ugni Blanc grapes (known as Trebbiano in Italy) and a small selection of others are allowed to make up the rest.\n\nRead more:This is the difference between Cognac and brandy, and 6 other things you didn't know about the grape-based drink\n\nCalvados, however, is a much more diverse spirit. The 30&40 duo tell me there are around 300 different varieties of apples available under the Calvados AOC, and the list is constantly growing \u2014 you just have to prove that the apples you are using are native to the Normandy region. Therefore, distillers can use dozens of different varieties of apples to make just one expression of Calvados.\n\nOn the other hand, Dutheil says: \"You will never be surprised by Cognac. You will never find that tiny farmer that makes his own Cognac \u2014 that doesn't exist because the market is too mature.\"\n\nOne of the many local producers used by 30&40. 30&40\n\nIndeed, the pair tells us that around six million bottles of Calvados are produced each year, compared to 200 million bottles of Cognac.\n\nSo why the massive disparity in output?\n\nDutheil says the divide between Cognac and Calvados goes beyond ingredients and production methods, though, and into the early modern era.\n\n\"During the 18th century, King Louis XIV passed a law that forbade people from Normandy from exporting Calvados outside the region,\" he says. \"Because one of his ministers was from Cognac.\"\n\nAs a result of Louis XIV's actions, investment and therefore production of Calvados stagnated while Cognac exports went through the roof.\n\nFurthermore, Dutheil says that a lot of the great Cognac houses were created by British owners who loved the taste of traditional French eau de vie (clear, colourless fruit brandy). The founder of Martell, for example, was a merchant from Jersey in the British Channel Islands and the founder of Hennesy was an Irish Jacobite military officer.\n\nCalvados, meanwhile, \"was a very local product for local people, so it was never very intense in terms of business,\" B\u00e9jot says.\n\nHow to serve Calvados\n\n30&40\n\nCalvados makes a good ap\u00e9ritif or dig\u00e9stif.\n\n\"The traditional way to enjoy Calvados is as an after-dinner drink,\" B\u00e9jot says.\n\n\"But, you can enjoy it like you would a good whiskey \u2014 you can enjoy it after dinner but also before a meal.\"\n\nB\u00e9jot advises serving it in a tulip-shaped glass, which will trap the aromas, and drinking neat without ice for maximum flavour \u2014 \"small wine glasses are also fine [to serve in],\" he stipulates.\n\nHowever, the pair recognises that after-dinner drinks aren't exactly \u00e0 la mode with young people of today: \"We're more seeing aperitifs; spritz-type of serves,\" B\u00e9jot says.\n\nAs such, Calvados goes great in cocktails, he adds. \"It's one of the spirits in classic cocktails like the Jack Rose, which you can find in any good classical cocktail bar.\"\n\nWhat to eat with it, and the 'Trou Normand'\n\nDrinking Calvados during a meal is actually quite a traditional way of consumption, Dutheil says.\n\n\"People in Normandy used to drink Calvados during meals because it would renew your appetite.\"\n\n\"It's what we call a Trou Normand or 'Norman hole' because it creates a new hole in your belly!\" B\u00e9jot adds.\n\nSo what food pairs with the appley liquor? \"We did something with pigeon and mushrooms. We had also lobster and a classical dessert called Paris-Brest,\" B\u00e9jot says.\n\n\"It fits well with very rich flavours.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Chloe Miller", "title": "The world's largest cruise ship just landed in Miami \u2014 here's what it's like on board", "description": "Symphony of the Seas, from Royal Caribbean, is the world's largest cruise ship.

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nSwiss drug maker Novartis and digital therapeutic firm Pear Therapeutics released the first ever FDA-authorized prescription digital therapeutic for substance use disorder. Digital therapeutics is a category of software \u2014 typically in the form of consumer-facing mobile health apps \u2014 that replaces or complements the existing treatment of a disease.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nA randomized control trial showed that when used in conjunction with outpatient therapy, Novartis and Pear's digital therapeutic improved abstinence in substance use and increased adherence to treatment programs compared with patients who only received outpatient therapy.\n\nAddressing substance use disorder is a pressing industry issue: Drug overdose deaths hit a new annual high in 2017 with more than 72,000 fatalities, per the CDC. And healthcare costs caused by the opioid epidemic were more than $200 billion between 2001 and 2017, according to Altarum.\n\nThe new therapeutic advances Novartis' move beyond pill-based therapeutics and toward health management. Providers are increasingly turning to digital health for novel treatment options, and Novartis is padding its offerings with digital services to differentiate and make it a more attractive option to clients.\n\nFor example, Novartis and Pear announced in March that they're developing digital products that can be prescribed alongside Novartis' medication to improve the treatment of schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis (MS). The drugmaker is also one of the most active investors in healthcare technologies, including telemedicine platforms, point-of-care diagnostics, and oncology therapeutics, according to CB Insights.\n\nNovartis' bet on digital therapeutics makes sense as it's becoming a high growth segment of digital health. New use cases, increasing interest from the FDA, and pharma companies like Novartis seeking new revenue channels are driving growth in digital therapeutics. One of the primary barriers to app-based therapeutics hitting the mainstream is uncertainty around reimbursement.\n\nPayers may be reluctant to compensate providers for prescribing digital therapeutics without a complete understanding of the software's cost-effectiveness, and doctors are unlikely to deliver a treatment they won't get compensated for.\n\nWith a growing stock of clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of digital therapeutics, however, we should see more payers embracing the tech. We expect adoption of digital therapeutics to grow at an annualized rate of 90% between 2018 and 2023, to reach 110 million users by 2023."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kif Leswing", "title": "Foxconn is slashing costs ahead of a 'difficult' year \u2013 and it's the latest warning sign for Apple (AAPL)", "description": "Foxconn, Apple 's top manufacturing partner, has reportedly said that the upcoming year could be \"very difficult and competitive\" and that it is planning to slash expenses, according to Bloomberg.

Reuters/Kevin Lamarque Regardless of whether Foxconn is simply going through a regular belt-tightening period, the disclosure is sure to spark speculation after recent reports have pointed to a major slowdown in iPhone demand.\n\nBefore Foxconn's warning and earnings shortfall, several suppliers of iPhone components had warned about orders being cut. Lumentum, Skyworks, and Qorvo, which count Apple as a top customer, all have slashed future estimates, with each blaming the shortfall on order cuts from an unnamed major customer. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Apple had cut production orders for all iPhone models, blaming weak demand.\n\nWall Street analysts are also worried iPhone unit sales will start shrinking in the short term. Those concerns are believed to be why Apple decided to stop reporting unit sales, which analysts relied on as a key metric. Apple said it preferred to focus on its transition to a services company, with regular recurring revenue.\n\nApple's share price has declined over 20% since its October peak, costing the company over $265 billion in market value.\n\nOf course, Foxconn doesn't just manufacture Apple products. It's also the manufacturer for other computer and phone brands as well as gadgets like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch. Foxconn's latest announcement may reflect a cooling global market for premium electronics rather than weakness specific to Apple.\n\nFoxconn is also spending billions on the construction of a factory in Wisconsin. It's unclear whether Foxconn's cost cuts may affect that plant, which President Donald Trump called an \"incredible investment.\"\n\nBut regardless, all signs from companies that count Apple as a customer are now pointing to an impending slow period for sales and growth."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Myelle Lansat and Richard Feloni", "title": "A former GE and NBC exec who never got her MBA spent the first 90 days as an exec reading textbooks and embracing what she didn't know", "description": "When Beth Comstock was hired as chief marketing officer for General Electric, she spent her first 90 days on the job learning about the basics of marketing.

CYBG, which will integrate the fintech's service into its existing digital banking platform, says the venture will allow it to add an innovative channel to its current personal lending business, per the FT.\n\nThe deal evidences the growth of the salary financing segment in recent years. Big-name backers of fintechs in the sector include insurer Legal & General, which led SalaryFinance's \u00a340 million ($51 million) Venture round last year as well as its most recent $20 million Series B. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs marked its first investment into the UK's consumer lending market when it provided \u00a3100 million ($129 million) of debt and equity financing last year to SalaryFinance competitor Neyber.\n\nThese fintechs are particularly attractive to large financial institutions (FIs) because integrating with employers' payrolls makes their loans more secure \u2014 SalaryFinance's default rate, for instance, is 0.5%. The startup says this security allows it to offer its customers cheaper rates than other short-term loan products like credit cards or payday loans \u2014 it claims to offer customers typical savings of \u00a3600 ($772) over the course of an average loan of \u00a32,900 ($3,727).\n\nPartnerships of this kind allow fintechs and FIs to leverage each other's competitive advantages. According to SalaryFinance, 17 million working adults in the UK have savings of less than \u00a3100 ($129), giving it a huge addressable market to target. By partnering with an incumbent bank like CYBG, it can significantly increase its capacity to underwrite loans, allowing to capture a wider share of this space.\n\nFor banks like CYBG, partnering with fintechs offers them access to growing segments like salary-based financing, without having to fork out the technology investments made by the largest banks. Going forward, we're likely to see partnerships of this kind \u2014 between incumbents that don't have the same resources as market leaders and fintechs looking to scale their operations \u2014 mushroom significantly."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tanya Dua", "title": "What you need to know in advertising today", "description": "Facebook's advertising platform suffered from a major outage.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.\"\n\nThirteen years after Jobs delivered that speech, business executives are finding a way to reach a similar epiphany: by writing their own eulogies. According to Fast Company, the exercise is becoming increasingly common in the business world, both in the US and in China.\n\nThe reasoning behind the exercise is that by imagining what might be said about you at your funeral, you'll gain clarity on what kind of person you want to be and what changes you'll need to make to achieve that.\n\nThe practice dates back decades, and has been recommended by therapists, psychologists, and business coaches.\n\n\"When we take the time to write our eulogies, it creates this magnetic pull power that draws us forward,\" executive coach Daniel Harkavy told Fast Company. \"Our priorities and our vision for where we want to be as leaders and how we'll get there come into sharp focus. This clarity enables us to make the best decisions, get up out of our comfortable patterns, create new habits, and start moving us toward a better future.\"\n\nRead more: Obituary writers reveal the surprising things they learn by writing about the dead\n\nScience seems to support the benefits of the eulogy technique, too. A 2012 study from the University of Missouri found that thinking about death can lead to positive changes in a person such as exercising, quitting smoking, and using sunscreen. It also found that thoughts of mortality \"can lead to decreased militaristic attitudes, better health decisions, increased altruism and helpfulness, and reduced divorce rates.\"\n\nAnother paper from 2015 found that when people were reminded of death, it made them less likely to waste money in the present.\n\nThe research suggests why people stand to benefit from writing their own eulogies, and it's something Jobs alluded to in his famous speech:\n\n\"Death is very likely the single best invention of life,\" Jobs said. \"It is life's change agent.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kate Taylor", "title": "Americans are avoiding romaine lettuce after another E. coli outbreak \u2014 and it reveals one of the most dangerous grocery-store habits", "description": "The CDC recommended on Tuesday that Americans avoid all forms of romaine lettuce.

A CDC study found that, from 1998 to 2008, leafy greens were associated with more incidents of food poisoning than any other type of food.\n\nWhile cooking veggies and meat can kill germs, many leafy greens are eaten raw. Salads, in particular, are a food-poisoning risk, as they bring together a number of raw foods that have had countless opportunities for contamination.\n\nShoppers and restaurants that buy pre-chopped lettuce from suppliers put themselves at even greater risk. The process of washing, cutting, and bagging food increases the likelihood that it will become tainted, according to Bill Marler, a lawyer who specializes in cases of food poisoning. Marler says he avoids precut and prewashed fruit and vegetables \"like the plague.\"\n\nA 2010 study by Consumer Reports found \"unacceptable\" levels of bacteria that commonly cause food poisoning in about a third of the 208 salad bags tested. That doesn't mean these bacteria actually caused an illness \u2014 just that they had the potential to do so.\n\nHowever, romaine lovers may find themselves confused about one last fact \u2014 why has this particular leafy green caused so many problems in 2018?

I need to have at least some understanding of what the documents cover, but the idea of frantically scanning is painful.\n\nInstead, I can try searching directly in the document using CTRL-F. By searching for keywords, I can whizz through my document and find the most relevant portions.\n\nCTRL-Shift-Click\n\nThe process of adding documents one-by-one to my cloud storage or email attachment can be tedious and time consuming. If I wanted to attach all the documents, a simple CTRL-A would suffice, but for more selective uploads that solution isn't always helpful.\n\nInstead, I can press CTRL-Shift and simply select each document I'd like to add and have them all added at the same time.\n\nCTRL-M\n\nIn the age of multitasking, I often have multiple programs running on my computer at any given time. To cut through the noise I use CTRL-M to quickly minimize any other windows I may have opened and return to my desktop.\n\nCTRL-W\n\nAnother live saver for chronic multitaskers is the shortcut CTRL-W, which helps me close any program, tab, or window I have open without having to mouse over and manually exit. Without removing my hands from the keyboard, I simply continue pressing W until my screen has returned to a state of tranquility.\n\nWindows-L\n\nCaught watching cat videos at work or during a lecture? With one click of Windows-L I can lock my computer's screen in a matter of seconds and escape an inevitable reprimand for being off-task \u2014 and better yet, get back to watching that cat when the coast is clear.\n\nCTRL-D\n\nI often find myself overwhelmed by the number of tabs I've opened in my web browser and sometimes have trouble bringing myself to monotonously bookmark and close each one. But by using CTRL-D, I can automatically bookmark interesting pages as I open them and relieve myself (and my RAM) of the burden of 15-plus open tabs. But be careful not to select anything before you press it, or you might accidentally delete it.\n\nCTRL-PrtScr\n\nA shortcut that embarrassingly eluded my knowledge for years, CTRL-PrtScr is the one-stop shop for all my screenshotting needs. If I want to capture an important message, funny photo, or video still, this shortcut will take a shot of my current screen and save it to my clipboard to be pasted wherever I choose.\n\nCTRL-Shift-V\n\nYou've probably heard about CTRL-V - the keyboard shortcut that allows you to paste items from your computer's clipboard. But its cousin, CTRL-Shift-V, is equally if not more useful. This shortcut also allows me to paste from my clipboard, but it pastes everything as plain text, meaning that any strange formatting I might have brought over when I copied the item won't disrupt the formatting I already have.\n\nAlt-Arrow\n\nIf you've ever fallen down a Google rabbit hole, you'll know how important it is to be able to claw your way back out. By pressing Alt and either the right or left arrow key in a browser I can easily move backwards or forwards in my own search history and find my way back to where I started searching.\n\nRead more: 60 time-saving keyboard shortcuts every office worker should know\n\nShift-Arrow\n\nCtrl-C is probably one of the most popular keyboard shortcuts, but actually selecting the text I want to copy can be frustrating with glitchy trackpads and mice. This shortcut allows me to more delicately select the exact text I want by using the arrow keys.\n\nCTRL-Shift-T\n\nI have a nasty habit of overwhelming my browser (and myself) with many, many open tabs. Often the tabs are left open as a reminder to myself of something I need to do, so you can imagine my panic when those tabs are accidentally closed. But with CTRL-Shift-T, on a Google Chrome browser, I can easily rescue them from the grave. The shortcut lets me reopen any recently closed tabs and saves me the trouble of starting my searching again from scratch."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Avery Hartmans", "title": "The career rise of Angela Ahrendts, from a small town in Indiana to becoming the highest-paid executive at Apple (AAPL)", "description": "Angela Ahrendts currently serves as Apple's head of retail.

If you want to jazz up your pot a little, consider the cork-topped plunger. Bodum, though a Danish company, makes its French Presses in Portugal, which is, after all, the cork capital of the world.\n\nReviews of the Bodum Chambord on Amazon are largely positive (about 3,000, rounding out to 4.2/5 stars), but a good number of them complain about the same thing: The stainless steel frame that holds the carafe in place is wont to warp over time, especially if you're not careful when you remove the carafe. That would be more or less fine if the plastic handle weren't supported by it on one side with no fastener.\n\nAs a result, the handle tends to slip out of the frame once it's been bent, and that's how catastrophe takes place. I've noticed this myself and had one or two close calls over the years, but I was able to bend it back into place which, touch wood, has held. Still, it's certainly an inconvenience. What's more inconvenient is a limited one year warranty that doesn't cover the glass.\n\nBut, while this press may be sort of fragile, and the warranty may not be terribly encouraging, it's fairly inexpensive and does its job well. Just treat it carefully, and be sure to let it cool down before cleaning. Although it is heat-resistant, borosilicate becomes much less stable when heated up. Otherwise, consider investing a little more in a stainless steel model. Glass is still glass, for now. \u2014 Owen Burke\n\nPros: Affordable, easy to use, attractive design\n\nCons: Plastic handle, delicate frame-to-handle attachment, strainer allows some grounds to get through"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Peter Kotecki", "title": "Sleep deprivation can be dangerous \u2014 here's how long you can hold off sleep without life-or-death consequences", "description": "Sleep deprivation can produce a series of dangerous symptoms, including cognitive losses and anxiety.

Those who sleep less than seven hours per night may show symptoms such as anxiety and depression, and sleep deprivation has been linked to obesity, diabetes, poor decision-making, and decreased concentration.\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley neuroscientist Matthew Walker said in a previous interview with Business Insider that a lack of sleep can also negatively impact one's cardiovascular health.

Some researchers said the rats' immune systems failed and allowed bacteria to kill the rats. Others said sleep deprivation led to fatal brain damage, while a third theory argued the rats' body temperature became so low that they died from hypothermia.\n\nRegardless of the reason, the researchers believed that the prolonged sleep deprivation produced symptoms so severe that the rats could not survive. In humans, researchers have only observed serious psychological effects like hallucinations, as the research has not gone beyond a couple days of sleep deprivation.\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation's most recent guidelines, released in 2015, warn against straying too far from sleep recommendations.

Exposure to noises as low as 65 decibels \u2014 about as loud as the hum of an air conditioner \u2014 can increase your blood pressure, heart rate, and the stress hormones in your blood, according to Ted Rueter, founder of Noise Free America.\n\nAfter learning all that, I started to wonder how I could prevent not only my daily noise-related stress, but also the potential long-term damage to my hearing.\n\nThe answer lies with noise-canceling headphones.\n\nNoise-canceling headphones generate sound waves that are designed to cancel out most outside noise, making them helpful in reducing your exposure to noise pollution. Also, because they nullify ambient noises, you're likely to listen to your music at a lower volume.\n\nI wore a pair of noise-canceling headphones around New York City for a week to see if they would boost my quality of life and protect my hearing. Here's what I found.\n\nThe headphones\n\nBose's QuietComfort 35 noise-canceling headphones Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nWhen I set out on this project, I wasn't sure which headphones to try. But after a few days searching for the best options on the market, I decided on Bose's QuietComfort 35.\n\nThe headphones, which are now in their second generation, are almost universally beloved. Both my sister and boyfriend own them and can't stop talking about how great they are. Meanwhile, my colleague Tony called them his \"go-to pair of headphones for everyday use\" when he reviewed them earlier this year.\n\nThe headphones cancel or muffle most ambient noise, they sound great, and best of all, they're incredibly comfortable.\n\nTheir only downside is that they cost $350, which is more than I would normally be comfortable paying for headphones. Luckily, there are deals on them from time to time \u2014 right now, you can find them for $50 off, according to CNET.\n\nThe results\n\nI wore the QuietComfort 35s as much as I possible could over the course of more than a week. I wore them every day during my commute, on walks during my lunch break, and occasionally at the office. (I don't typically like wearing headphones while I work, but I tried it for this experiment.) I used the headphones for listening to music, making calls, and occasionally just to block out the ambient noise.\n\nThe result: A major boost in my quality of life.\n\nHere's what I noticed:\n\nI slept better. I felt less stress, and as a result, I slept more deeply and clenched my jaw less than I normally do.\n\nI felt less stress, and as a result, I slept more deeply and clenched my jaw less than I normally do. I was more relaxed and focused when I started work each morning. My 20- to 30-minute commute went by more quickly and seemed easier than ever before.\n\nMy 20- to 30-minute commute went by more quickly and seemed easier than ever before. I was less stressed when I returned home from work. Usually when I get home at the end of the workday, I'm a little cranky and need some time to unwind and relax. But when I arrived home after wearing the QuietComfort 35s, I was in a much better mood than normal.\n\nUsually when I get home at the end of the workday, I'm a little cranky and need some time to unwind and relax. But when I arrived home after wearing the QuietComfort 35s, I was in a much better mood than normal. My neck aches and headaches were more mild. I'm prone to getting terrible migraine and tension headaches, and knots in my neck and shoulders. Those didn't disappear completely, but I noticed that after wearing the headphones, I wasn't constantly massaging my neck. And I went more than a week without taking ibuprofen.\n\nI'm prone to getting terrible migraine and tension headaches, and knots in my neck and shoulders. Those didn't disappear completely, but I noticed that after wearing the headphones, I wasn't constantly massaging my neck. And I went more than a week without taking ibuprofen. I enjoyed my music more. Listening to music on my train ride and walks can be an exercise in frustration, since I'm always having to adjust the volume, trying to balance between having it loud enough to hear but not too loud to hurt my ears. The in-ear headphones I typically wear have never been comfortable for me \u2014 I'm always having to jam them back in my ears. But with the Bose headphones, which are an over-the-ear design, I didn't have to worry about any of that and could just zone out and enjoy my songs.\n\nListening to music on my train ride and walks can be an exercise in frustration, since I'm always having to adjust the volume, trying to balance between having it loud enough to hear but not too loud to hurt my ears.

Perhaps most importantly, I enjoyed city life more. It's a privilege to live and work in New York, but it can also by physically and psychologically taxing. It's easy to get worn down by the daily grind of life here. Being able to block out the city's excessive noise makes living here significantly less stressful and makes me appreciate the sights and people much more. (That being said, it's extra important to be visually aware of your surroundings when you're wearing headphones that muffle noises such as car horns and sirens.)\n\nAdditionally, I felt like I was doing a better job of protecting my hearing \u2014 although I realize that may have just been my perception.\n\nNoise-canceling headphones are expensive. Most people don't have a spare $350 or more to spend on such a device.\n\nBut to me, a few hundred dollars seemed like a small price to pay for better health and a happier life."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "The farm-equipment maker Deere slumps after missing on earnings and signaling slower sales growth amid the trade war with China (DE)", "description": "The farm-equipment maker Deere missed on both the top and bottom lines.

In a world where more and more shopping happens online, Walgreens is trying to figure out what it'll take to get you to visit one of its 9,560 US stores.\n\n\"We're in transformation mode,\" Richard Ashworth, Walgreens' president of operations, told Business Insider.\n\nAshworth is doing all this to keep up with customer behavior, which has been changing much faster than it has in past decades. \"Everything has changed\" in just the past eight years, he said.\n\nAshworth said customers wanted to be able to shop more quickly and conveniently. And they're making many of their purchases online.\n\nWalgreens is up against stiff competition for customers, facing off against the likes of Amazon, which is getting into the pharmacy business through its acquisition of the online pharmacy PillPack; CVS Health, which is making a big bet on the healthcare aspect of its business through the pending acquisition of the insurer Aetna; and of course the retail giant Walmart.\n\nFor its part, Walgreens may be looking to strike up a closer relationship with a health insurer as well. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Walgreens and Humana were considering taking equity stakes in each other. Walgreens is already partnering with Humana to run primary-care clinics out of some of its stores in the Kansas City area.\n\n\"The pharmacy business model is under more direct attack from disruptive players than are health plans,\" the Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said Wednesday.

Yet the \"fools\" are winning. Anyone who bought the stock before the launch of iPhones XS, XS Max, and XR is now poorer.\n\nApple's stock performance this year. Google\n\nThe reasons for Apple's decline aren't a secret:\n\nCEO Tim Cook announced he would no longer disclose iPhone unit sales numbers \u2014 and investors have concluded it means those numbers aren't going to look good. Sales are flat.\n\nSeveral iPhone parts suppliers revealed they had received a cut in orders, implying a reduction in iPhone manufacturing in the region of 15 million units.\n\nGoldman Sachs downgraded its target price for AAPL twice this month on the news.\n\nThe debate among investors now looks like this: Is Apple stuck in a rut with a phone that won't grow? Or is this the dark before the dawn, as Apple raises prices and gets more revenues from selling music and apps?\n\nAt least one investor is clear: Buy aggressively on the dip.\n\nThe bull case looks like this\n\nApple has successfully raised prices on its products and will continue to do so. Sure, the smartphone market is now tapped out. There will be no future bump in iPhone sales. But the average selling price of an iPhone has risen $220 since 2008, or 40%. The future is all about revenue growth.\n\nIn addition, services revenue (apps, music, and so on) was up 17% year-on-year in Apple's Q3 earnings this year. As Apple's existing \"installed base\" of iPhones continues to grow \u2014 it will hit 1 billion phones by the end of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan and his team \u2014 the market for those services will also grow.\n\nThe bears aren't so sure\n\nGuggenheim analysts Robert Cihra and Amil Patel argued in a recent note to clients that Apple may have raised the price of the iPhone pretty much as far as it can.\n\nOf that 40% increase since 2008, \"nearly HALF of all that just came in FY18 alone,\" they wrote. Apple cannot repeat that year after year. So it's possible that the days of revenue growth on increases in selling prices are over.\n\nAnd while the installed base feels like a huge advantage, it has also repeatedly failed to deliver. Analysts used to think that the installed base would produce \"super cycles\" of new buyers as each new iPhone was launched.\n\nAs the base got bigger, and the phones inside it got older, a larger number of people would need a new phone every year, they argued. That never happened.\n\nIn Europe and North America, consumers are keeping their iPhones for three years. Back in the day, they reupped every two years. In China, it's 3.6 years. And in the rest of the world, it's 4.4 years, on Bank of America's numbers.\n\nRead more: Apple will no longer report iPhone numbers after growth went to 0%, and analysts are now worried iPhone sales may decline\n\nNow, some analysts are pinning their hopes on the idea that the installed base will boost services revenue. You can buy limitless apps and songs, even on a really old phone. That's the theory, according to Katy Huberty and her team at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\"As the smartphone market matures, services takes the growth baton from devices, which ultimately results in more stable growth and higher margins at Apple,\" she recently told clients.\n\nA lot of poor people now own very old iPhones\n\nApple's future growth won't come from the iPhone, according to Guggenheim. Guggenheim\n\nBut Mohan is skeptical. The base is full of really old phones for a reason \u2014 price-conscious consumers can't afford to continuously pay more for newer products. The base partly detracts from Apple's ability to grow sales because it is full of less well-off people, he argued.\n\n\"As growth migrates to the secondary market, which we view as more price-conscious consumers, we view a lower initial services attach.

So they found a way around the banks and received what's called \"seller financing,\" where the home buyer pays the home seller in a series of payment installments.\n\nEventually, Hefets' family built up enough equity in their home through the payment installments to qualify for a mortgage from the bank. With the mortgage, her parents were able to refinance their home, take out cash, and buy other rental properties.\n\n\"I was probably the only 10 year old who knew how to fix a clogged sink,\" Hefets told Business Insider in a recent interview. \"[It] was not a very useful skill to have then, but surprisingly useful now.\"\n\nThat's because Hefets and her co-founder Brian Ma have created a real-estate startup called Divvy, which emulates the idea of seller financing. Potential home buyers in Cleveland, Memphis, and Atlanta (the company's first markets) who may not qualify for traditional bank mortgages can work with Divvy to receive alternative financing options and build toward owning the home.\n\nDivvy buys homes outright and customers pay the company back in a series of monthly payments \u2014 25% of which goes toward building equity and 75% goes toward paying \"rent,\" which is how Divvy makes its revenue.\n\nHefets explains that Divvy requires a 2% down payment from customers so that they have \"some skin in the game.\" Over a three-year period, customers will build toward owning 10% of the home, at which point they've built enough equity to apply for a mortgage.\n\nA major pain point in the housing market\n\nIn October, Divvy raised a $30 million Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from others like Affirm CEO Max Levchin. Hefets \u2014 who serves as the company's COO \u2014 tells us that in its first year, Divvy helped buy homes for over 100 people and has had over 20,000 people sign up for an application.\n\n\"We've found a really huge pain point in the market,\" Hefets tells us. \"People are really excited about finding alternative financing and are starting to gravitate towards Divvy.\"\n\nHefets \u2014 who started her career in private equity \u2014 tells us that Divvy's program of payment installments is a lot less risky for buyers than a traditional mortgage.\n\n\"The customers do feel like they're owning a home and they are building up equity within in it. The difference is that we're doing it in a more manageable way where it's not as risky as being like, 'Here's an entire home and a giant mortgage,' which is a lot of responsibility for some folks to take on,\" Hefets said. \"We're not pushing [customers] to take on debt. Instead, we're letting [them] build up equity which is nothing but wealth creation and savings.\"\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup currently has 15 employees, and its COO says its official mission is getting 100,000 families their first homes.\n\n\"That's what we're trying to do in the next, no more than five years. We want 100,000 homes,\" Hefets said. \"We want that to be the first home that a family can buy and we want it to be the stepping stone that allows people to transition from renting to eventually owning their own homes.\"\n\nStill, there are plenty of challenges.\n\nThe emotions of buying a home\n\nAs a team, one of Divvy's core values is to \"check the upstairs plumbing,\" which Hefets explains to mean, \"don't ever miss anything.\" That value is especially important when it comes to home inspections. In the past, Hefets and her team have decided against buying certain homes, even if a customer said it was their \"dream home,\" because of issues like a leaky roof or termites.\n\nThat can lead to a range of emotions from potential customers.\n\n\"It's the largest consumer purchase that they're ever going to make in their lives, so it's super emotional,\" Hefets explains. \"Which means what we're doing is more exciting, but probably harder than what I had given it credit for.\"\n\nFor every hard conversation though, there are plenty of positive ones. Hefets tell us of a conversation she recently had with a customer who just had his home approved.\n\n\"I got on the phone with one of our customers who's typically a very serious guy. We're on the phone and it's like, 'Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. I agree. I don't agree.' Super formal,\" Hefets explains. \"At the end of the call he said, 'Miss Adena, I want you to know that my mom tells me I don't tell people enough how I'm feeling.

They enjoy spending time in their rooms, whereas the boys spend all their time playing games on their upper decks.\"\n\nCristobal Palma / Estudio Palma\n\nGustavo Utrabo and Pedro Duschenes, directors of Aleph Zero, said: \"It has been a joy to see the children making the building their own and adapting the space to fit their needs.\n\n\"We wanted to be prescriptive without being overbearing, to be supportive without being patronising, and to encourage growth and development without cosseting it.\"\n\nMarcelo Rosenbaum and Adriana Benguela, directors of Rosenbaum, said: \"This award strengthens our understanding of architecture as a tool for social transformation, a tool that transcends construction and creates a deep connection between young people and their ancestors and knowledge.\n\nLeonardo Finotti\n\n\"The space facilitates the interaction between public and private, and socialising between the collective, nature and the individual, reconnecting children and young people to their origins and with their surrounding ecosystem.\"\n\nThe RIBA International Prize is awarded just once every two years and is billed as one of the world's most rigorously judged architecture awards.\n\nEach longlisted building is visited in person by a group of international experts before being handed to a grand jury, who visit the final shortlisted four buildings."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Isobel Asher Hamilton", "title": "'They treat us like disposable parts': An Amazon warehouse worker is waging war on working conditions in a new anonymous newspaper column", "description": "An Amazon worker has begun writing a column in The Guardian about the working conditions and corporate culture at Amazon's warehouses.

That said, they're both most likely true.\n\nNo US inspector ever entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul where the October 2 killing took place. It was two weeks before any outside inspector set foot in that consulate.\n\nRead more: Here's everything we know about the troubling disappearance and death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nIn fact, almost all of what the public knows about Khashoggi's killing has been leaked to the Turkish media from anonymous Turkish intelligence sources. Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has purged its press, military, and spy services to the point where none are independent.\n\n\"Members of the Turkish political establishment are looking to use this crisis for the benefit of Turkey,\" Sanam Vakil, a senior consulting research fellow in the Middle East North Africa Programme, told Business Insider.\n\nJuicy leaks from Turkish intelligence can be read as an attempt to force a recalibration of US-Saudi ties, Vakil said. (You can read more on that subject here.)\n\nFor over a month now, a steady drip of leaks has provided ever more grisly details about the killing, keeping the story in the news and keeping the pressure on leaders day after day.\n\nBut if Turkey is so sure that Crown Prince Mohammed had Khashoggi killed in Istanbul, then why hasn't it moved against him either?\n\nErdogan has described Khashoggi's death as a murder ordered by the \"highest levels\" of Saudi leadership, but he's made no formal charges over the killing even though it took place in his country.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said of Turkey's unofficial accusations: \"They are leaks that have not been officially announced, and I have noticed that they are based on an assessment, not conclusive evidence.\"\n\nNo European leader has blamed Crown Prince Mohammed, either. Germany barred some of the men charged by Saudi Arabia, widely seen as accomplices or scapegoats, and cut arms sales to the kingdom. The US did pretty much the same with sanctions and scaling back its military support for the war in Yemen.\n\n\"I don't think that Washington or Paris or London are looking necessarily to sanction MBS personally\" but rather wish for more accountability from the kingdom, Vakil said, referring to the crown prince by his initials.\n\nBut for all the outrage over Trump's indelicate statement, what's the alternative?\n\nWhat does putting \"America First\" in regard to Saudi policy look like? Essentially, it comes down to keeping a US-friendly regime in place in Riyadh.\n\nThe US has no alternative to the crown prince, Tony Badran, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Business Insider.\n\nIf Trump called on Crown Prince Mohammed to step down, essentially regime change in Saudi Arabia, it could end horrifically for the US.\n\n\"The potential for destabilization is there,\" Badran said. \"The whole approach of people calling for this flippantly, breathlessly, is just absurd. You cannot possibly imagine how the dynamics are going to go. You can't game it out.\"\n\nFor years, Al Qaeda has argued that \"the Saudi regime stands only as a tool of the Americans and that if you destabilize the relationship then the Saudi relationship falls and [Al Qaeda] will inherit the place,\" Badran said.\n\nThe world's 1.6 billion Muslims are all required by their faith to visit the Saudi city of Mecca in their lifetime.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia, the custodian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, came under the power of an openly anti-US regime, it could cause incalculable damage to the US.\n\nTrump is still wrong, though\n\nTrump delivering a speech at the Arab-Islamic-American Summit in Riyadh in 2017.

Screenshot/Twitter/Hatice Cengiz\n\nMuch of the US press has fumed over Trump's handling of Khashoggi's death, given his role as a journalist writing columns for The Washington Post.\n\nBut Khashoggi, who died at 59, spent 57 years in Saudi Arabia, spending much of that time working as an operative for the kingdom in its pre-reform days. He worked closely with Osama bin Laden in the 1990s before cutting ties after September 11, 2001. After that he worked closely with Saudi intelligence as an operative.\n\nAt The Post, he advocated changes in Saudi's government once Crown Prince Mohammed took power and started on his attempts to overhaul the Saudi economy and introduce some social reform.\n\nIn his last column for The Post, Khashoggi said the Arab world most needed a free press.\n\n\"A state-run narrative dominates the public psyche, and while many do not believe it, a large majority of the population falls victim to this false narrative,\" Khashoggi wrote. \"Sadly, this situation is unlikely to change.\"\n\nIronically, Khashoggi's death turned much of the US media into an outlet for foreign intelligence services and state narratives aimed at harming the US-Saudi alliance, which may not be in the best interest of the US public."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sponsor Post", "title": "Help your business thrive through challenging times with Agile", "description": "The philosopher Heraclitus observed, \u201c Everything changes and nothing stands still. \u201d Although not directed at business leaders, this phrase nevertheless rings true.

British business leaders are faced with numerous changes that threaten revenues in 2019:\n\nTechnological change. Fierce competition and market disruptors. Economic uncertainty (perhaps due to Brexit negotiations and other geopolitical developments).\n\nHow can we tackle these challenges? Traditional business practices such as restructuring, adjusting personnel, and change management have their place, but are not enough. There is a \"third way\" executives can adopt: Agile.\n\nWhat is Agile?\n\nAgile is a mindset that enables businesses to succeed in uncertain environments. When coined as a term in 2001, Agile described a common set of principles shared by several approaches to software development. Today, an Agile way of working delivers higher quality products in a shorter time, no matter what is being created.\n\nIncreasingly, executives across the UK are seeking Agile coaching and training to create an Agile culture throughout the organisation, from HR to the C-suite. The Agile approach they turn to most often is Scrum.\n\nWhat is Scrum?\n\nScrum is an Agile approach that relies on teams to deliver products in short cycles, enabling fast feedback, continual improvement, and rapid adaptation to change.\n\nImagine a business needs to build a new product for their customers. It could be anything from a new financial platform to an advertising video or even a car engine. Traditionally, the company might create the product using a 'conveyor belt' methodology: The product starts in one department, then is passed to another department where they work on their piece, then pass it on again until it ends up at its final delivery point. Often by the time it arrives, it no longer matches the needs of an ever-changing market.\n\nNow, imagine a Scrum team. A Scrum team breaks the new product into small batches of functionality that can be completed in short timeframes. Each batch is created by a cross-functional team who have the skills necessary to bring the product from idea to delivery, without transferring it down a conveyor belt of handoffs. As each batch is completed, the customers and stakeholders give feedback that informs the next batch of functionality. This cycle repeats until the full product is delivered \u2014 a product that meets customer needs because the business had the opportunity to adjust the fit at the end of each time frame.\n\nCan Scrum help my business?\n\nResearch by Forbes Insights in collaboration with Scrum Alliance shows that of businesses who adopted Scrum, six out of ten have experienced a faster time to market and faster innovation. It is no surprise, then, that this same study found that two-thirds of executives now see Agility as an essential part of their company's DNA. Scrum and Agile help businesses be more productive, drive higher customer satisfaction, and lead to increased team morale.\n\nEverything changes. As a leader it is down to you to ensure that you are fully engaged with the transformation, so your business is not left behind.\n\nIf, like most business leaders surveyed, you'd like to learn more about Agile, you might start here.\n\nThis post is sponosred by Scrum Alliance. | Content written and provided by Scrum Alliance."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Isobel Asher Hamilton", "title": "NASA is launching a safety review of SpaceX after Elon Musk smoked weed live on the internet", "description": "NASA will launch a safety review of SpaceX and Boeing, who it has contracted to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, The Washington Post reports.

Most critically, a preliminarily agreement to cooperate on oil and gas exploration, a move that is likely to rile the many Filipinos wary of Chinese territorial expansionism and untrusting of Beijing's intentions.\n\nA 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a case filed by Manila clarified, among other issues, that the Philippines had sovereign rights to the energy reserves at around Reed Bank. It also put to bed China's nine-dash line claim to swathes of the region, which the senate said was \"unlawful and expansive.\"\n\nThe ruling brought many Filipinos out onto the streets in support.\n\nWhen China subsequently rejected the Hague tribunal's ruling outright, that support quickly turned to fury.\n\nActivists raise clinched fists as they march towards the Chinese consulate for a protest in Manila on February 10, 2018, against Beijing's claims in the South China Sea after installing military facilities and equipment on them.

But according to Silver, all of that could change soon.\n\nSilver spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday about his expectation that the NBA will have a woman head coach soon. According to Kevin Draper of the New York Times, Silver hopes that the NBA will become the first major professional men's sports league in the United States to employ a female head coach.\n\n\"We are very focused on a woman being a head coach in our league,\" Silver said, per the New York Times. \"I am very confident it is going to happen at some point.\"\n\nSilver named San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon, Washington Mystics guard and Washington Wizards player development assistant Kristi Toliver, and Seattle Storm star and newly-appointed Denver Nuggets basketball operation associate Sue Bird as likely candidates to break the NBA's glass ceiling.\n\nLongtime San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich has high praise for assistant coach Becky Hammon. ESPN\n\nFormer WNBA stars Lindsey Harding and Jenny Boucek also currently hold positions with NBA franchises and could advance through the ranks in the coming years.\n\nBack in March of 2017, Silver told ESPN's Ohm Youngmisuk that he hopes a female ascends to the helm of one of the NBA's teams \"sooner rather than later.\" In that same interview, Silver addressed the lack of gender diversity among the league's officiants.\n\n\"It would be my goal as we look to increase that pool of officials that we recruit equally from pools of potential women as we do from men,\" Silver told Youngmisuk. \"We will be looking very hard at dramatically increasing the representation of women in our officiating ranks.\"\n\nHe has already begun to make good on that promise. The league recently promoted two female referees to full-time positions, making them the fourth and fifth women to ever officiate in the NBA. Now it appears Silver will focus his attention on the lack of female representation in coaching.\n\n\"When it comes to coaching, when there is absolutely no physical requirement, when it is not a function of how high you can jump or how strong you are, there is no physical litmus test to being a head coach in the league, there is absolutely no reason why a woman will not ascend to be a head coach in this league,\" he told Youngmisuk. \"We are very focused in on it.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christian Edwards", "title": "China's top security agency is accused of directing a wave of cyberattacks against Australia", "description": "Australian companies have been the target of a fresh wave of China-originated cyberattacks this year as part of a \"constant, significant effort\" to plunder corporate assets and intellectual property, according to a report released Tuesday.

Officials are said to have joined the migrants' WhatsApp groups to monitor communications, many of them from Honduras and seeking asylum.\n\nThrough their intelligence-gathering efforts, officials received word that a group of migrants may be bolting through car lanes near the San Diego border in California. The Customs and Border Protection agency reportedly shut down an entire section of lanes at the border crossing between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., but the crossing never occurred.\n\nAP Photo/Rodrigo Abd\n\nIt was unclear whether the agency's measures affected the migrant group's purported plans.\n\nThe exact cost of the program was unclear, but one Defense Department source estimated the cost of paying informants and analyzing their intelligence to be thousands of dollars, according to Newsweek.\n\nIn a statement, Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman cited security concerns and did not discuss specific methods of gathering intelligence.\n\n\"While not commenting on sources or methods, it would be malpractice for the United States to be ignorant about the migrants \u2014 including many criminals \u2014 attempting to enter our country,\" Waldman said, according to NBC News. \"We have an obligation to ensure we know who is crossing our borders to protect against threats to the Homeland and any indication to the contrary is misinformed.\"\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge blocked President Donald Trump's move to curb the number of asylum-seeking migrants who cross the US-Mexico border at ports of entry. White House and Homeland Security officials have warned that hundreds of people from the caravan pose a national security threat, a description that was previously contradicted by the Defense Department's own risk assessment."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "title": "Walmart wants its campaign donation back after uproar over Sen.

As a result, we are withdrawing our support and requesting a refund of all campaign donations.\"\n\nAt a campaign stop in Tupelo, Mississippi, Hyde-Smith told a supporter that, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" The quote was first reported on November 11 by Lamar White, Jr. of the Bayou Brief, a local nonprofit publication.\n\nHyde-Smith's remark has been condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike, given the legacy of racial violence and lynching in Mississippi. Her election opponent former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy is African-American.\n\nInitially, Hyde-Smith declined to apologize for the remark. \"In a comment on November 2, I referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement,\" her campaign said in a statement. \"In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\" However, on Tuesday at a debate, Hyde-Smith formally apologized for the comment.\n\nHyde-Smith was appointed to the US Senate following the resignation of Thad Cochran due to health issues. In a special election held on November 6, neither Hyde-Smith nor Espy reached the requisite percentage of votes.

US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York via AP\n\nZambada said the cartel twice made multimillion-dollar payments to Genaro Garcia Luna, a Mexican security official.\n\nSometime between 2005 and 2006, Zambada and a lawyer for his brother met Garcia Luna at a restaurant in Mexico City, according to testimony recounted by Victor Sancho, the US correspondent for Mexican newspaper El Universal.\n\nGarcia Luna was head of Mexico's Federal Investigation Agency at the time, and the $3 million payoff was to ensure he would appoint a specific official as police chief in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state and the cartel's home turf.\n\nThe official in question was \"in the pocket\" of \"El Mayo,\" one of Guzman's lawyers said Tuesday. Zambada said he personally handed Garcia Luna the briefcase with the money.\n\nAt the time of the other payment, in 2007, Garcia Luna was public-security secretary in the government of President Felipe Calderon, a Cabinet position that oversaw the federal police\n\nGarcia Luna got between $3 million and $5 million to make sure \"he didn't interfere in the drug business\" and that \"El Mayo\" was not arrested, Zambada said, according to Sancho.\n\nZambada also said that members of the Sinaloa cartel, including members of the Beltran Leyva Organization, which was a Sinaloa cartel ally until a split in the late 2000s, also pooled $50 million in protection money for Garcia Luna.\n\n\"That was said,\" Zambada said of the pooled money, according to Sancho.\n\nCalderon, who left office in 2012, first deployed troops en masse in Mexico to fight drug-related violence. During that administration, Garcia Luna was criticized for the country's precipitous rise in drug-related violence.\n\nMexican Public Security Minister Genaro Garcia Luna at a meeting with public-security secretaries in Mexico City, September 7, 2011. REUTERS/Bernardo Montoya\n\nMike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration who worked with Garcia Luna in the 1990s and 2000s, cast doubt on allegations against the former Mexican official.\n\n\"I worked with Genaro Garcia Luna for many decades, and during that time period we shared very sensitive information,\" Vigil said Tuesday. \"He never, ever compromised it. He would give us access to all of the information that they had.\"\n\n\"During the time that I worked with him,\" Vigil added, \"he never compromised any of our cases.\"\n\n\"If Jesus Christ were to be named head of the Federal Police in Mexico, within two weeks they would be accusing him of corruption,\" Vigil said. Garcia Luna \"always, always cooperated with us,\" providing information and pursuing operations.\n\nIn a letter released Tuesday night, Garcia Luna denied Zambada's claims, calling them a \"lie, defamation and perjury.\"\n\nAs a public official charged with fighting crime, Garcia Luna added, \"I have been the subject of defamation, as I have attacked the interests of organized crime. Never has a single proof or evidence of any of these infamies been brought.\"\n\nGarcia Luna was not the only official mentioned on Tuesday. Zambada said that in 2005, his brother paid a \"few million dollars\" to an adviser to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was at the time the mayor of Mexico City and will take office as Mexico's president on December 1.\n\nPresidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador casts his vote during Mexico's 2018 presidential election in Mexico City, Mexico, July 1, 2018.

(Lopez Obrador stepped down as mayor in mid-2005 to run for president, losing a disputed election to Calderon.)\n\nThough the official in question was not immediately clear in court, Gabriel Regino, who was a security official during Lopez Obrador's mayorship, denied the allegation, saying on Twitter, \"It is false that during my exercise of public service I have received some bribe from the trafficker Jesus Zambada.\"\n\nRegino said his government position had \"motivated\" accusations against him and that he denied \"categorically\" Zambada's claims. He said he was ready to testify to any authority, national or foreign.\n\nDuring opening statements last week, Guzman's defense said that \"El Mayo\" Zambada had maintained his freedom through \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" in bribes that went \"up to the very top,\" including to the current and former presidents of Mexico, both of whom denied the allegation.\n\nGuzman defense also said that \"El Rey\" Zambada would say he \"paid off, at the request of Mayo, the now incumbent president of Mexico to the tune of $6 million or more on two separate occasions at a restaurant.\"\n\nWhen Guzman's lawyer asked Zambada about the relationship between the official and Lopez Obrador, prosecutors objected and Judge Brian Cogan stopped that line of questioning, according to Reuters legal reporter Brendan Pierson, who added that earlier in the day Cogan had issued a \"heavily redacted order\" limiting what the defense could ask the prosecution's cooperating witnesses during cross-examinations.\n\nCogan said information gained from a broad cross-examination wouldn't outweigh \"protecting individuals\" who weren't part of the case and \"would suffer embarrassment,\" according to New York Times legal reporter Alan Feuer.\n\nThis story has been updated with comment from Genaro Garcia Luna."}]
