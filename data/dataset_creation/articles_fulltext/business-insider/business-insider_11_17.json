The Saudi government denies the allegation, and so far, President Donald Trump has mostly accepted its narrative.\n\nBut the CIA's finding, which was made in high confidence and first reported by The Washington Post, represents the most definitive US assessment to date directly linking Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nIn light of that, Trump is faced with a critical question: will he accept his own intelligence agency's assessment or Saudi Arabia's?\n\nTrump was reportedly shown evidence that the Saudi crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing, but he wanted to avoid pinning the blame on Crown Prince Mohammed. Nicolas Asfouri - Pool/Getty Images\n\nCIA director Gina Haspel traveled to Turkey late last month to address the investigation into Khashoggi's death. She met with Trump when she returned to the US a few days later, and national-security experts said it was highly unlikely she didn't fill him in on what the agency had determined.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump told reporters he had not yet been briefed on the matter.\n\nNed Price, the former senior director of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, told INSIDER the odds that the CIA had high confidence in its assessment and yet did not brief Trump right away \"are virtually nil.\"\n\n\"Both of these things almost certainly can't be true,\" he added.\n\nRead more:Here's everything we know about the troubling disappearance and death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nIndeed, several Trump aides told The Post he had already been shown evidence of the crown prince's alleged involvement in Khashoggi's murder but was looking for ways to avoid blaming him for the journalist's death.\n\nLater Saturday, the White House said Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo briefed Trump on the CIA's assessment while he was en route to California. In an interview that aired on Fox News Sunday, Trump also said his administration \"be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday.\" He added that the report will include \"who did it.\"\n\nWhen host Chris Wallace asked Trump whether he believed the Saudi crown prince had lied to him, Trump responded, \"I don't know. You know, who can really know? But I can say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.\"\n\nPresident Trump has boasted about how he made \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars from the Saudis. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\n'The Saudis have bought the man'\n\nRobert Deitz, the former general counsel at the National Security Agency, said the president's response was par for the course.\n\n\"When Trump is in a bind, he tends to temporize, and I think that's what's going on here,\" Deitz told INSIDER. \"The bind is this: Saudi Arabia is the mother of all arms buyers. They're also a very important Middle East ally. So how can the US hold [Crown Prince Mohammed] and Khashoggi's killers accountable while also preserving the alliance? Because it's very challenging for the US to simply dump Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nAfter saying he hadn't been briefed on the Khashoggi investigation Saturday morning, Trump touted the US's economic ties to Saudi Arabia, calling the country a \"great ally.\"\n\n\"They give us a lot of jobs ... a lot of business, a lot of economic development,\" he said.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia is an important economic partner, fact-checkers have pointed out that the president often overstates the value of the alliance by inflating the number of American jobs Saudi arms sales would create and how much it would help the US economy.\n\nTrump and his advisers have also stressed the strategic advantages of a US-Saudi alliance, particularly when it comes to containing Iran. But Middle East experts say that with or without a partnership with the US, Saudi Arabia would still push back against its neighbor because of roiling tensions between the two countries that go back years.\n\nRead more: US hits 17 Saudis with sanctions over Khashoggi, including crown prince's top henchman who reportedly directed killing via Skype\n\nGlenn Carle, a former CIA covert operative, offered a blunt assessment of Trump's response \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to the Khashoggi investigation.\n\n\"The main pillar of this administration when it comes to the Middle East is that the president wants to make nice with [Crown Prince Mohammed] and Saudi Arabia because he likes dictators and because the Saudis have bought the man,\" Carle told INSIDER.\n\nTrump said last month that he has \"no financial interests in Saudi Arabia.\" But during his presidential campaign, he boasted about making \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars from Saudi customers and said he would maintain close ties with the kingdom because it invested in his properties.\n\nUltimately, Carle said, Trump will likely \"pay lip service to how killing is bad,\" but will go back to business as usual by supporting the crown prince and Saudi Arabia.\n\nRanda Slim, the director of conflict resolution at the Middle East Institute, echoed that view.\n\nFrom the onset of the Khashoggi case, she told INSIDER, Trump made clear that \"maintaining a close relationship with the de-facto ruler of Saudi Arabia will trump the need for justice and accountability\" for Khashoggi's murder.\n\nTrump stunned observers when he rebuffed the US intelligence community in favor of Russia in Helsinki. Thomson Reuters\n\n'He doesn't care if it's an ally or an adversary; it's all about what supports his own personal interests'\n\nIf Trump were to continue trusting Crown Prince Mohammed over the CIA after being briefed on the matter, it would be reminiscent of his response to Russian President Vladimir Putin after the US intelligence community concluded with high confidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to elevate Trump to the presidency.\n\nWhen Trump flew to Helsinki for a high-stakes meeting with Putin over the summer, he shocked observers when he said at a press conference that he trusted Putin's denial of Russian interference over US intelligence findings.\n\n\"The president has shown time and again that he will only agree or praise or take note of something that supports his particular perspective, and everything else he will either ignore or denigrate,\" Carle said. \"Thus, his approach to the Saudis will be the same as his approach to Russia. He doesn't care if it's an ally or an adversary; it's all about what supports his own personal interests and beliefs.\"\n\nBrian McKeon, a former NSC chief of staff under Obama, expressed similar sentiments.\n\n\"It does appear that the Trump administration is engaged in willful blindness - averting its eyes to the evidence being presented by the CIA - in an effort to avoid having to confront the consequences of the CIA's conclusion about [Crown Prince Mohammed's] culpability in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi,\" McKeon, who is now a senior director at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy & Global Engagement, told INSIDER.\n\n\"We may be seeing a repeat of the shameful response to Russia's interference in the 2016 election - where the political leadership of the administration believed a dictator over the conclusions of the US intelligence community,\" McKeon added.\n\nRead more:National security experts warn Trump is behaving more and more like a 'controlled spy'\n\nTrump, who has a long history of business ties to Russia, often praises Putin and says it's important for the US to get closer to Russia so the two countries can cooperate on matters of mutual interest, like counterterrorism.\n\nHe has faced resistance, however, from Congress and his own administration, which continues approving sanctions and other countermeasures against Russia even as Trump calls for a cozier relationship with Moscow.\n\nThe looming quagmire with Saudi Arabia is similar, but with one key difference.\n\n\"The CIA concluded with high confidence that [Crown Prince Mohammed] ordered the assassination of a US resident,\" Slim said. \"While Putin stands behind many of his critics' assassinations, no intelligence agency, let alone the CIA, has publicly stated he ordered the killings himself.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump tours scorched Paradise, California: 'It's total devastation'", "description": "Evan Vucci/AP President Donald Trump visited northern California neighborhoods Saturday to survey damage caused by a wildfire that ravaged more than 200 square miles in the last week.

The declaration evoked his initial tweeted reaction to the fire, the worst in the state's history, in which he seemed to blame local officials and threatened to take away federal funding.\n\nWhen asked if seeing the historic devastation, which stretched for miles and left neighborhoods destroyed and fields scorched, altered his opinion on climate change, Trump answered, \"No.\"\n\nThe president has long voiced skepticism about man's impact on the climate and has been reluctant to assign blame to a warming earth for the increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters.\n\nRead more:Trump continues to blame fires on forest mismanagement even while traveling to California\n\nAt least 71 people died across Northern California, and authorities are trying to locate more than 1,000 people, though not all are believed missing. More than 5,500 fire personnel were battling the blaze that covered 228 square miles (590 square kilometers) and was about 50 percent contained, officials said.\n\nFor Trump, it was a day to comfort a state grieving from twin tragedies, wildfires in both Northern and Southern California as well as a mass shooting at a popular college bar north of Los Angeles.\n\nWearing a camouflage \"USA\" hat, Trump gazed solemnly at the devastation in Paradise.\n\nSeveral burned-out buses and cars were nearby. Trees were burned, their branches bare and twisted. Homes were totally gone; some foundations remained, as did a chimney and, in front of one house, a Mickey Mouse lawn ornament. The fire was reported to have moved through the area at 80 mph.\n\nThe Camp Fire left behind burned cars and homes in Paradise, California. Sharon Bernstein/Reuters\n\n\"It's going to work out well, but right now we want to take of the people that are so badly hurt,\" Trump said visiting what remained of the Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park. He noted \"there are areas you can't even get to them yet\" and the sheer number of people unaccounted for.\n\n\"I think people have to see this really to understand it,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president later toured an operation center, met with response commanders and praised the work of firefighters, law enforcement and representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\"We've never seen anything like this in California,\" he said. \"It's total devastation.\"\n\nTrump took a helicopter tour en route to Chico before he toured Paradise. A full cover of haze and the smell of smoke greeted the president upon his arrival at Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento.\n\n\"They're out there fighting and they're fighting like hell,\" Trump said of the first responders.\n\nHe pledged that Washington would do its part by coming to the Golden State's aid and urged the House's Republican leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, a Trump ally and frequent White House visitor, to \"come to the office\" to help secure the needed funding.\n\nTrump, who left Washington early Saturday and didn't expect to return to the White House until well past midnight, planned to travel several hundred miles south to visit with victims of a recent country music bar shooting. A gunman killed a dozen people at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks on Nov. 7 before committing suicide.\n\nTrump long has struggled to convey empathy to victims of national disasters and tragedies. His first reaction to the fires came in a tweet last week that drew criticism as unnecessarily critical and tone-deaf given the devastation: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nThe Camp Fire left behind burned homes in Paradise, California. Stephen Lam/Reuters\n\nNature and humans share blame for the wildfires, but fire scientists are divided as to whether forest management played a major role. Nature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, the state has been in a drought and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel.\n\nHe stuck to that theme in his remarks just before departing on Saturday when he outlined what he planned to discuss with Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov-elect Gavin Newsom, both Democrats: \"We will be talking about forest management. ... The one thing is that everybody now knows that this is what we have to be doing and there's no question about it. It should have been done many years ago, but I think everybody's on the right side.\"\n\nTrump, who has long feuded with the political leaders of heavily Democratic California over issues such as immigration and voting, also has threatened to withhold federal payments to the state. After being criticized for his response, Trump has shifted gears, expressing words of encouragement to first responders and those of sympathy for hit victims.\n\nBut when he was asked by Fox News in an interview set to air Sunday whether climate change played a role in the number of serious fires, he said \"maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management.\"\n\nBrown and Newsom welcomed the president's visit, with the governor suggesting they set aside political differences since it \"now is a time to pull together for the people of California.\"\n\nBrown, a fierce advocate of addressing climate change, did not respond to Trump's statement that he has not changed his mind on the matter but pointed to several causes and they need to deal with them.\n\n\"If you really look at the facts, from a really open point of view, there are a lot of elements to be considered,\" Brown said after Trump spoke. \"The president came, he saw and I'm looking forward over the next months and beyond to really understand this threat of fire, the whole matter of drought and all the rest of it. It's not one thing, it's a lot of things and I think that if we just open our minds and look at things we'll get more stuff done.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christopher Woody", "title": "The Air Force has picked bases to test its new advanced bomber \u2014 here's where the B-21 Raider is heading", "description": "The Air Force expects to get the first of its new B-21 Raider bombers in the mid-2020s.

New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.\"\n\nNow he's released new details about the redesign to BFR's two main stages or sections, originally called the Big Falcon Spaceship and Big Falcon Booster. He also renamed those parts to \"Starship\" and \"Super Heavy,\" respectively.\n\n\"Starship is the spaceship/upper stage [and] Super Heavy is the rocket booster,\" he tweeted on Monday. Musk added that Super Heavy will be akin to a Falcon 9 booster \u2014 which lands itself, can be refueled, and relaunched many times \u2014 \"but much larger.\"\n\nThe size of SpaceX's BFR compared to NASA's Saturn V rocket, the Statue of Liberty, and the space shuttle.

SpaceX\n\nMusk started SpaceX in 2002 out of frustration that NASA didn't have a concrete plan to send people to Mars.\n\nThe company has since disrupted the global market for rockets with lower-cost and higher-performance launch vehicles. Amid all of that commercial activity, Musk worked on a plan to \"back up\" the human race by sending 1 million people to Mars.\n\nMusk initially referred to SpaceX's future Mars launch vehicle as \"Falcon XX,\" then the \"Mars Colonial Transporter.\" He unveiled the first official design of the system \u2014 a 400-foot-tall rocket-and-spaceship \u2014 in a 2016 presentation, calling it the \"Interplanetary Transport System.\"\n\nBy the end of 2017, he'd shrunk the system by about 50 feet and renamed it BFR. As of September 2018, the system was back to about 387 feet tall and the design included movable wings that also function as landing legs. That plan, which Musk described as \"the final iteration,\" called for a 180-foot-tall spaceship that would sit atop a 219-foot-tall rocket booster.\n\nMusk said this would enable SpaceX to ferry as many as 100 passengers to Mars.\n\nThe planned dimensions of SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket. Olivia Reaney/Business Insider\n\nNow, however, Musk says the renamed Super Heavy booster is needed for the Starship \"to escape Earth's deep gravity well.\" But he added that the booster is \"not needed for other planets or moons.\" The tech mogul has yet to provide a new illustration that incorporates these changes.\n\nMusk also said he has scrapped the plan to use the Falcon 9 as a \"mini BFR\" to test aspects of a full-scale system. In addition, he defended the name \"Starship,\" saying later versions of the vehicle could reach nearby star systems\u2014 not just worlds within our solar system.\n\nIt is not yet known if and how the design changes might affect the planned spaceflight of Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire and art collector slated to be the first passenger on the BFR. Along with eight artists, Maezawa intends to complete a week-long mission around the moon in 2023 (and has likely paid SpaceX hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege).\n\nThe new \"#dearMoon\" mission is supposed to be the first step toward eventually getting BFR to Mars. Musk has said he wants to launch an unmanned mission to the red planet by 2022, followed by a manned mission by 2024.\n\nSpaceX is in the midst of building a spaceship prototype under a giant tent at the Port of Los Angeles.

This rocket is expected to stand about 322 feet tall and be able to lift about 70 tons of spacecraft hardware and supplies into orbit.\n\nNASA's hopes to test-launch the first Block 1 rocket in June 2020 on a flight called Exploration Mission-1 (or EM-1). The mission would prove SLS is safe and reliable by flying an uncrewed Orion crew capsule around the moon and back to Earth.\n\nA crewed Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2) would follow several years later.\n\nHow NASA plans to pull off its Exploration Mission-2 flight with the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spaceship. NASA\n\nIt is unknown how much an SLS launch might cost. The same is also true for SpaceX's BFR and Blue Origin's New Glenn, which have yet to announce mission pricing.\n\nThe figure for NASA's program depends on the types of missions it pursues, how many SLS rockets are launched and how frequently, and how development costs are accounted for. For example, the space shuttle's per-mission raw cost was about $500 million, but averaging in the entire program's development costs and accounting for inflation brings the per-mission figure closer to about $1.5 billion.\n\nSo far NASA has spent about $11.9 billion on SLS, and the agency is projected to need $4-5 billion more than it has planned by 2021. Relatedly, the scheduled launch date for EM-1 in June 2021 is about 2.5 years behind schedule.\n\nAn internal audit of NASA's program found that preventable accidents, contract management problems, and other performance issues related to Boeing, the prime contractor, is largely responsible for the cost overruns and delays.\n\nIf more hiccups come with the SLS program, NASA may be watching SpaceX beat the agency to the moon with a crewed mission. That's because Musk, the company's founder, is pursuing aggressive timelines to reach the moon and Mars with BFR.\n\nHow SpaceX could beat NASA back to the moon\n\nAn illustration of the SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, launching into space.

SpaceX\n\nMusk started SpaceX in 2002 out of frustration that NASA didn't have a concrete plan to send people to Mars.\n\nThe company has since disrupted the global market for rockets with lower-cost and higher-performance launch vehicles. Amid all of that commercial activity, Musk worked on a plan to \"back up\" the human race by sending 1 million people to Mars.\n\nMusk initially referred to SpaceX's future Mars launch vehicle as \"Falcon XX,\" then the \"Mars Colonial Transporter.\" He unveiled the first official design of the system \u2014 a 400-foot-tall rocket-and-spaceship \u2014 in a 2016 presentation, calling it the \"Interplanetary Transport System.\"\n\nBy the end of 2017, he'd shrunk the system by about 50 feet and renamed it BFR. As of September 2018, the system was back to about 387 feet tall and the design included movable wings that also function as landing legs. That plan, which Musk described as \"the final iteration,\" called for a 180-foot-tall spaceship that would sit atop a 219-foot-tall rocket booster.\n\nMusk said this would enable SpaceX to ferry as many as 100 passengers to Mars.\n\nThe planned dimensions of SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket. Olivia Reaney/Business Insider\n\nNow, however, Musk says the renamed Super Heavy booster is needed for the Starship \"to escape Earth's deep gravity well.\" But he added that the booster is \"not needed for other planets or moons.\" The tech mogul has yet to provide a new illustration that incorporates these changes.\n\nMusk also said he has scrapped the plan to use the Falcon 9 as a \"mini BFR\" to test aspects of a full-scale system. In addition, he defended the name \"Starship,\" saying later versions of the vehicle could reach nearby star systems\u2014 not just worlds within our solar system.\n\nIt is not yet known if and how the design changes might affect the planned spaceflight of Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire and art collector slated to be the first passenger on the BFR. Along with eight artists, Maezawa intends to complete a week-long mission around the moon in 2023 (and has likely paid SpaceX hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege).\n\nThe new \"#dearMoon\" mission is supposed to be the first step toward eventually getting BFR to Mars. Musk has said he wants to launch an unmanned mission to the red planet by 2022, followed by a manned mission by 2024.\n\nSpaceX is in the midst of building a spaceship prototype under a giant tent at the Port of Los Angeles.

NASA/Ames/Dominic Hart\n\nSpace Launch System is often called a super-heavy-lift rocket. This means it's designed to heave a payload of more than 55 tons (roughly the mass of a battle tank) into low-Earth orbit.\n\n\"We need a [super-]heavy lift launch capability,\" Jurczyk said. \"Without it, we're not going to have a safe, reliable, and affordable architecture and implementation for human exploration.\"\n\nSeveral iterations of SLS are planned through the 2020s, and the first is called Block 1. This rocket is expected to stand about 322 feet tall and be able to lift about 70 tons of spacecraft hardware and supplies into orbit.\n\nNASA's hopes to test-launch the first Block 1 rocket in June 2020 on a flight called Exploration Mission-1 (or EM-1). The mission would prove SLS is safe and reliable by flying an uncrewed Orion crew capsule around the moon and back to Earth.\n\nA crewed Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2) would follow several years later.\n\nHow NASA plans to pull off its Exploration Mission-2 flight with the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spaceship. NASA\n\nIt is unknown how much an SLS launch might cost. The same is also true for SpaceX's BFR and Blue Origin's New Glenn, which have yet to announce mission pricing.\n\nThe figure for NASA's program depends on the types of missions it pursues, how many SLS rockets are launched and how frequently, and how development costs are accounted for. For example, the space shuttle's per-mission raw cost was about $500 million, but averaging in the entire program's development costs and accounting for inflation brings the per-mission figure closer to about $1.5 billion.\n\nSo far NASA has spent about $11.9 billion on SLS, and the agency is projected to need $4-5 billion more than it has planned by 2021. Relatedly, the scheduled launch date for EM-1 in June 2021 is about 2.5 years behind schedule.\n\nAn internal audit of NASA's program found that preventable accidents, contract management problems, and other performance issues related to Boeing, the prime contractor, is largely responsible for the cost overruns and delays.\n\nIf more hiccups come with the SLS program, NASA may be watching SpaceX beat the agency to the moon with a crewed mission. That's because Musk, the company's founder, is pursuing aggressive timelines to reach the moon and Mars with BFR.\n\nHow SpaceX could beat NASA back to the moon\n\nAn illustration of the SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, launching into space. Here, the spaceship is shown detaching from the booster. SpaceX\n\nSpaceX employees have been toiling under a tent in Los Angeles to build the top half of the system, called the Big Falcon Spaceship.\n\nMusk and Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's president, have both said the spaceship could be doing short launches called \"hops\" as soon as late 2019. Musk is also planning to modify his mainstay Falcon 9 rocket into a \"mini-BFR ship\" to test some of the more challenging aspects of the ship, like blazing-hot reentry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe planned dimensions of SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket. Olivia Reaney/Business Insider\n\nIn 2020 or 2021, he aims to launch a fully integrated version of BFR \u2014 a Big Falcon Booster with the Big Falcon Spaceship on top \u2014 into orbit around Earth. (Around the same time, Blue Origin is planning to use New Glenn to deliver a lander to the surface of the moon to scout for ice to make rocket fuel.)\n\nIf SpaceX's first orbital launch and later uncrewed missions fly without an explosion or other incident, the company intends to fly a Japanese billionaire and a group of artists around the moon in 2023.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the space agency would react to such a feat, which is essentially a creative reprise of the Apollo 8 mission of 1968. In fact, 2023 is the same timeframe in which NASA plans to launch EM-2 around the moon.\n\nAn illustration of the spaceship of SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, flying around the moon. SpaceX\n\nIt's also unknown what NASA would do if SpaceX launches its first uncrewed missions to Mars with BFR in 2022, followed by the first crewed missions in 2024. That's several years ahead of when the space agency hopes to land people on the moon, and perhaps a decade sooner than NASA would attempt a crewed Mars landing.\n\n\"We haven't really engaged SpaceX on how we'd work together on BFR, and eventually get to a Mars mission \u2014 yet,\" Jurczyk said of NASA's leadership. \"My guess is that it's coming.\"\n\nA US space agency without an American spaceship\n\nNine astronauts will fly the first four crewed missions inside SpaceX and Boeing's new spaceships for NASA, called Crew Dragon and CST-100 Starliner, respectively. NASA via AP\n\nRight now, Jurczyk said, the space agency's leadership is laser-focused on test launches for its Commercial Crew Program, a competition for private companies to build and launch American spaceships.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Commercial Crew is to revive US spaceflight capabilities that the agency lost when it retired the space shuttle fleet in 2011. (Ever since then, NASA has relied solely on Russia to taxi its astronauts to and from the $150 billion International Space Station.)\n\nBoeing and SpaceX have each designed and built seven-person space capsules, which are each nearing approval for uncrewed and crewed test launches. SpaceX is currently looking to fly first with its Crew Dragon ship.\n\n\"Their first uncrewed flight test, right now, is scheduled for January, followed by, not many months later, maybe in the springtime, their first crewed flight test to the space station,\" Jurczyk said.\n\nRead more: Boeing may have used a lobbying firm to plant a scathing opinion piece about SpaceX in US news outlets. At stake is billions of dollars in NASA contracts.\n\nOnce the Crew Dragon and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner ships prove they can launch safely and reliably, the agency's leadership should have more energy to contemplate its deep-space future with BFR and Blue Origin's New Glenn.\n\n\"How we engage will depend a lot on the pace at which those systems and capabilities develop,\" Jurczyk said.\n\nThe key for NASA is to get as quickly as possible to some kind of super-heavy-lift capability.\n\n\"Right now we see the way to do that is through SLS, because we kind of have the head-start and use these legacy technologies and systems,\" he said, referring to the fact that SLS will use space shuttle engines and other well-understood hardware.\n\nJurczyk added: \"That's kind of where we are. We know we need that kind of BFR \u2014 and whatever evolves from New Glenn \u2014 heavy-lift capability if we're going to do human exploration of the solar system. We don't think another approach is going to be as safe, affordable, and reliable.\"\n\nAre you a current or former NASA employee with a story to share?

Now, they're expanding internationally.\n\nMeet China's airlines\n\nThe modern era in Chinese aviation started in 1988 when the Civil Aviation Administration of China or CAAC made the decision to disband its eponymous airline into six smaller state-owned carriers spread throughout the country. CAAC exists today, but purely as an industry regulator. After a few rounds of consolidation, only three of the carriers remain \u2014 Air China, China Eastern, and China Southern.\n\nA China Eastern Boeing 777-300ER. Flickr/BriYYZ By the late 2000s, privately-own Hainan Airlines had grown in scale and importance to form the fourth member of the quartet.\n\nGuangzhou-based China Southern is the largest of China's airlines. With a fleet of nearly 600 aircraft, it's also the largest airline in Asia. The only airlines in the world with more planes than China Southern are American, Delta, United, and Southwest.\n\nThe second largest is Shanghai-based China Eastern with more than 500 aircraft. Air China is the most direct descendant of CAAC Airlines. In fact, it was operating many of CAAC's flagship international routes. Air China is also the smallest of the three with a fleet of around 400 aircraft.\n\nRead more: Here are all of the countries not allowed to fly into the US.\n\nHainan, a subsidiary of travel giant HNA Group, is the country's largest privately owned international airline with about 225 aircraft and is the only one with a five-star rating from consumer aviation website Skytrax.\n\nIn fact, Hainan was rated the eighth best airline in the world for 2018 by Skytrax.\n\nHow China's airlines affect America's airlines\n\nSo the question must be asked, what effect will they have on major US carriers like American, Delta, and United?\n\nThe answer to this question is rather complex.\n\nA China Southern Airbus A380. Airbus Over the past few years, American, Delta, and United have waged an all-out assault on Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways. The US carrier accused the Middle Eastern carriers of allegedly receiving $50 billion in government subsidies over the past decade. According to the US carriers, the trio of Persian Gulf-based airlines have used this money to unfairly distort the competitive balance of the marketplace in violation of the OpenSkies agreements that govern air travel between the US and their countries of origin.\n\nThe Middle Eastern carriers have long denied these claims. But they aren't the only airlines that have been accused of being propped up by subsidies.\n\nRead More: Emirates Airline profits are down by 86% and things may not get better soon.\n\n\"China's state-owned airlines have gotten as much as, if not more, in subsidies over the years than the guys in the Middle East,\" Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst for Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider.\n\nFor example, Chinese airlines received $1.3 billion worth of subsidies in 2016 alone just from lower-tier municipal governments looking to develop non-stop international flights to their cities, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe result is that Chinese carriers have flooded the trans-Pacific market with subsidized seat capacity. This has caused prices to bottom out. This is great for the consumer but makes things awfully tough on those trying to compete on routes.\n\nA Hainan Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. Boeing As fuel prices continue to creep back towards $100 a barrel, US airlines are certainly feeling the pinch.\n\nSo why haven't the US carriers complained?\n\n\"The US carriers, unfortunately, do not have a leg to stand on in terms of the subsidies for some of these long-haul routes simply because there's no OpenSkies agreement with China, therefore, there isn't the protection it affords,\" ICF vice president of aviation commercial advisory, Mark Drusch, explained to Business Insider in an interview.\n\nAnd then there are the business ties.\n\nChina's major airlines all have long-standing business relationships with their US rivals. China Eastern and China Southern (until the end of the year) belong to the same Skyteam airline alliance as Delta. While Air China and United both belong to the Star Alliance.\n\nRead more: The 10 best airlines in the world for 2019.\n\nTaking it one step further, Delta spent $450 million in 2015 to acquire a 3.55% stake in China Eastern. Delta also has an observer seat on China Eastern's board of directors. Last year, American Airlines invested $200 million to buy equity in China Southern.\n\n\"Delta has made it very clear that their plan is to, with China Eastern, build Shanghai into a major connecting hub between the US and the interior of China,\" Drusch told us.\n\nAccording to Drusch, American has plans for a similar growth strategy by taking advantage of China Southern's new mega hubs in Guangzhou and Beijing.\n\nAre they friend or foe?\n\nIn many respects, Chinese airlines are both friend and foe for America's big three.\n\nEven though China's airlines compete for business across the Pacific, it's a significant source of connecting business for US carriers. Once they reach the US, Air China's passengers connect onto United while China Eastern's use Delta. China Southern passengers connect onto American and Delta. Hainan's passengers use Alaska Airlines and JetBlue. And vice versa on China-bound flights.\n\n\"I don't think at this point in time they are a threat as much as they are combined (with a US partner), a smart way of further developing the Chinese market,\" Drusch said. \"The market is profitable for US carriers. In the aggregate, US carriers do make money flying to China, full stop.\"\n\nAccording to the former Delta and Continental executive, the recent failure of several United and American airlines routes in China can be blamed more on poor timing and overcapacity than Chinese competition.\n\nAn Air China Boeing 777-300ER. Boeing For example, United abandoned both its San Francisco to Xi'an and San Francisco to Hangzhou flight last year because they were two of the worst performing routes in their network. Drusch attributes this to the fact that both of the Chinese destinations are secondary cities with travel markets that aren't quite mature enough to handle such a flight.\n\nWhile American's decision to end its Chicago to Shanghai and Chicago to Beijing flights is due to the fact that AA is the secondary carrier in the Windy City. It doesn't the have the same level of connectivity as Chicago-based United, which is why American has decided to better focus their resources on Dallas and Los Angeles where they are much stronger.\n\nFinally, the strength of US airlines lies with its domestic business.

Why did you wait until just before the IPO to sign the deal?\n\nShenkman: We certainly didn't have a strategy of waiting for the IPO. I had met Ryan probably 6 to 7 months ago. I had become aware, through some conversations with him, of some expansions of the platform. The breadth with which they expanded the platform, and how robust it was, is something I hadn't expected. So when we got together about 6 months ago, I actually tried to have some partner conversations and realized that with the pending IPO and the strategic nature of the business, that we might engage in something more strategic.\n\nThe two time tracks just fell in parallel.\n\nPeterson: How did SAP and Qualtrics come to the $8 billion figure? Qualtrics said that it planned to IPO at a $4.8 billion valuation.\n\nShenkman: You can think about it, Becky, in three ways. One is, obviously you see what's happening in the public markets. In all likelihood, this company would have traded above $8 billion in the public markets\n\nIn all likelihood, this company would have traded above $8 billion in the public markets\n\nwhen you look at their growth rates, their profitability and their creating a new market category. So I think the public market themselves really help to push some of the valuation.\n\nNumber two, other transactions \u2014 which were strategic transactions in the same way that this is a horizontal transaction for us \u2014 were important in that benchmarking.\n\nAnd the third is that we obviously see significant opportunity to expand and change our business and their business together, which drives significant opportunity between the two companies.\n\nPeterson: Is there a reason why SAP decided to buy a company like Qualtrics rather than try to replicate it internally?\n\nShenkman: It's not like they started yesterday and flipped over a product. They've been around for 16 years. They've obviously created a significant amount of intellectual property and a lot of breadth in their platform. They've built a significant business. It would be challenging for us to go from a straight build to be able to attack a market that's growing as fast as this market and still have a meaningful share of it.\n\nPeterson: Did your team look at any of Qualtric's competitors?\n\nShenkman: If you look at the competitive landscape, what you find is Medalia is primarily focused around NPS (Net Promoter Score); Glint, which sold to LinkedIn, was focused on employee surveys; SurveyMonkey is primarily a survey company.\n\nWe certainly did not do this with Qualtrics because of surveys. We did this because we believe this is a broad, robust, horizontal platform\n\nWe certainly did not do this with Qualtrics because of surveys. We did this because we believe this is a broad, robust, horozontal platform...\n\nthat can be the glue across the intelligent enterprise and bring together our key ERP (enterprise resource planning) assets with our key cloud assets and help drive this vision we have of the intelligent enterprise.\n\nPeterson: Beyond Qualtrics, what is SAP's overall corporate development strategy?\n\nShenkman: Our strategy since 2011 has been to buy market leading cloud assets. In 2011, we bought SuccessFactors, and we followed that up with Ariba. After Ariba, we bought Fieldglass and then we followed that up with Concur. We also bought a company called Hybris.\n\nWe have consistently, every 12 to 24 months, went out into the market and bought a market-leading cloud asset. We still continue to drive our business toward the cloud, we continue to build toward the cloud. And we continue to supplement that not only with acquisitions but with also partnerships that are relevant for us to continue to grow around the cloud.\n\nPeterson: What is SAP's pitch when it's courting a company for an acquisition?\n\nShenkman: One is that we have a model that's often different than our competitors. We have a lot of respect for the people who have built these businesses. We recognize that there can be a really mutually beneficial, symbiotic relationship between us. So we've always had a more slow coming-together of the parties, in terms of how we operate companies.\n\nSo one, there is usually a fair degree of collaboration around how we operate, as opposed to some others who may be much more focused on cost synergies and rationalizing their P&L (profit and loss).\n\nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty announced the $34 billion acquisition of RedHat last month. AP Photo/Manu Fernandez\n\nSecond is that the global scale of SAP provides these companies enormous opportunities.\n\nQualtrics is a good example, where 80% of their revenue comes from companies based in the United States. SAP, as you may know, does business in 192 countries and really has been a global business for 40 years. So we have a global breadth that is really unmatched in enterprise software.\n\nAnd the third, and it's been consistent with all of our deals, is the culture. We are a culture built around helping enterprises build the best businesses that they can. When you look at companies we've acquired, their relevance to enterprises and our focus on enterprise gives us a common mission.\n\nPeterson: How do view the M&A space when it comes to the cloud? It seems like the idea of a transformational acquisition is picking up a lot of steam in the space, especially when you look at deals like IBM's $34 billion acquisition of RedHat last month.\n\nShenkman: We were an early acquirer of cloud assets, so this is not a new trend for us. We have continually looked for market-leading assets that could help us rapidly accelerate our cloud growth and our strategy around enabling our customers to run the most efficient operations and businesses they can.\n\nI think that M&A has always provided an opportunity for strategic growth. And one way to think about this, Becky, is that the cloud is moving at a much faster rate than any other technology transformation\n\nThe cloud is moving at a much faster rate than any other technology transformation...\n\nand I think that's probably a fair way to think about trying to catch up around buy-versus-build.\n\nIf you look at Qualtric's growth, which we've said is more than 40% year-over-year \u2014 when you just look at those growth rates and where this business is headed, it's very hard to organically catch up with some of these companies.\n\nI think there is something particular about the cloud in terms of some of these more transformative acquisitions you're seeing.\n\nPeterson: What was it like being a strategic buyer in 2018?\n\nShenkman: Any time you have a combination of rapid transformation of an industry, like we're seeing in the cloud combined with strong economic growth across many regions of the world, you're going to find premium prices. So what's challenging at times is finding a unique asset that you can justify and understand the stand alone price of.\n\nFor us, that's about not only finding something unique but something that's very horizontal that can be globalized. When I think about the marketplace, we were very happy to find an asset that fits so well in our strategic rational.\n\nI don't think this is an easy market, based off of where valuations are, to get deals done but I do think that if you find an asset that meets your strategic needs, that deals can get done, and this reflects that.\n\nRead more:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alexandra Ma", "title": "China is locking up its Muslim minorities, and pushing Islamophobia to get Europe to do it too", "description": "The Chinese government is receiving more and more heat over its persecution of the Uighurs, a majority-Muslim ethnic minority in the country's west.

At an historic crossroads linking China to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, the city has changed under Chinese rule with government development, unofficial Han Chinese settlement to the western province, and restrictions imposed by the Communist Party. Beijing says it regards Kashgar's development as an improvement to the local economy, but many Uyghurs consider it a threat that is eroding their language, traditions, and cultural identity. The friction has fueled a separatist movement that has sometimes turned violent, triggering a crackdown on what China's government considers 'terrorist acts' by religious extremists.

They've also denied knowing about the PR campaign that was conducted on its behalf.\n\nFacebook's scandals have illustrated Zuckerberg's shortcomings\n\nThe Times report alone might have led to the ouster of top executives at another company. But it focuses only on a handful of the myriad of missteps Facebook has made under Zuckerberg and his team of late. Other notable fiascos include the leak of millions of users' personal data to Cambridge Analytica, the more recent hacking attack that compromised some 30 million accounts, and the use of its service to incite violence in Myanmar against the Rohingya people and to spread fake news and hate speech.\n\nChristopher Wylie helped expose the leak of Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica. YouTube/The Guardian Taken together, the scandals have shown vividly that while Facebook under Zuckerberg's leadership was hell-bent on growth, it massively underinvested in, or simply gave short shrift to, concerns such as privacy, security, and the ability of malicious actors to hijack its service. He and his team have been scrambling ever since to address such problems. In the process, Facebook's user growth has slowed, its costs have gone up, and its stock price has slumped.\n\nThose things alone would likely have upset investors and had them agitating for a management shakeup. But each new scandal that's arisen has highlighted Zuckerberg's chief shortcoming as a leader. However technically proficient and visionary from a product perspective he may be, he's consistently seemed to be asleep at the switch when major problems were brewing on Facebook's service. Whether because he was unable, unwilling, unavailable, or just unimaginative, he's repeatedly failed to foresee and head off problems before they arose.\n\nTake the Soros smear. Zuckerberg on Thursday said he'd been unaware until he read it in The Times the day before either about the attempt to link Facebook's critics to Soros or that Facebook had hired the public relations firm that led the effort. You'd think the CEO of a company would be well informed about a major PR effort being conducted on his company's behalf, particularly if it was planning to do something so controversial. But apparently not Zuck.\n\nRead this:Heads ought to roll at Facebook over the Soros smear \u2014 starting with Zuck's\n\nZuckerberg's stock means he has all the power\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that investors have repeatedly shown they are indeed unhappy with Zuckerberg's leadership. Last year, a majority of independent shareholders of Facebook voted in favor of a proposal that would have required it to replace him as chairman with someone who had no ties to him or the company. A similar proposal is slated to be up for a shareholder vote again next year. Meanwhile, the company has seen numerous shareholder resolutions in recent years that have sought to take away some of Zuckerberg's power and to provide more outside oversight the company.\n\nLike Zuckerberg, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has shares that give him outsized control over his company. Greg Sandoval/Business Insider Those efforts have all failed for one simple reason: under Facebook's corporate bylaws, Zuckerberg is something like an absolute monarch. He doesn't have to step down or cede any of his power or submit to anyone else's oversight unless he chooses to do so. And so far, he's chosen to maintain his complete grip on power.\n\nTechnically, what empowers Zuckerberg is Facebook's stock structure. The company has two classes of shares \u2014 Class A, which is mostly held by everyday investors; and Class B, which is mostly held by Zuckerberg. Each Class B share comes with 10 times more votes than each Class A share. What that means is that even though Zuckerberg owns or controls about 15% of Facebook's total outstanding shares, he gets about 60% of its votes.\n\nThat means that just by himself he can vote down any shareholder proposal, nominate anyone he wants to Facebook's board of directors, and pretty much run the company as he sees fit.\n\nZuckerberg is one of a growing number of executives \u2014 many of them in the tech sector \u2014 who are insulated from investors and the public by their companies' multi-class stock structures or by outsized voting rights. Others in that group are Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.\n\nInvestors are unhappy with dual-class structures\n\nMany investors are getting fed up with such arrangements and for good reasons. Not only do they get little to no control over the companies they own, but research indicates that shares of companies with such stock structures underperform their peers over the long run.\n\nInstitutional investors have started to pressure individual companies such as Facebook to eliminate or agree to sunset their dual-class stock structures. They've also started to press exchanges and index funds to bar companies with such stock arrangements.\n\nNatasha Lamb, managing partner at Arjuna Capital, an activist investment firm that has challenged Zuckerberg's power at Facebook, with little success. Natasha Lamb They've had some success. A growing portion of newly public companies that have dual-class structures have sunset provisions that will end them over a period of some years. S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that going forward it will not include any additional companies in the S&P 500 or related indices that have dual-class stock structures. And FTSE Russell announced that to be listed on its indices, companies must have shares worth at least 5% of the companies' voting rights held by outsiders or trading freely.\n\nBut none of these developments address the problem at Facebook or other companies that have refused to end or sunset their dual-class stock structures. King Zuck has simply refused to give up power, regardless of the pressure that outsider investors have tried to place on him.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P Dow Jones grandfathered in companies with dual-stock structures that are already included in its indices. And should the exchanges make a move to bar such companies, they too will likely give a pass to companies that are already listed.\n\nIt's time for Congress to step in\n\nThirty years ago, as the number of companies with dual-class structures started to tick up, the Securities and Exchange Commission tried to force the stock exchanges to bar the practice among their listed companies. Unfortunately an appeals court struck down the rule less than two years after the SEC approved it, clearing the way for Facebook, Google, and other companies to go public with dual-class structures. The appeals court's reasoning was that Congress hadn't explicitly given the SEC the authority to force the exchanges to mandate companies have particular stock structures.\n\nIt's long past time for Congress to correct that oversight. It ought to either ban dual-class stock structures among public companies outright, or make clear that the SEC can do so itself.\n\nDoing so wouldn't just help shareholders get a handle on Facebook. It would help make the company \u2014 and its tech peers that similarly insulate their insiders \u2014 more accountable to the public at large.\n\nFor the good of society, that accountability is long overdue.\n\nNow read:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kevin Webb", "title": "These are the 7 best Black Friday gaming deals you'll find in stores - Business Insider", "description": "Business Insider These are the 7 best Black Friday gaming deals you'll find in stores Business Insider Black Friday is fast approaching and it's the season for holiday deals on video games.

After nearly a decade, it started raising interest rates in response to a booming labor market, and has continued amid signs that inflation is creeping back in.\n\nInvestors are now watching for how quickly the Fed will return its benchmark rate to a point that coincides with the so-called neutral rate. At this estimated level, monetary policy is neither expanding nor contracting the economy.\n\nThere's no consensus, even among Fed officials, on just how close we are to neutral interest rates. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said policy was probably \"a long way\" from neutral. But on Thursday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who also votes on policy decisions, said interest rates were \"not too far\" from neutral.\n\nAccording to Barry Bannister, the chief equity strategist at Stifel, the Fed has in fact raised rates to a level that should in fact worry equity investors. The charts below show that the fed funds rate peaked above the neutral level before the meltdowns in 2000 and 2008.\n\nStifel\n\nEconomists believe that the neutral rate has fallen in the post-crisis period because productivity and labor-market growth are not as robust as they were before the recession. This, in turn, explains why the trendline for the bear market trigger point has declined over time.\n\n\"The maximum tolerable peak for the fed funds above the Laubach & Williams neutral rate has been associated with major equity market tops since the savings-fueled global debt boom began in the late-1990s,\" Bannister said in a recent client note.\n\nThe implication is that even if the Fed decided to stop raising the range of the Fed funds rate, it may already be too late for equity investors, according to Bannister.\n\nAny indication that the Fed is slowing down its path of rate hikes would be bullish for markets. However, Bannister expects that such a rally will be short-lived because investors would realize \"the Fed's weak position.\"\n\nThe central bank has two mandates from Congress: price stability and maximum employment. But it's often said that the Fed has a third, shadow mandate of keeping financial markets stable.\n\nFed officials prefer to focus on their official mandate, and say they rely on economic data \u2014 not market gyrations \u2014 to guide their interest rate decisions.

What happens if parliament votes down Theresa May's Brexit deal?\n\nEarly in December, the prime minister will put her deal to a \"meaningful vote,\" in parliament. As things stand, it's looking increasingly likely that MPs will reject it.\n\nAll opposition parties have vowed to oppose the deal, with only a small handful of rebel Labour MPs set to support the government.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, say they intend to oppose the deal because of the \"backstop\" mechanism agreed to by May would mean additional checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nA significant number of Conservative MPs also intend to oppose the deal. Around 20 have already called for a vote of no confidence in May because of the deal with around a dozen more also suggesting they are likely to oppose the deal, both on the Leave and Remain wings of the party.\n\nAnything but a defeat for the prime minister therefore appears unlikely. So what will happen if May does lose that vote? Here's how it could all play out.\n\n1. A no-deal Brexit\n\nTheresa May Getty\n\nThe first option is to leave the EU without a deal in March next year. There are two distinct types of no-deal exit. A relatively managed no-deal in which both sides acknowledge their inability to sign off a deal, and try to minimise chaos for businesses and people by reaching ad-hoc side agreements in important areas like border controls and cross-border finance contracts.\n\nThe alternative is an acrimonious and very hard exit with the UK paying no money and the EU rejecting side-deals. However, such an outcome is unlikely according to Charles Grant at the Centre for European Reform, who believes \"those responsible for the chaos would soon become unpopular with their voters; also, the financial markets' reaction would be more extreme, with a sharp weakening in the value of the pound.\"\n\nNeither the EU or the UK want to leave without a deal. Even hard Brexiteers like Liam Fox appear to have awoken to the dangers of such an outcome, with the International Trade Secretary saying on Friday that \"a deal is better than no deal.\"\n\nHowever, if May is unable to get a deal through then a no-deal Brexit becomes the default position. However unlikely it may seem, the possibility cannot be ruled out.\n\n2. A general election\n\nJeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nIf May is unable to get a deal through parliament then one option open to her is a general election. This is the option being pursued by the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who believes he can put enough pressure on May to force her to go back to the country if she is unable to get support for her deal from MPs. It would certainly not be impossible to force an election, but under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act it would require at least 7 Conservative MPs to join the opposition in backing one for a new election to be held.\n\nAfter the calamitous experience of last year's general election where May threw away her majority, and with the parties close in the polls, most Conservative MPs are horrified by the prospect of an election for one simple reason: They could lose. The prospect of a radical socialist prime minister would likely be enough to frighten pretty much all Tory MPs away from backing an election.\n\nTory MP and former minister Guto Bebb, who backs a \"People's Vote,\" told Business Insider that he would expect the Conservatives to lose \"very badly\" if they sought a general election after the deal failed in parliament.\n\n\"If the prime minister's deal fails in parliament, and she decides to call a general election to get a mandate, my expectation is that the Conservative party would lose very badly,\" he said.\n\n\"The proposition would be: 'So far we've failed, can we have a vote of confidence please?'\"\n\n\"I just can't see that being a rational way forward for the government,\" he added.\n\n3. Send the prime minister back to Brussels\n\nMichel Barnier Getty\n\nPart of the justification made by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for another election would be to allow him to take over the reins of government in order to renegotiate a deal with the EU. The current line from Brussels is that the deal cannot be re-negotiated. However, if push came to shove, there would probably be room for at least some EU flexibility in order to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit. The pressure for more flexibility would arguably be even greater if there was a new prime minister and party in Downing Street. However, any renegotiation would require time and the possible extension of the Article 50 process. While the EU has not ruled out an extension they would likely be incredibly reluctant to do so under any but the most extreme scenarios.\n\n4. A People's Vote\n\nAn anti-Brexit protestor Alex McBride/Getty Images\n\nThere is growing cross-party support in Westminster for a so-called People's Vote \u2014 or a second referendum \u2014 especially among Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs, but also some prominent Conservative MPs including Dominic Grieve and Jo Johnson.\n\nThere are several factors working against supporters of a People's Vote, however. Critics say it would undermine trust in democracy and potentially cause civil unrest. They also point out that there is a very good chance the Remain campaign would simply lose again, which would defeat the object of the exercise from many of their perspectives.\n\nDowning Street, however, is vehemently opposed to another referendum, and Theresa May has said it would be \"a gross betrayal of our democracy.\" A Conservative government would almost certainly never legislate for such an outcome. The party would be eviscerated at the polls and its leader ousted immediately.\n\nBut there's a reasonable chance that Labour could be in power before March next year. By far the most likely route to a second referendum would be through a Labour government which has explicitly kept the option of supporting it on the table, despite Jeremy Corbyn's personal reluctance to support one.\n\n5. Voting for May's deal a second time\n\nTheresa May Getty\n\nAnother scenario which could see disaster averted is a second vote on the deal. Theresa May \u2014 or whoever succeeds her after being forced out \u2014 could put the current deal, or a marginally renegotiated one, before parliament a second time. Faced with the prospect of a terrifying no-deal or another referendum, or general election, it remains possible that sceptical MPs could be cajoled into supporting it. However, such a turnaround would be dependent on the first vote being relatively close. If May loses the vote on her deal by a large margin, as it currently seems feasible that she will, then it will be much harder to persuade MPs who rejected it the first time, to risk the wrath of their supporters by going into the voting lobbies to support her deal a second time."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jim Edwards", "title": "The Evolution of Ev: The creator of Twitter, Blogger, and Medium has a plan to fix the mess he made of the internet", "description": "Ev Williams invented Blogger in 1999, Twitter in 2006, and Medium in 2012.

The ar\u2026 [+24156 chars]", "fulltext": "First, let's correct a myth: Ev Williams definitely has a desk.\n\nEarlier this year, the New York Times reported that Williams \u2014 the billionaire entrepreneur who founded Twitter and Blogger \u2014 runs his new company, Medium, from an office that has no desk. The article included a photo of Williams resting on a sofa at his headquarters, no desk in sight.\n\nIt conjured an image of a mercurial Silicon Valley mogul, controlling his minions from an iPad or a phone. Maybe, I thought, he had discovered a disruptively unencumbered new style of leadership. Perhaps \"no desk\" was the natural evolution from \"standing desk,\" another Silicon Valley efficiency cliche. So I went to Lisbon, where Williams was addressing the Web Summit tech conference, to ask him about the future. Will we all eventually find ourselves in a desk-less work environment, sprawling around on office sofas, like Williams?\n\nI first saw him at a party hosted by Brooke Hammerling. Her Brew PR agency has long been a one-stop shop for high-level Silicon Valley connections, and her annual Web Summit party did not disappoint: It was at the Chinese Pavilion, in Lisbon's trendy Principe Real neighbourhood, near a clifftop park that has a spectacular view of the castle that dominates the city's skyline.\n\nWilliams didn't stay very long, although he talked to former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, who was also at the bar, along with Juliet de Baubigny, the senior partner who just left Kleiner Perkins to join Mary Meeker's new VC firm. Rachel Dodes-Wortman, the former New York Times and Wall Street Journal writer who became head of film partnerships at Twitter (but now runs communications at Knotel), was also there. It was more of a work meeting than a party, and Williams left at around midnight, after summoning a car on his phone.\n\nThe next day, I found Williams in a conference room backstage at Lisbon's vast Altice Arena. He is tall, skinny, and his face now carries a middle-aged beard, highlighted with grey. He is, at 46, literally one of tech's legendary greybeards. He does not appear to particularly enjoy talking to the media. So he picks his words carefully, and talks in a thoughtful, deliberate way.\n\nHe is, conspicuously, sitting at a table that he is clearly using as a desk.\n\nAnd he is baffled by my question.\n\n\"I have a desk!\" he says.\n\nHe looks over at his PR staff. \"Did that get reported, that I don't have a desk?\" They remind him that it was indeed reported last year that he has no desk.\n\nA light goes on.\n\n\"I didn't have a dedicated desk,\" he says, meaning that he had a desk, but not like an official desk in a stereotypical corner office, or something like that.\n\nFree-desking didn't last long. \"I got a desk in the meanwhile. I needed somewhere to put my computer.\"\n\nThis is disappointing.\n\nWilliams has not discovered a magical new way to run a company. He's a normal human being, with a normal desk, just like the rest of us.\n\nIf you're distressed at the volume of digital media noise funnelled at you each day, then Williams accepts the blame\n\nWilliams prepares his microphone backstage at the Altice Arena in Lisbon. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\nWell, not quite normal.\n\nUnlike the rest of us, Williams' thoughts have had a surprisingly large impact on the way we all think.\n\nThis is the man who invented Blogger, in 1999. At the time \u2014 the early days of the internet, really \u2014 it was not obvious that there would be a vast marketplace for people who wanted to comment on news coverage originally published elsewhere. Or that billions of people would want to read summarised aggregations rather than the original reporting on which it was based. His realisation that the internet needed high-quality publishing tools for amateurs made blogging into the oxygen of the media environment. There are now 173 million blogs on the internet.\n\nAnd then, in 2006, he did it again. It was equally not-obvious that anyone might want a micro-blogging platform which constrained authors' thoughts to just 140 characters. Yet now we live in a world where much of our news is delivered first on Twitter. There are 326 million Twitter users out there. It's the president of the United States' favourite bully pulpit.\n\nWilliams' thinking has made him rich. He owned 43.7 million shares of Twitter when it went public at $26 a share in 2015, making him an instant billionaire. (He has since sold at least 30% of his stake.) Not bad for the boy who grew up on a farm in Clarks, Nebraska.\n\nIf you're distressed at the volume of digital media noise funnelled at you each day, and the way Twitter reduces everything to a shallow take, shorn of detail, context or nuance ... then Williams accepts much of the blame.\n\nHe once said of President Trump's use of Twitter, \"It's a very bad thing, Twitter's role in that ... If it's true that he wouldn't be president if it weren't for Twitter, then yeah, I'm sorry.\" He had believed that Twitter's ability to let anyone say anything, to a wide audience, would mean that \"the world is automatically going to be a better place.\" But, \"I was wrong about that,\" he said.\n\n\"If you create a system that rewards attention, the easiest way to get attention is to be a bad actor. That underlies our media ecosystem, that underlies our political system, and it's degrading society in so many ways.\"\n\nWilliams has all but given up on social media. \"I've pretty much weaned myself off of being addicted to social media for instance, which I was at one time,\" he says. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\nLater, on the 20,000-seat centre stage at Web Summit, he was asked, How do we get out of the \"attention economy\" feedback-loop cesspool? His reply is incredibly insightful, and it's worth reproducing in full:\n\n\"The fundamental problem that we're focused on is a microcosm of one of the biggest problems in society, which is simply that we have created a world in which attention is rewarded in quantity. Meaning it's not the quality of the attention, it's not how you make people feel. It's whether you get their attention. And we've optimized these systems \u2014 traditional media, social media, online and offline \u2014 where attention is rewarded, and what we can measure is rewarded. And we can measure whether people are paying attention by what page their browser is on, or what social media they're liking, but we can't actually measure how they feel, we can't measure if they're getting smarter, we can't measure if they're understanding the world better. So we've really created this system in society where the class clown, the disruptive kid in school who is very effective at getting attention, but not effective at helping people, that becomes the winning play. \u2026 Obviously, if you create a system that rewards attention, the easiest way to get attention is to be a bad actor. That underlies our media ecosystem, that underlies our political system, and it's degrading society in so many ways.\"\n\nToday, Williams has all but given up on social media, he tells Business Insider. \"I've pretty much weaned myself off of being addicted to social media for instance, which I was at one time,\" he says.\n\nThat's an astonishing thing for the founder, former CEO, and current board member of Twitter to say. It is akin to Mark Zuckerberg announcing that he tries to not spend time on Facebook.\n\nNow he limits \u2014 or tries to \u2014 how much time he spends looking at his phone.\n\n\"The kids are the biggest forcing function, and I'm faulty on this as well, but I'll usually make my kids breakfast and try not to be on my phone while doing that, so that's good, and then they're gone and then I'm like in work mode,\" he says. \"I'll look at my email before I leave the house and when I'm walking to the train.\"\n\nThe good news is, Williams does, in fact, believe he can fix this. So it's worth exploring the evolution of his thinking. Twice he has been ahead of the curve and created media tools that altered our universe.\n\nNow he is trying a third time.\n\nMonetising the value of \"How I Got My Husband to Actually Do His Share of the Housework\"\n\nBy audience size alone, Medium is already in the same league as The New York Times. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\nIf Blogger was an iteration of the \"traditional\" digital publishing done by news organisations, and Twitter was an iteration of blogging done by amateurs, then Medium is a further iteration of both. It's a publishing platform that specialises in long, thoughtful, one-off posts by writers who are not producing a stream of frequently updated content.\n\nAnd it is huge.\n\nTwenty-thousand articles are published on Medium every day, there are 20 million stories in the archive, and the site has 90 million unique readers per month. That's roughly the same as the New York Times, according to ComScore, but with only about 100 employees.\n\nThe addition of subscribers to Medium is the new innovation that is being most closely watched by competitors in the media. You can read three articles on Medium for free, every month, before you encounter a paywall. Normally, companies that charge subscriptions are offering a high-quality stream of useful, fact-checked, niche-themed content, so you know what you are getting. (The Wall Street Journal and Business Insider both want you to pay for business news, for instance.)\n\nBut Medium's content is random. On November 14, Medium's front page had articles such as, \"How I Got My Husband to Actually Do His Share of the Housework,\" \"Where Do Our Sex Dolls Go After We Die?\" and \"The Books That Saved My Life in Prison.\" It has also published a lengthy, impressive dissection of the sham behind the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment.\n\nWill people want to pay for a product that consists entirely of surprises, of varying quality, from writers who don't work full-time? Williams says yes. \"The whole system is growing, both topline uniques, visits, posts, and subscribers,\" Williams says. He declines to talk about revenues, however.\n\nGrowth is not the same as profit, either. Williams has so far taken $134 million from investors since 2012, and he confirmed to Business Insider that the company remains unprofitable. The investment is a massive sum for what is, in many ways, a magazine-format media company. And six years is a long time to run without finding a way to sell your product for more money than it costs to make.\n\nWilliams says he will be seeking more investment soon. It is, perhaps, not a coincidence that he did the media tour at Web Summit in November. Good publicity often helps companies persuade VC investors to part with cash.\n\nMedium abandoned its previous business model, advertising, over a year ago. Advertising could have been good for Medium. With 90 million users, even if the site ran only automated \"programmatic\" ads, it would have generated revenues in the millions of dollars. But Williams didn't go programmatic. Instead, he offered sponsored content \u2014 handcrafted stories written specifically to please brands \u2014 which Medium then promoted around its unsponsored articles.\n\nWilliams has a bewildering explanation of how this worked:\n\n\"Sponsored content is a particular type of content that we could charge to have created. So what we did was package creation, hosting, and distribution. And so the creation of that content isn't the creation of other content, it's the creation of sponsored content. So the only way for that to pay for non-sponsored content is by advertising the sponsored content on the non-sponsored content. Meaning, we could get paid for creating sponsored content but we couldn't pay someone who was creating non-sponsored content, except by putting ads on the non-sponsored for the sponsored content, and then that is being monetised. So our company is being monetized with sponsored content, the content that is not sponsored is being monetised with an ad.\"\n\nHe pauses for a beat, and adds, \"We stopped all that.\"\n\nHis former girlfriend once told The New York Times: \"He's not CEO material\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve screwed up in many, many, many ways in terms of managing people,\" Williams admitted in 2010. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\n\"We stopped all that\" are four words that cover a tough period inside Medium. Fifty people \u2014 one-third of the workforce \u2014 were laid off in 2017 as Medium pivoted away from advertising. He cut ties with a number of publishing partners. He made a lot of people angry. Sources told Business Insider at the time that they regarded Medium as a \"s---show\" and a disorganised \"vanity startup.\"\n\nRead more: INSIDE MEDIUM'S MELTDOWN: How an idealistic Silicon Valley founder raised $134 million to change journalism, then crashed into reality.\n\nThe episode also burnished Williams' reputation as not-the-best-CEO-who-ever-walked-the-Earth. In addition to being Twitter's creator, he was also the CEO from 2008 to 2010, a time remembered for infighting between the founders. Current Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \u2014 who still sits on the board with Williams \u2014 was once asked by The New Yorker what he was thinking in 2010 when he helped persuade the board to force Williams out of the chief executive's chair in favour of Dick Costolo. \"Was I thinking, Screw Ev? Emotionally, was I asking that? I don't know. Maybe,\" he said.\n\n\"I've screwed up in many, many, many ways in terms of managing people,\" Williams admitted in 2010. Even his girlfriend agreed: \"It was bitter, horrible and tough. He's not CEO material. It doesn't play to his strengths. He's a better inventor; he's better at coming up with ideas,\" Meg Hourihan told the Times.\n\nBut that was eight years ago. Things have changed. Williams has evolved.\n\nThe stuff that gets the most traffic is often the most awful content on the net: Porn. Clickbait. Politically biased news.\n\nWilliams wants to reward the best content \u2014 financially. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\nThe real problem with advertising on Medium, Williams says now, is that \"I didn't think it would ultimately create the incentive structure we were trying to do, which was to really reward the best content. You can build a business around it, but it doesn't directly support great content.\"\n\nThat bit about \"reward the best content\"?\n\nThat is key to understanding why Williams has eschewed the simplest, most lucrative way \u2014 advertising \u2014 of monetising his site. To make advertising pay, sites need to rack up huge audiences. The problem is that the content that gets the most traffic is often the most awful content on the net: Porn. Clickbait. Politically biased news. That's how a bunch of teenagers in Macedonia got rich in 2016, by pumping out fake pro-Trump stories for gullible Americans to click on, such as \"Michelle was caught cheating with Eric Holder \u2014 OBAMA IS FURIOUS!!!\"\n\nAnd that's why Williams regards the internet as being like a \"car crash.\" Everyone stares at car crashes. But the internet interprets this as a demand for car-crash content, and supplies ever more of it. Williams wants to turn that on its head and create a virtuous cycle in which people are rewarded for supplying only the highest-quality content. People are happy to tolerate advertising alongside free porn. But they are generally only willing to pay to read reliable, helpful material.\n\nHe is rewarding that content financially, too. A team of editors now assigns paid freelance articles, just like a magazine. And anyone can sign up to Medium's \"Partner Program,\" which gives writers a slice of each $5 subscription based on how deep a subscriber's engagement went.\n\n\"Our content spend in 2018 will be more than $5 million. We are budgeting multiples of that for next year,\" Williams says.\n\nAs an example, Williams talks about a recent article on how to set up your iPhone for minimal distraction. \"It was a 73-minute read. It was deep, meaningful content but it can be curiosity driven, it can be utility driven, it can be every topic under the sun.\"\n\n\"I'm still just obsessed about how I use my time\"\n\nWilliams regards himself as a former social media addict. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\n\"Minimal distraction\" is a subject close to Williams' heart. As an ex-social media addict, he is trying not to use his iPhone. He has switched off many of its notifications and tries not to take it with him to events with friends or children.\n\n\"I'm still just obsessed about how I use my time,\" he says.\n\nAnd does he really wear a wristwatch so that he isn't tempted to look at his phone to see the time?\n\n\"I do wear a watch. It's a regular old-fashioned wind-y watch.\" Then he gestures to the watch with his free hand, in a jokey way, as if he's trying to sell it on a cable TV shopping channel, and says, \"It's a Vacheron. A Swiss watch. It's very nice. I sometimes wear a Swatch, but this is my fancy watch.\" And we all laugh.\n\nHe doesn't know which model of Vacheron Constantin he is wearing \u2014 \"It's the very thin one?\" \u2014 but a cheap Vacheron retails for \u00a316,500 ($21,000) and an expensive one will run you to \u00a369,300 ($89,000).\n\nWilliams says he has not been successful in leading a distraction-free life.\n\n\"I try to but just like all of us, I'm faulty.\"\n\nThat obsession with time well-spent recently reared its head inside Medium's HQ. Williams was trying to solve a problem regarding Medium's recommendation system. Readers who like what they find on Medium can offer \"claps\" (similar to likes), or share it on social media (like Twitter), or respond with a comment. Every website has something similar.\n\n\"As we started focusing on subscriptions, rather than just engagement, we found that the quality of stories mattered, not just whether someone was interested in it (or even whether they read it). Quality is, of course, still hard for machines to determine, so in the last year we started doing a lot more human curation, which has driven a change in our machine-based recommendations,\" he says.\n\nRead more: Here's how the other Twitter cofounders reacted to Jack Dorsey becoming CEO.\n\nMeetings that last as long as an entire working day\n\nHe also likes really long meetings. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\nWilliams instituted his favourite new management trick to work on the problem: Meetings that last as long as an entire working day.\n\n\"Here's a thing I believe in and want do more: Have fewer but longer meetings,\" he says.\n\nMost people hate meetings. There's a whole management school ideology around holding meetings while standing up, or walking outside, or banning PowerPoint, to make them shorter and more focused. Is he serious?\n\n\"Longer meetings, yes,\" he says.\n\n\"This is a counterintuitive thing,\" he says. \"Often there's complex problems. You have a series of meetings, you never make progress because it's like cleaning out a closet. You actually have to get everything out, and get organised, and dedicate a significant amount of time to actually crack the nut of a complex problem rather than chip away at it incrementally and when you identify those problems it's actually a lot more productive to get everyone together for half a day, or a day, and actually figure something out, than to do it in your regularly scheduled meeting. That's a trick I am a fan of.\"\n\n\"We had one of those ... last week.\" It was a half-day meeting on the recommendation system, and it brought in engineers and product managers, after months of development. Staff were asked, \"OK, what have we learned, what do we know? Rather than just the weekly 'what are we doing next?' It's complex, it's big, and we made a lot more progress in that meeting than we had for a while,\" Williams says.\n\n\"This year, we built a new recommendations engine from scratch. It's doing better than the old system, but we think it can be a lot better. There are many ways we might go about this \u2014 from focusing more on topics, to various NLP [natural language processing] techniques, to author-follow relationships, to collaborative filtering, and other [machine learning]-based techniques. We have tried a whole bunch of things, some which have worked, some which have not.\"\n\n\"It takes time to get up to speed on what we've done and what we've learned recently, it wouldn't have worked to have a regular one-hour meeting. And if we'd had a series of shorter meetings instead, we would have had to reboot the discussion each time,\" he says.\n\nSeparately, Williams also believes that Medium's comments ecosystem has a unique advantage. On Medium, comments are called \"responses,\" and they don't thread like other comments sections. It suppresses trolls and insults, and promotes positive, helpful responses. Comments don't get shown to other readers unless the author approves them and if the reader follows the commenter. The author has control over what responses are elevated above the rest, by either clapping or responding to the conversation. Other comments \u2014 negative criticisms, random bulls--t \u2014 can be removed by the author, or are otherwise \"buried\" a click away from the story itself. At the same time, writing a comment on Medium involves creating something that looks like a separate post, making the writer feel self-conscious about using the format for a quick insult. When you log in, other users reward you with notifications if they think your comments are good.\n\nPut those two things together: A revenue system that rewards high-quality work; and an ecosystem around recommendations and comments that suppresses trolls and promotes constructive behaviour: That's Williams' latest evolution.\n\nThe latest iteration of Ev is determined to learn from his mistakes \u2014 so he gets anonymous HR reviews from his staff\n\nWilliams has developed a content recommendation system that promotes useful feedback and suppresses trolls. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\nBut do his staff like it? Or are they thinking, \"Oh my god, Ev wants another one of his endless meetings\"?\n\nHe laughs, \"As a CEO you never really know the truth, but they said they liked it! I'll have to get the anonymous feedback.\"\n\nThat is another way that Williams has evolved. Now, he is more determined to learn from his mistakes. He receives regular, anonymous \"360-degree\" feedback from staff on what he is like as a boss.\n\n\"I did one just recently,\" he told us. \"There was some bad stuff so I assume there's a least some truth. But it was super helpful. The last one I did was probably a year and half ago [right after the layoffs and the pivot from advertising] and then I just did another one. It gets interesting when you actually see change.\"\n\n\"The first one that I really took to heart was that I say I am interested in the bad news and negative feedback but I don't actually act like it, so \u2026\" he tails off, laughing at himself.\n\n\"The bad tendency was to dismiss people's concerns if I didn't believe they were valid. Before, I dismissed it. So now it's about listening better and acknowledging the concern, making sure I acknowledge the validity of the concern even if I disagreed that it was a problem.\"\n\n\"There was less bad stuff. So either people are less truthful or I made progress!\"\n\nHe has also committed to listening more to his staff. Diarmuid Greene/Web Summit via Sportsfile\n\nSince the Times' \"no desk\" story ran, Williams has become increasingly deskbound, in part because he wants to listen more to his staff.\n\n\"We rearranged the office. I kind of wasn't talking with my executives enough so we put our desks altogether, so we have a place just to have casual conversations. It's in the open. I also have a dedicated conference room that I call 'my office.' There is this Silicon Valley image of, you just don't have an office, and you are mixed in with the people. But I need a place to meet [privately] with people, also. It's helpful to be able to close the door and have conversations. I also make a lot of phone calls.\"\n\nOn any given day, \"I'm barely at my desk. I'm often in my conference room,\" he says.\n\nAt one level, the no-desk thing is trivial. He tried an office without a desk, but now he uses a desk to help him communicate with his people. So what? Big deal.\n\nBut it typifies the evolving, layered way Williams thinks. A desk is just a thing you put your computer on, sure. But its position also determines who gets to talk to you, and who does not; what information reaches you, and what does not. (Pretty much like the positioning of a publishing platform in a media ecosystem.)\n\nRight now, Williams is trying to listen more. He thinks he is succeeding. In the anonymous HR review he got recently, he tells me: \"There was less bad stuff. So either people are less truthful or I made progress!\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "VP Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping threw verbal jabs at each other in dueling speeches at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit", "description": "China's leader Xi Jinping and US Vice President Mike Pence traded barbs in speeches to a summit of world leaders Saturday, outlining competing visions for global leadership as trade and other tensions between them simmer.

Ayers, Pence's chief of staff, is reportedly a front-runner to replace White House chief of staff John Kelly, who has long been rumored to be on his way out.\n\nTrump hit back at the report Saturday morning, telling reporters outside the White House that Pence is \"100% loyal\" and has been a \"trooper\" within the administration.\n\nHours later, Trump tweeted to lash out at the \"phony story\" and insisted he \"can't imagine any President having a better or closer relationship with their Vice President then the two of us.\"\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley reportedly brushed off the speculation on Trump's alleged doubts about Pence, saying the president \"absolutely supports the vice president and thinks he's doing an incredible job helping to carry out the mission and policies of this administration.\n\nMike Pence and Donald Trump at a campaign event in Virginia.

Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied that the crown prince had a role in Khashoggi's death.\n\nKhashoggi, who was killed last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, contributed to The Washington Post and had written editorials critical of the crown prince. He had gone to the consulate to pick up documents needed to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, 36.\n\nThe CIA's conclusion was based on several pieces of intelligence. The Washington Post, which broke the story, said that information includes a call from Saudi ambassador Khalid bin Salman, Mohammed's brother, to Khashoggi. During the phone call, Khalid bin Salman encouraged Khashoggi to go to the consulate in Istanbul. Other pieces of information supporting the CIA's conclusion are audio recordings from Turkish officials and the fact that several people in the 15-person team that flew to Turkey had served on Mohammed's security team, according to the report.\n\nAn unnamed official told The Wall Street Journal that there was no \"smoking gun\" and that the CIA's assessment was based on \"an understanding of how Saudi Arabia works.\"\n\nThe official also told The Journal \"this would not and could not have happened\" without the crown prince being involved.\n\nThe call from Khalid bin Salman to Khashoggi was made \"at his brother's direction,\" according to The Post, though it is unclear if Khalid bin Salman knew that the journalist would be killed. A spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy told The Post that Khalid bin Salman and Khashoggi did not discuss Turkey and asserted that the CIA's \"purported assessment are false. We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations.\"\n\nTheir full statement was tweeted out on Friday:\n\nThe audio recordings from the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul have been given to multiple international governments and were heard by CIA director Gina Haspel. They reveal that Khashoggi was killed within \"moments\" of arriving at the consulate.\n\nThe Saudi government has repeatedly changed its story on Khashoggi's death. On Thursday, the Saudi public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb released his findings. A spokesman for the prosecutor, Shaalan al-Shaalan, said 11 people had been indicted and five face the death penalty; their names were not released.\n\nThe prosecutor's office said an official at the head of a mission to persuade Khashoggi to come to Saudi Arabia ordered the killing.
