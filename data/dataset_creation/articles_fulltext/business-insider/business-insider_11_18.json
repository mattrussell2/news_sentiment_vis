China wanted to boost trade and investment and \"promote the early commencement of building of even more agreed upon projects,\" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nChinese committed investments in the Philippines in the first half of this year were just $33 million, about 40 percent of that of the United States and about a seventh of Japan's, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, tracking a similar trend the previous year.\n\nTrade between China and the Philippines has picked up significantly, but data suggests mostly in China's favor.\n\nChinese exports to the Philippines grew 26 percent in the first nine months of 2017 from the same period a year earlier, outpacing its imports from Manila, which grew 9.8 percent.\n\nNet foreign direct investment from China has, however, surged to $181 million for the first eight months of this year, from $28.8 million for all of 2017, according to the Philippine central bank.\n\nPRESSURE NEEDED\n\nDuterte has made a point of praising China effusively and confessing his \"love\" for Xi. He even jokingly offered his country to Beijing as \"a province of China\".\n\nMany ordinary Filipinos as well as international lawyers and diplomats are incensed by Duterte's refusal to even raise with China the Permanent Court of Arbitration's (PCA) 2016 award that ruled in the Philippines' favor, and invalidated Beijing's claim to most of the South China Sea.\n\nInstead, Duterte is seeking an agreement with China to jointly explore offshore gas at the disputed Reed Bank in the resource-rich and strategic waterway. Some lawmakers fear that could be tantamount to recognizing Beijing's claim to a site that the PCA ruling said China has no sovereign rights to under international law.\n\nDuterte has also been against Southeast Asian countries taking a united stand against China militarization and at a regional summit last week, he warned against causing friction, because the South China Sea was \"now in their (China's) hands\".\n\nHeydarian said if Duterte was unable to show an economic dividend from his China gambit, it could weaken his hand ahead of 2019 mid-term elections that might determine the success or failure of his presidency.\n\nTo stand a chance of delivering on his policy agenda, Duterte needs his allies to command a majority in Congress and the Senate to ensure key legislation is passed to enable reforms aimed at generating revenue, attracting investment and creating higher-quality jobs.\n\n\"If after Xi Jinping's visit, there's still no big move by China to invest in the Philippines, if China's militarization and reclamation will just continue unabated, you're going to have a situation where Duterte will come under extreme pressure,\" he said.\n\n\"The opposition is going to use that to pin down Duterte and his allies as Chinese lackeys.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Neil Jerome Morales in MANILA and Ben Blanchard in BEIJING; Editing by)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tyler Lauletta", "title": "Julio Jones delivered a massive hit to prevent an interception and now the NFL world is convinced he could play safety", "description": "Julio Jones delivered the biggest hit of Week 11.

Once broken down and diluted with sometimes dangerous additives for retail sale, a kilo can end up being sold for a total in the low six figures.\n\n\"So you have the cartels that are manufacturing the cocaine sending their cocaine to the United States, because they're getting a bigger bang for their dollar,\" Fajardo Orshan said. \"That's how it comes up here and that's how we intercept it.\"\n\nRead more: The Coast Guard is catching more drug-running subs, but most 'very stealthy' narco subs are probably going undetected\n\nIn other markets, like Australia or Europe, prices can be much higher, but established smuggling routes from South America and consistent demand in the US appeal to traffickers, Coast Guard commandant Adm.

For Ocasio-Cortez, the issue seemed to be beyond politics, saying \"that's really what we need to do to save this country.\"\n\nThe call marked the launch of Justice Democrats' #OurTime campaign. The group, which initially recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run, has so far focused on supporting candidates that reject money from corporate PACs and represent progressive stances. Now, according to their website, Justice Democrats are looking to replicate the success of Ocasio-Cortez across the county by electing \"a new generation of diverse working-class Democrats who have a bold vision to transform our economy and democracy.\"\n\nRead more: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is using Instagram stories to bring you behind the curtain of the Washington, DC establishment\n\n\"We are unafraid of taking on out-of-touch incumbents in primary challenges because we don't need to just elect more Democrats, we need to elect better Democrats,\" reads the group's website.\n\nOn the call, executive director Saikat Chakrabarti put the campaign's mission bluntly: \"We have to primary people because it's one of the only ways we'll get working class people, poor people, people who have great big ideas into the party.\"\n\nAs inspiration, Ocasio-Cortez shouted out other Justice Democrats-backed success stories to illustrate that progressive challenges in primaries were possible: \"When you think about the true vanguard of the progressive movement it is dynamic women like Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar and they ran in blue districts.\"\n\nAlready, even before being sworn in, Ocasio-Cortez and her class have begun to push back on the Democratic establishment in Washington.\n\nOn the first day of orientation for freshman House members, Ocasio-Cortez attended a sit-in in Rep. Nancy Pelosi's office to demand the formation of a select committee to draft legislation that would create a \"Green New Deal\" \u2014 a policy found in Justice Democrats' platform. Pelosi is facing a contentious bid to regain her speaker seat, and Ocasio-Cortez's support, as a leader among the new progressive Democrats, could help put talk of a progressive challenge to bed.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez isn't closed off to the possibility that centrist Democrats can get the job done. When asked about Nancy Pelosi, Ocasio-Cortez said, \"This is not about supporting or not supporting an individual. It's about making sure that we can get as progressive and aggressive of legislation as a party on climate change as quickly as possible.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tyler Lauletta", "title": "Alex Smith suffered a gruesome injury that reminded many of Joe Theisman's infamous broken leg", "description": "Alex Smith suffered a gruesome leg injury in the third quarter of the Redskins game against the Texans.

So far, Jackson has been used as a gadget-play specialist, splitting Flacco out wide and showing Jackson as a pass-run threat to leave defenses guessing.\n\nWhile Jackson's opening drive didn't feature a pass, it showed that the big-play ability that made him one of the most electric players in college football hasn't left him.\n\nFurther, if Jackson can continue to prove a dangerous rusher, the mere threat of him taking off should open up his passing game on its own. When teams over-commit to containing him, he can step up and sling one deep.\n\nJackson's career is still unwritten, and he still has a way to go before convincing his most-skeptic critics that his arm is NFL-ready. But if he can keep moving the ball and the Ravens commit to a game plan that plays to his strengths, there's no reason he couldn't be seen as one of the best quarterbacks of the 2018 draft class a few years down the road."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ellen Cranley", "title": "Rick Scott defeats Bill Nelson for Florida Senate seat after tense recount", "description": "Florida Gov.

However, according to Schefter, the Browns would like to speak with her about what she could bring to the position and the organization. The interview could also lead to a different role with the team.\n\nShortly after the report, Dorsey released a statement saying the team is still in the early stages of their coaching search and Rice \"has not been discussed.\"\n\n\"Former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice is a great leader, possesses the highest possible character, and also happens to be a Browns fan,\" Dorsey wrote. \"Our coaching search will be thorough and deliberate, but we are still in the process of composing the list of candidates and Secretary Rice has not been discussed.\"\n\nRice issued a statement saying she is \"not ready to coach.\"\n\nI love my Browns -- and I know they will hire an experienced coach to take us to the next level.\n\nOn a more serious note, I do hope that the NFL will start to bring women into the coaching profession as position coaches and eventually coordinators and head coaches. One doesn't have to play the game to understand it and motivate players. But experience counts -- and it is time to develop a pool of experienced women coaches.\n\nBTW -- I'm not ready to coach but I would like to call a play or two next season if the Browns need ideas! And at no time will I call for a \"prevent defense.\"\n\nThe role of NFL head coach is evolving\n\nWhile the report was met with skepticism and laughs of \"it's just the Browns being the Browns,\" the move may not be as crazy as it sounds if you consider that the job of \"head coach\" in the NFL is evolving and at some point, it will look nothing like the position with which we are all familiar.\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, NFL head coaches will be less like coaches and more like CEOs. Likely, teams will hire people \u2014 possibly under the title of \"President of Football Operations\" \u2014 to make all the crucial decisions, deal with the media and the public, and leave 95% of the actual coaching to the coordinators and position coaches.\n\nThe position of \"head coach\" would essentially cease to exist.\n\nFuture NFL \"head coaches\" will likely be more like Theo Epstein of the Chicago Cubs. Yale University Power over teams on and off field has shifted to the front office\n\nTo a certain extent, we have already seen this in Major League Baseball, where people like Andrew Friedman of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Theo Epstein of the Chicago Cubs put the teams together and predetermine most of the managerial decisions before a game has even started even though neither is ever in the dugout. The difference in those cases is that a manager is still the public face of the team.\n\nWe have also seen something similar at the college level where coaches like Bobby Bowden and Joe Paterno did little or no actual coaching towards the ends of the careers and were more like figureheads when it came to the actual games.\n\nRead more:The season is already over for some NFL teams \u2014 here are the teams that won't make the playoffs\n\nIn the NFL, the evolution has already begun. Offensive and defensive coordinators typically call plays and run their respective sides of the ball. During practices, position coaches do most of the coaching\n\nDuring games, NFL head coaches are often limited to deciding when to go for it on fourth down and yelling at the officials. Most of their job is done off the field, especially for coaches like Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots who are given more control and autonomy over the team and the organization, something that Rice would likely have.\n\nNone of this means Rice, who is a former member of the College Football Playoff selection committee, will ever be an NFL head coach. But that she is a candidate should not come as a surprise as it is just another example of how the job of head coach is changing, and soon, the position we are all familiar with may disappear forever."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Benjamin Zhang and Matthew DeBord", "title": "These 5 amazing cars from Tesla, Subaru, Lincoln, Ferrari, and Jaguar nearly won Business Insider's 2018 Car of the Year award", "description": "Business Insider is set to announce the winner of our 2018 Car of the Year award.

Immediately after they graduated, they went to work on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.\n\nSamuels worked as a strategy consultant at Bain & Company in New York, DeBaun became a product manager at Intuit, Nelson was an early engineer at Palantir, and Jackson was a community manager at LinkedIn.\n\nThose roles taught them the necessary skills they would take to Blavity, but there was a downside.\n\nWith social and political unrest brewing in places like Ferguson, Missouri, Samuels said he and his friends \u2014 who were, at the time, separated by distance and their careers \u2014 shared a less edifying experience than their happy college days.\n\n\"This time, we didn't have that core black gravity linking us together. The world was exploding. This is 2014; this is coming off the heels of the government execution of Troy Davis; this is after Trayvon Martin. And that was building up to 2014 when Mike Brown was killed,\" Samuels said.\n\nIn this Wednesday Aug. 20, 2014 file photo, protesters march in the street as lightning flashes in the distance in Ferguson, MI. AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File \"It was hard to be a black person in primarily white spaces when so many things were happening,\" he said.\n\nOn some days, Samuels recalled, he would walk into work, and it would feel like none of the political unrest he and other black millennials saw as an existential threat was happening at all.\n\nSo, he did what most black millennials did at the time.\n\n\"I was texting my friends and family, or I was going to social media to feel what needed to be felt, so that at least I knew I wasn't crazy to be like, sad, or upset, or angry, or frustrated.\"\n\nSamuels wasn't alone. That's when he, DeBaun, Jackson, and Nelson landed on an idea. They could take their combined experience in digital technology and business strategy, along with the creative people they knew who were sharing stories on social media, to replicate their college-years' feeling of black gravity. And they could do that on a national level, he said.\n\nSo, in July 2014, Blavity was born. Early on, it existed as a virtual company. The team worked via Slack, Asana, and Gmail. After a year and a half of bootstrapping, they opened their first office, inside a large live-work loft in LA's arts district \u2014 but the hustle continued.\n\nSamuels, DeBaun, and the team lived in that loft; they created separate micro-apartments inside \u2014 one for DeBaun and the other for Samuels \u2014 while the office occupied the rest of the space.\n\n\"It doesn't get any closer than living, eating, and breathing your work,\" Samuels quipped.\n\nThat early focus on elevating African-American millennials in a digital media landscape where they were inadequately represented proved to be the right move.\n\nMore than two years after Blavity's founding, an October 2016 Nielsen report illustrated just how effectively African-American millennials, with their multibillion-dollar buying power and \"undisputed cultural influence\" was driving conversations online.\n\nBlavity founders (left to right): Aaron Samuels, Morgan DeBaun, Jonathan Jackson, and Jeff Nelson. Blavity\n\nA game of endurance\n\nAs if growing a startup with his best friends and living at the office with them weren't enough, Samuels was also attending Stanford business school and traveling.\n\nHe calls his life a game of endurance.\n\n\"It's a statement about the journeys that some entrepreneurs have to go through, that other entrepreneurs never have to go through,\" he said.\n\nThings changed after Blavity raised $1.86 million of seed-round funding in April 2017 from the Washington, DC-based New Media Ventures and LA-based Macro Ventures. The company has since gone on to raise $8.5 million total.\n\nNow the company has an office parked in a pristine high-rise in bustling downtown Los Angeles, where Samuels oversees 48 full-time employees, as well as a new office and staff in Atlanta.\n\nSamuels is excited about expansion but doesn't want to lose sight of the bigger mission: empowering a generation of leaders.\n\nAaron Samuels speaks at the AfroTech entrepreneurial summit in 2017. Blavity/AfroTech \"I'm really excited about the next phase for our company,\" Samuels said.\n\n\"I'm also terrified. I think that it is difficult being a black millennial in this country. That is something that has probably always been true for the entire history of this country. And I don't think that it's different now.\"\n\nSamuels recognizes the progress black people have made in the world, but he warns against using that progress to justify that things still are not as they should be.\n\nHe hopes that Blavity can lead the way in moving the cultural conversation forward. To Samuels, that conversation should include everyone, without neglecting Blavity's foundational principles.\n\n\"I am hoping for more support from our current community to expand, to be welcoming, and to share in our collective excitement about the possibilities of what we can build together,\" he said.\n\nFind Aaron Samuels on Facebook, and on Twitter and Instagram @PoetryAaron.\n\nHear more of Samuels' story, building a business as an artist and founder, and the future of black digital media at IGNITION 2018."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Travis Clark", "title": "The top 5 TV shows on Netflix and other streaming services this week", "description": "Spooky titles are still ruling Netflix, with \"Stranger Things\" in high demand and its \"Sabrina\" reboot gaining steam.

There was a time when privacy concerns were primarily about financial loss, such as bank wire or credit-card fraud,\" Gary Howlin, the senior vice president at Gavin de Becker & Associates, which provides executive protection for wealthy people including clients in the Supreme Court and the CIA, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Now, particularly with personal information readily available via internet and social-media sources, people are using what was once private information to learn where clients live \u2014 or information about their activities in order to seek personal encounters with them,\" Howlin said.\n\nAs a result, the wealthy are proceeding with caution when it comes to grand displays of wealth.\n\nTake for example Kim Kardashian West. The Queen of Selfies has always been known for flaunting her diamonds on Instagram and on \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" but after being held at gunpoint and robbed of more than $10 million in jewelry in 2016, she became more discreet about her wealth by toning down her social-media photos, no longer wearing a lot of jewelry in public, and getting 24-hour security.\n\nKim Kardashian West was robbed at gunpoint in 2016. Jason Merritt/Getty Images\n\nBut such a harrowing incident isn't a prerequisite for being discreet.\n\nCEOs and business moguls, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson, have always been somewhat private, at least to the general public, but even celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Melissa McCarthy are refraining from putting their wealth on display.\n\nThe wealthy are living under the radar at home\n\n\"There was a time when people really flaunted their wealth \u2014 now they don't,\" David Forbes, the head of private office at the estate agent Savills, told the reporter Kate Allen of the Financial Times. \"People's priorities over the years have shifted. Now right at the top of the list, it's security.\"\n\nHe added that while the wealthy still spent money on boats and planes, they didn't want to attract the kind of attention open displays of wealth bring; they're increasingly opting for what Allen called \"under the radar\" living, which takes shape on both small and big scales.\n\nThis involves blocking GPS from locating property with a jamming signal, removing homes from the grid, and hiring architects to conceal buildings \u2014 whether by designing an underground home or by using a \"stealth concealment design\" for aboveground properties, Allen reported.\n\nThese privacy tactics don't come cheap \u2014 one underground mansion was listed for $185 million last year. And those without underground homes are paying up to $500,000 to install luxe panic rooms, which are becoming more popular than ever among the rich as gun violence increases, Business Insider's Katie Warren previously reported.\n\nDrake, seen here with a bodyguard, has a house in Hidden Hills, California, which is blocked from Google Street View. Joe Scarnici/Getty Images\n\nThey're also living in affluent neighborhoods that bar Google's photography vehicles from entering \u2014 meaning their residences don't show up on Google Street View.\n\nPaul McCartney's mansion isn't visible on Street View, and neither are the homes of the residents in the celebrity-studded Hidden Hills, California, which include Kardashian West and Kanye West, Lisa Marie Presley, Drake, and Miley Cyrus, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nTry to drop a pin on Sea Island, Georgia, where numerous PGA Tour players live and where the average home costs $3.2 million, and you'll find no results on Street View either.\n\nRead more:7 places you can't find on Google Maps\n\nForbes told Allen that shell companies and ownership structures enabled anonymity to property buyers, as do gated communities. Homeowners are also spending more on home security systems, he said.\n\nGavin de Becker & Associates provides a very high level of protection. At residential estates, that involves a dedicated security office, elaborate technological early-warning systems, and strict access control to keep people out, Howlin said.\n\nFacebook awarded its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, a $10 million allowance for security this year. AP\n\n\"It is common for a successful, well-known executive to spend a million dollars a year \u2014 or much more \u2014 for a comprehensive security and privacy program,\" Howlin said.\n\nThis year, Facebook approved a $10 million annual security allowance for Zuckerberg and his family, an increase of nearly $3 million from the previous year, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe wealthy are also seeking out privacy and security when they travel\n\nBut such security isn't limited to the home \u2014 the ultrarich are also taking steps to travel more discreetly.\n\n\"If you're driving a convertible Bentley right now in the South of France, you're asking for trouble \u2014 you'll be followed back to your villa by a couple of scooters,\" Forbes told Allen.\n\nPerhaps that's partly why so many billionaires avoid driving luxury cars. Zuckerberg has been seen in an Acura TSX, a Volkswagen hatchback, and a Honda Fit, each valued at or under $30,000. The Walmart heiress Alice Walton, the world's richest woman, drives a 2006 Ford F-150 King Ranch, which retails for about $40,000, according to CNBC.\n\nBut that's just on the road \u2014 traveling across the country or internationally brings other challenges.\n\nFor this, Gavin de Becker & Associates relies heavily on logistical planning and execution \u2014 clients want hotel rooms prechecked under an alias and privately accessible.\n\n\"Our clients will never be found standing at the lobby desk to check in, and even walking through the public spaces is optional,\" Howlin said. The firm also owns and operates the Private Suite at LAX, where rich people pay upward of $4,500 for solitude when traveling \u2014 that includes drop-offs on the tarmac, bodyguard protection, and \"private\" security lines.\n\nRead more:I visited the private terminal at LAX where rich people pay upward of $4,500 to skip the lines and pull up to their planes in BMWs, and it made me feel like a billionaire\n\n\"It's a safe haven offering the best privacy, security, and amenities money can buy,\" wrote Business Insider's Tanza Loudenback, who toured the luxury terminal.\n\nBut that's when they're flying commercially.\n\nThe Private Suite at LAX offers security for elite travelers.

Though thousands of apps claim to help treat everything from alcoholism to opioid addiction, few are truly equipped to help make a dent in the problem, according to Evans and his team.\n\nSo in a recent report, the researchers at Rock Health outline what makes a startup in the addiction space worth backing. They also lay out several red flags they aim to avoid.\n\nOne of the 'largest opportunities to deliver tremendous value to patients and the healthcare system'\n\nRoughly 63,000 Americans died in 2017 from drug-use disorder, commonly known as addiction. Shayanne Gal/Business Insider Among Rock Health's main criteria for backing an addiction-focused startup is ensuring that it's grounded in comprehensive research, Chipper Stotz, one of the report's authors, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's not always an easy task. With thousands of apps claiming to treat some aspect of substance-use disorder \u2014 whether curbing alcohol cravings or working up the courage to attend a peer-support group meeting \u2014 it can be difficult to distinguish a legitimate tool from a scam.\n\n\"As an industry there are hundreds if not thousands of apps that might 'help' with substance-use disorder, but whether they're actually collecting data on their efficacy and viability is another matter,\" Stotz said.\n\nTwo startups in the report that Rock Health felt met these criteria were Marigold Health, the platform that links people with addiction to text-based peer support, and Chrono Therapeutics, which uses a combination of wearable patches and an app to help people quit smoking.\n\nRead more: A 22-year-old Johns Hopkins dropout is pioneering a new way to treat drug addiction using your phone, and health venture capitalists are lining up to invest\n\nEvans believes there will be a shift in addiction-treatment spending toward more services that take after the Marigold model, something he said made the industry \"among the largest opportunities to deliver tremendous value to patients and the healthcare system.\"\n\nSomething that 'works better than the current gold standard of treatment'\n\nBI To ensure that a startup is worthy of their investment dollars, Stotz and his peers at Rock Health look for at least two key things, he said:\n\nAre they working with academic medical centers, such as the University of California, San Francisco's Headache Center, or the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Medicine?\n\nDo they have a full-time staff dedicated to collecting that evidence-based data?\n\n\"We're not looking at solutions that are pen-to-napkin scenarios,\" Stotz said. \"We're really looking for evidence-based programs and solutions that have had some success in different trials.\"\n\nThose trials could be large peer-reviewed papers or smaller-scale clinical trials. The most important factor is that there's data behind the program. This isn't just important from a patient perspective, Stotz said. It's also vital to encourage buy-in from insurance providers who are considering whether to cover the cost of an intervention.\n\n\"Providers,\" Stotz said, want to see that a tool \"works better than the current gold standard of treatment.\"\n\nAreas ripe for a tech solution\n\nThough addiction-treatment models have been around for decades, many of them aren't well-regulated, and the quality and kind of care can differ immensely from place to place. Patients in one ZIP code, for example, may get one kind of treatment, while patients in another are offered an entirely different set of options.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment, for example, is largely regarded as the gold standard for treating opioid-use disorder, or addiction to painkillers like fentanyl or morphine. The treatment involves providing patients with access to medications such as buprenorphine and naltrexone, which have been shown to curb deaths from the disorder.\n\nBut few rehabilitation facilities offer the treatment, instead pushing patients to abstain from all medications.\n\nRead more: Most rehabs don't offer a science-backed treatment for drug addiction. A new initiative aims to change that.\n\n\"The great majority of people seeking treatment do not receive anything approximating evidence-based care,\" the report says.\n\nNew digital solutions could help avoid this type of situation by capturing more data on a more consistent basis, allowing clinicians to see how well a program is working and tweak it accordingly.\n\nDigital tools could help in another way, too: They can help ensure that patients have more regular and consistent contact with the support systems they need to stay healthy.\n\nThat continuous support might take one of many forms, whether texting with a therapist, video calling a peer group, or doing text-based cognitive behavioral therapy, a heavily researched clinical approach to mental illness that encourages people to examine how they react to challenging situations.\n\n\"Ongoing support is really critical,\" Stotz said."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Bob Bryan", "title": "Trump's landmark trade deal with Canada and Mexico is suddenly in trouble", "description": "The highlight of President Donald Trump's trade policy has been the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada \u2014 the USMCA.

The original NAFTA was passed with mostly Republican votes despite being agreed to under President Bill Clinton. Former President Barack Obama, meanwhile, needed extensive GOP support to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nDespite not being able to make large changes to the text \u2014 that would require Trump to reopen negotiations with Mexico and Canada \u2014 legislation can help determine the level of enforcement of certain parts of the USMCA.\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell, who could lead the critical House Ways and Means Committee next year, told Bloomberg that the USMCA can't pass as is. He said there needs \"to be not only changes in the legislation but more enforcement\" in the deal to get enough Democrats on board.\n\nOther Democrats have also expressed misgivings. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, considered the frontrunner to be the next House speaker, has called for strengthening the pro-labor and environmental aspects of the deal by making them legally enforceable, instead of just guidelines.\n\n\"Most important of all are the enforcement provisions in terms of labor and the environment,\" Pelosi told The New York Times. \"Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\"\n\nRead more: A top Republican senator just made it clear that Trump's new trade deal with Mexico and Canada could still fall apart\n\nBut amid the early wobbles, most analysts expect the deal to eventually get done. If Democrats don't agree to the deal, Trump could threaten to pull the US out of NAFTA entirely \u2014 which would be an economic disaster \u2014 and Democrats don't have an alternate track to take.\n\n\"We believe that will happen early next year as we don't believe Democrats will derail the USMCA without a viable alternative just to deprive Trump of a 'win,'\" Nancy Vanden Houten, senior economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a post-midterm note to clients.\n\nConservative pushback\n\nGiven Democrats' hesitation, Trump needs near-unanimous support from his own party to ensure the USMCA's passage.\n\nOn that front, a small clause in the deal could actually cause a revolt among the GOP.\n\nForty conservative House members sent a letter to Trump on Friday expressing displeasure with a provision in the USMCA that requires member countries to beef up workplace protections for LGBT people.\n\nThe House members argue that the deal could force the US to make significant changes to labor laws to make sexual orientation and gender identity a protected class \u2014 or risk getting kicked out of the economically critical deal.\n\n\"A trade agreement is no place for the adoption of social policy,\" the letter said. \"It is especially inappropriate and insulting to our sovereignty to needlessly submit to social policies which the United States Congress had so far explicitly refused to accept.\"\n\nRead more: The US, Canada, and Mexico's new trade pact looks a lot like NAFTA. Here are the key differences between them.\n\nLosing 40 GOP members in the House would require more than 50 Democrats to flip and support the deal for it to pass, which is highly unlikely.\n\nBut making any such changes would be difficult. The deal text is set to be signed at the G20 summit on November 30, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is unlikely to accept any side deals to allow the US to ease up the protections.\n\nBut without those changes, conservatives say the deal could be in trouble.\n\n\"This is language that is going to cause a lot of people to reconsider their support of the trade agreement, and to the point that it may endanger the passage of the trade agreement unless something is done,\" GOP Rep. Doug Lamborn told Politico on Friday."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "GOLDMAN SACHS: GE Capital has a $20 billion funding gap that needs to filled by 2020 (GE)", "description": "General Electric 's lending arm, GE Capital, has to fill a $20 billion funding gap through ways such as selling assets, Goldman Sachs says.

With the acquisition of Whole Foods, new Prime TV series, and brick-and-mortar stores like Amazon Go, it's clear the company isn't satisfied to simply be an e-commerce giant.\n\nHowever, fewer American are aware of Alibaba's expansion \u2014 which is, if anything, even broader than Amazon's attempts. The company has entered markets including food delivery, entertainment, and grocery, with its chain Hema, which is slated to hit 100 locations by the end of this year.\n\nAll-knowing Alibaba\n\nAlibaba \"pretty much wants to own everyone's digital life,\" Michelle Grant, head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Their imagination is the limit,\" Grant said. \"Anywhere from e-sports, to social media, to entertainment, to sports itself, to products, to food delivery \u2014 if they're allowed to play in it, they will.\"\n\nAlibaba's end game isn't just boosting sales of its own brands and those of its merchants. It is intent on gathering a massive amount of data about customers and helping partners do the same as the company builds out its omnichannel New Retail business.\n\n\"It's really about digitizing the entire offline store environment,\" Tsai said. \"One of the biggest challenges with the traditional store environment is when someone walks into the store, they have no idea who the customer is \u2014 whether they picked up something or looked at another item.\"\n\nNow, using mobile technology, Alibaba can track everything from how customers walk through stores to what they were looking at online before making offline purchases. Basically, Alibaba wants to have its finger on the pulse in every factor of people's lives \u2014 and use that information to get them to spend more through Alibaba.\n\nFear and paranoia in the 'global land grab'\n\nAlibaba\n\nRight now, Alibaba's mission doesn't directly interfere with Amazon's own aspirations to expand its reach and dominate every aspect of customers' lives, as they operate in different regions around the world. The pair also has different business models, with Amazon developing as a retailer in its own right, while Alibaba primarily serves as a partner for other businesses.\n\n\"I think the average American thinks that we are the Amazon of China,\" Alibaba president Michael Evans said. \"And, we're not the Amazon of anything.\"\n\nHowever, competition could become more direct as the companies look globally to grow business, with regions such as Southeast Asia and Brazil as potential battlegrounds in what Grant calls the \"global land grab.\"\n\nFor Alibaba, aggressively expanding into new sectors is tied to fear that another company \u2014 be that Amazon or another competitor \u2014 might beat them to the punch and gain an upper hand. If Amazon wins over loyal shoppers with something like grocery delivery in a country where both companies are battling for customers, it could set off a domino effect that threatens Alibaba's online-to-offline retail and data collection dominance.\n\n\"Philosophically, how we look at whether we got into one business or another ... we never ask ourselves whether this is a lucrative area or whether it's going to be a commercially successful thing,\" Tsai said.\n\n\"We do things out of necessity and we do things out of fear,\" Tsai continued, citing Alibaba's 2003 launch of Taobao to shut down the threat of eBay expanding in China.\n\n\"There's a high sense of paranoia within the company.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Democrat Gil Cisneros flips Orange County House seat in last contested California race - Business Insider", "description": "Business Insider Democrat Gil Cisneros flips Orange County House seat in last contested California race Business Insider Democrat Gil Cisneros flipped an Orange County House seat in one of the last contested races in California.

Considering the strengthening greenback has been seemingly pricing in further monetary tightening, a surprising dovish signal from the Fed could send it diving, thereby increasing volatility.\n\nAnother possible agent of cross-market chaos could be shocking macroeconomic data, BAML says. If this scenario were to play out, it could force abrupt downgrades in both gross domestic product (GDP) and earnings growth.\n\nGDP is the bellwether reading for a nation's economy, and any sort of downward rerating could scare investors into a more defensive stance, leading to sharp selling in riskier assets like stocks. Meanwhile, profit expansion has been the foremost driver of gains throughout the almost 10-year bull market, and any vulnerability could also send equities careening lower.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that these factors will combine to cause the next major market crash.

The company has yet to turn a profit, but says it has 3 million paid users.\n\nCal Henderson, despite being with Slack since the very beginning, didn't intend to end up here.\n\nCal Henderson is a British programmer who keeps trying and failing to build gaming companies\n\nWhen Henderson was living in London in the early 2000s, he came across a browser-based social game called \"Game Neverending.\"\n\n\"It was a type of point-and-click type adventure,\" Henderson told Business Insider in an October interview. \"It's not like you could win, it was an exploratory social gamespace.\"\n\nThe game was, Henderson, said \"hard to explain, which is also the reason why it wasn't successful.\"\n\nBut he was fascinated by the casual, social nature of the game, which pre-dated massive online worlds like World of Warcraft and social media gaming like Zynga's FarmVille. He got in touch with the game's development team, headed up by president Stewart Butterfield, and harassed them to let him join.\n\nSlack CEO Stewart Butterfield. Beck Diefenbach/Reuters\n\nButterfield and the team were operating out of Vancouver and quickly running out of cash for developing Game Neverending. They came up with a plan: Build a secondary service that would generate the revenue to fund the game's development.\n\nThey recruited Henderson as chief software architect promising him that, eventually, he would get to work on Game Neverending's development. Despite not having met the team, Henderson agreed.\n\nAnd so the photo site Flickr was born.\n\nFlickr. Flickr\n\nThe original version of Flickr, Henderson said, was a real-time chatroom that let people share photos. \"It was a lot more like Slack,\" he said. \"And it didn't work. You had to be online at the same time as the other person wanting to use Flickr for it to make sense. It was fun to play with in the office, but in real life nobody used it.\"\n\nAt this point, Henderson still hadn't met any of the team. He did eventually meet them when the company gathered together in California to launch the first version of Flickr, which promptly failed.\n\nBut then came further iterations, and the team landed on the idea of hosting photos on web pages. Henderson moved to Vancouver with everyone else to work on the new version full-time and, in his words: \"I just never went home.\"\n\nIt became clear that Flickr was where the money was at. Flickr began to grow quickly, and it was obvious that it was bigger than just a money-spinner for Game Neverending.\n\n\"Reluctantly we shut down development on the game and concentrated the company on Flickr,\" said Henderson.\n\nAround a year after launch, Yahoo acquired Flickr for a reported $25 million. At the time, hardcore early users were unhappy about the change in ownership, although Henderson notes that Flickr only grew its user base hugely after the sale.\n\nDespite the purported benefits of going to a bigger company, like having the cash to grow more quickly, Henderson described the process as \"hugely frustrating.\"\n\nAlthough the company was originally bigger than the then-nascent Facebook and YouTube, and pre-dated Twitter, Flickr wasn't given sufficient resources to grow, as Henderson tells it. The company which had widely been described as the world's best photo-sharing service quickly stagnated.\n\nThen, Henderson said: \"Facebook took us over, YouTube on the video side, then eventually Instagram came around and won mobile for photos. So it was super frustrating.\"\n\nThe Flickr team tried to build a second game \u2014 and failed again\n\nThree years after the Flickr acquisition, Butterfield and his cofounders resigned in spectacular fashion. Like Henderson, Butterfield was not flattering about Yahoo, describing it to journalist Mat Honan as \"a terrible joke.\" He was right \u2014 Yahoo would slowly fall apart thanks to poor leadership and numerous bad decisions around acquisitions.\n\nFreed from the confines of Yahoo, the Flickr gang would reunite to finally build their hit game. This time round, with a successful exit to Yahoo, there wouldn't be any issues with drumming up cash from investors. Butterfield's new company Tiny Speck raised more than $12 million from famed Silicon Valley investors Andreessen Horowitz and Accel, and began work on new game Glitch.\n\nGlitch. Glitch\n\nGlitch was a well-designed, Flash-based browser game with cute graphics and the ability to play collaboratively with other players.\n\n\"Really, it was trying to build those really old, online MUDs [multi-user dungeons], those mostly social spaces, and turn that into a browser-based social space game. That's what we tried to do with Glitch,\" Henderson said.\n\nMUDs were multiplayer online games, usually text-based. They were popular from the early days of the internet through to the 2000s, but were superseded by graphics-based worlds like World of Warcraft. Fans loved them as much for their social interaction as the gameplay, although few MUDs ever made money.\n\n\"[Glitch] was a lot more graphical than those very early games,\" Henderson said.\n\nRead more: Google once rejected this founder for a job \u2014 but then went on to acquire his first startup and partner with his 2nd\n\nBut: \"It really didn't work out. We spent four years on it and after spending a whole bunch of investor money, we hadn't build a game that would ever become a viable business.\"\n\nIt was expensive to keep running the game, and Tiny Speck failed to find a buyer to fund its development costs. Flash turned out to have been a bad bet.\n\nGlitch\n\nFailure to create a successful game was, Henderson said, a harrowing experience. Tiny Speck laid off staff, winding the game down, and telling its players that Glitch would no longer be available. There were around 50 people employed at Tiny Speck at the time, and a big proportion were game specialists. Most had to go.\n\nAt this point, Butterfield and co realised they probably had to give up trying to build games.\n\n\"We knew we wanted to work together again and that we wanted to build something, but it wasn't going to be a game, because we'd really fucked that up after four years and our original vision,\" Henderson said. \"I think the first time around, pre-Flickr, it felt like we failed because we had everything against us. It turns out the second time around we failed because\u2026 we're bad at making games. We had every possible advantage the second time around.\"\n\nA little like Flickr and Game Neverending, Slack's chat service was likewise famously a side-product of Glitch.\n\nSlack's chat service. Slack\n\nWhen Tiny Speck shuttered Glitch in 2012, the company announced it would keep developing its \"unique messaging technology.\"\n\nAlthough Slack now feels like an overnight success, it took $1.2 billion in total investment and a further four years before the company really took off.\n\nAnd Henderson has had to move from being a founding CTO to running a team of around 500 people. Given Slack isn't as big as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, how does he retain talent?\n\n\"We're kind of in an interesting adolescence, because we're not a young small startup any more,\" Henderson said. \"We're very established, especially in the Bay Area, we're more than 1,200 people. We're not public, so it's very different to joining a Google or Facebook where you know where they'll be in a year's time, and it's not early-stage risk.\"\n\nThat means selling people on the fact that Slack makes a meaningful difference to the way people work.\n\nSlack has also achieved what appears to be impossible for everyone else in Silicon Valley: Diversity. Women make up 30% of Slack's technical roles and almost 50% of its leadership roles. Underrepresented minorities \u2014 excluding Asian \u2014 make up 11% of US leadership roles.\n\nBy comparison, women account for 25% of technical roles at Google, and only 26% of leadership roles. Underrepresented minorities make up 4.2% of leadership roles.\n\n\"There are four founders of the company, and we're all white dudes,\" said Henderson, referring to himself, Stewart Butterfield, Eric Costello, and Serguei Mourachov. \"And if you're not intentional about diversity early on then it gets harder to dig yourself out of that hole. It's not just women in engineering, but people from all underrepresented minorities. We were aware we needed to address that very early.\"\n\nSlack is determined not to sell out this time around\n\nHenderson is adamant that Slack will stay independent after the team was burned by its experiences at Yahoo.\n\n\"We're very committed to remaining independent,\" he said.\n\nIts main competition remains Microsoft, which has just acquired the AI startup behind a popular Slack chatbot. The Redmond giant also made a free version of its Slack rival Teams available, to try and persuade small businesses and freelancers onto the platform.\n\nBut, Henderson points out, Microsoft is one giant (and old) company trying to do lots of different things. Slack has the advantage of focusing on one service, and it can move more quickly.\n\n\"The Microsoft competition is really good for us,\" he said. \"When we first started the company and built the product, we were eight people that had a belief that Slack would be useful\u2026 it was all very well for us to believe that as startup founders who have to drink their own Kool-Aid.\n\n\"It's very validating that [Microsoft] believe this is a software category which is going to exist in a decade, which is going to be very important.\"\n\nMicrosoft's Slack rival, Teams. Microsoft\n\nHe added: \"We make exactly one product that we care about, the lifeblood of our company. We concentrate everything on it. We make one thing. The other advantage is that at the core of Slack is it's a collaboration hub for all the different bits of software you have in the workplace, and we are able to partner with all of those organisations, whether it's Microsoft or Google or SalesForce.\"\n\nWith two young children and a company with a bright future to run, Henderson doesn't have a lot of time for games, though he lists Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley among his current favourites. But he still keeps the fire of hope alive along with some other game enthusiasts at the firm.\n\n\"We have a channel inside Slack's Slack called 'Games we might finish,' where we talk about projects that we've started, and which are languishing,\" Henderson said. \"I've been working on this game for about two years, which I've written some of the outline of, and which I've got really good ideas about, but I've not found the time to really do anything.\"\n\nBut, he concludes: \"I'm definitely going to finish this one.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Trump calls Saudi Arabia a 'spectacular ally,' despite CIA report blaming the crown prince for Jamal Khashoggi's death", "description": "Reuters/Yuri Gripas President Donald Trump said Saturday that a CIA assessment blaming Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was \"very premature.\" Trump said he would receive the complete CIA report on T\u2026", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-calls-saudi-arabia-spectacular-ally-despite-cia-report-on-khashoggi-death-2018-11", "urlToImage": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bf0c655da27f865b85a1693-1920-960.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T02:32:06Z", "content": "WASHINGTON/MALIBU, California (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday called a CIA assessment blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi \"very premature\" and said he will receive a complete report\u2026 [+5750 chars]", "fulltext": "WASHINGTON/MALIBU, California (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday called a CIA assessment blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi \"very premature\" and said he will receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday.\n\nTrump, on a trip to California, said the killing \"should never have happened.\" The report on Tuesday will explain who the US government believes killed Khashoggi and what the overall impact of his murder is, Trump said.
