My support for the new deal in the coming weeks, and perhaps that of many of my Republican colleagues, will depend on the steps the president takes to strengthen it.\n\nOn the positive side, the USMCA enhances the current Nafta with a new section covering digital trade, broader intellectual property-rights protections, and a ban on localized data storage requirements. The benefits of these improvements are unfortunately more than offset by the USMCA\u2019s trade-limiting provisions. These include its expiration 16 years after it enters into force, continued use of Section 232 tariffs, severely limited investor dispute settlement protections, arbitrary wage requirements on auto and auto parts production, and numerous quotas on autos, steel, and aluminum, among other things.\n\nTo ratify the USMCA, President Trump faces a choice: make further trade-restricting concessions and hope they secure passage in a House of Representatives controlled by Democrats next year, or make protrade modifications in the implementing legislation and enact the USMCA under a Republican-controlled Congress before the end of this year. I urge him to choose the latter.\n\nEntrusting House Democrats with passing the USMCA is a dicey proposition, at best. Many of the newly elected Democrats ran on opposition to all things Trump, and the next House speaker will not prioritize passage of President Trump\u2019s signature trade achievement. In addition, liberal constituencies are already panning USMCA. Environmental organizations are actively opposed. Labor unions are withholding support despite significant courtship from the U.S. Trade Representative. And key House Democrats are demanding changes that would undermine trade among the three countries\u2014and may even require reopening negotiations.\n\nThe new Democratic majority in the House also might indefinitely stall passage of USMCA, goading the president into responding with the \u201cnuclear option\u201d\u2014a unilateral withdrawal from the existing Nafta. This would be disastrous for the American economy, and would kick off a constitutional battle between the branches over trade power.\n\nTo avoid this quagmire, President Trump should work with congressional Republicans to incorporate additional free-trade features in the USMCA\u2019s implementing legislation so that it can be passed before the next Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3, 2019. These improvements wouldn\u2019t require reopening negotiations with Mexico and Canada. To preserve this option, the president, under Trade Promotion Authority rules, must submit the final text of the trade agreement to Congress before the end of this month. By doing this, the president would preserve the fast-track procedures of TPA, including a straight-up, simple majority vote requirement in the Senate. This procedural step does not commit President Trump to a strict timeline for passage of the USMCA. Rather it leaves open the option for congressional consideration this year or next.\n\nConsidering the USMCA before the end of this year would require a process more expedited than some of my colleagues would prefer. However, it may be the president\u2019s best shot at securing a vote on USMCA, and preserving the North American trading relationship. That is why I, and 11 of my Republican colleagues, sent a letter to President Trump late Tuesday, asking him to keep open the option of passing this agreement in this Congress.\n\nIf President Trump chooses to pursue a USMCA vote in Congress this year, I will engage in a good-faith effort to work with his administration on implementing legislation that corrects the flaws listed above and that could pass Congress with the votes of free traders like me.\n\nMr. Toomey, a Republican, is a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Paul Romer", "title": "Government Can Do More to Support Science and Innovation", "description": "Focus on infrastructure, information sharing, and separating scientific advisors from regulators.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-can-do-more-to-support-science-and-innovation-1542758326", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CK557_romer_SOC_20181118125130.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:58:48Z", "content": "The U.S. government is divided and so are the people.

But perhaps we can all agree that the economic growth of the 20th century, driven by robust markets and technological innovation, was good for everyone. The government can do more than most policy makers realize to sustain this long-term, broadly shared growth through investment in science.\n\nI have three recommendations for the 116th Congress to support the sciences and foster innovation:\n\nFirst, government needs to take a more active role in creating scientific infrastructure. The U.S. has done it in the past, showing that investments in science today can result in critical economic infrastructure tomorrow. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency laid the foundation for the internet, which now powers the modern economy. Now this infrastructure needs to be maintained and improved to facilitate new innovations.\n\nCongress can help without any additional spending by letting recipients of research grants use those funds to support open-source projects, which make their blueprints publicly available. Recipients can already use grant funds to buy commercial software; freeing them up to help open-source initiatives would even the playing field.\n\nTake Python, the open-source programming language that has become the language of choice for software developers in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science. Programmers have used Python to power innovation in everything from the detection of gravity waves (resulting in last year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics) to reducing the cost of developing new drugs. Letting researchers allocate even a fraction of their federal grant funding to support open-source projects like Python would encourage the development and maintenance of scientific infrastructure open to everyone.\n\nSecond, Congress should look for opportunities to extend scientific transparency to the private sector. It could draw on the principles that guided the design of our patent system; the law protects a private right to charge for the use of a discovery, but mandates public disclosure of its details so others can learn from it.\n\nTo see how this could work, consider hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for oil and gas. Regulators in North Dakota forced firms to disclose how much water and sand they used to frack each well and how much oil it produced. This let a different firm drilling a well nearby select a better mixture for its well. Over time, the entire industry optimized the mix used in various geological conditions and substantially reduced costs.\n\nCongress could apply this insight to industries accumulating vast quantities of data about daily life. At an artificial-intelligence conference in September, an Uber representative suggested that anyone looking to do cutting-edge research on autonomous-vehicles would have to come work for the ride-sharing company in order to access Uber\u2019s massive\u2014and proprietary\u2014dataset of vehicle trips. Opening access to that data would speed up innovation and spur growth.\n\nThird, Congress can protect the independence of the federal government\u2019s scientific advisers, who must be uncompromising in their pursuit of the facts. The key is to set them apart from regulators, who rely on facts but must compromise to balance competing interests when they write regulations.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is a model for this. After a transportation accident, the NTSB\u2019s only job is to establish what happened. It can make recommendations, but has no power to implement them. Flight-safety regulations are the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s responsibility. This layer of separation protects both scientists and regulators.\n\nThe same model should be applied to other areas, such as diagnosing the cause of a financial crisis. After the last crisis, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was not able to reach consensus about the facts of what happened because some members jumped ahead to possible regulatory changes. Keep the two separate: Congress should create fact-finding authorities that are independent from all regulatory agencies. This would give regulators and firms the facts they need to evaluate any changes to existing regulations.\n\nBy focusing on science, the 116th Congress can help create growth and prosperity. As a citizen, I remain optimistic. As a scientist, I\u2019m convinced that the U.S. can repeat what it did so well in the last century: foster innovation that benefits all Americans.\n\nMr. Romer, a co-recipient of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics, is a University Professor at New York University."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "William A. Galston", "title": "Work: The New Political Breakthrough", "description": "Left and right are coalescing around policies to boost wages and reduce idleness.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/work-the-new-political-breakthrough-1542757818", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-38024/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:53:08Z", "content": "Americans can argue endlessly about the meaning of the midterm elections, but one thing is clear: Most of us are worried about the divisions in our country and are eager to begin healing them.

According to a recent survey conducted by More in Common, these divisions have energized the far-left and far-right, but have left most Americans exhausted and anxious. Eighty-seven percent believe the country is more divided than at any point in their lifetime, 86% fear these divisions will lead to increased violence, and 89% say they want both parties to find areas of convergence and compromise.\n\nThough there is no reason to expect much from a divided Congress, a few issues seem ripe for bipartisan action. For example, policy makers can narrow the gap between thriving metropolitan areas and small-town and rural regions by boosting the fundamentals of growth\u2014capital, skills, communication, transportation\u2014in left-behind areas, as my colleagues and I at the Brookings Institution proposed in a paper last week.\n\nAnother, even more ambitious goal would be restoring the centrality of work in American society. This ideal frames two important recent books: one from the center-right, Oren Cass\u2019s \u201cThe Once and Future Worker,\u201d and the other from the center-left, Isabel Sawhill\u2019s \u201cThe Forgotten Americans.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan case for action goes something like this: For most people, work is an important source of structure and meaning. There are many different kinds of work, in the home and in civil society as well as in offices and factories, and all deserve respect. But today Americans\u2019 core concern must be paid employment, which honors the principle of reciprocity. Workers do the best they can in their jobs and are compensated by the market, with wages sometimes supplemented by public support.\n\nAlthough unemployment is at a near-record low, the share of Americans participating in the workforce is well below the high reached at the end of the 20th century. The decline of work among men with less than a four-year degree has been especially pronounced. The consequences have not been pretty: dissolving marriages, unstructured lives, rising rates of depression, substance abuse and suicide.\n\nWe can argue endlessly about whether changes in the economy triggered changes in the culture or vice versa. But whatever may have been the case three decades ago, we have reached a point at which it no longer matters. In too many areas, cultural and economic decline have combined to create a tangle of dysfunction.\n\nPolicy makers should view the problem from the starting point of today, and resolve to take action on every front. America must restore the norm of gainful employment for all who are mentally and physically able and are not working in the home. The private and public sectors must share responsibility for equipping every American, college-bound or not, with marketable 21st-century skills. Congress and state legislatures should restructure public benefit programs to encourage work and ensure that workers earn a living wage. Finally, the nation must enact public policies that sustain the labor market through downturns, making it possible for every able worker to find a job.\n\nOpportunity for all who seize it, work for all who can do it, cooperation by every sector in this endeavor: these are the building blocks of a social compact that a wide spectrum of the American people can endorse.\n\nSome will reject this program. Backers of a universal basic income believe that the link between work and income should be broken, while advocates of an unregulated private market claim the invisible hand will produce all the jobs and compensation workers need and deserve.\n\nOther critics go even further. Writing from a Christian perspective, Jonathan Malesic argues that there is a mismatch between our moral expectations and the reality of modern work. The characteristic activities of today\u2019s workplace inculcate more vice than virtue, he alleges, and tear down character rather than building it. \u201cWe believe the false promise that work confers dignity, character, and purpose,\u201d he says in a recent essay. As a result, \u201cOur commitment to the work ethic, meant to help us live the good life, is actually keeping us from doing so.\u201d\n\nMr. Malesic anticipates, and looks forward to, a time when automation will end work as we know it, freeing workers to develop and live out individually crafted, noneconomic forms of meritorious life. But most people need to find meaning within structures they do not create. Until there is a clear alternative for more than a few unusual individuals at the margins, it would be dangerous to undermine the moral centrality of work, a principle that can help reunite our divided society."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Holman W.

Now many seem convinced they have comprehensive insight into Facebook \u2019s special iniquity as it failed to solve the dilemma of an open platform on which Russians and others are able to post content that many find objectionable.\n\nThey don\u2019t. The Times gives us a sliver of a window that, at best, may be accurate but is incomplete.\n\nThe Washington Post offers a piece of similar length examining a single producer and single consumer of fake news. Lo, the producer is a liberal who enjoys baiting conservatives (and making money from it) with made-up stories shared on Facebook, such as one claiming Chelsea Clinton and Michelle Obama flipped Donald Trump the finger at the White House during the national anthem.\n\nThe consumer is an elderly woman who invests no more effort in these stories than it takes to click \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare.\u201d She is a lifelong Republican, we\u2019re told, but the Post doesn\u2019t even tell us if she voted.\n\nSo what is the net effect? Probably nil.\n\nA voice against the howling has been a group at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, whose work we\u2019ve pointed to before. Now they have a book based on actual evidence of millions of news stories and how they were shared on social media. What drove the election decision was not Russian trolls or fake news on social media but a pas de deux of the mainstream center-left media and conservative upstarts like Fox and Breitbart.\n\nSome choice bits:\n\nWhat happened in 2016, they write, \u201ccannot be laid at the feet of Facebook, Russia, or new technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the starkest findings of our work was the extent to which non-horserace coverage in mainstream media followed the agenda of the right-wing media and the Trump campaign. . . . Trump got more coverage, and, however negative, the stories still covered his core substantive issues\u2014immigration, jobs, and trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cCritically, if the biggest win for Russian information operations is to disorient American political communications, then overstating the impact of those efforts actually helps consolidate their success. . . . [I]t is important not to confuse the high degree to which Russian operations are observable with the extent to which they actually made a difference to politically active beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors on America.\u201d\n\nDuh.\n\nLet\u2019s roll back the tape. It was evident to this columnist Russian trolls were favoring Donald Trump as early as mid-2015, but it didn\u2019t then and doesn\u2019t now seem like a big deal. The internet is a welter of dubious information and fake claims by people pretending to be somebody they aren\u2019t. On the internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog.\n\nFacebook, it\u2019s true, brought this behavior to many more people than were accustomed to patronizing, say, 4chan. So let\u2019s ban all new things\u2014or perhaps grow up about the dilemma of open platforms and the First Amendment.\n\nWhen it comes to the Russians, the Berkman book also shows why this column makes a habit of dumping on any simplistic analysis that assumes pro-Trump Russian messages increased the Trump vote. As the prior administration\u2019s intelligence chiefs made clear, Russia wanted its meddling to be seen. The real message was, \u201cWe\u2019re screwing with you, America.\u201d So how many votes did Mr. Trump lose during the campaign because of a torrent of partisan and media innuendo about his alleged Putin ties? The net effect of the Kremlin\u2019s noisy activities is what matters.\n\nIf we\u2019re being honest with ourselves, the overwhelming effect of Russian meddling was to make Russian meddling a club that U.S. elites could use on each other in pursuit of ambition. Somebody might well be deserving of blame for this, but it\u2019s not Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nFacebook is an especially inapt scapegoat for the besetting uncertainties of our age. The U.S. electorate is described as \u201cpolarized.\u201d Closely divided, with a large number of voters shifting back and forth, would be a better description. But what divides us is harder to put a finger on\u2014or maybe it\u2019s truer to say anything would be apt to divide us given the problems of the post-war Western model: overflowing debt plus insufficient productivity to keep living standards universally rising, to afford promised pensions and health care, to give the next generation a better life.\n\nPolitics is fully capable of making things worse, as we might find out thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s trade warfare or the neo-socialist infatuations of the Democrats. But it\u2019s also to politics that we must turn for solutions. That means changing the subject from the search for scapegoats."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "William Mattox", "title": "'School Choice Moms' Tipped the Florida Governor's Race", "description": "DeSantis owes his win to unexpected support from minority women.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/school-choice-moms-tipped-the-governors-florida-race-1542757880", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37868/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:51:21Z", "content": "Believe it or not, Republican Ron DeSantis owes his victory in the Florida gubernatorial election to about 100,000 African-American women who unexpectedly chose him over the black Democratic candidate, Andrew Gillum.

This exceeded their support for GOP U.S. Senate candidate Rick Scott (9%), Mr. DeSantis\u2019s performance among black men (8%) and the GOP\u2019s national average among black women (7%).\n\nTo be sure, 18% of the black female vote in Florida is equal to less than 2% of the total electorate. But in an election decided by fewer than 40,000 votes, these 100,000 black women proved decisive. Their apparent ticket splitting helps to explain why the Florida governor\u2019s race wasn\u2019t as close as the Florida Senate race, though Mr. Gillum was widely expected to carry Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson to victory on his coattails.\n\nWhat explains Mr. DeSantis\u2019 surprising support from African-American women? Two words: school choice.\n\nMore than 100,000 low-income students in Florida participate in the Step Up For Students program, which grants tax-credit funded scholarships to attend private schools. Even more students are currently enrolled in the state\u2019s 650 charter schools.\n\nMost Step Up students are minorities whose mothers are registered Democrats. Yet many of these \u201cschool-choice moms\u201d vote for gubernatorial candidates committed to protecting their ability to choose where their child goes to school.\n\nFour years ago, Gov. Scott narrowly won re-election thanks to a spike in support from school-choice moms. In 2016 more than 10,000 scholarship recipients joined Martin Luther King III in Tallahassee to protest a lawsuit filed by the teachers union in America\u2019s largest-ever school choice rally.\n\nRegrettably, Mr. Gillum\u2019s campaign chose to ignore signs that many minority voters view school choice as \u2018\u2019the civil rights issue of our time,\u201d to quote Condoleezza Rice. Mr. Gillum figured his charm and potential to become the state\u2019s first black governor would win over African-American voters.\n\nBut many school-choice moms were not convinced. A social-media campaign by the Florida Federation for Children reminded voters of Mr. Gillum\u2019s strong opposition to school choice. The issue also helped solidify Mr. DeSantis\u2019s support among Latinos at an impressive 44%.\n\nThe unexpected outcome of the Florida governor\u2019s race should encourage Republicans nationwide to pitch their education agenda to minority voters. It should also prompt Democrats to rethink their blind allegiance to teachers unions.\n\nMost of all, Florida\u2019s surprising outcome ought to encourage every American\u2014especially in these hyperpolarized times\u2014to support policies that bring together strange bedfellows to solve serious problems.\n\nMr. Mattox is director of the Marshall Center for Educational Options at the James Madison Institute.

But investors suffering high market anxiety fortunately do not need to wonder whether tax competitiveness will help the U.S. in the long run.\n\nThe Journal\u2019s Corrie Driebusch reports on Tuesday\u2019s rout:\n\nMounting concerns about the pace of growth spurred fresh declines in stocks around the world Tuesday, wiping out yearly gains for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average...\n\nThe latest bout of selling left investors grappling anew with concerns that the nearly 10-year bull market could be running out of steam, even as ongoing growth in U.S. jobs, manufacturing, and corporate earnings signal to many that a recession isn\u2019t imminent...\n\nAnalysts say there is little evidence to support an impending recession. Earnings are growing at a solid clip, manufacturing production grew at a solid pace for the fifth consecutive month in October, and the U.S. economy\u2019s growth, while slowing, is still powering ahead at a faster pace than it notched for much of the long-running U.S. expansion since the financial crisis.\n\nYet analysts at big institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan also see very slow growth ahead, perhaps because they have bought into the \u201csugar high\u201d theory that the Trump tax cuts provide only a temporary stimulus before the U.S. returns to its sluggish new normal destiny.\n\nWhite House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett, on a recent trip to London, takes on this theory in an interview with the Economist magazine. Mr. Hassett emphasizes the impact of the United States cutting its federal corporate income tax to the new competitive 21% rate from the old 35% levy, which was among the highest in the industrialized world:\n\nI think that we should start by defining sugar high. And I think a sugar high would be maybe a consumption burst that was driven by something like the government mailing checks to people, or the Cash for Clunkers programme in the previous recession, where we bought a bunch of used cars and then people went out and bought new cars. What\u2019s happening now is that we\u2019ve cut the cost of capital. So we\u2019ve made it cheaper to invest in the US.\n\nHe adds that investment and economic growth have picked up just as the White House predicted, and that the economy will continue to benefit as firms are able to increase output thanks to the new machines bought with the increased investment. He reminds readers that \u201cwhen we came out with our 3% [GDP growth] forecast for this year people said the forecast is ludicrous. It was driven basically on hard science that we\u2019ve documented extensively in the Economic Report of the president. And we now see it in the data.\u201d\n\nBut can it last? Just a wee bit west of the Economist\u2019s London offices lies perhaps the world\u2019s foremost example of the power of competitive corporate tax rates. For decades Ireland has enjoyed one of the lowest rates in the world. And the latest readings suggest that the country continues to outshine its higher-taxed neighbors.\n\nTwo weeks ago Irish public broadcaster RTE reported:\n\nThe European Commission has revised upwards its growth predictions for Ireland for this year and next year as it cut the overall growth forecasts for the euro zone.\n\nGDP growth for Ireland is now forecast to reach 7.8% in 2018 and 4.5% in 2019, the Commission said in its latest quarterly economic forecast.\n\nThe Commission had predicted growth of 5.6% for this year and 4% for 2019 in its summer economic forecast.\n\nEven before this upward revision, the EC was expecting the Emerald Isle to record the fastest growth in the European Union this year. The Celtic tiger is roaring especially loudly when compared to the quiet economies nearby. RTE continues:\n\nUnder the forecasts, the euro zone will grow 2.1% this year after a 2.4% expansion in 2017.\n\nThe slowdown will continue next year when growth is expected at 1.9%, slightly below the previous estimate of 2%.\n\nKieran Donoghue of IDA Ireland, the country\u2019s public-private agency tasked with encouraging foreign investment in the country, tells this column that the Irish government \u201cremains totally committed\u201d to the country\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate. But he also notes with concern that Ireland no longer boasts the most competitive rate in the region.

TJX and Ross Stores ROST -1.56% on Tuesday both said that rising freight and wages were cutting into profits. Target reported that its gross margin slipped in the third quarter, while on its earnings call executives repeated their mantra of ensuring that the company \u201cis priced right daily.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, all those retailers\u2019 shares fell sharply. More surprisingly, even Apple AAPL -2.54% is suffering from the same issue.\n\nDemand for Apple\u2019s new iPhones has been lower than expected, leading it to slash production orders. Among the explanations, which include a maturing smartphone market and heightened competition, an important one is price. Apple\u2019s new crop of iPhones cost $749 to $1,099, versus $649 to $769 in 2016\u2014enough of a difference for people to hang on to their current phone a little longer or switch to a less expensive alternative.\n\nHome builders can relate. A combination of high prices and rising interest rates has been cutting into new home sales, and on Monday the National Association of Home Builders reported its measure of builder sentiment tumbled this month. The broad S&P index of home-building stocks has fallen by a third so far this year.\n\nApple\u2019s experience is worrisome for most businesses because the effort to switch from the company\u2019s operating system is greater than it is to another brand of bleach or to private-label cornflakes.\n\nSo far, Apple appears to be among the minority of companies trying to get consumers to pay significantly more. When it reported results last week, Walmart said that gross profit margins at its U.S. stores edged lower in part as a result of \u201cprice investments,\u201d the company\u2019s euphemism for price cuts. Last week\u2019s inflation report from the Labor Department showed little effect on prices from the most recently imposed tariffs. For companies that don\u2019t compete against Walmart, there is Amazon.com , where profit margins have always been thin.\n\nYears of low inflation have ground down Americans\u2019 inflation expectations, making them less willing to accept price increases. Consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan now say they expect inflation to average 2.6% over the next five years. That is higher than the actual pace of inflation now, since people always overestimate inflation, but lower than the 3.1% they expected before the last recession hit.\n\nThe tight jobs market and another wave of tariffs mean companies will be under rising pressure to raise prices. But companies that assume their customers will agree to pay more risk seeing those customers go away.\n\nWrite to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Rebecca Ballhaus", "title": "The Wall Street Journal: Trump submits written answers to Mueller\u2019s questions", "description": "Lawyers for President Donald Trump said they have submitted written responses to questions posed by special counsel Robert Mueller about possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyers-submit-written-responses-to-muellers-questions-1542750815", "urlToImage": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GY871_18trum_ZG_20181120171407.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:15:21Z", "content": "WASHINGTON Lawyers for President Donald Trump said they have submitted written responses to questions posed by special counsel Robert Mueller about possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

WBA 1.32% and health insurer Humana Inc. HUM 0.27% are in preliminary discussions to take equity stakes in each other, according to people familiar with the matter, as health-industry players scramble for tie-ups that will help them compete in a rapidly evolving environment.\n\nThe companies, which already have a partnership focused on serving seniors from two Walgreens locations, are having wide-ranging talks that also include the possibility of expanding that venture, the people said. Details of the talks couldn\u2019t be learned and there\u2019s no guarantee there will be any new deal between the companies.\n\nDrugstore owners and other health providers are looking for ways to diversify, bulk up and insulate themselves against external threats, including from Amazon.com Inc.\n\nThe latest talks come nearly a year after Walgreens rival CVS Health Corp. announced a $69 billion deal to buy insurer Aetna Inc. The proposed acquisition is aimed at securing new avenues for growth for the pharmacy company and capturing more of what consumers spend on health care.\n\nFor Walgreens, a closer connection with Humana could replicate expected benefits of the CVS-Aetna deal at a much lower cost than a takeover, especially given the strong performance of Humana stock in recent years. Humana\u2019s market value currently stands at about $42 billion, while Walgreens\u2019 is $78 billion. Cross shareholdings could increase incentives for the companies to work together and make their partnership work.\n\nWalgreens, based in Deerfield, Ill., has more than 18,500 stores in 11 countries, including those from equity-method investments. Its brands include Walgreens and Duane Reade in the U.S. and Boots abroad. Walgreens earlier this year bought more than 1,900 stores from Rite Aid Corp. for more than $4 billion. It is one of the world\u2019s largest purchasers of prescription drugs and also has a big wholesale business, which distributes drugs and other health-care products to pharmacies, doctors and hospitals in several countries, mainly in Europe.\n\nHumana, based in Louisville, Ky., had $53.8 billion in revenue last year and is the second-biggest provider of the private Medicare plans known as Medicare Advantage. Medicare is viewed as a growth engine in the insurance industry as baby boomers age into the program.\n\nIn June, the companies announced that a Humana unit would operate primary care clinics focused on older people in two Walgreens stores in the Kansas City, Mo., area.\n\nSeniors are heavy users of pharmacies and a focus for Humana because of its Medicare business. The partnership is part of a broader effort by Humana to move further into the business of providing direct care to its Medicare Advantage members. The company has become a major player in home-care and hospice services, and it also has a growing primary-care footprint, including its Partners in Primary Care clinics.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, the two companies said they \u201ccould possibly look to expand their collaboration into other markets over time.\u201d Ultimately, the partnership could expand nationwide, one of the people said.\n\nThe budding Walgreens-Humana partnership represents more of a back-to-basics course for the pharmacy giant. Walgreens had bet big and lost on a new-age arrangement with Theranos Inc., hosting the Silicon Valley startup\u2019s blood-testing operations in some of its stores without fully vetting the technology. The relationship was a disaster and ended in litigation, with Theranos later shuttering its operations and settling civil-fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Humana pact isn\u2019t the only old-school arrangement Walgreens has undertaken recently. Last month, Walgreens said it would expand its collaboration with LabCorp , a well-established diagnostics company, with the companies opening at least 600 LabCorp patient-service centers at Walgreens stores over the next four years.\n\nWalgreens tried earlier this year to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. , a drug distributor it owns a big stake in, but the companies failed to reach a deal.\n\nIndeed, deal making among the various health-care providers has proved difficult to consummate in recent years. In 2015, Aetna signed a $34 billion deal to buy Humana, but the proposed takeover and a similar one fell apart in the face of antitrust challenges. Earlier this year, Walmart Inc. held preliminary talks to buy or strike another deal with Humana, but those talks have cooled, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u2014Anna Wilde Mathews contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com, Michael Siconolfi at michael.siconolfi@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Gordon Lubold", "title": "The Wall Street Journal: Shifting U.S. troops on border reflects \u2018reallocation,\u2019 not drawdown, Pentagon says", "description": "Some of the thousands of U.S. troops ordered to the Mexican border last month could begin returning to their home bases in coming days as military officials rotate units to address shifting requirements, officials said Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-shift-some-troops-but-border-mission-will-last-until-dec-15-1542747189", "urlToImage": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX875_border_ZG_20181105201959.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:38:05Z", "content": "WASHINGTON Some of the thousands of U.S. troops ordered to the Mexican border last month could begin returning to their home bases in coming days as military officials rotate units to address shifting requirements, officials said Tuesday.

The effort almost made me nostalgic for my years spent chained to a desk as a magazine editor. Sure, my colleagues could be brutally condescending, the pay wasn\u2019t great and the pressure to dress on-trend was relentless, but at least I knew what to expect: aching feet from stomping around Manhattan in heels, mountains of shopping debt and clear-cut boundaries between work and play, with wardrobes for both.\n\nIt\u2019s been 17 years since I\u2019ve regularly reported to an office, and since then many of the rules about how we work, and how we dress for it, have changed. Last year, a report from research group Global Workplace Analytics and FlexJobs noted that the number of people who describe themselves as \u201ctelecommuters\u201d has increased 115% since 2005, which translates into roughly 3.7 million of us who work outside of a traditional office more than half the time. Here in Los Angeles, my work appointments bleed into my personal time as I drive around town, so I need outfits that function for both. To stay focused and on task for the professional parts, I often err on the dressy side.\n\nTHE NEW WFH WARDROBE / For Networking At a Coffee Shop Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas Pair a cozy sweater with on-trend pants, and that agent at the next table might actually ask about your screenplay.

When I have a Skype interview, I reach for a pair of gold statement earrings, a Kosas lipstick and a fashion-y blouse from Isabel Marant or Dries Van Noten. No one needs to know that I\u2019m barefoot in my ripped Levi\u2019s from the waist down. If a deadline\u2019s looming and I need the buzz of human activity to jump-start my brain, I\u2019ll throw on my wide-legged, one-step-above-jeans Jesse Kamm pants and a quilted jacket and join the hordes of other professional nomads looking for Wi-Fi and an empty chair in a cafe. There\u2019s no strict uniform for this disjointed calendar of commitments and environments. Working from home these days, where we are often required to network both in person and online via smartphone, requires a flexible strategy. Vanished are the days when working from home meant being invisible.\n\nThe founders and designers of Sydney, Australia-based Bassike, Deborah Sams and Mary Lou Ryan, addressed these challenges when they created their line of tailored-yet-casual pieces in 2006. \u201cWe were thinking about everybody\u2019s lives, how we\u2019re all juggling, and wanted to create wearable, practical clothes that are easy to launder and care for,\u201d said Ms. Sams. She and Ms. Ryan are eager to provide solutions for our new, collective work-from-everywhere lifestyle. For example: A shirt dress that you can wear over leggings.\n\nTHE NEW WFH WARDROBE / For a Stressful Skype Session Photo: F.

Shirt, $138, shopdoen.com; Earrings, $4,160, tenthousandthingsny.com\n\nWhile a flexible schedule can be liberating, some freelancers set self-imposed rules. \u201cI went to a prep school with a dress code,\u201d said Andrea Arria-Devoe, 43, a contributor to lifestyle website Goop, a documentary film producer and an advisory board member for the Plastic Pollution coalition. \u201cSo it\u2019s been ingrained in me that dressing nicely makes you sit up a little straighter in your chair.\u201d Her new uniform involves dressed-up separates\u2014polished jackets and pants\u2014that are elevated enough for her packed schedule of meetings. She depends on pieces from independent New York designers like Caron Callahan, often wearing the same outfit a couple of days in a row (more environmentally sustainable and definitely a freelancer-only luxury).\n\n\u201c \u2018Vanished are the days when working from home meant being invisible.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKatharine Zaleski, who works at home as president and co-founder of Manhattan-based PowerToFly, an organization that provides companies with the services to meet diversity hiring goals, said that the primary criterion her clothing has to meet is whether it works for her morning school drop-offs via scooter. After that, she might add a nice jacket for a virtual conference, but her professional wardrobe is now completely on her own terms: \u201cBack when I worked in an office full time,\u201d said Ms. Zaleski, 37, \u201cI got stomach aches when I had to wear a restrictive suit or dress all day long.\u201d\n\nLeaving behind the sense of sartorial dread that accompanies zipping up \u201cprofessional\u201d suits and dresses is one of the perks of a flexible job. When Nilou Ghodsi, the founder and owner of the Los Angeles store and online boutique Heist, transitioned from a career in finance in 2002, she also left behind a closet full of Theory suits.

Maj. Gen. Alexander Prokopchuk has already coordinated the abuse of Interpol extradition requests, known as \u201cred notices,\u201d to pursue Mr. Putin\u2019s enemies, including prominent American businessmen and environmental activists.\n\nChina\u2019s arrest and detention of Meng Hongwei, the previous president who disappeared mysteriously earlier this month, has provided an opening for Mr. Putin to pursue his meddlesome agenda. But if the Kremlin tramples on the agency\u2019s neutrality, how will the West respond? How will the civilized nations of the world\u2014the ones that recognize and respect the rule of law\u2014protect their citizens from the wrath of Mr. Putin\u2019s new global police force when it is headed by a loyal general?\n\nGen. Prokopchuk\u2019s allegiances are clear. He was appointed to Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry in 2003, not too long after Mr. Putin ascended to the presidency. He became a key surrogate in the Putinization of the Russian state. Since 2011, when he was appointed head of Russia\u2019s Interpol Bureau, he has been indispensable in Mr. Putin\u2019s manipulation and abuse of what is supposed to be a neutral, apolitical international organization.\n\nPart of the problem lies in how Interpol\u2019s red-notice system works. The process for applying for one of these international arrest warrants is notoriously fickle, requiring a member state simply to submit a form. There is almost no oversight. Interpol rarely investigates the validity of these warrants. The organization acknowledges that approximately 97% of notice requests are not reviewed in depth.\n\nIn 2008 an American citizen residing in Copenhagen was detained as a result of an Interpol red notice and held for almost two months in a maximum-security prison. Ilya Katsnelson was never charged, as investigators determined that it was his involvement with a Putin nemesis\u2014Russian dissident Mikhail Khordorkhovsky\u2014that provoked the warrant. U.S. investor and Putin critic Bill Browder experienced something similar in Madrid, where he was arrested in his hotel room by Spanish police who declared the cause of arrest to be \u201cInterpol\u2014Russia.\u201d\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s weaponization of Interpol is most apparent in the European Union\u2019s frontier Baltic and Balkan states. Interpol issued a red notice for Estonian politician and intelligence chief Eerik-Niles Kross on the eve of the 2013 elections in the tiny Baltic country of 1.3 million. Mr. Kross\u2019s IRL party was poised to make sizable gains against Estonia\u2019s Russia-aligned party.\n\nMost worryingly, Russia is using Interpol as the sharp end of a stick to expand its influence in the Balkans. Mr. Putin is keen to secure Russian control of EU energy supplies through Kremlin proxies Rosneft and Gazprom . Under Gen. Prokopchuk\u2019s watchful eye, Interpol has used red notices to shift geopolitical currents and attack Europe\u2019s energy security.\n\nSince 2009, when Hungarian energy company MOL beat Russian competitors to an investment in INA, Croatia\u2019s largest energy company, Russia has supported Croatia\u2019s attempts to renege on that agreement. A powerful Russian energy presence in central Europe would have huge ramifications for the region and the EU. Perhaps not coincidentally, the MOL chairman Zsolt Hern\u00e1di had an Interpol red notice issued against him on bribery charges this week, despite already being exonerated of those very same charges by the United Nations\u2019 most senior trade-arbitration court in 2017.\n\nAll of this comes at a critical time for the region. Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller visited Croatia in 2014 to try to scare off potential competition in what Russia considers to be its Central European backyard. From energy deals to electoral campaigns, the abuse of Interpol\u2019s red-notice system has real geopolitical consequences. And if Mr. Putin can capture and control benign international institutions to execute silent economic coups in an attempt to destabilize Europe, perhaps it is time for the West to rethink its engagement with these organizations. Allowing Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression to go unchecked could lead to permanent strategic losses for the liberal order.\n\nOf Interpol\u2019s 192 members, 14 democracies account for 74% of the body\u2019s funding. Unless they use that financial leverage to change the body\u2019s archaic processes at this year\u2019s summit in Dubai, a much bigger price will be paid by Europe and the Western world.\n\nMr. Bokhari is a Washington-based national security and foreign policy specialist with the University of Ottawa\u2019s Professional Development Institute."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "A.J.

Baime.\n\nWhen I was 16, I had this beat-up car, and one day I got a flat. I made it to a service station and when I went into the garage, there was this Pantera sitting there being serviced. I nearly had a heart attack. I was living in Joplin, Mo., and seeing a car like that in the Ozarks was like seeing a UFO. I vowed that someday I would own a Pantera.\n\nFast forward to the mid-1980s. You know that kind of dream when you wake up and you can\u2019t tell what is real and what is not? I had a dream that I was driving a red Pantera. It was so real I woke up with my hands in steering-wheel position. I was living in Las Vegas, I had very little money, and I was about to get married. But I decided it was time.\n\nScott Black, owner of a public-relations company in Carrollton, Texas, bought his first De Tomaso Pantera nearly 30 years ago. The 1972 model here is his second.

The 1972 model here is his second. Trevor Paulhus for The Wall Street Journal\n\nI bought my first Pantera in 1989, and I have been an owner ever since\u2014for nearly 30 years. The one pictured here is my second. I bought it in 1996 from a man I knew named Keith Verges. He was an extremely sharp businessman but he gave me an unbelievable deal\u2014$35K.\n\nWhat is a Pantera? For a lot of people my age, it was the car that inspired you to be car-crazy. It was also an international car. Ford Motor Co. partnered with an Italian firm called De Tomaso, and launched the Pantera in model-year 1971. The body was designed by an American named Tom Tjaarda. The engine was a 351-cubic inch Ford V-8 (American), the transaxle was by ZF (German), and the tires were Michelin (French).\n\nFord sold Panteras in the U.S. through Lincoln-Mercury dealers. Unfortunately De Tomaso was not the best at quality control, and the 1970s oil crisis didn\u2019t help matters. Ford discontinued the car in the U.S. around the end of 1974.\n\nToday, Pantera owners are a different breed. Unlike some owners of old cars, who treat them like \u201cgarage queens,\u201d Pantera owners are known to drive these cars\u2014to drag-race them, road-race them, just have fun with them. It is an Italian exotic that is reasonably priced, and there is a great community around them.\n\nOne of the Pantera clubs puts out a guide with the contacts of owners. So no matter where you drive your Pantera, you can find someone to help you out in a jam or to throw you a party.\n\n\u2014Contact A.J.

Ideas include germ-killing lamps and a turbo-charged \u201cuniversal vaccine\u201d that would be effective for years and would fight all strains of flu, not just a few.\n\nNYC Health + Hospitals, the nation\u2019s largest public health system, recently convened experts to brainstorm how to handle a flu pandemic, in which millions would be stricken.\n\n\u201cIt is not a matter of if it will happen, it is a matter of when it will happen,\u201d Syra Madad, senior director of the system\u2019s Special Pathogens Program, told the gathering of more than 100 hospital and government officials and researchers. \u201cWe have all the ingredients for a pandemic,\u201d she said, recalling the 1918 flu that killed 50 million people across the world.\n\nSince then, there have been major advances in science and infection control. But there are also more lethal bugs floating around in an incredibly mobile society, Dr. Madad said. In the 2017-2018 flu season, nearly 80,000 Americans died and more than 900,000 were hospitalized. Experts advise getting the seasonal shot; this week, they couldn\u2019t predict this flu season\u2019s severity or how effective the flu shot will be.\n\nOne weapon unavailable in 1918 is the flu shot, which Dr. Madad and other experts say is still a must, no matter its shortcomings.\n\nA new drug to relieve flu symptoms was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the first in nearly 20 years, the agency said. Xofluza is supposed to shorten the flu\u2019s duration by a day or more and requires only one dose.\n\nBut preventing flu is the goal, and most experts agree that more effective vaccines are urgently needed. Typically, the seasonal shot has an effectiveness rate between 40% and 60%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the most recent season, it reduced a person\u2019s likelihood of getting sick with the flu by 40%. Getting the vaccine significantly reduces hospitalization among adults and children, says Dan Jernigan, director of CDC\u2019s influenza division.\n\nEvery year, flu vaccines are planned months in advance. Predicting which strains the vaccine should cover \u201cis a guessing game,\u201d said Jeffrey Shaman, an associate professor at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is spearheading the federal effort for a universal vaccine. A leader during the AIDS epidemic, he sees that fight as a template for taking on the flu. He hopes to replicate the \u201cpassion\u201d that went into AIDS research, with \u201cyoung as well as experienced investigators from different fields\u201d mobilized to seek a cure.\n\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before Congress in March about the recent flu season. Dr. Fauci is challenging researchers to work together on a universal vaccine against flu. Photo: Toya Jordan Sarno/Bloomberg News\n\nDr. Fauci aims to assemble a dream team of scientists with different areas of expertise\u2014such as virology, immunology and drug development\u2014to work together on a universal vaccine. For seven years, his project, the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers, will dole out $30 million a year in grants. The deadline for proposals is Nov. 29. Dr. Fauci said he welcomes researchers who aren\u2019t flu experts to join the effort.\n\n\n\nAmong those researching a different tack is David Brenner, a professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia\u2019s Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons. Dr. Brenner wants to fight the spread of flu with a form of ultraviolet light that can destroy germs but is safe for humans.\n\n\u201cOur approach is let us try and kill the virus before they get to you,\u201d Dr. Brenner said. He sees his lamps as a supplement to a vaccine, not a substitute for one.\n\nDavid Brenner, at microscope, and Manuela Buonanno, right, and David Welch study human skin tissue to see if it is damaged by exposure to a type of ultraviolet light that kills the flu virus. Photo: Annie Tritt for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHospitals already zap equipment with ultraviolet light to sanitize it, but the lamps are off-limits to people, because of health hazards. Dr. Brenner\u2019s lamps emit \u201cfar UVC\u201d light\u2014a wavelength he said is safe for humans. These would be beamed \u201canywhere people congregate,\u201d he said, such as doctors\u2019 offices or airplanes.\n\nMost experts said a long-term and more effective universal vaccine should be the priority.\n\n\u201cI am a firm believer that the best solution is an appropriate vaccine,\u201d said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, noting that smallpox was eradicated by vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate dream is the universal [vaccine], but even one that works better\u201d than the seasonal flu shot would be welcome, Dr. Garcia-Sastre said.\n\nA universal vaccine is \u2018the ultimate dream,\u2019 said Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, right, at work with Guojun Wang. Photo: Monika Graff\n\nHe and his colleagues teamed up with other scientists, including some from the pharmaceuticals industry, and are seeking funding from Dr. Fauci\u2019s effort to research a vaccine they say works differently from the seasonal shot. The flu virus is covered in proteins shaped like mushrooms, said Florian Krammer, one of the Sinai researchers and a professor of microbiology. The seasonal vaccine targets the mushroom\u2019s \u201ccap\u201d to produce antibodies that fight back, Dr. Krammer said, but this cap changes, prompting the need to change the vaccine constantly.\n\nThe Sinai team\u2019s vaccine focuses on the \u201cstalk\u201d of the virus, which doesn\u2019t change, so a person would need, ideally, no more than two or three shots during his lifetime. A trial of the shot\u2019s safety and immune response is under way on about 65 patients.\n\nDr. Fauci\u2019s agency already is funding research into other universal vaccines, such as one by BiondVax Pharmaceuticals , an Israeli company. The vaccine, known as M-001, was designed to keep the \u201cvast majority of flu strains\u201d at bay, BiondVax said, and is being tested in the U.S.\n\nA universal vaccine is probably years off, experts warned, and likely to be reached through incremental stages.\n\nRobert Atmar at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, the principal investigator of the M-001 trial, said more studies are needed. A universal vaccine, he said, \u201cis a high bar to attain.\u201d\n\nPREVENTING A PANDEMIC\n\nAs flu season begins, researchers are working on ways to manage the virus, now and in the future.\n\nFOR NOW\n\nSeasonal flu shot: Still the best bet for avoiding the flu, it helps reduce dangers of hospitalization and death if you do get sick.\n\nXofluza: A new drug that recently received FDA approval. Like Tamiflu, it promises to shorten the misery of the flu by a day or more but requires only one dose.\n\nFOR LATER\n\nUVC lamps: A Columbia University researcher proposes using a special ultraviolet light to kill airborne flu germs.\n\nUniversal vaccine: The holy grail if achievable: a vaccine needed just once or twice in a lifetime that would protect against all strains of the flu."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Suzanne Vranica", "title": "Nielsen Holdings Names IBM's David Kenny as CEO", "description": "Nielsen Holdings appointed David Kenny as CEO, as the ratings and data giant reviews its strategic options amid activist pressure to either sell or spin off parts of its assets.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nielsen-holdings-to-name-ibms-david-kenny-as-ceo-1542715320", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37961/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:24:33Z", "content": "Nielsen Holdings NLSN -1.54% PLC appointed David Kenny as chief executive as the ratings and data giant continues to review its strategic options amid activist pressure to either sell or spin off parts of its assets.

The 57-year-old will join Nielsen on Dec. 3, succeeding veteran Mitch Barns, who has been at the helm since 2014 and said in July that he would retire at the end of the year.\n\nA longtime ad and technology executive, Mr. Kenny joins Nielsen at a critical juncture. The company began a full strategic review of its business in September, amid pressure to sell itself from activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which took an 8.4% stake in company earlier this year.\n\nThe New York-based research company, which has a market capitalization of $9.1 billion, has come under pressure over the past few years because of changes in consumers\u2019 media habits, which include the rise of video consumption on mobile devices.\n\nNielsen\u2019s business includes media and television ratings operations, which is dubbed its \u201cwatch\u201d segment, and its \u201cbuy\u201d division, which tracks purchases of groceries and other consumer products. The buy segment has been a weak spot, hampered by the changing retail environment and challenges that consumer-product companies face from new consumer tastes and shopping habits. Nielsen\u2019s stock has declined about 30% over the past year.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a more important time for measurement and analytics around media and to have a trusted intermediary,\u201d Mr. Kenny said in an interview. There is also a \u201cgreat need for advertisers to better understand where they are spending their money and what is working and what is not.\u201d\n\nNielsen Executive Chairman James Attwood said Mr. Kenny was chosen for his understanding of advertisers and his experience in artificial intelligence, big data and cloud technologies. Mr. Kenny has strong relationships with brands and media and technology companies, which he honed during his many years as a top executive at advertising giant Publicis Groupe SA .\n\nMr. Kenny also has connections to many private-equity companies, which may come in handy because such firms have expressed interest in Nielsen.\n\n\u201cRight now, I work for the public shareholders; if the best way to serve them is to go private, I don\u2019t have any issues with that,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cI am very comfortable in either world.\u201d\n\nNielsen was taken private in 2006 by several buyout firms and went public again in 2011.\n\nMr. Kenny said he would work to speed up the pace of the strategic review. \u201cI have done this before, and I know the players,\u201d he added.\n\nBefore IBM , Mr. Kenny was CEO of the Weather Co., a weather-forecasting and information-technology company.

TGT -2.76% , Kohl\u2019s Corp. KSS -3.73% and others that released their quarterly results. The selloff, part of a broader market decline, included retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. that didn\u2019t report on Tuesday.\n\nA tight labor market and increasing wages have buoyed consumer confidence, prompting Americans to purchase more fashion apparel, flat-screen televisions and homewares. But retail profits have been under pressure from online competition as well as higher spending on workers\u2019 wages, shipping costs and recent tariffs on Chinese-made imports.\n\nTarget said more shoppers visited its stores and website, and bought products across all its merchandising categories, particularly toys, beauty products and baby items. The company reported a 5.1% increase in comparable sales in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier, including a 49% increase in digital sales.\n\n\u201cWe continue to benefit from a very healthy consumer and macroeconomic backdrop,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a conference call Tuesday, adding that the company has captured sales from retailers that are closing stores or liquidating.\n\nHowever, profit margins declined in the latest quarter as Target spent more on its supply chain and wages. The company has made investments heading into the holidays, including several delivery and pickup options, new products and lower prices.\n\nRelated Video The retail industry is undergoing another major shift -- to e-commerce. How did we get here? Photo: Associated Press\n\nTarget shares, which had rallied for most of the year, tumbled 10.5% to $69.03.\n\nMr. Cornell said Target wouldn\u2019t provide 2019 financial guidance, but said he was optimistic about the company\u2019s ability to boost profits next year. \u201cWe\u2019re poised to benefit from far greater scale across all of our initiatives,\u201d he said.\n\nSome analysts said a decline in operating profit is necessary to support Target\u2019s growth. \u201cSome on Wall Street may lament the dip, but the truth is you cannot reinvent a retailer on the cheap,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\nBest Buy Co. BBY 0.74% , which has been reporting strong demand for electronics in recent quarters, said comparable sales increased 4.3% in the third quarter for its domestic stores and website. It was the sixth straight quarter of comparable growth above 4%.\n\nThe company\u2019s profit margin, however, slipped on supply chain and other spending. CEO Hubert Joly said the sales growth reflects the company\u2019s efforts to add services as well as the favorable economic environment. \u201cBecause of the investments we\u2019ve made, we are competitive in the marketplace,\u201d he said on a conference call.\n\nBest Buy cited strong demand in the quarter for smartphones, videogames, home appliances and wearable gadgets. The gains were partly offset by declines in tablet computers, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kohl\u2019s reported a 2.5% increase in comparable sales for the latest quarter, citing demand for apparel. The department-store chain\u2019s margins increased slightly from a year earlier, but sales growth was slower than recent quarters.\n\nKohl\u2019s CEO Michelle Gass told analysts on a conference call that she felt good about the health of consumers. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly no reason to believe that will change as we head into the holidays,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Target and Best Buy reported higher quarterly profits than a year ago, but much of the gains came from lower tax rates following the U.S. federal overhaul. Operating profits declined in the latest quarter from a year ago. Without a lower tax rate, Kohl\u2019s profits would have missed analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe results failed to reassure investors, who have been unloading shares of many retailers following the latest batch of earnings reports after driving up the stock prices earlier in the year.\n\nShares of Kohl\u2019s fell 9.2%, while Best Buy bucked the trend, gaining 2.1%. TJX Cos. fell 4.4% after the parent of TJMaxx and HomeGoods said earnings were hurt by a pension settlement charge.\n\nTJX, which reported strong sales and profit growth in the latest quarter, was also hurt by higher freight costs, a problem facing many retailers. Kohl\u2019s warned that higher shipping costs in the holiday quarter would be a drag on margins.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results follow strong sales reports from the country\u2019s biggest retailer Walmart, department-store chain Macy\u2019s Inc. and the internet giant Amazon.com, which are all competing for American wallets. Shares of Walmart fell 2.7% and Macy\u2019s fell 3.4% Tuesday, while Amazon shed 1.1%.\n\nNot all chains are riding the tide of rising consumer spending. Wedding gown retailer David\u2019s Bridal filed Monday for bankruptcy protection, cutting $400 million in debt while it restructures operations.\n\nMall-stalwart L Brands Inc., the parent of Victoria\u2019s Secret, said Monday it was halving its annual dividend after posting another quarter of falling sales at its flagship lingerie brand. Shares of L Brands dropped 17.7% Tuesday, the largest percentage drop since December 2008.\n\nComparable sales at the Gap brand fell 7% in the third quarter, compared with a 1% increase last year. That metric at its parent company, Gap Inc., was flat, helped by a 4% increase at Old Navy, its biggest division by sales. The company also lowered its profit guidance for the year.\n\nOn a conference call Tuesday, Gap Inc. CEO Art Peck said he might close hundreds of underperforming Gap stores. \u201cThese stores are a drag on the health and a drag on the performance of the brand,\u201d he said.\n\nSome retailers are benefiting from the struggles of others. Following the collapse of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and store closings at Sears Holdings Corp. , retailers including Best Buy and Target have pursued their business and picked up market share.\n\nSome chains are still struggling with strategic and operational challenges. Lowe\u2019s Co LOW -0.63% s. said Tuesday it plans to exit from its Mexico retail operations and shed two U.S. home-improvement businesses, after it reported slower same-store sales gains than rival Home Depot Inc. and a 27% decline in profit from a year ago.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nTJX Cos. lowered its fiscal year GAAP earnings to reflect a pension settlement charge. Excluding the charge and other expenses, the retailer said it raised its adjusted profit goals on a split-adjusted basis. An earlier version incorrectly said TJX slashed its profit goals amid higher inventory and expenses.

The fund isn\u2019t required under bankruptcy law and has no ties to the chapter 11 process itself.\n\nSoon after Toys \u201cR\u201d Us announced it was shuttering its U.S. business in March, employees banded together to fight for severance payments and initially took aim at the company\u2019s private-equity backers.\n\nKKR, Bain and real-estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust VNO -0.42% acquired Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in a 2005 leveraged buyout for $6.6 billion, which included $5.3 billion in debt.

The FTC\u2019s longstanding policy has been to only seek money after a second violation.\n\n\u201cYou have the president talking about Made in America and manufacturing on a regular basis,\u201d AAM President Scott Paul said. \u201cIt seemed like the right time to encourage the FTC to be more earnest about its enforcement.\u201d\n\nIn three major cases in September, the FTC ruled against three companies\u2014a maker of military-themed backpacks, a hockey puck manufacturer and an online mattress retailer\u2014that falsely represented products as made in America. All three companies were ordered to stop marketing these products as made in the U.S., but none was fined or forced to admit fault.\n\nThe agency has issued 135 warning letters and brought 10 lawsuits against companies for fraudulent Made in the USA labeling since 2010. Only one company has been fined for a second violation. Connecticut-based Stanley Works , now Stanley Black & Decker Inc., was fined $205,000 in 2006.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nFraudulently labeled products have been a longstanding irritant for U.S. manufacturers, who see a \u201cMade in America\u201d label as a competitive advantage and a source of pride.\n\nMany of the falsely labeled products are made in China, and American manufacturers now see a chance to leverage Mr. Trump\u2019s sympathies as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a bitter trade dispute. Similar strategies have successfully been employed recently by other industries to address long-held grievances about competition from China with the Trump administration.\n\nFTC commissioners are appointed by the president, but the agency operates independently, and Mr. Trump cannot direct the FTC to change policies.\n\nIn their September rulings about the three cases, FTC commissioners said they were reviewing whether to seek \u201cnew or infrequently applied remedies\u201d over fraudulent \u201cMade in America\u201d labels. It didn\u2019t explain exactly what those would be but said they could involve \u201cmonetary relief or notice to consumers.\u201d\n\nA tougher approach to first-time offenders could have a significant impact, said Michael Taylor, a partner at King & Spalding who represents U.S. manufacturers in a range of trade-related regulatory and customs issues.\n\n\u201cYou have some people who very clearly know what they\u2019re doing and don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re going to get whacked if they get caught the first time,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tactics is also gaining supporters on Capitol Hill. In October, Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, Tammy Baldwin, of Wisconsin, and Christopher Murphy, of Connecticut, sent a letter to the FTC chairman calling for an end to \u201cno-fault, no-money\u201d settlements.\n\nUnder FTC policy, products must be made with nearly all American-made parts to be labeled \u201cMade in the USA\u201d or \u201cMade in America,\u201d or to use American flags on their packaging, but the commission\u2019s enforcement options are limited.\n\nThe FTC can pursue refunds for customers for first-time offenses, but it is prevented by law from seeking outright fines for a first violation, said James Kohm, director of the agency\u2019s enforcement division in the Bureau of Consumer Protection.\n\nMr. Kohm said the agency usually avoids the refund process because it can require intense effort for relatively small payments: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult, and it would take a lot of resources.\u201d When the FTC sought refunds to consumers for a superglue-like product in 2016, it resulted in $220,000 in payments.\n\nCompanies that pay the extra expense to make their products in the U.S. say the label gives them an advantage with consumers.\n\n\u201cWe hear from our retailers. Some of them say \u2018We\u2019re getting more requests for things that are made in America. We get people who come in and say it\u2019s a tie breaker,\u2019 \u201d said Wyatt Bassett, chief executive of Vaughan-Bassett Furniture, which makes all of its furniture out of American lumber in a factory in Virginia.\n\nA 2015 survey by Consumer Reports found that 80% of Americans say they would rather buy American-made products, and more than 60% say they would be willing to pay 10% more for U.S.-made items.\n\nWhether consumers\u2019 enthusiasm for U.S.-made products translates into a significant sales advantage for U.S. companies is a point of debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any evidence that this has a big effect on what people purchase,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University professor who studies international economics and China\u2019s development. Consumers seem to want lower prices more than American-made products, she said.\n\n\u201cWith household incomes in general not rising very quickly over the past 15 to 20 years, consumers have tried to make their budgets go further,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the continued production of fraudulently labeled products suggests there are manufacturers who believe it still helps.\n\nMs. Lovely noted that the rules around Made in America labeling can be confusing, and companies can violate them without realizing it.\n\n\u201cThere are rules, and companies\u2014even if they\u2019re trying to abide by them\u2014may find them complicated, so issuing a cease and desist, it might not be unreasonable,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the September ruling, FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra argued in a dissenting opinion that the three companies should have been forced to pay.\n\n\u201cIn cases involving egregious and undisputed Made-in-USA fraud, I believe there should be a strong presumption against simple cease-and-desist orders,\u201d Mr. Chopra wrote. He said the commission should require more painful remedies such as a payments equal to their ill-gotten gains, consumer refunds or admissions of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cEvery firm needs to understand that products labeled \u2018Made in USA\u2019 should be made in the USA, and that fake branding will come with real consequences,\u201d Mr. Chopra wrote.\n\nThe prevailing commissioners explained their decision by saying that the relatively small number of second violations shows that the current system has served as a deterrent.\n\nWrite to Heidi Vogt at heidi.vogt@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Josh Barbanel", "title": "Amazon Employees Join Long Island City Condo Rush", "description": "Condo sales in Long Island City are suddenly soaring, thanks to Amazon\u2019s decision to open a headquarters in the Queens, N.Y., neighborhood.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-employees-join-the-rush-to-buy-long-island-city-condos-1542709801", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37927/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:44:30Z", "content": "Condo sales in Long Island City are suddenly soaring, thanks to Amazon.com Inc.s decision to open a headquarters in the Queens, N.Y., neighborhood.

The company said it is determined to fix those issues.\n\nLowe\u2019s said its profit fell 27% to $629 million, or 78 cents a share. The results included $280 million in pretax charges from closing all of the company\u2019s Orchard Supply Hardware stores, closing some underperforming stores in the U.S. and Canada, impairments on the Mexico business, and an inventory write-down related to exiting its Alacrity and Iris businesses.\n\nExcluding certain items, Lowe\u2019s posted a profit of $1.04 a share.

Photo: Associated Press\n\nMany states are experiencing rapid labor-force gains as the economic expansion hums along. In Wyoming and West Virginia, the situation couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\nSince the recession ended in June 2009, Wyoming\u2019s labor force has contracted by 5.1%, the biggest drop of any state in the nation during this period. West Virginia is next, with a decline of 4.5%, according to Labor Department data. Other states have shed workers, too, including Vermont, Kansas and Ohio.\n\nBy contrast, the nation as a whole has clocked labor-force growth of 5.1% since mid-2009.\n\nWhile natural beauty and other factors such as a low cost of living and business-friendly government are drawing workers into states like Utah and Idaho\u2014which also have resource sectors\u2014Wyoming and West Virginia are suffering setbacks. The underlying reasons for these two states' labor-market declines tie back to their hefty reliance on coal, as well as more structural factors such as below-average attainment of higher education.\n\nThe coal industry has been steadily losing jobs over the past several years as power plants turned to cleaner alternatives like natural gas, a boon to Texas\u2019s labor force, which is the second fastest-growing in this economic expansion.\n\nIn Wyoming and West Virginia, dependence on coal means that during an energy bust, many discouraged workers leave. But unlike states with more diverse economies, these two don\u2019t have enough other sources of employment to hold steady or grow to compensate for the decline in mining and related industries.\n\n\u201cWhen you have that dependence on just a few commodity industries and you don\u2019t have a high-skilled workforce, that makes it difficult for the state to attract high-wage businesses, high-wage jobs,\u201d said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics who specializes in Wyoming economics. \u201cIf people can\u2019t find good job opportunities at home, they will move elsewhere.\u201d\n\nBoth Wyoming and West Virginia have seen population losses driven by outward migration. Wyoming's population dropped by nearly 6,000 from 2016 to 2017, while West Virginia\u2019s population declined by almost 13,000, a drag on labor-force growth.\n\nCoal is closely linked to many jobs in Wyoming and West Virginia, which means employment across the states\u2019 economies are feeling the hit.\n\nIn West Virginia, manufacturing jobs have suffered: The state's payrolls in this sector are around 47,000, down from 57,000 a decade earlier. In Wyoming, the state and local government sector, reliant on the coal industry for tax revenues, has seen jobs decline sharply in recent years.\n\nWhile the labor-force decline in both Wyoming and West Virginia has moderated over the past year, possibly tied to a pickup in energy prices, a full recovery remains a challenge.\n\nFor one, in the wake of the 2015 energy downturn, many coal companies in Wyoming replaced people with machinery, according to Ms. Cosma.\n\nFurthermore, below-average higher-education attainment in Wyoming and West Virginia means the states struggle to retain highly skilled workers and draw in new ones. West Virginia's labor force also suffers due to a lack of high-wage jobs and high opioid use.\n\nAdding to the challenge of growing these regional labor forces is an aging population.\n\n\u201cIf you have someone within 10 years of retirement age who say loses their job as a coal miner, they don\u2019t really have the incentive to get back into the labor force if they\u2019ve saved up enough for retirement,\u201d Ms. Cosma said.\n\nRELATED\n\nWhy West Virginia Metros Are the Nation\u2019s Most Troubled Labor Markets (Aug. 31, 2018)\n\nThese Eight States Still Haven\u2019t Regained All Their Lost Jobs (July 21, 2017)\n\nThe Only State to Lose Jobs Since July Last Year: West Virginia (Aug. 21, 2015)"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Kristina Peterson", "title": "McConnell Controls Fate of Criminal-Justice Overhaul Bill", "description": "With just two more weeks scheduled in the lame-duck Senate\u2019s session, the Republican majority leader will not commit to holding a vote on the measure backed by bipartisan sponsors and President Trump.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcconnell-controls-fate-of-criminal-justice-overhaul-bill-1542709801", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37971/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:30:26Z", "content": "WASHINGTONSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has emerged as the final hurdle facing an overhaul of the criminal-justice system that last week picked up bipartisan support, including from President Trump.

Jeff Sparshott here to take you through the day's top economic news. We'll also look at fake \"Made in the U.S.A.\" labels, why states shouldn't depend on coal's comeback, Brexit, and how Apple and cable TV are coping with weaker-than-expected demand. Share your thoughts by responding to this email.\n\nWHAT'S WRONG WITH THE HOUSING MARKET?\n\nThe housing industry has been a drag on the overall economy in five of the last six quarters. That doesn't seem likely to change much. Builder sentiment fell sharply this month amid worries about affordability. Prices have been climbing faster than incomes for years, in part because there aren't enough homes on the market to meet demand. Now with a new tax law that that reduces incentives for homeownership and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, ownership is even more of a stretch.\n\nWorst-case scenario: The housing market helps drive furniture sales, building-materials purchases and construction employment. If it falters further, it could become an even bigger drag on the economy. But this isn't 2005 or 2006, when housing accounted for as much as 6.7% of gross domestic product, households were severely overstretched with mortgage debt and the market flamed out. Housing is less than 4% of GDP now, mortgage-debt-to-income is well below its 2007 peak and the rest of the economy appears solid. Strong job creation, rising incomes and steady household formation should keep housing from anything like a free fall.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\n\nU.S. housing starts for October, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to rise to an annual pace of 1.23 million from 1.201 million a month earlier. Permits are expected to rise to 1.27 million from 1.241 million.\n\nKeep an eye on markets, where volatility is the new normal. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed near a seven-month low and tech-giant Alphabet slipped into bear-market territory Monday. On Tuesday, stocks around the world followed the U.S. selloff.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nBORN IN THE U.S.A.\n\nManufacturers of U.S.-made products, hoping to capitalize on President Trump\u2019s aggressive stance on China, are calling for tougher action against companies that make bogus \u201cMade in the USA\u201d claims. The Alliance for American Manufacturing wants the Federal Trade Commission to get companies to pay restitution, or at least admit fault, the first time they falsely label products as American-made. The FTC\u2019s longstanding policy has been to only seek money after a second violation, Heidi Vogt reports.\n\nFraudulently labeled products have been a longstanding irritant for U.S. manufacturers, who see a \u201cMade in America\u201d label as a competitive advantage and a source of pride. Many of the falsely labeled products are made in China, and American manufacturers now see a chance to leverage Mr. Trump\u2019s sympathies as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a bitter trade dispute.\n\nTHE COAL INDUSTRY ISN'T BACK\n\nMany states are experiencing rapid labor-force gains as the economic expansion hums along. In Wyoming and West Virginia, the situation couldn\u2019t be more different. Since the recession ended in June 2009, Wyoming\u2019s labor force has contracted by 5.1%, the biggest drop of any state in the nation. West Virginia is next at 4.5%, Sarah Chaney reports. One big reason: A hefty reliance on coal.\n\n\u201cWhen you have that dependence on just a few commodity industries and you don\u2019t have a high-skilled workforce, that makes it difficult for the state to attract high-wage businesses, high-wage jobs,\u201d said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics who specializes in Wyoming economics. \u201cIf people can\u2019t find good job opportunities at home, they will move elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSUCCESS IS NOT FINAL, FAILURE IS NOT FATAL\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has a deal to extract the U.K. from the European Union. Will the British Parliament go for it?\n\nMrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party doesn\u2019t command a majority in the House of Commons and many of her own lawmakers virulently oppose her plans to leave the EU. So Brexit comes down to votes from members of Parliament who don\u2019t support her and never wanted to leave the EU. If lawmakers revolt, Parliament could order Mrs. May to go back and negotiate tweaks for the deal\u2014or even vote for a second Brexit referendum, Max Colchester reports.\n\nSUPPLY OUTSTRIPS DEMAND: IPHONES\n\nLower-than-expected demand for Apple Inc.\u2019s new iPhones and the company\u2019s decision to offer more models have created turmoil along its supply chain and made it harder for Apple to predict the number of components and phones it needs. Apple slashed production orders for all three of the iPhone models it unveiled in September in recent weeks.\n\nForecasts have been especially problematic for the iPhone XR, Apple\u2019s new lower-price model. Around late October, Apple slashed its production plan by up to a third of the approximately 70 million units it had asked some suppliers to assemble between September and February, Yoko Kubota, Takashi Mochizuki and Tripp Mickle report.\n\nSUPPLY OUTSTRIPS DEMAND: CABLE TV\n\nMore than 1 million consumers canceled their cable-TV or satellite subscriptions in the past quarter, one of the largest seasonal drops ever. The pay-TV decline comes as many U.S. households are turning to the internet for entertainment and canceling their traditional subscriptions, a phenomenon called cord-cutting. A growing share of Americans, known as cord-nevers, are forgoing pay-TV altogether, Drew FitzGerald and Benjamin Mullin report.\n\nUnlike Apple, cable providers seem unlikely to voluntarily dial back supply. So if demand is dropping like a stone, will price follow?\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\u201cGold! Gold!

NSANY -0.88% after the arrest of Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn in Japan.\n\nAfter a meeting late Tuesday, Renault\u2019s board said it had appointed Thierry Bollor\u00e9, the company\u2019s No. 2 executive, to serve as deputy CEO on a temporary basis. Philippe Lagayette, Renault\u2019s lead independent director, was named as interim chairman, the company said.\n\nRenault is moving to fill a power vacuum that Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest created atop the French company and its alliance with Nissan. Japanese prosecutors detained Mr. Ghosn, an auto-industry titan and one of the world\u2019s best-known business executives, after Nissan went to Japanese authorities with details of an internal probe that alleged he incorrectly reported his compensation in filings over many years. The Japanese auto maker said it would seek to oust Mr. Ghosn from his position.\n\nDescribing Mr. Ghosn as \u201ctemporarily incapacitated,\u201d Renault\u2019s board said the 64-year-old executive would formally retain his posts as chairman and CEO of the car maker. However, the board said it was delegating all of his powers to Messrs. Bollor\u00e9 and Lagayette.\n\nBy deputizing Mr. Bollor\u00e9, Renault\u2019s board empowered him to wield Mr. Ghosn\u2019s voting rights on the board of Renault-Nissan BV, the Dutch joint venture that manages the auto makers\u2019 alliance, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThat move is crucial, the people said, because it preserves the balance of power that Renault and Nissan share in the joint venture. Renault-Nissan BV is jointly funded by Renault and Nissan, with Mr. Ghosn as its CEO and a board made up of executives from both companies, according to Dutch corporate filings.\n\nThe Dutch firm has become a focal point of Nissan\u2019s scrutiny. Nissan informed Renault on Monday that it has evidence of potential wrongdoing at Renault-Nissan BV, according to the people familiar with the matter.\n\nOn Tuesday, Renault\u2019s board said it was requesting that Nissan \u201cprovide all information in their possession arising from the internal investigations related to Mr. Ghosn.\u201d\n\nRenault-Nissan BV manages long-term strategy for the partnership and owns subsidiaries responsible for tasks including joint purchasing and information-technology services. Its expenses, which totaled more than \u20ac150 million ($170 million) in 2016, include management fees for executives, services provided to alliance partners and payments to outside consultants, according to the Dutch filings.\n\nThe appointment of Messrs. Bollor\u00e9 and Lagayette came after a request of the French government, which is concerned Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest risks weakening the alliance.\n\n\u201cI spoke today on the phone with the Japanese economy minister and we will do everything we can to entrench the alliance,\u201d Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nNissan\u2019s growth in recent years has made it the larger of the two companies, selling more cars than its French partner and contributing heavily to Renault\u2019s profit. That has given rise to fears among French unions and government officials that a creeping \u201cNissanization\u201d is under way.\n\nAs Renault and Nissan have moved toward a unified production system\u2014allowing models from either company to be built at any alliance factory in the world\u2014workers in France have worried that jobs could be easily moved out of the country, where labor costs have historically tended to run high.\n\nThe alliance, which in 2016 added Mitsubishi Motors Corp. as a partner, says it generates savings through joint purchasing of parts and equipment, as well as common engineering of the basics of vehicle design. Its shared functions include human resources.\n\nThe alliance said that in 2017 it generated \u20ac5.7 billion in savings for its members, up from \u20ac5 billion a year earlier.\n\nAuto executive Carlos Ghosn was the architect of an alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, a rare success story of auto makers working together.

In addition to a Disney-branded service set to launch late next year, Disney has created an ESPN-branded service and will become a majority owner of Hulu when the Fox deal closes.\n\nFox\u2019s library of programming, from National Geographic to its FX cable network, will help fill out those services and reduce the number of major Hollywood studios to five, from six.\n\nThe antitrust authority of the European Union approved the deal this month. Some international jurisdictions have yet to weigh in.\n\nAs part of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s approval of the deal, Disney will need to divest Fox\u2019s regional sports networks. It also lost Fox\u2019s stake in the Sky PLC pay-TV company to rival Comcast Corp. The divestiture and Sky sale are expected to reduce the overall cost of the deal by more than $20 billion.\n\nChina is an important market for Disney.

Make no mistake, the weekend\u2019s widespread marches against Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plan to raise fuel taxes are the most serious political threat since the French president took office in 2017.\n\nMore than 250,000 people are estimated to have turned out against higher fuel costs driven by global oil-price developments and Mr. Macron\u2019s tax increase. Irate motorists blocked roads and highways across the country, and some marches turned violent or nearly so. One elderly woman was killed by a panicked motorist who allegedly accelerated when her car was surrounded. The protesters are calling themselves the Yellow Vests, after the safety apparel they wear.\n\nEvery French president faces protests in the streets over something, and Mr. Macron has stared down a rail strike and marches against his labor reforms. But this unrest is more widespread geographically with more diverse protestors, who are emerging in large numbers from the rural and exurban middle class.\n\nThe protests also are about more than the details of the fuel tax\u2014a bad idea Mr. Macron is pursuing apparently to bolster his green credentials. The president\u2019s popularity has plummeted since the summer amid a string of personnel scandals and political gaffes that emphasized his aloof persona and distracted him from economic reform.\n\nMany of the Yellow Vests probably didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Macron last year, and the fuel-tax plan plays into their worst perceptions of him. A recurring theme in interviews of Yellow Vests is that the city-slicker Mr. Macron and his wealthy pals in Paris don\u2019t understand how important cars are to ordinary folks in areas that lack public transport.\n\nThe worry for the president is that large numbers of voters, including some of his supporters from 2017, may agree that Mr. Macron is losing touch. Polls show broader public sympathy by far for the Yellow Vests\u2014nearly 75% support\u2014than there was for striking railway workers.\n\nThat makes the fuel tax a needless waste of Mr. Macron\u2019s diminishing political capital. Unlike labor reforms or rail overhauls, the fuel tax has nothing to do with Mr. Macron\u2019s economic-growth agenda. It\u2019s not even about boosting revenue. It\u2019s simply about discouraging the French from driving too much for environmental reasons.\n\nExpensive green piety is not why voters embraced Mr. Macron last year, and now the bubbling frustration endangers the economic change the French voted for. Important reforms, including to the pension system, may now need to wait until next summer while Mr. Macron regroups, if new reforms happen at all after these political and policy missteps.\n\nMr. Macron shows no signs of backing down on the fuel tax, and maybe he can brazen out the protests. But with European Parliament elections looming next May, he can\u2019t afford many more policy fumbles. The Yellow Vests are a warning to return to what voters elected him to do\u2014create jobs and make the French economy great again."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "The Editorial Board", "title": "Sticking it to Pharma---With Competition", "description": "A record pace of generic drug approvals is reducing prices.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sticking-it-to-pharmawith-competition-1542674076", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37966/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:34:38Z", "content": "Did you hear that the Trump Administration has saved Americans $26 billion on prescription drugs?

Democrats hope to benefit politically by undermining faith in American democracy.\n\nAt the last tally on Sunday, Mr. Kemp led Democrat Stacey Abrams by about 55,000 votes or 1.4 percentage points. She finally acknowledged Mr. Kemp\u2019s victory on Friday, though her non-concession concession makes Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sound like gracious losers.\n\n\u201cThis is not a speech of concession, because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper,\u201d she said. As secretary of state for eight years, Mr. Kemp presided over \u201csystemic disenfranchisement, disinvestment and incompetence,\u201d she declared.\n\nLeading her long list of grievances worthy of Festivus on \u201cSeinfeld\u201d, she has accused Mr. Kemp of \u201cpurging\u201d some 53,000 voters\u2014most of whom were minorities\u2014from the rolls. Georgia\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d law enacted by the GOP Legislature last year requires information on voter registration applications to mirror the information on file at the Georgia Department of Driver Services and federal Social Security Administration. The law was intended to prevent groups from sloppily filling out applications for individuals, as Ms. Abrams\u2019s New Georgia Project appears to have done.\n\nYet voters whose applications are flagged have 26 months to clear up discrepancies. They may also vote if they present a valid photo ID, as is required of all voters under Georgia law. Voters whose IDs don\u2019t match the names on registration forms may still cast provisional ballots. In other words, nothing stopped legitimately registered voters from casting ballots\u2014except perhaps the Democratic warnings that they may be deemed ineligible.\n\nDemocrats also howl that Mr. Kemp has cancelled some 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012. Mr. Kemp\u2019s alleged offense: Complying with federal and state law. Under Georgia law, registered voters who haven\u2019t voted in three years are sent notices to confirm their residency. If they don\u2019t respond or vote in the following two general elections, they are removed from the rolls.\n\nGeorgia is merely implementing the federal 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which requires states to \u201cconduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names\u201d of voters who are ineligible \u201cby reason of\u201d death or change in residence. In 2002 Congress added that \u201cregistrants who have not responded to a notice\u201d and \u201chave not voted in two consecutive general elections for Federal office shall be removed.\u201d Georgia\u2019s registration procedures are similar to those in Ohio, which the Supreme Court upheld in June.\n\nIf Mr. Kemp was trying to suppress voters, he did a lousy job. Georgia\u2019s voter rolls have swelled by more than 20% since 2010 amid an expansion in online registration. Voter turnout this year was up 16.4 percentage points over 2014 levels, which is even greater than the 12.6-point increase nationwide. Early voting also doubled since 2014.\n\nBy all evidence Ms. Abrams benefitted tremendously from this surge in turnout. She received 90% more votes in Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County (45% black) than the Democratic candidate in 2014 and 62% more in neighboring DeKalb County (55% black).

The third and most decisive is now beginning to take shape.\n\nThrough most of his first year in office, Mr. Trump moved cautiously on the international stage and tended to defer to mainstream advisers. Starting last spring with the departures of H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump has been taking more radical steps, ramping up tariff wars around the world while jettisoning the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Iran nuclear deal, the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Universal Postal Union.\n\nFor Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, this second stage has been catastrophic. American power, they argue, depends on the institutions Mr. Trump is weakening and the allies he is alienating; the president is sawing off the branch on which he sits. His defenders say he is placing American power on a sounder footing, clearing away the deadwood of the past, forcing others to pay their fair share and ensuring the U.S. benefits more from international trade.\n\nThe case against Mr. Trump\u2019s international disruption isn\u2019t as strong as most in the foreign-policy establishment believe. There are certainly dangers in the president\u2019s impulsive approach\u2014some of them grave\u2014but Mr. Trump has one big point in his favor. The liberal-internationalist vision, which holds that the world is a kind of greater European Union, moving inexorably toward its own kind of \u201cever closer union\u201d via a strengthening network of international institutions, seems to be running out of steam.\n\nAs countries like Turkey, India, China, Brazil and Nigeria develop, they are striving more to strengthen their sovereignty than to pool it. By shifting America\u2019s stance away from the losing defense of legacy liberal internationalism that characterized the John Kerry years, the Trump disruption might, might point the way toward a more sustainable U.S. diplomatic approach.\n\nBut for Mr. Trump to be remembered as something other than a diplomatic wrecking ball, his administration will have to rapidly shift gears. Destruction ceases to be creative when it doesn\u2019t lead to the construction of something better. After the cautious first stage and the dramatic second stage, a third stage of strategy and leadership must follow.\n\nIn the Middle East, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen seem to be forcing the administration to review its strategic options. Simply outsourcing U.S. regional policy to Riyadh and Jerusalem won\u2019t do. Washington needs a vision and a policy that both reassures our local allies and disciplines some of their wilder instincts. Walking away from the Iran deal was easy; implementing a new regional strategy will be hard. Like his predecessors, Mr. Trump will be judged not by his intentions but by his results.\n\nThe administration\u2019s China policy has also reached an inflection point. The tariff card has been played. But what is the administration\u2019s vision for the future of an economic relationship that, despite Chinese abuses, has benefited both countries and cannot be ripped apart without profound damage to many U.S. companies and industries? How will the administration balance its interest in building a strong global alliance to counter China and its efforts to extract more favorable trading terms from partners like Germany and Japan? Can the Trump administration develop an approach to China that is bipartisan enough to ensure Democrats don\u2019t scrap it all when they return to power?\n\nUnlike the Soviet Union, China has engaged successfully with the international market system and as a result has many more channels of influence around the world. How will the administration orchestrate a global response? This is a harder task than the Truman administration faced; is the Trump administration up to the job?\n\nIn Europe, President Trump has been blunt about the many shortcomings he sees in existing U.S. relationships with key allies. He hasn\u2019t, however, put forward a compelling vision of the kind of trans-Atlantic relationship he would like to see instead.\n\nIt is the same on trade. We know Mr. Trump prefers bilateral deals to multilateral ones and that he sees reciprocity as the key to fairness. But what would a reformed World Trade Organization look like? How does Mr. Trump want trade disputes to be handled? Can Mr. Trump subject the international economy to an endless series of trade shocks without undermining the domestic prosperity on which his future and that of his party depend?\n\nDonald Trump spent much of his pre-political career as a builder and a developer. President Trump has mostly been in the demolition industry where foreign policy is concerned. That will likely change in the next few months as the unrelenting pressure of world events forces the administration to define and communicate its objectives more clearly. As stage two gives way to stage three, it will become easier to see where this administration wants to take the world\u2014and whether it is having any success."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Joseph Epstein", "title": "Americans Turned to Trump to Roll Back the Progressive Tide", "description": "To understand his appeal, look at the excesses of liberals in recent years.

I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nNot a bad question, really. As I thought it over, it occurred to me that what genuinely excites Mr. Trump\u2019s crowds and draws them to him is their shared antiliberalism. By liberalism I do not mean liberalism of the kind that was at the center of our fathers\u2019 Democratic Party\u2014which supported labor unions, civil liberties, racial integration, involvement in international affairs. I refer to the liberalism now metamorphisized into progressivism, at the heart of the thinking of such Democrats as Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others.\n\nThis is the progressivism that edges into socialism, that is said to attract the young, that promises a newer, kinder America\u2014the progressivism that exalts identity politics and has no argument with political correctness. As one looks upon the people who attend Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, one sees the faces not of Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d but of the proletariat out of which Karl Marx\u2019s dictatorship was supposed to derive. Yet these people, despite the progressives\u2019 promises to them of free Medicare, free college tuition, and the rest, want nothing to do with Sens. Warren, Sanders, Booker & Co. Quite the reverse: They loathe them.\n\nThe man who attends a Trump rally turns on his television set and that night\u2019s news leads off with a Black Lives Matter protest in his city. If that city is Chicago, he might recall that this year some 2,619 people have been shot, 475 shot and killed, the preponderance of these being black people shot by black youth gangs. If it is another city, there is a distinct possibility, as fairly often in the past, that the protest will lead to looting of nearby shops. Al Sharpton, nattily turned out, is likely to have flown in for the festivities to remind everyone about the world\u2019s injustice.\n\nOur man changes channels and is greeted by a story of a long and happy lesbian marriage. He reads in the papers that people are fired from jobs for remarks that, under the reign of political correctness, are interpreted as racist, sexist, you name it; that students feel unsafe at Yale; that a year\u2019s tuition, room and board at Dartmouth is $74,000. Doubtless before long he will read a story about an 11-year-old who is suing his parents for not allowing him to transgender himself.\n\nOh God, he thinks, make America great again, make America straight again, make America anything but what it is becoming. What elected Donald Trump, and what sustains him, is not his rather dubious charisma, his ideas, his obvious jolt to the country\u2019s earlier slow economic growth, and no, not even the wretched campaign run by Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump was chosen as a rebuke to the progressivism that has made life in America seem chaotic, if not a touch mad, and that now threatens to take over the Democratic Party.\n\nA number of highly intelligent Trump supporters I know are perfectly willing to acknowledge the president\u2019s manifold flaws. They voted for him, and probably will again, because he is not Hillary or Barack Obama or Chuck Schumer. In the old Indian proverb, the enemy of their enemy is their friend; more than friend, he, Donald J. Trump, is happily their president.\n\nAfter the midterm elections, Nancy Pelosi announced that she is exultant that more than 60% of the Democratic members of Congress are women, or ethic minorities, or LGBT. Some Democrats threaten to investigate President Trump\u2019s personal finances. Others hold out the promise of impeaching Mr. Trump, Brett Kavanaugh or Matthew Whitaker. So the beat of identity politics, and progressivism generally, goes on.\n\nThe pull to the left of the Democratic Party is Donald Trump\u2019s greatest hope for re-election, while Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior is the greatest force pulling Democrats still further to the left. Tariffs, trade agreements, even immigration policy seem slightly beside the point when, as now, not two different parties but two radically different views of the good life dominate public discourse. And so things go, two ends without a middle. The shame is that most Americans find themselves in that missing middle, helpless without a party, hopeless without a leader. Politics has rarely seemed so dismal.\n\nMr. Epstein is author of \u201cThe Ideal of Culture and Other Essays\u201d (Axios Press) and \u201cCharm: The Elusive Enchantment\u201d (Lyons Press)."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Robert C.

The first would make it easier for small employers to band together to offer employees access to a common plan. The second would update the mortality tables to reflect longer life-spans, which would slow down the rate of distributions from most retirement plans.\n\nIn October the Labor Department responded by proposing a limited expansion of 401(k) plans for multiple employers\u2014limited because the agency doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to make major changes. Nor is the Treasury legally empowered to make the needed broader changes on plan distributions. Fortunately, both reforms are included in a bill, the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, or RESA, which is moving steadily through Congress with broad bipartisan support.\n\nAlmost 60 million private-sector workers don\u2019t have access to any retirement plan at work, according to the Social Security Bulletin. Approximately 75% of those workers are employed by firms with fewer than 100 employees, which do not want to take on the financial and administrative burdens of running a retirement plan. Yet under current rules, unrelated employers are generally not allowed to band together to save money on the plans they offer.\n\nRESA would change that by expressly allowing unrelated employers to sponsor multiple-employer plans. It would also permit qualified financial firms, with fiduciary obligations, to offer a standard plan to groups of small employers.\n\nThe new law also ought to further reduce the retirement-coverage gap by addressing the needs of part-time and seasonal employees. Currently, employers with retirement plans aren\u2019t required to include part-time and seasonal workers, unless they work at least 1,000 hours per year. For this reason, more than four million workers are excluded from their employers\u2019 retirement plans.\n\nRESA could be improved\u2014for instance by requiring employers with plans to help part-time or seasonal workers save for retirement through automatic payroll deductions. This would cost such employers almost nothing, since most already have the ability to send employee contributions to their retirement investment funds electronically.\n\nTo encourage small employers to adopt multiple-employer plans or other retirement plans, RESA would cover their startup expenses. The tax credit for these startup expenses is currently capped at a miserly $500 per year for the first three years. Under RESA, that maximum would increase to $5,000 per year for three years, depending on the number of employees eligible for the plan.\n\nTo offset the budget costs of expanded MEPs, RESA would tighten the tax rules for required minimum distributions. Under current law, when plan participants reach age 70\u00bd, they must begin to take annual distributions from their IRAs or other retirement plans at a rate appropriate to their remaining life expectancy as calculated by the Internal Revenue Service. These distributions are taxed as ordinary income to participants (except for Roth IRAs).\n\nIf plan participants die before their plan assets are fully distributed, they can pass them on to named beneficiaries. But beneficiaries can then stretch out the distributions according to their own remaining life expectancy\u2014which, depending on their age, could be another 30 to 50 years. That loophole, which is hard to justify on policy grounds, markedly delays the flow of taxable income from retirement plans.\n\nRESA would partially close the loophole by requiring most beneficiaries to distribute the remaining assets within five years of the plan participant\u2019s death. The bill includes major exceptions for spouses, minor children and disabled beneficiaries, but it\u2019s revenue neutral: the expansion of multiple-employer plans reduces federal tax revenues by $3 billion over the next decade, which is roughly equivalent to the revenue gained from partially closing the required-minimum distribution loophole.\n\nRESA is one of the few bills on Capitol Hill with broad bipartisan support. For an easy legislative victory, the administration should push Congress to adopt it by the end of the year.\n\nMr. Pozen is a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan and former president of Fidelity Investments."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Khadeeja Safdar", "title": "L Brands Slashes Dividend, Picks Chief for Victoria's Secret Lingerie", "description": "L Brands said it had hired a Tory Burch executive to take over its Victoria\u2019s Secret lingerie business after the chain posted another quarter of declining same-store sales.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/l-brands-names-john-mehas-as-ceo-of-victorias-secret-lingerie-1542663981", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37906/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:15:18Z", "content": "L Brands Inc., LB -2.07% trying to revamp business at its flagship Victorias Secret chain, on Monday said it is halving its annual dividend and hiring a Tory Burch executive to lead the lingerie division.

After tamping down the yuan\u2019s appreciation for the better part of two decades, Beijing has begun to lend support to the sagging currency. Last month China used roughly $32 billion of its foreign-exchange reserves to bolster its currency. The yuan is dropping largely because China\u2019s growth is slowing and capital has begun to flee the country.\n\nFor most of its recent history, China had little reason to worry about capital outflows of foreign money. From 1994 to 2014 the Chinese enjoyed a surplus in their overall balance of payments, which consists of the current-account balance plus private capital flows. This surplus generated foreign-exchange earnings. The People\u2019s Bank of China, Beijing\u2019s central bank, purchased incoming foreign currency at the going rate and amassed a mountain of foreign-exchange reserves. These peaked at just over $4 trillion in June 2014.\n\nWhile a growing pile of reserves might seem like a gift, it presented the Chinese authorities with a series of challenges. As the foreign currency rolled in, the PBOC purchased it from commercial banks by crediting them in yuan. This drove down interest rates in the interbank market, which in turn increased domestic lending and the money supply. To control these increases, the PBOC began issuing bonds to the banks in 2002, absorbing excess yuan. Known as sterilization, operations of this kind were pioneered in Japan in the 1960s and have been common across East Asia since the 1980s.\n\nYet the PBOC\u2019s bond issues came at a cost. With the increased bond issuance associated with sterilization, the central bank had to pay ever-higher yields to entice banks to buy bonds. To stem the growing cost, the PBOC slowed down its sterilization operations. Instead, it aimed to control the money supply by raising the reserve-requirement ratio (RRR) on bank deposits, which mandates that banks place a certain percentage of their cash in a central-bank reserve. By June 2011 the RRR had reached 21.5%, freezing more than a fifth of Chinese bank deposits that otherwise would have been lent out to private borrowers.\n\nIn parallel with the sterilization of capital inflows, the PBOC began in 2005 to allow appreciation in the yuan-dollar exchange rate. The yuan rose 35% against the U.S. dollar from 2005-15. Over the same period, China\u2019s thriving economy meant wages also increased by 14.6% a year. The combination of the stronger yuan and the wage surge meant Chinese wages in U.S.-dollar terms effectively quadrupled, boosting the local standard of living but hurting China\u2019s international competitiveness.\n\nFast forward to August 2015. That\u2019s when the yuan experienced a nasty wobble, declining 4% in two days as capital flows reversed. Since then, regulators have imposed new exchange controls and other restrictions on certain types of capital outflows. Yet the trend of net outflows from China has continued sporadically.\n\nSo the PBOC\u2019s challenge today is the opposite of what it faced in the previous two decades. The central bank must ensure adequate growth in the money supply while capital flows out and the current-account surplus rapidly dries up. More broadly, China must reverse the sterilization process without destabilizing the economy.\n\nThe PBOC\u2019s strategy so far has been to increase domestic credit, compensating for shrinking foreign-exchange reserves. By today, those reserves have decreased by the equivalent of about $1 trillion, which the PBOC has counterbalanced with about $1.2 trillion of domestic credit.\n\nThe major difference from the surplus era of the early 2000s is that China\u2019s annual growth rate has dropped from roughly 10% to 6%. To meet its inflation target of 2%, the central bank has reduced the rate of growth in the money supply from 15% a year in 2013 to just 8% today.\n\nWages have leveled off as China\u2019s economy cools and inflation has stayed low. But the question remains whether things are stabilizing, as President Xi Jinping desires, or if capital will continue to flee as a result of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nTrade disruptions seem unlikely to upend China\u2019s economy entirely, as exports account for only about 18% of Chinese gross domestic product, and only 3.6% of GDP comes from exports to the U.S.\n\nSo where is China headed? The most likely course is the one taken by Japan after its trade spat with the U.S. over textiles and steel in the 1980s. Back then, Japan shifted rapidly to higher value-added industries like automobiles and robotics. China already has begun to shift away from industries that add less value like garments and toys, allowing jobs to migrate to Vietnam and Bangladesh. If U.S. tariff pressures intensify, China surely will accelerate the upgrade of its automobile, electronics and artificial-intelligence capabilities.\n\nThough China is going through a rough patch as it deleverages and slows its credit growth, central-bank policy looks set to maintain stability on the domestic front.

Taking away his hard pass, the claim goes, violates both First Amendment speech rights and Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process. What Mr. Acosta\u2019s cheerleaders don\u2019t seem to appreciate is that elevating a government pass into a constitutional fight will prove a loser in the long run, especially for television outlets such as CNN.\n\nEven the judge who issued a temporary restraining order Friday that restored Mr. Acosta\u2019s pass said he was ruling narrowly and wasn\u2019t pretending to adjudicate the First Amendment claims. David Rivkin, a constitutional lawyer who has served in the Justice Department and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, calls Mr. Acosta\u2019s legal case \u201cpatently absurd,\u201d and notes that, while valuable, a White House pass is not a matter of constitutional right but of a sensible accommodation.\n\n\u201cTo believe otherwise would mean that he is entitled to his White House pass, to travel with the president, to being able to participate in White House press conferences and be able to pose questions to White House officials and that none of these policies, including being able to pose questions, can be changed without some form of due process,\u201d Mr. Rivkin says.\n\nIt helps to remember that the press corps works at the White House out of mutual convenience. But the physical presence is particularly crucial for television news. The illusion of intimacy and authority conveyed by filming inside the White House grounds is why each network has a camera stationed on the little strip on the driveway leading to the West Wing.\n\nImagine what it would mean if TV reporters had to broadcast from outside the fence. This would be the nuclear option. And if it were to go down this path, the Trump White House would certainly make itself look besieged and as if it had something to hide.\n\nBut this is a president who has already pulled out of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner. Is it really hard to envision Mr. Trump and his aides concluding he\u2019s not going to get a fair shake no matter what, and then relocating the press accordingly?\n\nEven without the nuclear trigger, there are any number of responses that would render Mr. Acosta\u2019s restored pass a hollow victory for the White House press. Mr. Trump, for example, could simply stop calling on Mr. Acosta and others from major media outlets. Or he could exercise his own speech rights and not hold any press conferences at all.\n\nOr he could do something he raised Sunday in an interview with Fox News, which is to turn off the cameras that show the reporters. This echoes an idea floated by the former press secretaries for both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. In an article for the Columbia Journalism Review just before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mike McCurry and Ari Fleischer suggested no longer having the daily briefing as a live televised event.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t do anything to stop the hot-dogging at pressers featuring the president. It would, however, kill the incentive for showboating at the daily briefings. Again, it is the television press that stands to lose most, especially if Mr. Trump were to couple moving daily briefings off camera with holding few or no press conferences himself.\n\nAs for the White House, it too has incentives to reconsider how best to handle the Acosta situation. It might start by recognizing Mr. Acosta\u2019s arrogance and narcissism as a gift. However much President Trump may accuse the \u201cfake news media\u201d of bias and rail against its unfairness, this pales next to the public preening spectacle of Mr. Acosta himself, a living, breathing example of why so many Americans, as the New York Post\u2019s Michael Goodwin recently pointed out, don\u2019t trust reporters to tell the truth.\n\nIn this sense the White House might be wiser to keep Mr. Acosta exactly where he is. Why not, for example, have the president tell Mr. Acosta, \u201cJim, you can ask as many questions as you like\u201d and allow him to turn the press conferences into \u201cThe Jim Acosta Hour\u201d? Then see how much support Mr. Acosta enjoys among other White House reporters who have good questions they don\u2019t get to ask because CNN\u2019s correspondent hogged the mike.\n\nThe larger point is that once a tradition goes and a necessary give-and-take becomes a matter of narrow legal right rather than sensible accommodation, each side loses something. It\u2019s but one reason Mr. Fleischer says that Mr. Acosta \u201cis the wrong hill for the press to die upon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real way forward isn\u2019t a lawsuit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s for the press and the White House to work together on a reasonable code of conduct. Acosta might not like it, but most White House reporters are polite and won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nWrite to mcgurn@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Burt Neuborne", "title": "Divide States to Democratize the Senate", "description": "A constitutionally sound fix to a vexing political problem.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/divide-states-to-democratize-the-senate-1542672828", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37737/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:13:49Z", "content": "No State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate, declare Article V of the Constitution, which lays out the amendment process.

A Californian has only 1/65th the representation of a Wyoming resident in the upper chamber. That\u2019s undemocratic, but there\u2019s no way around Article V.\n\nOr is there? Article IV provides that \u201cnew States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union\u201d\u2014including from the territory of an existing state, if its legislature consents. Five states were created in this manner: Vermont from New York (1791), Kentucky from Virginia (1792), Tennessee from North Carolina (1796), Maine from Massachusetts (1820) and West Virginia from Virginia (1863).\n\nDrawing on that tradition, a Democracy Restoration Act could grant blanket consent to populous but underrepresented states to go forth and multiply to restore the Senate\u2019s democratic legitimacy.\n\nSection 1 of the act would provide that whenever the decennial census identifies states with populations that exceed that of the least populous state by more than, say, 20 to 1, each of those largest states would have the option of dividing in half. Section 2 would condition the creation of any such state on the consent of the residents of both halves of the original state.\n\nIf, using the 2010 census, we set the trigger at 20 to 1, the six states exceeding 12 million people\u2014California, Texas, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania and Illinois\u2014with about 41% of America\u2019s inhabitants, could split, yielding 12 new senators and dramatically reducing the Senate\u2019s structural inequality. If we set the trigger at 10 to 1, 19 states with more than 70% of the U.S. population could generate 38 senators. Go all the way to 6 to 1\u2014the ratio between the largest and smallest states when the Constitution was ratified\u2014and 29 states yield 58 senators.\n\nGiven current political reality, such an effort to restore democracy to the Senate would likely attract more Democratic than Republican support. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily advantage either party. Bifurcating Texas and Florida would probably generate Democratic gains, with Georgia and Ohio up next; but splitting California, New York and Illinois could open up opportunities for Republicans. Once state boundaries were locked into place, Senate gerrymandering would become almost impossible. The future is unpredictable, but it would be determined by democratically legitimate institutions.\n\nMy fix wouldn\u2019t be easy. Realistically, the Democratic Party would have to gain a Senate majority and the presidency under the existing, stacked system. Political leaders and residents in the underrepresented states would have to be willing to shake up the status quo to take advantage of the increased political power offered by creating new states. That means agreeing on fair boundaries, working out the problems of bifurcating (like liability for debts), and providing for joint administration of certain programs, possibly via interstate compacts.\n\nThe important thing is there\u2019s a constitutional way to rescue the Senate from its current undemocratic condition.\n\nMr. Neuborne has taught law at New York University since 1972."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Kamran Bokhari", "title": "The Kremlin's Interpol Power Play - Wall Street Journal", "description": "The Times The Kremlin's Interpol Power Play Wall Street Journal A close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to be elected the new head of Interpol this week at the organization's general assembly in Dubai.

Maj. Gen. Alexander Prokopchuk has already coordinated the abuse of Interpol extradition requests, known as \u201cred notices,\u201d to pursue Mr. Putin\u2019s enemies, including prominent American businessmen and environmental activists.\n\nChina\u2019s arrest and detention of Meng Hongwei, the previous president who disappeared mysteriously earlier this month, has provided an opening for Mr. Putin to pursue his meddlesome agenda. But if the Kremlin tramples on the agency\u2019s neutrality, how will the West respond? How will the civilized nations of the world\u2014the ones that recognize and respect the rule of law\u2014protect their citizens from the wrath of Mr. Putin\u2019s new global police force when it is headed by a loyal general?\n\nGen. Prokopchuk\u2019s allegiances are clear. He was appointed to Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry in 2003, not too long after Mr. Putin ascended to the presidency. He became a key surrogate in the Putinization of the Russian state. Since 2011, when he was appointed head of Russia\u2019s Interpol Bureau, he has been indispensable in Mr. Putin\u2019s manipulation and abuse of what is supposed to be a neutral, apolitical international organization.\n\nPart of the problem lies in how Interpol\u2019s red-notice system works. The process for applying for one of these international arrest warrants is notoriously fickle, requiring a member state simply to submit a form. There is almost no oversight. Interpol rarely investigates the validity of these warrants. The organization acknowledges that approximately 97% of notice requests are not reviewed in depth.\n\nIn 2008 an American citizen residing in Copenhagen was detained as a result of an Interpol red notice and held for almost two months in a maximum-security prison. Ilya Katsnelson was never charged, as investigators determined that it was his involvement with a Putin nemesis\u2014Russian dissident Mikhail Khordorkhovsky\u2014that provoked the warrant. U.S. investor and Putin critic Bill Browder experienced something similar in Madrid, where he was arrested in his hotel room by Spanish police who declared the cause of arrest to be \u201cInterpol\u2014Russia.\u201d\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s weaponization of Interpol is most apparent in the European Union\u2019s frontier Baltic and Balkan states. Interpol issued a red notice for Estonian politician and intelligence chief Eerik-Niles Kross on the eve of the 2013 elections in the tiny Baltic country of 1.3 million. Mr. Kross\u2019s IRL party was poised to make sizable gains against Estonia\u2019s Russia-aligned party.\n\nMost worryingly, Russia is using Interpol as the sharp end of a stick to expand its influence in the Balkans. Mr. Putin is keen to secure Russian control of EU energy supplies through Kremlin proxies Rosneft and Gazprom . Under Gen. Prokopchuk\u2019s watchful eye, Interpol has used red notices to shift geopolitical currents and attack Europe\u2019s energy security.\n\nSince 2009, when Hungarian energy company MOL beat Russian competitors to an investment in INA, Croatia\u2019s largest energy company, Russia has supported Croatia\u2019s attempts to renege on that agreement. A powerful Russian energy presence in central Europe would have huge ramifications for the region and the EU. Perhaps not coincidentally, the MOL chairman Zsolt Hern\u00e1di had an Interpol red notice issued against him on bribery charges this week, despite already being exonerated of those very same charges by the United Nations\u2019 most senior trade-arbitration court in 2017.\n\nAll of this comes at a critical time for the region. Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller visited Croatia in 2014 to try to scare off potential competition in what Russia considers to be its Central European backyard. From energy deals to electoral campaigns, the abuse of Interpol\u2019s red-notice system has real geopolitical consequences. And if Mr. Putin can capture and control benign international institutions to execute silent economic coups in an attempt to destabilize Europe, perhaps it is time for the West to rethink its engagement with these organizations. Allowing Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression to go unchecked could lead to permanent strategic losses for the liberal order.\n\nOf Interpol\u2019s 192 members, 14 democracies account for 74% of the body\u2019s funding. Unless they use that financial leverage to change the body\u2019s archaic processes at this year\u2019s summit in Dubai, a much bigger price will be paid by Europe and the Western world.\n\nMr. Bokhari is a Washington-based national security and foreign policy specialist with the University of Ottawa\u2019s Professional Development Institute."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Summer Said", "title": "Aramco Abandons Plan for Massive Corporate-Bond Sales to Fund Sabic Deal", "description": "Saudi Aramco no longer plans to launch what would have been one of the world\u2019s largest-ever corporate-bond sales to fund a roughly $70 billion stake in the kingdom\u2019s national petrochemical firm, looking instead to options requiring less public disclosure.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aramco-abandons-plan-for-massive-corporate-bond-sales-to-fund-sabic-deal-1542639560", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37812/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:11:04Z", "content": "DUBAISaudi Aramco no longer plans to launch what would have been one of the worlds largest-ever corporate-bond sales to fund a roughly $70 billion stake in the kingdoms national petrochemical firm, looking instead to options requiring less public disclosure, \u2026 [+4069 chars]", "fulltext": "DUBAI\u2014Saudi Aramco no longer plans to launch what would have been one of the world\u2019s largest-ever corporate-bond sales to fund a roughly $70 billion stake in the kingdom\u2019s national petrochemical firm, looking instead to options requiring less public disclosure, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSaudi Arabian Oil Co., as the company is officially known, had considered issuing up to $40 billion in bonds to help buy 70% of Saudi Basic Industries Corp., The Wall Street Journal has reported.\n\n..."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jared Malsin", "title": "Migrants Rescued by Cargo Ship Refuse to Get Off in Libya", "description": "Dozens of migrants are engaged in a standoff with Libyan officials, refusing to disembark from a ship that rescued them at sea because they fear torture at the hands of Libyan authorities.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/migrants-rescued-by-cargo-ship-refuse-to-get-off-in-libya-1542654620", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37938/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:01:54Z", "content": "CAIRODozens of migrants are engaged in a standoff with Libyan officials, refusing for more than a week to disembark from a cargo ship that rescued them at sea because they fear torture at the hands of Libyan authorities, according to humanitarian groups.
