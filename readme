#news_sentiment_vis

we created an entity sentiment analysis pipeline for news media
it can leverage google, ibm, and aylien entity sentiment apis

data/ contains the data collection pipeline - from querying the news apis, to setting up the local SQL database. Cloud functionality coming. 
setup/ contains requirements.txt, and is where the apikey would live
web/ contains files necessary for the website. 

many thanks to megan monroe and charles winston!
