The investigation is being handled by the Miami office of the FBI and by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, according to an email sent to the alleged victim last year by an FBI victim specialist. A recording on a phone line set up by the Justice Department to help victims said Friday the case remains active. Mr. Whitaker, appointed Wednesday by President Trump to replace Jeff Sessions as head of the Justice Department, oversees the FBI in his new job.\n\nThere are so many reasons Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t have chosen Matt Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general, it\u2019s genuinely challenging to choose just one. But by any fair measure, Whitaker\u2019s work with World Patent Marketing Inc. has to be near the top of the list. The Wall Street Journal reported the other day.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a minute, because the details are almost hard to believe.\n\nWhitaker joined the company\u2019s advisory board after having served as a U.S. Attorney in the Bush/Cheney administration \u2013 a fact World Patent Marketing exploited to lure potential clients.\n\nFour years ago, the company issued a press release that quoted Matt Whitaker as saying, \u201cAs a former U.S. attorney, I would only align myself with a first-class organization. World Patent Marketing goes beyond making statements about doing business ethically and translates them into action.\u201d\n\nThose comments started to look pretty bad after the Federal Trade Commission filed a civil suit against this World Patent Marketing, describing it as \u201can invention-promotion scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars.\u201d Among its alleged victims are many disabled American veterans.\n\nNow, the company is facing possible criminal scrutiny from the FBI, all while one of the company\u2019s top officials is running the Justice Department.\n\nIt\u2019s a dynamic that sounds like fanciful fiction: the president unilaterally empowered Matt Whitaker to serve as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official, while a company Whitaker helped lead is at the center of a multi-million-dollar fraud scheme being investigated by the FBI.\n\nAnd before you think his work on World Patent Marketing\u2019s advisory board meant his connection to the company was unimportant, note that according to Federal Trade Commission, Whitaker wrote threatening emails to the company\u2019s customers, pressing them not to complain about having been defrauded by the firm.\n\nAmong those subpoenaed as part of the FTC\u2019s case against World Patent Marketing was none other than Matt Whitaker, your new acting attorney general.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why a president would elevate such a person to an immensely powerful post, it\u2019s important to note that the White House apparently had no idea about Whitaker\u2019s connection to the company \u2013 because he wasn\u2019t vetted.\n\nIf there\u2019s a defense for such a move, I can\u2019t think of it.", "Joe and Mika discuss the big news of the day.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}", "Donald Trump and Florida Gov.

Marco Rubio (R) have, alas, dipped their toes in the same misguided waters \u2013 but the president and the governor have been more aggressive than most and have done the most damage to their credibility.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Scott, who has a dwindling lead against Sen. Bill Nelson (D), and who dispatched Florida law enforcement officials to find evidence to back up his ideas. That didn\u2019t turn out well.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the governor publicly raised the prospect of \u201crampant fraud\u201d as part of a panic-induced public-relations scheme, rather than based on meaningful proof of wrongdoing.\n\nAfter Florida law enforcement told the public that there\u2019s no evidence of fraud, Scott went to Fox News to once again raise the prospect of fraud.\n\nAll of which looked pretty bad for the governor \u2013 though the president\u2019s take may have been slightly worse.\n\nTrump started tweeting about Florida\u2019s election results on Thursday, pointing to \u201cfraud\u201d that did not, and does not, exist. A day later, he lied about the discovery of \u201cmiraculous\u201d votes, and vowed to dispatch lawyers to \u201cexpose the fraud\u201d that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nOn Saturday, while in France to recognize the 100th anniversary of World War I, Trump kept up the offensive, publishing a tweet accusing Democrats of \u201ctrying to STEAL two big elections.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the Republican president called for Florida to stop counting votes, raised the prospect of \u201cforged\u201d ballots, and condemned the uncounted ballots as \u201cinfected.\u201d Trump added, \u201cMust go with Election Night!\u201d\n\nIn other words, since his preferred candidate is currently ahead, Trump wants officials to stop counting votes, including those cast by military servicemen and women serving overseas. In the process, the president took steps to undermine confidence in the integrity of the elections system, as if counting provisional and vote-by-mail ballots is inherently suspicious.\n\nThis question from Brendan Nyhan rings true for a reason: \u201cThe president is making baseless accusations of fraud and calling for the vote count to be stopped while his political allies are ahead.

Her campaign manager predicted her victory was inevitable. The lengthy vote-count process, which has continued long after the polls closed Nov. 6, is mostly due to the need to verify signatures for voters who vote by mail. The Arizona Republic estimates about 215,000 ballots remain to be counted statewide.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take some time for officials to work through those ballots, and Democrats shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up just yet, but Sinema\u2019s campaign team insists her lead is \u201cinsurmountable,\u201d and most election watchers tend to think Sinema will be the one who takes office in the new year.\n\nFor his part, Donald Trump has decided to do what Donald Trump always likes to do: peddle odd conspiracy theories. \u201cJust out \u2013 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH,\u201d the confused president tweeted on Friday. \u201cElectoral corruption \u2013 Call for a new Election?\u201d He also said votes in Arizona are materializing \u201cout of the wilderness.\u201d\n\nNone of this made any sense. There\u2019s no evidence of corruption and there won\u2019t be a new election, largely because there\u2019s no need for one. Trump may be comfortable publicly questioning the integrity of an election for no reason, but the nonsense is literally unbelievable.\n\nMcSally, to her credit, hasn\u2019t endorsed any of the conspiracy theories, and for her trouble, there\u2019s reportedly frustration with her posture \u201cat the highest levels of the national party.\u201d\n\nAll of which brings us to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, under the leadership of Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.).\n\nOn Saturday, one NRSC official claimed, without proof, that an Arizona election official has \u201cdestroyed evidence\u201d as part of an illegal scheme to help Democrats. The same day, the NRSC issued a press statement accusing Democrats of engaging in \u201cvoter suppression tactics\u201d and \u201ccooking the books.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to back up any of this.\n\nAsked for an explanation as to why his national campaign committee would repeat baseless claims, Cory Gardner told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d yesterday that he wasn\u2019t \u201cfamiliar\u201d with his party\u2019s bogus rhetoric.

With Jon Kyl (R) temporarily filling the vacancy left by the late Sen. John McCain (R), it\u2019s very likely Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) will soon need to find someone else to take that seat.

Steve King hit the campaign trail in his Iowa district, hoping to salvage his career. A reporter from The Weekly Standard was on hand in Webster City, Iowa, on Nov. 5, when the right-wing congressman spoke with a group of supporters in the back of a restaurant.\n\nA constituent asked about King\u2019s latest pheasant hunting, and he offered a detailed answer about his \u201cpatented pheasant noodle soup,\u201d which led the GOP lawmaker to reflect on ingredients from local soil.\n\nKING: I raised a bunch this year, and they don\u2019t have enough bite. I guess I\u2019m going to have to go and get some dirt from Mexico to grow the next batch. [Laughs] AUDIENCE MEMBER: Trust me, it\u2019s already on its way. KING: Well, yeah, there\u2019s plenty of dirt, it\u2019s coming from the West Coast, too. And a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nNot surprisingly, many read the comments and picked up on what seemed like a not-so-subtle immigration subtext.\n\nI\u2019d assumed King would push back by insisting he was referring to literal dirt, but in a bit of a surprise, King accused The Weekly Standard \u2013 a prominent conservative magazine \u2013 of misquoting him.\n\nOver the weekend, The Weekly Standard\u2019s Stephen F. Hayes posted an audio clip of the exchange, which, as expected, proved that King was quoted accurately.\n\nHayes\u2019 piece summarized the story nicely: \u201cSo, King claimed our reporter lied. He didn\u2019t. He claimed we didn\u2019t have a recording. We do. He insisted we refused to release the audio. Untrue. It\u2019s worth remembering these things as you evaluate the credibility of the claim from King \u2013 a man with a history of bigoted comments and a recent obsession with the \u2018caravan\u2019 of immigrants traveling through Mexico to the United States \u2013 that he wasn\u2019t talking about immigrants when he joked about \u2018dirt\u2019 on its way to the U.S. from Mexico.\u201d\n\nFor those who missed the election results, King ended up winning another term, defeating J.D. Scholten (D) by just a few points. At least in theory, that leaves House Republicans with a decision to make.\n\nRemember, the week before Election Day, some GOP leaders were prepared to effectively cut King loose. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) publicly denounced the Iowan\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d antics, adding, \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.\u201d\n\nKing won anyway \u2013 with a partisan voter index rating of R+11, his district is easily the least competitive in Iowa \u2013 but House Republicans are not without options. GOP leaders could, for example, vote to kick him out of their conference and/or deny him committee assignments. They could also, at least in theory, try to expel him from the chamber.\n\nI don\u2019t seriously expect any of these outcomes, but if King\u2019s Republican brethren are serious about \u201cstanding up against white supremacy,\u201d to borrow Steve Stivers\u2019 phrase, there are steps they could take to prove it.", "Felix Salmon: Finance cmte. could spray \u2018t-shirt cannon of subpoenas\u2019 on DC copied!\n\nMoney, Power, Politics: Rep.

The New York Times reported a year ago that the Kremlin considered Rohrabacher so valuable that the FBI warned the congressman in 2012 that Russia considered him \u201can intelligence source worthy of a Kremlin code name.\u201d\n\nIt looks like Moscow is going to need a new friend on Capitol Hill. The Washington Post reported over the weekend:\n\nA Republican congressman known for his outspoken support for Russian President Vladimir Putin narrowly lost his Orange County, Calif., seat after 15 terms, a defeat that helped Democrats further solidify their House majority. Democrat Harley Rouda, a real estate executive, beat Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in one of the state\u2019s most closely watched congressional races, the Associated Press projected on Saturday. Rohrabacher\u2019s strong identification with President Trump and his unabashed support for Russia had made him ripe for a challenge in an affluent district that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Rouda had 109,591 votes to Rohrabacher\u2019s 101,081 votes, with 52 percent of the vote to the Republican\u2019s 48 percent, according to the AP.\n\nCalifornia has obviously earned a reputation as one of the nation\u2019s \u201cbluest\u201d states, but it\u2019s important to acknowledge the fact that Rohrabacher is a 30-year congressional veteran, representing a southern California district where registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats by a double-digit margin. He\u2019d never really been in jeopardy before this year.\n\nAnd yet, Rohrabacher lost anyway.\n\nPart of this is very likely the result of the GOP congressman\u2019s unsettling posture toward Russia, and Rohrabacher\u2019s alliance with Putin\u2019s other pal \u2013 Donald Trump \u2013 didn\u2019t strengthen his electoral position, either.\n\nBut there\u2019s another arc to the results, having to do with changes to the political landscape in the Golden State. The L.A. Times reported:\n\n\u2026Republicans will hold, at most, 11 of California\u2019s 53 seats in the House. Overall, Democrats are now in a position to make the greatest gains their party has seen in the chamber since Watergate. \u201cThis is more than just a bad year,\u201d said Mike Madrid, a GOP political strategist. \u201cThis is essentially a realignment in California politics, and the traditional base that has served the Republican Party no longer exists.\u201d\n\nIn this year\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats have already flipped three California seats from \u201cred\u201d to \u201cblue.\u201d There are still three more races that haven\u2019t yet been called, each featuring vulnerable GOP incumbents.

Not only are there still several pending races where the votes are still being tallied, but there\u2019s also a U.S. Senate race in Mississippi that\u2019s headed for a runoff.\n\nAt first blush, given Mississippi\u2019s partisan leanings, it may be tempting to assume the contest won\u2019t be competitive. But as we were reminded over the weekend, this Senate race is worth watching for all sorts of reasons.\n\nA video of U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., who faces a runoff against an African-American opponent, joking about attending \u201ca public hanging\u201d went viral Sunday as she insisted there was nothing negative about her remark. \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row,\u201d Hyde-Smith said during a campaign stop in Tupelo, Mississippi. The man she was referring to was identified as a local rancher.\n\nThe video was first posted online by Lamar White Jr., the publisher of The Bayou Brief, a nonprofit news site in Louisiana.\n\nAs always, context is everything: Hyde-Smith, an appointed Senate incumbent, is running against Mike Espy, the first African American to serve as the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, and who, 30 years ago, became the first African American elected to Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction.\n\nGiven the state\u2019s history, and her opponent\u2019s race, it\u2019s not unreasonable to argue that Hyde-Smith should\u2019ve avoided unprompted comments about public hangings.\n\nThe Jackson Free Press provided some additional historical context that\u2019s worth keeping in mind:\n\nBetween 1877 and 1950, Mississippi had the highest number of lynchings of African Americans of any state in the United States, just as the state had been the wealthiest from slavery before the Civil War, and then later passed the most onerous laws after Reconstruction to stop black people from voting and gain equal rights in the state. Across Mississippi, 654 lynchings were reported in that period, including two in Lee County, where Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments were made. Lynchings \u2013 extrajudicial mob justice used to intimidate African Americans \u2013 were usually done by hanging, often in front of crowds of joyous whites who even mailed postcards with lynching photographs to friends and family.\n\nIn all likelihood, Cindy Hyde-Smith is aware of this history. It makes her choice of words that much more unsettling.\n\nEspy called the Republican senator\u2019s comments \u201creprehensible,\u201d while Derrick Johnson, a native Mississippian who serves as president of the NAACP, added in a written statement, \u201cHer choice of words serves as an indictment of not only her lack of judgement, but her lack of empathy and lack of character.\u201d\n\nI expected a non-apology apology in which Hyde-Smith expressed some tepid regret \u201cif anyone was offended,\u201d but she wasn\u2019t willing to even go that far. \u201cIn referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous,\u201d the senator said in a statement.\n\nLast week, in a multi-candidate field, Hyde-Smith finished with 41.5% of the vote, to Espy\u2019s 40.6%. Because neither candidate reached the 50% threshold, there will be a special election on Nov. 27, which is two weeks from tomorrow. The two candidates are also scheduled to participate in a debate on Nov. 20.", "'Be for something,' says incoming congresswoman copied!\n\nDemocratic Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger says it's not enough for Democrats to just be against President Trump, but they have to be for something as lawmakers.\n\nRead More", "\u201cThe debt our Nation owes those who have worn the uniform is a debt we will never be able to fully repay,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence wrote yesterday in a tweet recognizing Veterans Day. \u201cBut just as those courageous men and women have fought for us, [Donald] Trump & our administration have fought for them.\u201d\n\nThat second sentence suggested it wasn\u2019t enough for the vice president to honor the service and sacrifices of America\u2019s veterans; Pence decided it\u2019d also be a good idea to add a political element to his message. Recognizing those who served on Veterans Day is important, but for the vice president, recognizing Donald Trump matters, too.\n\nPence\u2019s tweet directed people to a Fox News op-ed, ostensibly written by the vice president himself, with a headline that read, \u201cVeterans have no better friend than President Trump.\u201d\n\nThis president and our administration understand that veterans\u2019 benefits are not entitlements \u2013 they\u2019re earned. They are the ongoing compensation for services rendered in the uniform of the United States. And since the outset of our administration, we\u2019ve taken decisive action to make good on our promise to the heroes who\u2019ve served.\n\nThere\u2019s a degree of unseemliness to attaching a political public-relations angle to a message recognizing veterans. Mike Pence\u2019s pitch, in effect, was, \u201cHappy Veterans Day. But enough about you; now let me tell you how awesome Donald Trump is.\u201d\n\nEven if we put this aside, is the administration\u2019s actual record on veterans\u2019 issues as impressive as the vice president wants the public to believe?\n\nIt was Donald Trump, for example, who showed his deep concern for veterans by nominating someone to lead the VA whom the president later admitted \u201cmight not have been qualified.\u201d\n\nIt was a couple of months earlier when we learned about \u201cthe Mar-a-Lago Crowd\u201d that helped oversee Trump\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs. Pro Publica uncovered a dynamic in which three wealthy members of Trump\u2019s Florida resort effectively helped run the VA for months, despite having no relevant experience, and despite no oversight or accountability of any kind, basically because they\u2019re pals with the president through the club he still owns and profits from.\n\nThe triumvirate of Bruce Moskowitz, Ike Perlmutter, and Marc Sherman oversaw everything from the VA\u2019s digital records system to personnel decisions, occasionally using their influence in ways that may have benefited their private financial interests.\n\nAround the same time these revelations came to light, the Trump administration also took steps to suspend audits of lenders for violations of the Military Lending Act, which had the practical effect of making military families more susceptible to \u201cfinancial fraud, predatory loans and credit card gouging.\u201d (The move \u201csurprised advocates for military families,\u201d the New York Times reported in August.)\n\nWe can keep going. Under Trump, veterans have struggled to receive their benefits under the G.I. Bill. The president has misled the public about the VA Accountability Act. The veterans\u2019 hotline the Republican promised to create during his 2016 campaign has turned into a bust. Trump has politicized the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals in unprecedented ways. This morning, the Republican went so far as to inadvertently make the case for disenfranchising some veterans who cast votes while serving abroad.\n\nVeterans \u201chave no better friend\u201d than Donald Trump? This White House has a curious definition of \u201cfriend.\u201d", "It was August when Donald Trump first started sharing his thoughts on California wildfires, which the president was eager to blame on Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and \u201cbad environmental laws.\u201d As regular readers may recall, none of Trump\u2019s rhetoric made sense.\n\nThe Washington Post reported, for example, that the president seemed confused about every relevant detail. CNN added that even some White House officials \u201cadmitted to being slightly perplexed\u201d at Trump\u2019s obvious nonsense.\n\nAnd yet, Trump not only refused to get up to speed on the basics of the issue, he also refused to stop addressing the issue in unusually callous ways. Five months after his initial misguided foray, he renewed his offensive over the weekend.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday blamed \u201cmismanagement\u201d of California\u2019s forests for ongoing deadly wildfires, threatening to withhold federal payments after 25 people died in two separate blazes and evacuation orders were issued for some 250,000 state residents. \u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to consider a story like this one. The first and most obvious is to acknowledge the factual details and point out that the president simply has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. The fires are not the result of state officials\u2019 approach to forest management.\n\nCalifornia Professional Firefighters President Brian Rice issued a scathing written statement in response to Trump\u2019s nonsense, describing the president\u2019s assessment as being, among other things, \u201cdangerously wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd while it\u2019s tempting to end the conversation there, it\u2019s nearly as important to acknowledge serious concerns about the president\u2019s capacity for empathy and character.\n\nIn this case, Donald Trump \u2013 while in France \u2013 thought it\u2019d be a good idea to publish an ignorant tweet, blaming Americans for a deadly natural disaster, while the crisis was still unfolding.\n\nThe American president\u2019s first instinct wasn\u2019t compassion or consolation. Rather, as Californians fled and died, Trump\u2019s judgment led him to blame and threaten.\n\nI\u2019ve long been fascinated by the limits of the Republican\u2019s capacity for empathy, but this is a rather extreme example of Trump\u2019s indifference to a deadly crisis in his own country.\n\nPostscript: As for Trump\u2019s threat to end \u201cFed payments\u201d to the Golden State, in addition to the bizarre idea of an American president threatening an American state in the midst of a natural disaster, it\u2019s worth appreciating the fact that Trump has threatened to cut off federal funding to California a half-dozen times for a half-dozen reasons.\n\nThe Republican never follows through \u2013 because he can\u2019t \u2013 but he keeps repeating the hollow rhetoric anyway.", "Sherrod Brown lays out areas of focus for Dems copied!\n\nSen.

Chris Coons and Jeff Flake will be calling for a vote to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the coming week.\n\nRead More", "Donald Trump traveled abroad in July for a series of key international events, each of which proved to be deeply embarrassing for the American president and his administration. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) described Trump\u2019s foreign travel at the time as a series of \u201ccalamitous\u201d events, which seemed more than fair under the circumstances.\n\nFive months later, Trump\u2019s trip to France wasn\u2019t quite as cringe-worthy, but at times, it was close. Politico\u2019s report was exactly right: the Republican once again found himself isolated, both figuratively and literally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump looked very much alone in Paris this weekend, isolated from European leaders and longtime U.S. allies as he continued to pursue his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. He seemed most at ease late Sunday afternoon, on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, as he visited the Suresnes American Cemetery and memorial just outside Paris\u2026. It was the rare moment in Paris, an event where Trump was in control and could try to shine, coming off a weekend in which European leaders rebuked him both implicitly and explicitly. From Macron to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the message seemed clear: Trump is taking the U.S. in a more isolated direction, while former allies band together to reject him.\n\nOddly enough, Trump seemed eager to pick a fight before the gathering even began in earnest. On Friday afternoon, the American president published a tweet that read, \u201cPresident Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\u201d\n\nIn realty, Macron delivered remarks in which he stressed the need for Europe to be able to protect itself, rather than rely solely on the United States. By most measures, it\u2019s a sentiment Trump would ordinarily approve of.\n\nBut instead of getting his facts straight, the confused Republican thought it\u2019d be wise to lash out via Twitter, initiating a pointless diplomatic feud for no reason.\n\nIt went downhill from there.\n\nThe day after the Twitter spat, Trump chose not to attend an event at France\u2019s Aisne Marne American Cemetery. Trump instead published a series of additional tweets, several of which focused on a baseless election-related conspiracy theory.\n\nA day later, French President Emmanuel Macron delivered striking remarks in which he said, just steps away from his American counterpart, \u201cNationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying, \u2018Our interests first, who cares about the others,\u2019 we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what gives it grace and what is essential: its moral values.\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, has enthusiastically embraced the \u201cnationalist\u201d label, though it\u2019s an open question as to whether or not he fully understands the word\u2019s meaning. (To hear the Republican tell it, \u201cnationalism\u201d and \u201cpatriotism\u201d are synonyms. They\u2019re not.)\n\nObservers from around the world were similarly treated to photographs of world leaders, walking shoulder to shoulder along the Champs Elysees, without the ostensible \u201cleader of the free world,\u201d who arrived separately.\n\nStepping back, it\u2019s clear that many of Trump\u2019s failures as president relate to governing, but we\u2019re occasionally reminded of how routinely he struggles in simple, ceremonial tasks.\n\nAs we discussed in August, in some cases, Trump is considered so offensive that he\u2019s deliberately excluded from ceremonial events (McCain\u2019s funeral, Barbara Bush\u2019s funeral, the recent royal wedding in the U.K., etc.). In other cases, the president boycotts ceremonial events for political reasons (the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, the Kennedy Center Honors, etc.).\n\nIn still other cases, Trump wants to participate in ceremonial events, but others don\u2019t want to be in his company. Some championship sports teams, for example, have declined recent White House invitations.\n\nBut the most jarring examples are the events in which Trump tries and fails.\n\nThe presidency is a profoundly difficult job that includes disparate responsibilities. Nearly two years into the Trump era, it\u2019s not yet clear which of these duties meets Trump\u2019s unique skill set.", "As wildfires rage, Trump attacks California copied!\n\nPresident Trump also weighed in over the weekend on the California wildfires, claiming 'poor' forest management was in part to blame for the massive fires.
