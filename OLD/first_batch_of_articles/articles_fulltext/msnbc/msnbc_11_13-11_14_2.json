As the American president mocked our French allies yesterday \u2013 complete with an all-caps missive that read, \u201cMake France Great Again!\u201d \u2013 France was recognizing the three-year anniversary of an ISIS terrorist attack in Paris that killed 130 people.\n\nTrump may not have realized the significance of the date, but he didn\u2019t bother to check, either. Reuters reports that this did not go unnoticed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who attacked his French counterpart in a series of tweets on Tuesday, should have shown \u201ccommon decency\u201d instead since the country was mourning the anniversary of deadly attacks in Paris, a French government spokesman said. In five posts sent on the same day France marked the anniversary of the 2015 attacks that killed 130 people, Trump blasted the key U.S. ally over its near defeat to Germany in two world wars, its wine industry and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s approval ratings.\n\n\u201cYesterday was November 13, we were marking the murder of 130 of our people,\u201d French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told Reuters. \u201cSo I\u2019ll reply in English: \u2018common decency\u2019 would have been appropriate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult sentiment to disagree with.\n\nTrump\u2019s offensive was misguided anyway, given that it was rooted in confusion. Emmanuel Macron recently spoke about Europe taking responsibility for its own security, and not looking to the United States for protection, which is a sentiment the Republican White House should agree with. The American president, however, decided it was \u201cvery insulting\u201d \u2013 because in Trump\u2019s mind, Macron recommended building an army to protect Europe from Americans.\n\nThe larger context, of course, is every bit as important as the Republican\u2019s misplaced assumptions. After Macron took office, he seemed to have a strategy in mind: Trump may have alienated many of the United States\u2019 allies, but the young French president seemed determined to forge a partnership with the American leader.\n\nHe even threw Trump a parade, which the Republican seemed to thoroughly enjoy.\n\nBut the relationship now appears to be unraveling. I\u2019m reminded of something Politico reported over the summer, \u201cForeign leaders are learning that hand-holding, golf games, military parades and other efforts to personally woo President Donald Trump do not guarantee that Trump won\u2019t burn them.\u201d\n\nThe article quoted one former White House official saying, \u201cTrump is very selfish and I think he views flattery as a one-way street where he gets flattered and then there\u2019s no real reciprocal benefit going back the other direction. If you\u2019re a foreign leader you have to realize if you try to butter up Trump it doesn\u2019t really matter, it\u2019s a one-way street.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s likely Emmanuel Macron is now well aware of this unfortunate dynamic.", "What does the Clinton scandal tell us about the Mueller investigation? copied!\n\nLeon Neyfakh, staff writer at Slate and co-producer and host of their hit podcast \"Slow Burn,\" and Yahoo News Chief Investigative Correspondent Michael Isikoff join Craig Melvin to discuss why we keep revisiting the Clinton scandal two decades later.\n\nRead More", "49ers host Paradise High School football team in wake of wildfires copied!\n\nAs wildfires continue to ravage California, the San Francisco 49ers gave the Paradise High School football team something to smile about.\n\nRead More", "Jenna Bush-Hager sits down with Michelle Obama to discuss new book copied!\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama is setting the record straight, as she promotes her new book \"Becoming.\" Today she spoke to NBC's Jenna Bush Hager, who joined Craig Melvin to talk about the special bond between their two families.\n\nRead More", "Omarosa Manigault Newman talks potential White House staffing shake up copied!\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman, former director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison at the White House, joins Craig Melvin to discuss possible staffing changes in the White House and the new reporting on President Trump\u2019s mood after the midterms.\n\nRead More", "First lady calls for firing of national security aide copied!\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s office on Tuesday publicly called for the firing of senior National Security Council official, Mira Ricardel.

As things stand, it\u2019s the only state that can make that boast.\n\n* As of this morning, the Democratic lead in the U.S. House popular vote stood at 7.1%, though it may yet inch higher. For comparison purposes, note that in 2010 \u2013 which was widely seen as a GOP \u201cwave\u201d cycle \u2013 Republicans won the U.S. House popular vote by 6.6%.\n\n* Senate Democrats formally elected their leadership team for the next Congress.

The party\u2019s term-limits policy prevented Cornyn from keeping his post.\n\n* Orientation is currently underway for new senators, and Florida\u2019s Rick Scott (R) is participating, despite the fact that the votes in his race are still being counted.

The Washington Examiner noted:\n\nOn Tuesday, Brady also claimed that the tax code rewrite helped Republicans in the midterm elections, despite the losses suffered by the party and many of the lawmakers who helped write the bill. \u201cCan you imagine the outcome if we didn\u2019t have a booming economy?\u201d Brady asked. \u201cIt made a huge difference across this country and I think was key in a number of our Republican races.\u201d\n\nThe Texas congressman added that he believes House Republicans exceeded expectations in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThat last point is especially difficult to take seriously. In the days leading up to Election Day, the chatter in GOP circles was that the party might be able to eke out a narrow House majority. As recently as Nov. 3, Vice President Mike Pence declared, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hold our Republican majority in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nWhere exactly were those intra-party expectations about Republicans suffering their largest losses since the Watergate era?\n\nBut even putting this aside, the idea that the GOP\u2019s tax breaks for the wealthy \u201cmade a huge difference\u201d for Republicans is an even stranger argument.\n\nWe can say with quantifiable certainty that the party\u2019s tax plan was woefully unpopular among voters, prompting Republican officials and candidates to run away from the issue before voters headed to the polls.\n\nBrady\u2019s larger point seems to be that the policy was politically important in less obvious ways: tax breaks boosted the economy, the argument goes, which meant many voters were less eager for change, which in turn boosted Republican incumbents who might\u2019ve otherwise been defeated.\n\nIt\u2019s tough thing to prove either way. That said, the economy isn\u2019t much different than it was in 2015 \u2013 in fact, job growth is actually slower now than it was three years ago \u2013 so the idea that tax cuts for the wealthy served as rocket fuel for the economy is dubious, at best.\n\nThe fact that Brady is pushing these talking points isn\u2019t too surprising. After all, it\u2019s not realistic to think one of the key architects of the Republican tax plan would stand before reporters and declare, \u201cI guess we did the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nBut if there\u2019s evidence of the tax plan helping the GOP in the midterms, it\u2019s hiding well.", "Bryan Cranston on being 'mad as hell' in 'Network' copied!\n\nWhat is it like for actor Bryan Cranston to portray each night in front of a live audience a television anchor who's been fired from his job?

The city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker\u2019s company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000. Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\n\nJust when it seemed we couldn\u2019t possibly learn of a new controversy surrounding acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the Associated Press uncovered the latest in an amazing series.\n\nWell, sure, when you put it that way, it sounds bad.\n\nVox published a piece yesterday summarizing Whitaker\u2019s many controversies, and I was struck, not just by the seriousness of the allegations, but by the length of the piece itself. Ordinarily, before anyone could put together a lengthy list of controversies surrounding a Trump cabinet official, he or she would have to be in office for at least a couple of months.\n\nMatt Whitaker is currently in his seventh day \u2013 and two of those days were a weekend.\n\nAt least in theory, this would ordinarily be the point at which the White House started pushing back aggressively against the acting AG\u2019s many controversies, but that\u2019s proving difficult \u2013 not just because of the scope of Whitaker\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, but also because White House officials didn\u2019t know these stories were coming.\n\nFor example, we learned the other day that Whitaker is tied directly to a fraud scheme that\u2019s currently under FBI investigation. Soon after this came to public light, the Washington Post reported, \u201cWhitaker\u2019s connection to World Patent Marketing came as a surprise to both senior Justice Department and White House officials.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, last week, we learned of the acting attorney general\u2019s frequent public condemnations of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, the substance of which Whitaker has already rejected.

NBC News\u2019 Pete Williams reports.\n\nRead More", "The U.S. budget deficit for the last fiscal year, which ended in September, was $779 billion, up 16% from the previous year. That deficit was the fifth largest in modern American history \u2013 in non-inflation adjusted terms \u2013 and stood at 3.9% of GDP, up from 3.5% a year prior.\n\nFor those concerned with the ballooning budget shortfall, the new fiscal year isn\u2019t off to a good start. Bloomberg News reported yesterday:\n\nThe U.S. recorded a $100.5 billion budget deficit in October, an increase of about 60 percent from a year earlier, as spending grew twice as fast as revenue. The deficit widened from $63.2 billion in the same month last year, the department said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. October marks the start of the U.S. fiscal year.\n\nAs a rule, it\u2019s best not to overreact to monthly deficit numbers, which can bounce around a bit. The fact that the deficit was $100 billion in the first month of the fiscal year, for example, does not necessarily mean that it will be $1.2 trillion when the fiscal year ends.\n\nThat said, the $100 billion deficit in October doesn\u2019t do any favors for the Republicans who assured Americans that massive tax breaks for the wealthy will pay for themselves.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Democrats prepare to reclaim their majority in the House of Representatives, the monthly shortfall also serves as a fitting coda to Tea Party era.\n\nIn 2010, Republicans rode a wave into a House majority, fueled by Tea Party activism and a focus on \u201cfiscal responsibility.\u201d GOP officials and candidates said at the time that they were deeply concerned about the deficit \u201ccrisis,\u201d which would impose crippling burdens on future generations.\n\nEight years later, in their month before the midterm elections that would push them into minority status, House Republicans saw the deficit reach $100 billion, fueled in part by tax breaks they didn\u2019t even try to pay for.\n\nThe \u201cmovement,\u201d such as it was, failed.\n\nPostscript: Every time we discuss the deficit, I feel compelled to point out again that I\u2019m not a deficit hawk, and I firmly believe that larger deficits, under some circumstances, are absolutely worthwhile and necessary.\n\nThese are not, however, those circumstances. When the economy is in trouble, it makes sense for the United States to borrow more, invest more, cushion the blow, and help strengthen the economy.\n\nThe Trump White House and the Republican-led Congress, however, decided to approve massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations when the economy was already healthy \u2013 not because they were addressing a policy need, but because they were fulfilling an ideological goal.\n\nAnd now that the deficit is spiraling, those same Republicans have decided that what the nation really needs is more tax breaks \u2013 none of which will be paid for \u2013 and cuts to Medicare and Social Security.", "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) recently found herself in an awkward position. As Election Day approached, polls showed the Republican governor narrowly behind her Democratic challenger in a year where Dems appeared likely to make gains in this Midwestern swing state.\n\nComplicating matters, Reynolds\u2019 campaign co-chair was right-wing Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), whose racist antics were drawing fire from within their party. If the governor denounced her ally, she risked alienating parts of the GOP base. If Reynolds voiced support for King, she risked alienating mainstream voters offended by the congressman\u2019s conduct.\n\nThe Iowa governor\u2019s solution? She tried to avoid King\u2019s mess and hoped voters would back her anyway. The strategy may have ruined Kim Reynolds\u2019 chances of ever winning a Profile in Courage Award, but it was enough to win the election: the governor prevailed by three points over Fred Hubbell (D).\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, now that the race is over, Reynolds feels empowered to show the kind of courage she was afraid to show before Iowans cast their ballots. The Des Moines Register reported yesterday:\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signaled Tuesday she\u2019s lost her patience with U.S. Rep. Steve King, who narrowly won a ninth term in the U.S. House last week despite a firestorm of criticism for aligning himself with far-right European politicians and repeatedly making remarks many have deemed racist. Reynolds, a Republican who defeated Democrat Fred Hubbell in a close race to win a full four-year term, offered a bluntly worded response when asked by a reporter if she had visited with King about a series of controversies he has been facing. Reynolds said she hasn\u2019t talked with the Iowa congressman because she has been busy since the election. But, she added, \u201cI think that Steve King needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else, and I think he needs to take a look at that.\u201d\n\nThis was apparently the most forceful Reynolds has been to date in her criticisms of the right-wing congressman. And while King\u2019s detractors will likely welcome the governor\u2019s comments, her timing is extraordinarily convenient.\n\nLast week, Steve King was Reynolds\u2019 campaign co-chair, whom she campaigned alongside just days before Election Day. This week, Reynolds isn\u2019t sure Steve King properly represents the values of his constituents in western Iowa.\n\nRemember, the week before Election Day, some GOP leaders were prepared to effectively cut King loose. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) publicly denounced the Iowan\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d antics, adding, \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.\u201d\n\nKim Reynolds could\u2019ve said something similar at the time. Instead, the governor waited until her criticisms couldn\u2019t hurt her own ambitions.", "De Blasio: NYC drove a hard bargain with Amazon copied!\n\nThis week, Amazon announced its second headquarters would be located in the Long Island City area of Queens in New York City and in Virginia.

He\u2019s threatening to fire much of his team. He\u2019s whining about the Secret Service. Some members of his team are publicly denouncing remarks from their own colleagues. After skipping a ceremony honoring fallen American soldiers who served in World War I, he blamed his aides \u201cfor not counseling him that skipping the cemetery visit would be a public-relations nightmare.\u201d\n\nBut to fully appreciate the level of dysfunction in this White House, consider the fact that First Lady Melania Trump is getting involved in national security personnel decisions.\n\nIn an extraordinary move for a first lady, Melania Trump\u2019s office on Tuesday publicly called for the firing of a senior National Security Council official. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s communications director issued a statement around 2:30 p.m. saying the official, Mira Ricardel, should no longer serve as the NSC\u2019s No. 2. \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nThat was weird, though the story got a little weirder.\n\nAfter Melania Trump\u2019s office publicly called for the ouster of the deputy national security adviser, a variety of news organizations reported that Mira Ricardel had, in fact, been fired. The West Wing soon after pushed back, insisting Ricardel was still in her position, working at her desk.\n\nWhile the back and forth was confusing, we weren\u2019t just dealing with rumors and off-the-record leaks: the First Lady really did issue an official statement calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing \u2013 a statement that, as of last night, the White House hadn\u2019t acted upon.\n\nIn case this isn\u2019t obvious, it\u2019s extraordinarily unusual for a president\u2019s spouse to try to exert influence over national security personnel decisions. It\u2019s nearly as odd for a First Lady to call for an aide\u2019s ouster, only to have nothing happen.\n\nLet\u2019s also note for context that Ricardel is the top deputy for National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2013 who, it just so happens, was out of the country yesterday when Melania Trump issued her statement.\n\nI can\u2019t say with any confidence how much longer Ricardel\u2019s career in the Trump administration will last \u2013 according to multiple accounts, she has more than a few detractors on Team Trump \u2013 but the fact that this drama is happening at all is indicative of a presidential operation that appears hopelessly lost.", "Ex-CIA officer pens 'How to Get Rid of a President' copied!\n\nDavid Priess is a former CIA officer, and he joins Morning Joe to discuss his new book 'How to Get Rid of a President' and what he learned from briefing Robert Mueller.\n\nRead More", "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), reflecting on the results of the midterm elections, apparently thought it\u2019d be a good idea to write an op-ed on his perspective. Naturally, he turned to Fox News, which published a piece under a rather extraordinary headline: \u201cWill Dems work with us, or simply put partisan politics ahead of the country?\u201d\n\nMuch of the Republican leader\u2019s pitch was predictable \u2013 McConnell believes his party has been \u201cprolific\u201d in its triumphs over the last two years \u2013 but it was the GOP senator\u2019s references to bipartisanship that made the op-ed seem as if it were intended to be satirical.\n\nI have good news: reports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated. [\u2026] And looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol. What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference? [\u2026] After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\n\nFor the record, McConnell didn\u2019t appear to be kidding.\n\nTaken at face value, stripped of any context or history, the Senate majority leader\u2019s rhetoric may seem like an olive branch of sorts. The week after Americans elected a Democratic-led House and a Republican-led Senate, there was Mitch McConnell stressing the virtues of \u201cbipartisanship,\u201d \u201cworking together,\u201d and \u201creaching across the aisle.\u201d What could possibly be wrong with that?\n\nThe answer lies in everything we know about the senior senator from Kentucky.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a column the Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank wrote last year, describing McConnell as the politician who effectively \u201cbroke America.\u201d\n\nNo man has done more in recent years to undermine the functioning of U.S. government. His has been the epitome of unprincipled leadership, the triumph of tactics in service of short-term power. [\u2026] McConnell is no idiot. He is a clever man who does what works for him in the moment, consequences be damned.\n\nAs we discussed in detail at the time, whether one finds McConnell\u2019s work outrageous is a matter of perspective. If you\u2019re a myopic Republican partisan, the GOP\u2019s Senate leader has simply taken every possible opportunity to maximize his party\u2019s interests, using the levers of power at his disposal. McConnell, to the best of my knowledge, hasn\u2019t committed any crimes in his partisan pursuits, so much as he pushed the limits in ways without precedent in the American tradition, ignoring any sense of norms or institutional limits.\n\nAnd to that end, McConnell has been quite successful.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not a myopic Republican partisan, and your principal concern is with the health of the American political system, McConnell\u2019s work has earned him a role as one of this generation\u2019s most consequential villains.\n\nIt was McConnell who changed Senate norms to require 60-vote supermajorities on every piece of legislation of any significance. It was McConnell who was responsible for creating the modern judicial confirmation wars. It was McConnell who spearheaded every recent attempt to derail campaign-finance reforms.\n\nIt was McConnell who cooked up an unprecedented scorched-earth scheme to undermine Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, deliberately refusing to consider any compromises \u2013 even if it meant rejecting his own ideas \u2013 in the hopes of trying to ensure that the Democratic president only served one term.\n\nIt was McConnell who imposed the first-ever, year-long blockade on any Supreme Court nominee. It was McConnell who was warned about Russia\u2019s illegal attack on the American election last year, only to scuttle efforts to address the crisis in the hopes of putting Moscow\u2019s candidate in the Oval Office.\n\nIt was McConnell who decided to shift with the political winds in order to advance his partisan crusade. Milbank added, \u201c[M]ost characteristic of McConnell is his tendency to shift his views to suit current exigencies (on the minimum wage, withdrawal from Iraq, earmarks, abortion, labor and civil rights) and his adroitness at gumming up the works: forcing clerks to spend hours reading a bill aloud on the floor; opposing immigration legislation he\u2019d encouraged; asking for a vote on a debt-ceiling proposal and then trying to filibuster it; urging the Obama administration to support a bipartisan debt commission and then voting against it.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t about issues or ideology, per se. My point isn\u2019t that McConnell is on the right, and I\u2019m on the left, so I\u2019m opposed to his vision and preferred policies. Rather, we\u2019re talking about politics on an institutional level. We can evaluate the Kentucky Republican\u2019s views on given issues on a case-by-case basis, but what makes McConnell so destructive is how he\u2019s pursued his priorities, not the priorities themselves.\n\nI don\u2019t blame McConnell for considering partisan advantage important; I blame him for prioritizing partisan advantage above literally every other consideration, including the health and sustainability of our political system. I\u2019m not bothered by his victories; I\u2019m bothered by what those victories have cost.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that McConnell took his pitch to Fox News, arguing that he believes Democrats are \u201cmore interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\u201d\n\nIf the Senate majority leader doesn\u2019t want to be laughed at, perhaps he should try a less ridiculous message.", "Troops deployed to border is a 'stunt', says Sen.

On Friday, Maine election officials started processing ballots for the state\u2019s first federal race to employ its new ranked-choice voting system, which goes into effect when no candidate receives a majority of votes.\n\nUnder this new system, voters rank the candidates they want in order of choice. Because neither Poliquin nor Golden received more than 50% of the vote, the ME-02 race enters an \u201cinstant runoff.\u201d Mainers in District 2 who voted for candidates other than Poliquin or Golden will now have their second, or even third, choice rankings counted. The system is largely believed to benefit Golden and it could be what tips the scales in his favor.\n\nMaine voters approved ranked-choice voting by a slim margin in 2016, and lawmakers reacted promptly. After a 2017 advisory opinion by the Maine Supreme Court said they would rule ranked-choice voting unconstitutional if it were brought to them, the Maine legislature voted to delay ranked-choice voting\u2019s implementation until 2021. Enraged supporters of ranked-choice voting organized quickly to add a people\u2019s veto about the legislature\u2019s delay to the June 2018 ballot. The veto passed, restoring ranked-choice to Maine just in time for this year\u2019s midterms.\n\nBut today, ranked-choice voting finds itself once again enmeshed in legal drama. With the system expected to propel Golden past the GOP incumbent, the Portland Press Herald reports that Poliquin has filed suit in federal court, trying to stop the Maine secretary of state from proceeding with the ranked-choice count.\n\nIn his complaint, Poliquin asserts he has a \u201cconstitutional right to have federal election returns counted in accordance with traditional \u2013 and constitutional \u2013 procedures.\u201d\n\nWhat will come of the lawsuit, we don\u2019t yet know, but the timing is raising eyebrows. Poliquin, a sitting congressman, is challenging a state law\u2014twice approved by voters\u2014after the election, once it appeared ranked-choice voting would favor his opponent.\n\nAs the battle in Maine\u2019s 2nd continues to unfold, the outcome is likely to have national reverberations. If Golden were to win, it would not only be another Democratic House pickup, but it also would make him the first member of Congress to win through ranked-choice voting\u2014a system some see as the future of democracy and others decry as unnecessarily complicated and unconstitutional.", "'This is the most unsettled moment': John Brennan on Trump\u2019s post-midterms fury copied!\n\nFormer CIA Director and MSNBC analyst John Brennan sounds off on Trump\u2019s DOJ shake-up, White House chaos and Trump\u2019s latest foray on the world stage\n\nRead More", "Cindy Hyde-Smith repeatedly refuses to elaborate on 'public hanging' comments copied!\n\nKasie Hunt and the MTP Daily panel discuss Cindy Hyde-Smith's 'public hanging' comments, and how her strategy in the aftermath is typical Trump-style politics\n\nRead More", "Sources say Corsi one of nearly 12 Stone associates summoned by Mueller copied!\n\nSources say conspiracy theorist and Roger Stone ally Jerome Corsi was one of nearly 12 Stone associates that were summoned by Mueller.\n\nRead More", "Democrat Stacey Abrams says she cannot win Georgia governor's race, but does not concede 01:19", "Sen.-elect Rosen: \u2018We need to protect the Mueller investigation\u2019 copied!\n\nSenator-elect Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) joins MTP Daily to discuss whether Democrats should embrace progressivism and whether the midterm elections were a referendum on President Trump.\n\nRead More", "Today\u2019s edition of quick hits:\n\n* California: \u201cThirteen bodies have been found in Northern California in the wake of the deadly Camp Fire, bringing the death toll in the blaze to 42, authorities said Monday.

Moulton: There's no reason we shouldn't send new people to the top 05:09", "Voters in Bay County in Florida\u2019s panhandle, as expected, heavily supported Republican candidates, with more than 72% of locals supporting Ron DeSantis\u2019 (R) gubernatorial campaign and nearly 74% backing Rick Scott\u2019s (R) U.S. Senate campaign.\n\nThere is some question, however, about whether some of those votes were consistent with Florida\u2019s election laws. Politico reported yesterday:\n\nThe election supervisor in hurricane-wracked Bay County allowed some voters to illegally cast ballots by email \u2013 an act specifically prohibited by Gov. Rick Scott when he issued an emergency order to expand voting opportunities there after the storm. Despite the prohibition, Bay County Election Supervisor Mark Andersen says he stands by his decision in the Republican-rich county after Hurricane Michael. In all, he said, 147 voters returned ballots through email but only 10 were purely email-to-email interactions. In the other cases, voters used fax machines to email their ballots in, which is currently permitted by state law for overseas voters.\n\nObviously, circumstances matter. Bay County was hit hard by Hurricane Michael, and local communities are still struggling to recover. Officials in the area made a conscious choice to \u2013 let\u2019s be charitable \u2013 bend the rules, allowing some voters in the country to cast ballots in ways that fall outside state election laws.\n\nMy point is not that those voters should be punished or that their votes should be discounted. I am curious, though, about Republicans\u2019 apparent disinterest in how Bay County administered the election.\n\nRick Scott, for example, has been only too pleased to peddle absurd conspiracy theories about \u201cwidespread fraud\u201d in south Florida, specifically in counties that vote heavily Democratic. The Republican\u2019s claims, echoed by Donald Trump, quickly fell apart when Scott was asked to substantiate his allegations.\n\nBut about 500 miles to the north, we can now say with some certainty that voters in a heavily Republican district did, in fact, cast ballots in ways that conflict with Florida law.\n\nI remain a count-every-ballot guy, but wouldn\u2019t it be nice to see some constituency from leading GOP officials? Where\u2019s Rick Scott denouncing Bay County for deliberately circumventing the state\u2019s election laws?\n\nKevin Rader, a Democratic state senator whose district includes parts of Palm Beach and Broward counties, argued to Politico, \u201cWhy does this supervisor in this county not have to follow the law?

Donald Trump, who sees himself as something of an expert in matters of finance, was only too pleased to offer his assessment of the day\u2019s trading.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!\u201d the Republican wrote on Twitter.\n\nAh, yes. The president wants Americans to believe that investors, six days after Democrats won a House majority, suddenly realized that at some point next year, Congress may examine some of Donald Trump\u2019s scandals, and this led to a significant Wall Street selloff, months ahead of the first House hearing.\n\nNo, seriously, that\u2019s the president\u2019s argument. As the Washington Post noted, however, it\u2019s clearly not a good argument.\n\n[I]t\u2019s pretty silly to blame any single event for stock-market jitters. The technology sector fell after a key Apple supplier, Lumentum Holdings, cut its earnings and revenue outlook after it said a major customer \u2013 believed to be Apple \u2013 significantly reduced its orders for laser diodes. The announcement sent Lumentum down 33 percent, and many other tech stocks fell as well. This is just the latest warning sign in the once-sizzling tech sector. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is down more than 10 percent since the beginning of October. Meanwhile, investors were also reacting to the news that Saudi Arabia said it would cut its oil production. (Perhaps recognizing this connection, Trump later tweeted that the Saudis should not do that.) Another thing hanging over the market: Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nIt\u2019s amusing, of course, to see Trump adopt a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose posture toward Wall Street: when stocks go up, the president demands credit; when stocks go down, he insists Democrats get the blame.\n\nBut let\u2019s not miss the forest for the trees: Trump sure does seem nervous about congressional oversight.\n\nLast week, during a White House press conference, the president suggested he\u2019d refuse to work with Congress on substantive issues if the new House Democratic majority investigated any of his scandals. Trump effectively asked Dems to choose between legislating and conducting oversight \u2013 because in his mind, it has to be one or the other.\n\nA week later, Trump argued that the mere possibility of oversight at some point in the future caused a significant drop in Wall Street.\n\nObviously, the arguments are foolish on a substantive level, but the subtext is what matters: the president is preoccupied with the dangers posed by congressional scrutiny.\n\nI wonder why that is.\n\nPostscript: For the record, congressional Republicans did exhaustive oversights of the Clinton and Obama administrations.

Because despite the president\u2019s limitless confidence about his perceived triumph, reality keeps getting in the way. The New York Times reported yesterday:\n\nNorth Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program at 16 hidden bases that have been identified in new commercial satellite images, a network long known to American intelligence agencies but left undiscussed as President Trump claims to have neutralized the North\u2019s nuclear threat. The satellite images suggest that the North has been engaged in a great deception: It has offered to dismantle a major launching site \u2013 a step it began, then halted \u2013 while continuing to make improvements at more than a dozen others that would bolster launches of conventional and nuclear warheads. The existence of the ballistic missile bases, which North Korea has never acknowledged, contradicts Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that his landmark diplomacy is leading to the elimination of a nuclear and missile program that the North had warned could devastate the United States.\n\nNBC News published a similar report soon after, noting North Korea\u2019s ongoing work on its ballistic missile program, and highlighting a separate analysis by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, provided exclusively to NBC News, which described \u201ca secret military base deep in North Korea\u2019s interior that analysts believe could house missiles capable of reaching the United States.\u201d\n\nAll of this comes about a month after Trump describes his relationship with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un, and the recent negotiations he\u2019s had with the brutal dictator.\n\n\u201cI was really being tough \u2013 and so was he,\u201d the Republican told a West Virginia audience. \u201cAnd we would go back and forth. And then we fell in love, okay? No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters, and they\u2019re great letters. We fell in love.\u201d\n\nEvidently, those great letters left out a few things.\n\nIt seemed obvious from the outset that Donald Trump was making a mistake by prematurely claiming a triumph on North Korea. Despite the circumstances, though, as regular readers know, the American president assured the world that he\u2019d \u201csolved\u201d the problem posed by the rogue nuclear state, to the point that North Korea is no longer a threat.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem,\u201d Trump declared last month. \u201cNo longer \u2013 sleep well tonight!\u201d\n\nAll of this rhetoric seemed misguided at the time. It seems a little worse now.", "Donald Trump\u2019s trip to France to honor the 100th anniversary of World War I was not a success. In fact, as we discussed yesterday, the American president seemed to go out of his way to pick a fight before the international gathering even began in earnest, publishing a tweet on Friday accusing French President Emmanuel Macron of suggesting \u201cthat Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s remarks, Trump added, were \u201cvery insulting.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the Republican took steps to keep the fight going with this tweet.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\u201d\n\nTrump soon followed with a series of related tweets, slamming France on trade and criticizing Macron\u2019s approval rating. For reasons that I won\u2019t even try to explain, the Republican wrapped up his little tantrum by declaring, in an all-caps missive, \u201cMake France Great Again!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s note for context that France today is recognizing the three-year anniversary of an ISIS terrorist attack in Paris that killed 130 people. Whether or not the American president is aware of this is unclear, but Trump picked an unusually ill-timed day to squabble with our French friends.\n\nWhile it\u2019s generally wise to look past Trump\u2019s borderline-incoherent tweets, when an American president tries to initiate a feud with one of the United States\u2019 closest allies, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to understand why.\n\nAs is often the case, the root problem appears to be Trump\u2019s confusion. Macron did not, in fact, call for a European military force to protect the continent against the United States. Since the United States has no enemies in Europe, this wouldn\u2019t make sense.\n\nThe Washington Post explained what the French president actually said.\n\nTrump\u2019s interpretation of Macron\u2019s remarks is factually misleading, and comes from an interview Macron gave to France\u2019s Europe 1 radio several days before Trump\u2019s arrival. What Macron said has been largely echoed by European Union leaders for months now, and in fact mimics the same demand Trump has long made: Europe needs to stop relying on the United States for its own defense. \u201cI believe in the project of a sovereign Europe. We won\u2019t protect Europe if we don\u2019t decide to have a true European army. In front of Russia, which is at our borders and which can be threatening, I would like to start a security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect and which is European,\u201d Macron told Europe 1. \u201cWe have to have a Europe that can defend itself alone \u2014 and without only relying on the United States \u2014 in a more sovereign manner,\u201d he added.\n\nThese comments, which Trump should agree with, are apparently the basis for the Republican\u2019s incessant whining. Macron stressed the importance of European self-reliance; Trump thought it was an anti-American posture; and the result was a series of misguided tweets.\n\nHere\u2019s my question: is there no one at the White House who explained reality to the president, or did Trump simply not understand his latest foreign policy briefing?", "Mich. women didn't win due to 'novelty': Sen.

My imagination conjured images of Trump in the White House, placing the medal around the necks of Ted Nugent, Alex Jones, and Roseanne Barr.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether reality is better or worse than what I imagined.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor \u2013 to the wife of one of the Republican Party\u2019s most prominent patrons, the White House announced Saturday. Miriam Adelson will receive the medal along with six other \u201cdistinguished individuals\u201d at a ceremony on Friday, the White House said. She is married to billionaire Las Vegas casino magnate and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson, who joined Trump for a watch party at the White House residence on Tuesday evening to monitor the incoming returns from the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAs Politico\u2019s report added, the other 2018 honorees include Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), former football player and retired Minnesota Supreme Court justice Alan Page, Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach, and, posthumously, singer Elvis Presley, baseball great Babe Ruth, and former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nBut it\u2019s Adelson whose name stands out.\n\nRemember, it was the Adelsons who contributed more than $113 million to Republican causes in just this election cycle. In the last election cycle, no one, other than the president himself, donated more money to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign than Sheldon and Miriam Adelson.\n\nSure, it\u2019s possible that White House officials were so impressed with Miriam Adelson\u2019s philanthropic work that they felt compelled to honor her with a Medal of Freedom, but under the circumstances, they also must\u2019ve realized that a move like this, especially in light of Trump\u2019s other corruption allegations, would raise some questions about propriety.\n\nThe president did it anyway.\n\nThe Washington Post added in an analysis yesterday that Adelson\u2019s medal \u201creflects a growing pattern: one of Trump awarding a large majority of such medals and even pardons to supporters, to Republicans, and to recipients who fit his political agenda.\u201d\n\nThe news also comes exactly one month after we learned of Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to lobby Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on behalf of Adelson\u2019s business interests.\n\nDuring the Republican presidential primaries three years ago, Sheldon Adelson reportedly favored Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for the GOP nomination, which annoyed Trump. The New York Republican tweeted at the time, \u201cSheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!\u201d\n\nWho looks like the perfect little puppet now?", "Sen. Gillibrand to consider 2020, says Trump should resign copied!\n\nSen.

Three red-state Democratic incumbents had lost, another was trailing in Montana, and the GOP candidate was ahead in Arizona\u2019s open-seat contest.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Donald Trump held a press conference in which he boasted, in reference to the upper chamber, \u201c[W]e picked up a lot\u2026. Fifty-five is the largest number of Republican senators in the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nAs a factual matter, that wasn\u2019t even close to being true. There was, for example, a 55-member GOP Senate majority as recently as 2006, which wasn\u2019t exactly a century ago.\n\nBut it was also wrong because the Republican majority in the Senate next year won\u2019t have 55 members. Sen. Jon Tester (D) ended up prevailing in Montana, and as we learned last night, the Arizona race worked out in Democrats\u2019 favor, too.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is the apparent winner in the Arizona Senate race, narrowly defeating Republican Rep. Martha McSally, according to NBC News. As of Monday night, Sinema had 1,097,321 votes, or 49.68 percent, while McSally had 1,059,124 votes, or 47.96 percent.\n\nAt 42, Sinema will be the Senate\u2019s youngest woman. She\u2019ll also be the first ever openly bisexual U.S. senator, Arizona\u2019s first woman senator, and the first Democratic senator elected in Arizona since the 1980s.\n\nThe national reverberations of the outcome are already significant.\n\nFor example, thanks to Sinema\u2019s victory, the Senate will be even more closely divided than expected. With one Senate race unsolved, and one Senate special election still remaining, the Republicans\u2019 net gain in the chamber currently stands at zero \u2013 the GOP had 51 seats going into Election Day, and at least for now, it has 51 seats going into the next Congress.\n\nThat\u2019s likely to change fairly soon, with Republicans relatively well positioned in Florida and Mississippi, but even if both races end up in the GOP\u2019s favor, that would give Republicans a net gain of two for the cycle and a three-seat majority next year \u2013 creating a 53-47 chamber \u2013 smaller than the president\u2019s boast last week, and smaller than what the National Republican Senatorial Committee expected as recently as a month ago.\n\nThis will matter, of course, when it comes to governing in the next Congress, but it will also make it slightly less daunting for Democrats when looking ahead to the 2020 election cycle.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has another reason to be bothered by the election results. The candidate he endorsed in Arizona lost and the candidate he attacked won \u2013 all in a state he won two years ago.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump bragged last week, in reference to a question about congressional retirements, \u201cIn Jeff Flake\u2019s case, it\u2019s me. Pure and simple. I retired him. I\u2019m very proud of it. I did the country a great service.\u201d\n\nAnd now Jeff Flake\u2019s seat has flipped from \u201cred\u201d to \u201cblue.\u201d\n\nAs for McSally \u2013 who lost her own U.S. House district during her Senate race \u2013 there\u2019s still a chance she\u2019ll end up in the Senate anyway. Appointed Sen. Jon Kyl (R) is serving in the late Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R) seat, but Kyl isn\u2019t expected to stick around, and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) will need to appoint someone else.
