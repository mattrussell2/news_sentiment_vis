Matt Shea acknowledged Wednesday he had distributed a four-page manifesto titled \u201cBiblical Basis for War,\u201d which describes the Christian God as a \u201cwarrior,\u201d details the composition and strategies of a \u201cHoly Army\u201d and condemns abortion and same-sex marriage. The document is organized in 14 sections with multiple tiers of bullet points and a smattering of biblical citations. Under one heading, \u201cRules of War,\u201d it makes a chilling prescription for enemies who flout \u201cbiblical law.\u201d It states, \u201cIf they do not yield \u2013 kill all males.\u201d\n\nI happened to write a post on Shea back in 2013 when he urged like-minded folks to stock up on thousands of rounds of ammunition. (He also warned at the time of government-imposed FEMA concentration camps.)\n\nWhen the GOP lawmaker\u2019s \u201cmanifesto\u201d generated attention this week, Shea appeared in a Facebook Live video in which he defended his work as \u201ca series of sermons on biblical war in the Old Testament as part of a larger discussion on the history of warfare.\u201d\n\nIn the same video, however, the Washington official described the United States as \u201ca Christian nation,\u201d while dismissing his critics as \u201cMarxists\u201d and \u201cIslamists.\u201d\n\nMy friend Rob Boston explained yesterday, \u201cMany people active in the Religious Right long to use their religion to tell the rest of us what to do, although they deny that when pressed. The Reconstructionists are at least honest enough to say it upfront. Shea\u2019s manifesto is more of the same. It\u2019s an insistence that the Bible (as interpreted by a small band of far-right fundamentalists) provides justification for whatever these folks want to do \u2013 and that usually involves them running everyone else\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nAs for what\u2019s next for Shea, the local NBC affiliates reported that his \u201cmanifesto\u201d came to the attention of Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich, \u201cwho says he immediately alerted the FBI saying he felt the author, Shea, was dangerous.\u201d\n\nAlso from the God Machine this week:\n\n* The kind of story that gives me hope: \u201cA Muslim American group has raised more than $200,000 through an online crowdfunding campaign to help families affected by the Oct. 27 mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which killed at least 11. CelebrateMercy, one of the organizers of the campaign, told NBC News that the money will assist families with medical bills, funeral expenses and other immediate and short-term needs.\u201d\n\n* A striking editorial move: \u201cAs funeral services for those killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting continued into a third day Friday, the city\u2019s newspaper paid tribute to the victims with a Jewish prayer on its front page, spoken in ancient Aramaic and written in Hebrew script. The Pittsburgh Post Gazette\u2019s headline, a portion of a Jewish mourner\u2019s prayer, read: \u2018Magnified and sanctified be Your name,\u2019 according to the paper.\u201d\n\n* This may seem a little obscure, but the dispute over the \u201cPeace Cross\u201d is going to be a big church-state case: \u201cThe Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether a 40-foot cross in the median of a busy suburban Maryland highway is a secular memorial to those who died during World War I or an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion.\u201d\n\n* And speaking of interesting legal fights: \u201cA lawyer for religious groups on Wednesday defended in federal court a 64-year-old tax break that grants priests, rabbis and imams tax-free housing allowances \u2013 costing the Treasury of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\u201d\n\n* The New York Times asked young evangelical readers \u201cabout the relationship between their faith and their politics.\u201d The request generated some interesting responses.\n\n* The latest in a series of setbacks: \u201cThe Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC says five of its most valuable artifacts \u2013 once thought to be part of the historic Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 are fake and will not be displayed anymore. German-based scholars tested the fragments and found that five \u2018show characteristics inconsistent with ancient origin and therefore will no longer be displayed at the museum.\u2019\u201d", "Watch the full episode of Friday night's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}", "", "Watch the full episode of Friday night's The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}}", "Programming Note!
