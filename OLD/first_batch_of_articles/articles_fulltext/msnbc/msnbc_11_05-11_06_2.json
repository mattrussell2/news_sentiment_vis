When did you ever hear that from a politician? Maybe never. Never.\u201d\n\nWell, I imagine we\u2019ve never heard that from a politician because it\u2019s literally impossible. Trump has kept more promises than he\u2019s made? Huh? A prerequisite to keeping a promise is making a promise.\n\nSure, plenty of his boasts are strange, but this one was a special treat because it failed as a matter of fact and logic.\n\nComplicating matters, of course, is the fact that this isn\u2019t an area about which the president should feel confident. Indeed, as we discussed last month, the idea that Trump has honored his campaign pledges is folly.\n\nRemember when Trump promised to get Mexico to pay for a border wall? How about his promise to shrink the deficit and balance the budget? Or maybe his assurances that he\u2019d repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something that would cover everyone at a lower cost? Or how about his vow to push a $1 trillion infrastructure package? Each of these promises were pillars of Candidate Trump\u2019s message, and each have been broken.\n\nTrump said he\u2019d shield entitlements from cuts.

He said he\u2019d combat corruption in D.C. and reduce the influence of special-interest lobbyists.\n\nTrump may be convinced he\u2019s kept more promises than he\u2019s made, but the question he should consider is whether he\u2019s broken more promises than he\u2019s kept.", "Kara Swisher: Everyone is going to drop a dime on Facebook now 09:46", "Today\u2019s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country.\n\n* Gallup doesn\u2019t do a lot of horse-race polling anymore, but its final pre-election survey found Democrats leading Republicans on the generic congressional ballot, 54% to 43%, among likely voters.\n\n* At a rally in New Jersey yesterday, Republican Senate hopeful Bob Hugin was quoted saying, \u201cThis election is about who gets the vote out and who doesn\u2019t \u2013 and I hope it rains hard tomorrow.\u201d It is, in fact, expected to rain across much of the East coast today.\n\n* At Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Missouri last night, the president was joined on stage by two Fox News hosts, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro.

Evidently, he\u2019s running away from the state he\u2019s helped lead for eight years. The Portland Press Herald reported yesterday:\n\nGov.

To arrive at this, the RNC chair had to play a misleading game: she counted the early months of the Obama presidency, when the Great Recession \u2013 which began more than a year before Obama took office \u2013 was still causing the economy to hemorrhage jobs.\n\nIn other words, McDaniel peddled a line that included a kernel of truth, but which was fundamentally misleading. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). perhaps enjoying his status as a partisan celebrity a bit too much, abandoned the pretense of accuracy altogether yesterday.\n\n\u201cIf [Barack Obama\u2019s] jobs numbers were anywhere close to what we\u2019re talking about with President [Donald Trump], the media would stop the Earth from rotating to make sure everybody heard about it!\u201d\n\nIn one unfortunate tweet, Republican senator managed to tie together a falsehood, whining about the media, and shameless Trump flattery. I\u2019m sure the White House was delighted.\n\nBut no one else should be. Ahead of the election, Republicans haven\u2019t done much to emphasize the economy \u2013 the GOP strategy is based almost entirely on fear \u2013 but when they turn to jobs, they insist that Trump\u2019s record trumps Obama\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s not even close to being true. Let\u2019s dig into the available data.\n\nTrump has been in office for 21 full months. During that time, the U.S. economy, according to Trump\u2019s own Department of Labor Statistics, has added 4,054,000 jobs. What\u2019s wrong with that? Nothing. It\u2019s a perfectly respectable number, reflecting a healthy job market. It\u2019s debatable how much credit this White House deserves for the total, but if Republicans want to brag about the figure, that\u2019s understandable.\n\nBut in the last 21 months of the Obama presidency, the economy added 4,477,000 jobs. The arithmetic is unambiguous: job growth has slowed a bit since Trump took office.\n\nThat\u2019s not opinion; that\u2019s math.\n\nPerhaps, the president and his followers will argue, it\u2019s better to look at year-by-year job growth. Fine, let\u2019s do that, too. Trump\u2019s first year in office was, according to his Labor Department, the worst year for job creation since Obama\u2019s first term. Trump\u2019s second year in office looks quite a bit better, but with two months remaining, monthly averages in 2018 are behind where we were at this point in 2014 and 2015.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t about political spin. I\u2019m just talking about apples-to-apples comparisons based on arithmetic \u2013 from official data released from the Trump administration.\n\nYes, lazy partisans can focus on the jobs crisis Obama inherited in 2009, incorporate those early months into some broader averages, and paint a misleading picture, but that\u2019s no way to have a meaningful conversation.\n\nIt was therefore odd to see Lindsey Graham \u2013 who\u2019s been around long enough to know better \u2013 argue that Obama\u2019s job numbers aren\u2019t even \u201cclose\u201d to Trump\u2019s.\n\nThe questions for the senator and other Trump sycophants remain the same: why was the job market stronger across much of Obama\u2019s second term than it is now? Why were the 21 months before Trump\u2019s inauguration better for American job growth than the 21 months since Trump\u2019s inauguration?\n\nAnd to borrow Graham\u2019s phrasing, why aren\u2019t more people stopping the Earth from rotating to make sure everybody hears about it?", "Suburban Detroit voters speak on key election issues copied!\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Mariana Atencio speaks to voters at a polling location in Troy, Michigan, gauging their top national and local issues of concern.\n\nRead More", "California firefighters to Trump: 'You are wrong' about wildfires", "Midterm elections & the historical indicators that follow copied!\n\nThe midterms are a political tradition that goes back to 1790.

The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare.\u201d Just over the last week, the president has repeated this, practically word for word, in West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, and Indiana.\n\nThe rhetoric is, of course, wrong \u2013 and not altogether coherent. Expanding Medicare to include the rest of the country is not \u201cobliterating\u201d the system. For that matter, it\u2019s odd to hear the Republican pretend to champion Medicare and condemn Medicare as \u201csocialism\u201d at the same time.\n\nLast night in Missouri, however, Trump switched things up a bit. From the transcript:\n\n\u201cIf Democrats gain power on Tuesday, one of their very first projects will be a socialist takeover of American health care. You know what\u2019s happening. And your taxes are going to triple, maybe quadruple. You\u2019re not going to be happy. I know you well. \u201cThe Democrat plan would obliterate Obamacare. It will also \u2013 which is good \u2013 but leave the bad parts behind.\u201d\n\nYes, on the eve of a critical midterm election cycle, Donald Trump warned voters that Democrats intend to tear down their own health care law, which the president has spent much of the last two years trying to tear down.\n\nAfter reading the transcripts of every other speech Trump has delivered for a while, I have a hunch he just slipped. The president probably meant to say Democrats would \u201cobliterate Medicare\u201d \u2013 which is also wrong \u2013 but he accidentally said \u201cObamacare\u201d instead.\n\nTrump could\u2019ve easily paused to correct himself, but to do so would\u2019ve meant admitting a mistake. Instead, he pretended that he meant to say that, and then tried to quickly come up with a rationalization, saying it\u2019s a \u201cgood\u201d thing that Democrats would \u201cobliterate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, though those rascally Dems apparently intend to \u201cleave the bad parts behind.\u201d\n\nWhat \u201cparts\u201d?

Remember that?\u201d the former president said. \u201cThey have gone to Washington and just plundered away. In Washington, they have racked up enough indictments to field a football team. Nobody in my administration got indicted. So how is it that they cleaned things up?\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric generated spirited applause, so Obama has repeated this, practically word for word, at other events.\n\nMarc Short, up until recently Donald Trump\u2019s director of legislative affairs, appeared on CNN yesterday and told co-host Alisyn Camerota that Obama\u2019s rhetoric should be seen as out of bounds.\n\nCAMEROTA: What incendiary, toxic language is Barack Obama using? SHORT: He\u2019s talking about the rationale \u2013 so many people in the Trump administration having indictments as never before, that this is an unusual \u2013 CAMEROTA: That\u2019s true.\n\nWait, joking about Team Trump\u2019s many indictments has somehow become an example of \u201ctoxic\u201d rhetoric?\n\nI realize that the circumstances are embarrassing for the president and his allies. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman is now a convicted felon. So is Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman. And Trump\u2019s former personal attorney. And Trump\u2019s former White House national security adviser.

According to Marc Short, Obama is drawing attention to how unusual it is for a president\u2019s team to have quite so many convicted felons, which is a bridge too far.\n\nThis is difficult to take seriously.

Joe Donnelly (D).\n\nBut the way in which the current president acknowledged his immediate predecessor was a little unusual.\n\nTrump also criticized Donnelly for planning to campaign with former President Barack Obama in northwest Indiana this Sunday.

The Republican president, even now, still sees political value in tactics like these. Pointing out Barack Obama\u2019s middle name, in Trump\u2019s mind, serves to denigrate his predecessor, criticize officials like Donnelly, and perhaps most importantly, generate excitement among GOP voters.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of this going around. A Washington Post analysis added yesterday, \u201cPresident Trump appears to be banking on his party retaining control of the Senate or even gaining seats. To do so, and presumably in an effort to goose Republican turnout broadly in hopes of averting disaster in the House, he is increasingly surfacing an often-submerged bit of political rhetoric: Vote Republican to protect white America.\u201d\n\nAt first blush, it\u2019s tempting to emphasize what electoral strategies like these tell us about Donald Trump, his character, and his years-long record of exploiting racial tensions to advance his interests.\n\nBut as important as this is, we\u2019re also learning quite a bit about what Trump thinks of Republican voters. We are, after all, talking about election-season messaging: the president has voiced public concerns for months about his party\u2019s rank-and-file supporters feeling unmotivated ahead of today\u2019s midterm elections, which led Trump to look for ways to get them excited.\n\nThe president chose one topic above all others: race.

We tend to think of men voting Republican, which is generally correct, though men with degrees prefer Democrats by a narrow margin. Likewise, Dems enjoy a significant lead among women, but this poll suggests women without degrees easily prefer Republicans.\n\nThe gender gap is clearly one of the year\u2019s biggest stories, and if Democrats gain power after the midterms, it will be the direct result of women voters coming through for Democratic candidates.\n\nBut the NBC/WSJ data suggests gender only tells part of the story.\n\nPostscript: This is largely consistent with the recent trend: two years ago, Hillary Clinton easily won among voters with college degrees, while Donald Trump easily won among voters without college degrees.", "How will Trump's rhetoric impact the midterms? copied!\n\nRepublican strategist Al Cardenas laments the president's use immigrants to stoke fear in voters ahead of the midterms.

He also declined to put a hold on the case, which would have blocked the challengers from seeking evidence about his hotel business through the legal process known as discovery.\n\nThere are multiple legal disputes surrounding Trump and his emoluments troubles, but this case, brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C., appears to be the most serious for the president \u2013 and as of Friday, it isn\u2019t going away.\n\nThere are a couple of angles of interest, including some of the details of Friday\u2019s court order, but let\u2019s start by recapping what makes the case so interesting.\n\nAs we discussed in July, the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause prevents U.S. officials from receiving payments from foreign governments, which traditionally hasn\u2019t posed much of a problem for sitting presidents. But as is often the case, things get a little tricky with Trump: because the president has refused to divest from his private-sector enterprises, it means he continues to profit from businesses that receive payments from foreign governments.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t theoretical: Saudi Arabia, for example, spent roughly $270,000 at Trump\u2019s Washington hotel during one of the country\u2019s lobbying campaigns last year. Some of that money directly benefited the president.\n\nWhich, not surprisingly, creates a legal problem that\u2019s now being litigated.\n\nWhen the attorneys general of Maryland and D.C. filed suit, they had to clear some hurdles that could\u2019ve scuttled their case. For example, a judge had to agree they had the necessary standing to even file the case, and they cleared that hurdle in March.\n\nThe plaintiffs then had to prove that the Emoluments Clause applied to this kind of presidential private-sector venture. The judge sided in their favor on this, too.\n\nSo now what? As the NBC News report explained, the judge on Friday ordered lawyers for Maryland and D.C. \u201cto submit a schedule for discovery within 20 days.\u201d That opens up a variety of interesting possibilities: the plaintiffs want to \u201cinterview Trump Organization employees and search company records to determine which foreign countries have spent money at Trump\u2019s hotel in downtown Washington.\u201d\n\nBut also of interest was a tidbit the judge included in his court order on Friday. The Washington Post reported over the weekend:\n\nMessitte noted Trump\u2019s threats to sue author Michael Wolff and former adviser Stephen K. Bannon, and Trump\u2019s taunting of former CIA director John Brennan in August. After Trump revoked Brennan\u2019s security clearance, Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cI hope John Brennan, the worst CIA Director in our country\u2019s history, brings a lawsuit.\u201d \u201cIt bears noting that the President himself seems to have had little reluctance to pursue personal litigation despite the supposed distractions it imposes on his office,\u201d Messitte wrote.\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s lawyers have said the president shouldn\u2019t have to deal with litigation like this because the office of the presidency leaves him with so little time. The judge responded by pointing to Trump\u2019s many tweets in which he invited litigation \u2013 effectively discrediting his own attorneys\u2019 argument.\n\nIt\u2019s not even close to being the first time the president\u2019s own words have been used against him in court. As regular readers know, this keeps happening:\n\n* In January, the administration lost a DACA case, and the court ruling cited the president\u2019s own rhetoric when ruling against his position.\n\n* In Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s case, the judge indicated that he would consider Trump\u2019s record of highly provocative rhetoric towards Bergdahl as part of the sentencing decision.\n\n* The initial versions of the White House\u2019s Muslim ban faced repeated legal difficulties because of Trump\u2019s own rhetoric.\n\n* The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded over the summer that Democratic attorneys general could participate in a case over health care policy as a result of Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n* The administration\u2019s lawyers ran into the same problem last April trying to defend Trump\u2019s executive order on so-called \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d\n\n* And in March 2018, Trump lost another DACA case in part because of his own rhetoric.\n\nIn a way, Trump\u2019s opponents should probably hope he never stops speaking his mind so freely.", "When former Virginia Sen. John Warner (R) endorsed Sen. Tim Kaine\u2019s (D) re-election, it raised a few eyebrows. After all, the former five-term senator is a giant of Virginia Republican politics, and it wasn\u2019t long ago that it seemed implausible he\u2019d throw his support behind one of Virginia\u2019s most notable Democrats.\n\nBut as it turns out, he wasn\u2019t done. Warner then endorsed Leslie Cockburn, the Democrat in Virginia\u2019s competitive 5th congressional district, and late last week, he made another surprise announcement.\n\nFormer Virginia GOP Sen. John Warner tells NBC News he is endorsing several Democrats for Congress in 2018, including Abigail Spanberger, who is challenging GOP Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia\u2019s seventh congressional district. Now is the time to rise above politics, Warner, a dean of the Virginia Republican Party, told NBC News. \u201cIt goes beyond politics now. I\u2019m a Republican, I\u2019ll finish a Republican as I cruise through my 91st year. But you\u2019ve got to put the nation\u2019s interests and the state\u2019s interests ahead of politics,\u201d Warner told NBC in a phone interview.\n\nAll of this comes just two years after Warner also endorsed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re retired and doing what you want to do, you\u2019re free of any constraints,\u201d Warner added in his NBC News interview. \u201cI just feel that the Democrats have got superior credentials to what is being offered.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll learn soon enough whether the former GOP senator\u2019s backing helped sway some votes or not, but I think Warner\u2019s willingness to throw his backing behind Democratic candidates speaks to a larger truth.\n\nIf \u201990s-era fringe Republicans have become today\u2019s conservative Republicans, and \u201990s-era conservatives have become today\u2019s GOP moderates, what have \u201990s-era moderate Republicans become?\n\nEvidently, Democratic voters.", "GOP telling lies about health care: Sen.

Donald Trump\u2019s public response has gone a long way to reinforce concerns about the president\u2019s capacity for empathy: he criticized the temple\u2019s security measures; he echoed the suspected murderer\u2019s conspiracy theories; he made a visit to the city all about him; and he connected the violence to his campaign agenda.\n\nHis private response wasn\u2019t much better. The Washington Post reported overnight on Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto (D) and his efforts to help in the aftermath of the mass-shooting. Of particular interest was the phone call the mayor received the day of the massacre.\n\nThe three-minute phone call with the president jarred Peduto, 54, the popular second-term Democratic mayor of the Steel City, just as he was trying to get his head around what was happening. After offering thoughts and prayers \u2013 and pledging anything Peduto needed, including a direct line to the White House \u2013 Trump veered directly into policy, Peduto recalled. The president, Peduto said, insisted on discussing harsher death penalty legislation as a way to prevent such atrocities. Peduto was stunned into silence. \u201cI\u2019m literally standing two blocks from 11 bodies right now. Really?\u201d Peduto said, noting that he was numb and believed that talking about the death penalty wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing to bring them back or deter what had just happened\u2026. I ended the conversation pretty quickly after that.\u201d\n\nThis version of events is very easy to believe. In a brief Q&A with reporters just a couple of hours after the murders in Pittsburgh, a reporter asked Trump what can be done to address violence like this. \u201cI think one thing we should is we should stiffen up our laws in terms of the death penalty,\u201d the president replied.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine Trump saying something similar to the Pittsburgh mayor as he struggled to find his footing.\n\nIt\u2019s also not hard to understand why it wasn\u2019t a constructive topic of conversation.\n\nTo be sure, when a president calls a local leader to discuss a tragedy of this magnitude, it\u2019s going to be a difficult conversation. But common sense suggests there\u2019s an obvious course for a president to follow: extend condolences, offer support, and pledge federal assistance.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to initiate a conversation about new legislation on capital punishment \u2013 over which a city mayor would have no control.\n\nThe missing element, of course, is empathy. And as we\u2019ve discussed on several occasions, it\u2019s a quality missing from Trump\u2019s skill-set.\n\nFor example, in June, the president traveled to Texas to extend his support to families who\u2019d lost loved ones in a school shooting. Trump spoke to one grieving mother about his desire to dispatch armed security to schools, and when she explained her opposition to the idea, it didn\u2019t go well. She told the Associated Press that having a conversation with the president \u201cwas like talking to a toddler.\u201d\n\nAs we discussed at the time, it was a familiar reaction. After the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., for example, Trump called Samantha Fuentes, a student who\u2019d been shot and was left with a piece of shrapnel lodged behind her right eye. \u201cTalking to the president, I\u2019ve never been so unimpressed by a person in my life,\u201d she said after the conversation. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make me feel better in the slightest.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Trump hosted an event at the White House on school shootings, where he clutched talking points that had apparently been written for him. One of them read, \u201cI hear you\u201d \u2013 suggesting he needed to be reminded of this.\n\nBefore that, Trump reached out to Sgt. La David T. Johnson\u2019s widow, Myeshia Johnson, after he was killed in Niger. When their conversation didn\u2019t go well, the president ended up feuding with Ms. Johnson via Twitter.\n\nLast fall, shortly after the massacre in Las Vegas, the Associated Press reported that White House aides felt anxiety over what Trump might say (or tweet) about the mass murders. They were nervous, of course, because of the president\u2019s \u201ctroubled track record in such delicate moments.\u201d\n\nAfter Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, he marveled at the size of the \u201cturnout\u201d of people who wanted to see him in Corpus Christi. After initially ignoring Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, the president focused on the island\u2019s debts to Wall Street, feuded with a local mayor, and threw paper towels to locals as if he were shooting free throws.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are examples of Trump comforting people in need during difficult times, but it\u2019s nevertheless difficult to look past the pattern in which the president\u2019s empathy gap has been on display. He routinely struggles in a wide variety of ways, but it appears that asking Trump to play the role of Consoler in Chief is simply unrealistic.\n\nAs a candidate, the future president, referring to himself in third person, said empathy would be \u201cone of the strongest things about Trump.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s quite a bit of evidence to the contrary.", "Dems have edge in generic congressional ballot, poll finds copied!\n\nWith just a day before the midterms, the Morning Joe panel discusses the latest national polling in key battleground states and takes a look at the trend lines across the country.

Kemp, who is in a neck-and-neck race with Stacey Abrams, alleged that the state Democratic Party made a \u201cfailed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system\u201d and announced that his office was opening an investigation into the party. Kemp said his office alerted the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, but he offered no evidence to back up his allegation.\n\nBut all things considered, yesterday\u2019s news showed Kemp reaching a new low\n\nRick Hasen, an election-law expert at UC Irvine, wrote a piece for Slate describing Kemp\u2019s move as \u201cperhaps the most outrageous example of election administration partisanship in the modern era.\u201d\n\nHasen added, \u201c[W]hat Kemp has done now goes beyond the pale. He\u2019s accused his opponents of election tampering without evidence on the eve of the election, and plastered the incendiary charge on an official state website in the days before his office will administer that election. This is some banana republic stuff.\u201d\n\nGiven what we know, that assessment is more than fair. There is literally nothing to suggest Georgia Democrats tried to \u201chack\u201d the state\u2019s voter registration system. In fact, all available evidence suggests nothing of any significance happened at all.\n\nThe only apparent wrongdoing in this story comes by way of Kemp himself \u2013 since he\u2019s the one who seems to be abusing his office on the eve of a statewide election, subverting the electoral process to suit his own partisan purposes.\n\nMaking matters slightly worse is Kemp\u2019s recent history. It was, after all, just two years ago when the Georgia Republican accused the Department of Homeland Security of an \u201cunsuccessful attempt to penetrate the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s firewall.\u201d Months later, following an investigation, we learned that Kemp has no idea what he was talking about.\n\nI won\u2019t pretend to know what\u2019ll happen in this closely watched gubernatorial race, which could go either way. But I do know if Kemp were confident of success, he wouldn\u2019t have launched this gambit yesterday.\n\nI also know that if Kemp prevails after all of these antics, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised if a cloud of illegitimacy hangs over him for four years.", "Joe: This is a closer race than I thought it would be copied!\n\nWith just one day to go before the midterm elections, the Morning Joe panel assesses Donald Trump's closing message, the tightening polls and the mood of the country.\n\nRead More", "Missouri Senate is a margin-of-error contest, poll shows copied!\n\nDemocrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Josh Hawley are locked in a margin-of-error contest in Missouri's Senate race, according to a new NBC News/Marist poll of the state.\n\nRead More", "Andrew Gillum up among likely voters in new poll copied!\n\nIn Florida, Democrat Andrew Gillum is up among likely voters against Republican Ron DeSantis, 50 percent to 46 percent, within the poll's margin of error, according to the latest NBC News/Marist poll numbers.\n\nRead More", "Early voting in 2018 far outpacing 2014 early voting copied!\n\nRachel Maddow highlights several states in which the early in-person voting so far is already surpassing the total early voting numbers in 2014.\n\nRead More", "Trump admin in no apparent rush to fill anti-Semitism envoy job copied!\n\nRachel Maddow reports that despite some lip service, the Trump administration has yet to fill the job of U.S. special envoy for monitoring and combating anti-Semitism despite the position having been open since January 2017.\n\nRead More", "Trump keeps choice stark in 2018 election of love and hate copied!\n\nAn MSNBC panel contrasts Democratic and Republican strategies in 2018, with Democrats presenting several candidate who have earned the adulation of supporters while Donald Trump has ensured that every republican is seen only as a proxy for the Trump presidency.\n\nRead More", "Tight gubernatorial race in Georgia will be a battle of turnout copied!\n\nJoy Reid and Katy Tur report from Georgia on the especially close race for governor there and the passions voters have for their respective candidates.\n\nRead More", "House Intel Democrats hope to end Nunes' coddling of Trump copied!\n\nCongressman Adam Schiff talks about how the House Intelligence Committee would perform differently under Democratic control by actually investigating Donald Trump instead of protecting Trump as Devin Nunes has used his leadership of the committee to do.\n\nRead More", "Democrats seek to turn national poll advantage into local results copied!\n\nSteve Kornacki, MSNBC national political correspondent, talks about whether the advantage Democrats have in national polls will translate to the state and local midterm victories they need to reclaim some power in Washington.\n\nRead More", "Voters and candidates point to immigration, health care as key issues copied!\n\nNBC News\u2019 Kasie Hunt traveled across the country speaking with voters and candidates ahead of election day, and she asked them all a simple question: What is the single greatest motivating force in the midterm elections?\n\nRead More", "What time do you need to tune in for election results Tuesday? copied!\n\nSteve Kornacki, MSNBC national political correspondent, shows which key races you'll want to be paying attention to starting at 6pm ET on Tuesday, Election Day, and how long it will be before the full results of the 2018 election are known.\n\nRead More", "What will Washington look like if Democrats win back the House? copied!\n\nIf a Blue Wave comes in the midterm elections, President Trump will wake up to a very different Washington.
