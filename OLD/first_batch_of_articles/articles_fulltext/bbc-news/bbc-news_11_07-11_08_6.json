final deal was likely to be delayed.\n\nAn energy bill price cap of \u00a31,137 a year for \"typical usage\" is due to come into force in the new year.\n\nIt means suppliers will have to cut the price of their default tariffs to the level of the cap or below it.\n\nEnergy bills to be capped in new year\n\nWatchdog clears SSE-Npower merger\n\nHouseholds to benefit from energy price cap\n\nThe government introduced legislation earlier this year to establish the price cap following concerns about how efficiently the energy market was working.\n\nIn September, SSE said the cap would lead to \"significantly lower\" profits than it had expected at the start of the financial year in its retail arm.\n\nThe energy firm said it had become apparent that the impact of some \"recent market developments\", including the price cap, meant that the \"commercial terms associated with the proposed combination will need to be reconsidered\".\n\nAs a result, SSE and Npower's German owner Innogy were in talks \"regarding potential changes\" to the commercial terms of the deal, it added.\n\nSSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: \"We continue to believe that creating a new,

cap have had a significant impact on the outlook for the combined retail company\".\n\nIt said the negotiations would include talks about \"potential additional direct or indirect financial

It's not a bad way to start an interview for one of football's biggest jobs.\n\nSince Santiago Solari temporarily replaced the sacked Julen Lopetegui as Real Madrid manager, the Spanish giants are unbeaten and yet to concede a goal.\n\nTrue, the opposition have not been too testing: Solari's wins have come over third division Melilla in the cup, Real Valladolid in the league, and Czech side Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League.\n\nBut circumstances seem to have left the Argentine former Real winger 90 minutes away from a permanent spot in the Bernabeu dugout.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily, BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague explains the key factors that put Solari in such a strong position.\n\nKeeping one man happy\n\nWhen Lopetegui was dismissed on 29 October, the day after Real were thrashed 5-1 by bitter rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp, the team had slipped to ninth in La Liga.\n\nChampions League winners for the past three seasons, Los Merengues had just suffered a fifth loss in six games.\n\nThey turned to 42-year-old Solari, who was in charge of the club's reserves. He was promoted from within - just like Zinedine Zidane in January 2016 - albeit only \"provisionally\".\n\nSolari's three games in charge Copa del Rey, 31 October: Melilla 0-4 Real Madrid La Liga, 3 November: Real Madrid 2-0 Real Valladolid Champions League, 7 November: Viktoria Plzen 0-5 Real Madrid\n\n\"I am not sure Real Madrid look so different under Solari. They're not looking much better, just a bit more confident,\" Balague said.\n\n\"But looking at the line-up for Wednesday's win in Plzen, you realise what Solari has been doing best of all: keeping one very important person happy in particular - Florentino Perez.\n\n\"He left Luka Modric, Marco Asensio and Isco on the bench, which gives the message that everybody has to earn their place. Dani Ceballos was put in to show there is depth. There was a Champions League debut for 21-year-old academy graduate Javi Sanchez.\n\n\"And he also played Vinicius Junior. It is an unwritten rule at the club that Vinicius has to play, because the 18-year-old Brazilian cost 45m euros (\u00a339.1m), although some people say the deal was worth 65m euros (\u00a356.5m).\n\n\"Lopetegui would have felt the pressure, coming from Perez using his friends in the media, to select him, and all of these decisions make the club's president very happy.\"\n\nKeeping the team happy\n\nFormer Spain boss Lopetegui of course had to cope without Cristiano Ronaldo, for so many seasons the club's talisman before a \u00a399.2m move to Juventus this summer.\n\nBut Balague said his methods on the training pitch and tactics also played a role in failing to follow on from Zidane's impressive reign.\n\n\"Lopetegui is of the Johan Cruyff school of management, and he wants his teams to always play in a certain style, whereas Madrid over recent years have been much more about improvisation, leaving quality players to do the rest.\n\n\"It was perhaps a mistake for Madrid to choose him, because Lopetegui was not going to change.\n\n\"Solari has realised that you have to open the doors, let all of the tension out. He has allowed the players to forget responsibilities and obligations and express themselves.\n\n\"He has gone back to the Zidane style: go out and enjoy yourselves.\n\n\"Karim Benzema, Alvaro Odriozola, Casemiro, Dani Ceballos have all already been affected positively by the change and have said he should stay. 'We would kill for him,' they said.\n\n\"And Gareth Bale is scoring, which will give him the confidence he really needs.\"\n\nSo is it Solari's job to lose?\n\nSpanish league rules mean caretaker managers cannot be in charge of a club for more than 14 days. After that time, the temporary boss must be made permanent if they are to continue in the role.\n\nOn Monday, it will be two weeks exactly since Solari was put in charge.

I didn't think he got as much ball as he would have liked last weekend so I think we will see him again at 15 or 13 because he's a guy who is going to be perfect for a World Cup squad as well.\"\n\nCompetition for places is so strong that Schmidt has challenged British and Irish Lions second row Iain Henderson to \"put his hand up\" against the Pumas if he is to hold-off competition from the likes of Tadhg Beirne and Devin Toner for a place in the Ireland pack.\n\n\"It's a great thing from an Irish point of view that nobody is secure of their place and they know that every time they pull on that green jersey they have to perform otherwise there'll be somebody ready to take their spot,\" said former Ireland Grand Slam winner Paddy Wallace.\n\n\"Iain will be under pressure this week but at the same time he's a British Lion. It's great depth, Ireland are in such a good position and I agree with Darren they're set to be competitive against the All Blacks and really they can win that match.\"\n\nPaddy Wallace and Darren Cave in action for Ireland during a 2011 World Cup warm-up match\n\nBanana skin factor\n\nIreland have suffered three Rugby World Cup defeats at the hands of Argentina - most recently in the 2015 quarter-final in Cardiff - but they were comfortable winners against the Pumas when the two sides met in last year's autumn series.\n\n\"They're not the team of old, they're not the bogey team that Ireland have faced over the years,\" added Wallace.\n\n\"Argentina are getting better. They had an awful season last year where I'm not sure if they even won a game but in the Rugby Championship this year against the best in the Southern Hemisphere they turned over Australia and they turned over South Africa so they are improving.\n\n\"They have a lot of consistency in terms of who they can select every week due to the fact that they're involved in Super Rugby now.\"\n\nCave, who played both matches of a summer tour to Argentina in 2014 when Ireland won the series 2-0, agrees that Saturday's game will not result in a shock loss for the Six Nations champions.\n\n\"I know we've struggled against Argentina in the past at World Cups but I think Ireland are going to beat them comfortably,\" added the Ulster centre.\n\n\"Despite the hype around the New Zealand game, I don't see Joe letting his team take their eye off the ball - I don't see the banana skin factor coming into it.\n\n\"I just think this team, a lot of them didn't play last week, there's competition for places and they'll be ready for it and I think if Ireland are ready I don't see Argentina beating them.\"\n\nDarren Cave and Paddy Wallace were speaking to Gavin Andrews on BBC Sport NI's 'The Rugby Social'", "Image copyright Met Police Image caption Peter Gouldstone is being treated in hospital after sustaining bruising and a head injury\n\nA \u00a310,000 reward has been offered to catch the attackers of a 98-year-old man left fighting for his life after being robbed in his home.\n\nPeter Gouldstone was found with a head injury and bruising at a house in Evesham Road, north London, on Tuesday.\n\nHis son Simon Gouldstone said he \"feared the worst\" when he found him beaten and in a \"semi-conscious state\".\n\nThe charity Crimestoppers is offering a reward for information to catch those responsible for the \"horrific attack\".\n\nThere was clear evidence of disturbance at the property and a number of Mr Gouldstone's possessions had been taken including a 26-inch Panasonic television, police said.\n\nDet Insp Paul Ridley said: \"Mr Gouldstone was left for dead in his own home, a place where he should feel safest.\n\n\"There is no way of knowing when he would have been discovered.

The BBC followed a reporter in Lawrenceburg as she grappled with its impact on her own community.\n\n'They need to go to prison.\"\n\nOn a Sunday evening in September, Emily Walden spoke at a moving candlelit vigil organised by Parents of Addicted Loved Ones in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky.\n\n\"'They'\" are pharmaceutical company executives - she holds responsible for the prescription drugs epidemic which claimed over 72,000 drug related overdose deaths last year.\n\n\"Money's not enough we need to show enough is enough - putting them in prison will deter the next company from doing this\", she said, calling on US Attorney General Jeff Sessions to file criminal charges.\n\nSince 2012 Emily has been campaigning after she lost her 21-year-old son, TJ, to an overdose of the drug Opana.\n\n\"My son went on a camping trip with friends. The next day a police officer knocked on my door and told me he had passed away.\n\nHe was 21 years old. He was almost 18 when he first was offered an OxyContin. It was a short period of time, he went into treatment. He went through periods of time when he was doing well, then others when it was not.\n\n\"He told me he wanted to get better. He didn't fight me a lot - he said I know you want to help me - even when I was mean and took things away or drug tested him - he knew I wanted to help him,\" she recalls.\n\nImage caption \"Every day I think about him and everything that could have been.\" Emily Walden says of her son\n\nDespite her efforts - including tracking down and speaking to his drug dealers - Emily lost her son, and since then has focused relentlessly on the drug, Opana, and the company that manufactured it.\n\n\"Every day I think about him and everything that could have been. When he went to treatment he told everybody in the centre when I was going to visit - he said whatever you do don't mention Opana in front of my mom because she will go crazy.\n\n\"So, I think he'd look down on me a few times and laughed about it because even back then I was very upset and couldn't understand why he had access to such a dangerous drug. Oxymorphone should never have been put back on the market, ever.\"\n\nShe took her case to Andy Beshear - now Kentucky's Attorney General - and before he was elected, Emily asked him to investigate.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption On America's trail of destruction\n\nA year ago, November 2017, Kentucky filed its first lawsuit against an opioid manufacturer and now has seven lawsuits in total against different manufacturers. The state wants the cases to be heard in Kentucky - not as part of a bigger multi-action case being heard in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nAccording to Wes Duke, assistant director Medicaid fraud control unit at the Attorney General's office Kentucky, if the state's civil cases are successful they would want any payments for financial damages from the pharmaceutical companies to pay for drug prevention education, law enforcement and treatment.\n\nHe points out that these are civil cases - to meet Emily's hopes for a criminal case against the company's executives, he says, \"You would have to prove criminal liability that the executives were aware. That possibly could exist but these cases are civil.\"\n\nIn the early days of her campaigning, Emily was inspired by an article written by Laura Ungar, an investigative journalist with the Louisville Courier Journal, who has written extensively on the opioid epidemic since 2011.\n\nSeveral years back she told Laura that it had been one of her articles which inspired to start a local pressure group called Fed Up at the start of her campaign.\n\n\"I met Emily at a forum the Courier Journal held in 2016 - Emily just came up to me and said, 'hey I have read some of your stories and want to talk to you because I lost my son,'\" says Laura.\n\n\"I had travelled to Florida to write about the pill pipeline which was a huge problem. A woman there set up a group called Stop Now. Emily read my story and focussed on that group and contacted the woman and ended up starting a chapter in Kentucky because of the connection she made based on reading my story.\n\nImage caption Laura Ungar\n\n\"She has kind of taken it upon herself to do all she can to stop pill abuse and particularly do something about the regulatory side of things. She goes to Washington to get the [US Food and Drug Administration] to crack down more on pharmaceutical companies because she things that can stop other kids from dying.\n\n\"I was very touched that my story did this. And I would have never known that my story made this change without her coming up to me. It's always gratifying that when you put something out that it is doing something. And you think about those times when you put your stories out in the world and you didn't know about it.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The heroin-ravaged city fighting back\n\nThis summer Laura travelled back to a town called Austin, in nearby Indiana, researching a follow-up to her 2015 story which exposed how the town had suffered rural America's worst drug-fuelled HIV outbreak in recent history.\n\nPeople had found a way to inject Opana ER multiple times while sharing needles.\n\nIn returning in 2018, the Courier Journal wanted to tell the story of how Austin was trying to recover - \"a beacon of hope\" as editor Rick Green described it to his team who were working on this project.\n\nAs part of her campaign, Emily Walden testified last year to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against Opana ER.\n\nIn July 2017, the FDA asked Endo to withdraw the drug in what was the first time the agency had taken steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The grandparents' burden: 'We don't resent the kids - but life's hard'\n\nEmily makes a point of clarifying her motive.\n\n\"I am not going after this because my son died of that drug. The research I did and what I found out about that drug is the reason I pursued it. He should have never had access to it. Many, many other people should not have. It's a very dangerous drug that should have not been put back on the market.\"\n\nEmily estimates she puts in 40 to 50 hours a week, voluntarily, on top of her full-time job. She says addressing meetings is not something she had done before her son died.\n\n\"I struggle each and every time,\" she says.\n\nThe difficulty of reporting on the opioid and addiction epidemic is also something that is taken personally by Laura.\n\nShe recalls the most \"heart-wrenching\" story she has covered in almost 30 years of reporting - when she visited the local hospital where drug-dependent babies were being treated.\n\n\"It not only shows how addiction affects not only the people using drugs, but their families and the most innocent members of our society.\n\n\"As a mom of two who has held my babies, holding these babies when they were shaking and crying and could not be consoled -I'll never forget It - it was more than your normal day doing journalism. That human connection I felt- this is just a terrible thing.\"\n\nLaura says Kentucky has been so hard hit in terms of drug-dependent babies.\n\n\"When I went to University Hospital's neonatal [intensive care unit], I saw about half the babies there were born dependent on drugs - which was just shocking to me.\n\n\"I get over days like that by really realising I am a human being and need to decompress and have some downtime to deal with my feelings. When these things are hurting me, I am hopeful that I am bringing some change to the situation - and that makes it worthwhile to show other people what is happening.\"\n\nOver the years the stories Laura has reported on about the opioid epidemic have changed.\n\nWhen she first started reporting on \"opioids\" the newspaper felt it necessary to define the word for readers. No longer.\n\nThe story has moved on - what started with over-prescribing for pain relief became a different problem when legislation was introduced to make it more difficult to get opioids - and consequently those who had become addicted turned to street heroin.\n\nNow the concern is deadly fentanyl.\n\nThe Jefferson County Coroner, Barbara Weakly-Jones, explained how the overdose numbers have increased - from 218 deaths in 2015 to 323 in 2016, and reaching 424 deaths in 2017. By mid-September this year the total had reached 205.\n\nIn 2016 12% of heroin overdoses included fentanyl or an analogue - in 2017 that number was 62%, and in 2018 to date, it's 70%.\n\nAs Barbara put it - \"you don't have any idea whether there is fentanyl in the heroin or not - until it is too late.\"\n\nTo put it into context, she compared the death toll from drugs with the number of homicide deaths - 58 in 2018.\n\nThere are signs that the response to the epidemic in Louisville is having an impact - the overdose deaths may be stabilising, in part due to the efforts to make anti-overdose Narcan available to first responders, as well as family members and the public.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption America's new generation of addicts\n\nA needle exchange has expanded its numbers, while recovery centres such as the Healing Place have increased their capacity.

All the country is struggling with this problem,' says Laura.\n\nEmily Walden says she is pleased that the state cases are progressing, but says the federal government is not doing enough.\n\n\"From the first time, I was there in Washington, there was zero legislation and now there is lots of legislation being proposed. But we are not nearly hitting what we should. There were 72,000 people died last year, we need to step it up.\n\nI am just a mom. I want this fixed.

With their replacements coming on to up the ante in the closing stages, they forced their opponents back towards their own line and, with Halfpenny off the field injured, substitute Biggar was a picture of composure as he converted the vital penalty.\n\nWales finally end losing run\n\nLike the golden-brown hues of falling leaves and the dropping temperatures, Wales losing to Australia had become an autumn tradition over the past decade.\n\nA run of 13 straight defeats stretched back to 2008, many of them due to dramatic late scores and most by painfully narrow margins - of the 13 losses, only two were by 10 points or more.\n\nWales, however, were quietly confident of stopping the rot.\n\nThey had won their six previous matches, whereas the Wallabies had won only three of their 10 Tests in 2018 and slipped to an historic low of seventh in the world rankings, albeit returning to sixth courtesy of Scotland's loss in Cardiff last week.\n\nWales full-back Leigh Halfpenny had an uncharacteristic off-day with the boot against Australia\n\nBut such is Australia's competitive spirit and their strong record against Wales, one writes them off at their peril.\n\nAs ever, the visitors were devilishly competitive at the breakdown, with back-rowers David Pocock and Michael Hooper often slowing Wales' ball.\n\nAnd despite the occasional flash of Wallaby flair in the opening exchanges, the home side managed to do the same to their opponents in an attritional first half.\n\nNeither side could puncture the opposing defensive line, with each having to be content with a penalty apiece through Halfpenny and Bernard Foley.\n\nSurprisingly, the usually accurate Halfpenny pushed one penalty wide of the post shortly before the interval, and the full-back put his head in his hands when he then squandered a second kick at goal.\n\nNormal service was resumed after the break, however, with the Scarlets full-back restoring Wales' lead with 13 minutes left.\n\nHalfpenny was then involved in a moment of controversy, as he was tackled late by Samu Kerevi, who escaped punishment despite appearing to catch the Wales player's head with his shoulder.\n\nRather than a Wales penalty, referee Ben O'Keeffe awarded one to Australia for a different infringement and To'omua struck it perfectly from the touchline to bring his side level.\n\nAt that moment, the Welsh fans felt a dreaded sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: the old recurring nightmare of late heartache against the Wallabies.\n\nBut Wales were determined to exorcise those demons and their reward for a wholehearted and disciplined display was Biggar's penalty - on the field for a dazed-looking Halfpenny - which prompted deafening roars of celebration and banished a decade of hurt.\n\nWales' World Cup audition\n\nThis autumn series is something of an audition for Wales' players, who are looking to secure their squad places with next year's World Cup in mind.\n\nWith a view to improving their strength in depth and rewarding those who impressed on the summer tour of the United States and Argentina, head coach Warren Gatland handed starts to fringe players such as wing Josh Adams and lock Adam Beard at the expense of more seasoned players.\n\nBritish and Irish Lions backs Liam Williams and Biggar were instead named on the bench, along with lock Cory Hill who had co-captained Wales on that summer tour.\n\nWorcester wing Josh Adams was given a starting Wales berth against Australia\n\nThere were few opportunities for Adams to showcase his attacking skills in a tight encounter, while Beard occasionally used his enormous 6ft 8in frame to good use by disrupting Australian line-outs.\n\nBut Gatland will have learned that his less experienced charges can stand the heat of Test rugby against a southern hemisphere powerhouse.\n\nThe New Zealander will also have been pleased with the impact of his replacements - Williams, Hill, Biggar, Tomos Williams, Rob Evans, Ellis Jenkins and Dillon Lewis - whose impact he had highlighted before the match as a potentially decisive factor considering Wales' previous late defeats against the Wallabies.\n\nAnd given that Australia are in the same World Cup pool as Wales, this was a timely moment to end their decade-long hoodoo and land a significant psychological blow against their old foes before they meet again in Japan next year.\n\nWales: 15-Halfpenny, 14-North, 13-Davies, 12-Parkes, 11-Adams, 10-Anscombe, 9-Davies;

international born in the Ivory Coast, as \"West Indian\".\n\nThey say the scout, Serge Fournier, claimed it was because PSG \"didn't want us to recruit players born in Africa, because you are never

Or does he?\n\nNonu stepped his way to a solo try, Carter was immaculate and New Zealand won 34-17.\n\nBut then not many plans do succeed against a team who have lost just four of their 29 matches over the past two years.\n\nHere is another, based on what went wrong in those rare defeats.\n\n1. Out-kick them\n\nBarrett has scored 31 tries in 70 Tests from fly-half, but is not as impressive off the tee\n\nBeauden Barrett may well become the first man to win the World Player of the Year three years in a row at the end of this month.\n\nThe All Blacks fly-half can cut a defence to ribbons with scything pace or the weight, timing and disguise on a pass. Delicate chips, teasing grubbers and booming touch-finders flow from his instep while his brain coolly steers the All Blacks points harvester around the field.\n\nHe is some player. But he is not the best goal-kicker the world has ever seen.\n\nHe clocked just a 65% success rate in the All Blacks' recent Rugby Championship campaign. By contrast, France's Maxime Machenaud and Wales' Leigh Halfpenny landed 90% and 89% of their kicks at goal respectively during this year's Six Nations.\n\nBy most measures South Africa should have lost when the two teams met in Wellington in September.\n\nThe Springboks made only 258m to the All Blacks' 624. They had only 25% possession, 21% territory and conceded 10 penalties, while New Zealand offered up only three.\n\nGoal-kicking success in 2018 Source: RugbyPass Leigh Halfpenny (Wal) 87% Bernard Foley (Aus) 85% Greig Laidlaw (Sco) 84% Johnny Sexton (Ire) 77% Owen Farrell (Eng) 74% Handre Pollard (SA) 72% Beauden Barrett (NZ) 66%\n\nBut, the statistic that headlined all of them was, a sensational 36-34 win for the visitors.\n\nKey to victory was South Africa fly-half Handre Pollard landing five out of six kicks, earning his side 11 points.\n\nBy contrast Barrett landed only two from six.\n\nSouth Africa kicking coach Vlok Cilliers was critical of Barrett in the aftermath, claiming that the All Blacks, so used to having games won before the final 10 minutes, struggled with clutch kicks at goal.\n\n\"All the other major kickers in the world are far likelier to have been exposed to pressure kicking at goal in the last quarter of games. Him? Not nearly so much,\" he told Sport24.\n\nSimon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Gracenote, also believes that Barrett's return off the tee is a result of the All Blacks' excellence, but in a different way.\n\nHis research, covering the All Blacks' 23 Tests before last weekend's win over Japan, shows that if they can make touch inside the opposition 22m from a penalty, it is actually more pragmatic than going for the posts.\n\n\"New Zealand add, on average, 3.07 points from each spell of possession inside the opposition 22m beginning with their own line-out ball,\" he explains.\n\n\"So New Zealand rarely kick for points, taking only 36 shots in their last 23 Test matches.\"\n\nIf the opponent can withstand those All Black raids into their own 22m though and force Barrett to try his luck off the tee instead, they could be onto something.\n\n2. Bring the big lads wide\n\nMcKenzie tries and fails to halt the momentum of Marika Koroibete in Brisbane\n\nThe All Blacks will have another kicking option in their line-up at Twickenham on Saturday. Full-back Damian McKenzie has landed 10 out of his 11 pots at goal for them this year.\n\nHe is also an instinctive, incisive runner with the ball in hand. But part of his elusiveness is his small stature.\n\nHe is 5ft 10in tall and weighs in at 12st 4lb - almost quaint numbers in the modern era of meat and muscle.\n\nHow McKenzie stacks up against other full-backs Height Weight Damian McKenzie (NZ) 5ft 10in 12st 4lb Leigh Halfpenny (Wal) 5ft 10in 13st 5lb Stuart Hogg (Sco) 5ft 11in 14st 9lbs Elliot Daly (Eng) 6ft 14st 11lb Willie le Roux (SA) 6ft 1in 14st 7lbs Rob Kearney (Ire) 6ft 2in 14st 13lbs Israel Folau (Aus) 6ft 4in 16st 3lb\n\nWhen Australia took a 23-18 victory over the All Blacks in Brisbane in October 2017, one Wallaby try came from isolating McKenzie against former Fiji rugby league international Marika Koroibete out wide.\n\nSimilarly one of the two scores for the British and Irish Lions in their win in Wellington in July 2017 came from Taulupe Faletau hanging wide to barge through full-back Israel Dagg.\n\nIt is not a subtle tactic, but isolating the All Blacks' smallest defenders one-on-one against the heaviest-duty runners, or aerial bombs, could puncture their well-organised defence.\n\n3. Shut down their all-court game\n\nAaron Cruden demonstrates the All Blacks commitment to keeping the ball alive against the Lions\n\nGrant Fox - All Blacks legend and a selector for the current crop - told the Times in December what irked him most about his side's second-Test defeat by the Lions.\n\n\"We didn't take as many risks against the Lions as we should,\" he said.\n\n\"There were enough opportunities for us to move the ball to areas where we'd planned, where we felt we could hurt the Lions.\n\n\"We didn't throw the pass, we chose to kick or carry. They did that to us because we knew how good they were.\"\n\nThe ball-handling skills of the All Blacks - from one to 15 - leave defences struggling to get a fix on their targets. Their off-loading and intelligent support lines create a kaleidoscope of attacking patterns.\n\nHowever, slow them down, tie them in and introduce a sliver of doubt into their play and, by Fox's own admission, their attacking edge is blunted.\n\nCoach Eddie Jones hinted England would try something along these lines this weekend, promising his team would not be drawn into an expansive \"athletic contest\".\n\n\"We will not be wearing singlets and running shorts. It will be a proper game of rugby,\" he added.\n\n4. Exploit their slow starts to the half\n\nZebo scored one of Ireland's five tries in Chicago\n\nPerhaps the All Blacks are still recovering from the exertions of the haka. Perhaps the novelty of playing against the world's best team gives the opposition an early boost. Either way there are two clear windows of opposition opportunity.\n\n\"New Zealand appear to be at their most vulnerable in the first six minutes of each half. During those periods their opponents enter the All Black 22m more than New Zealand manage to do the same at the other end,\" explains Gleave.\n\n\"During other periods of their matches, New Zealand always have the most entries into the 22m.\"\n\nIreland got the jump on the All Blacks early in both halves of their seismic 40-29 win in Chicago in November 2016.\n\nNew Zealand's autumn internationals 3 November Beat Japan 69-31 10 November England 17 November Ireland 24 November Italy (in Rome)\n\nJoe Schmidt's side found touch inside the New Zealand 22m after being awarded a penalty two minutes into the game and, awarded another shortly after, were three up with as many minutes on the clock.\n\nSix minutes into the second half and Johnny Sexton kicked into the corner once again to set up the field position from which Simon Zebo raced over to make it 30-8.\n\nNew Zealand made it back to within four points, but could not make up the ground.\n\n5. Get lucky\n\nCheslin Kolbe, who plays his club rugby in Toulouse, has benefitted from the Springboks relaxing rules over foreign-based players\n\n'Lucky' might be a bit harsh.\n\nBut, considering the world champions' desire to offload and keep the ball alive (see point three), rushing out of the defensive line to gamble on making a high-risk interception has been a profitable tactic.\n\nFourteen of South Africa's 36 points in their September win came that way, with Willie le Roux pinching an ambitious quick line-out attempt by Jordie Barrett before Cheslin Kolbe snaffled Anton Lienert-Brown's pass to go under the posts.\n\nAustralia wing Reece Hodge did similar in the Wallabies' October success, stealing the ball and darting in from 80m to open the scoring.\n\nJust like the lottery of the loose ball, tight decisions can make all the difference if they break right.\n\nJerome Garces (centre) resisted his assistants' suggestion to take a second look at Sonny Bill Williams' red card against the British and Irish Lions\n\nThe Lions were undoubtedly helped to victory in Wellington by Sonny Bill Williams' first-half red card for a shoulder to the head of Anthony Watson.\n\nReferee Jerome Garces turned down suggestions from his video official and his assistants to have a second look at the incident, certain that it was red.\n\nAnd in the final four minutes, Garces decided Kyle Sinckler had been taken out in the air, awarding the Lions a match-winning penalty, when the decision could easily have gone the other way for the prop jumping into the tackle.\n\nThe margins between success and failure are as slim as a rare winning scoreline against the All Blacks.", "Manchester United will be the underdogs when they go to Etihad Stadium to play neighbours Manchester City on Sunday - but who will prevail?\n\n\"I feel that the ball has just started to run for United a little bit,\" BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson said. \"Look at their last-gasp wins over Bournemouth and Juventus this week.\n\n\"When you keep scoring important last-minute goals, it is great for you and it also worries the opposition a little bit.\n\n\"Yes, City are favourites but I don't think this will be straightforward for them at all.\"\n\nLawro is making predictions for all 380 top-flight matches this season, against a variety of guests.\n\nThis week's guests are WWE wrestlers Dolph Ziggler and his tag-team partner Drew McIntyre.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Premier League Predictions: WWE's Drew McIntyre & Dolph Ziggler\n\nDrew is a Rangers fan - and has been from a very early age.\n\nHe explained to BBC Sport: \"My family supports Rangers and Celtic and, when you are a baby, they leave out the two tops and you crawl towards one of them.\n\n\"I believe I crawled to the Rangers top when I was a kid.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old from Ayr is enjoying life under current Gers boss Steve Gerrard and thinks he might bring the glory days back to Ibrox - although it might take a while.\n\n\"Gerrard played with his heart, which is something we were missing,\" McIntyre explained.\n\n\"He is drilling it into his team and we are on the rise.

In Ohio, one widely-shared claim of vote rigging turned out to be caused by a temporary paper jam.\n\nIn Georgia, where African-American candidate Stacey Abrams is contesting results in her race against incumbent governor Brian Kemp, many online are claiming that issues like ballot machines supplied without power cords and four-hour queues helped boost Mr Kemp to victory.\n\nMr Kemp was responsible for overseeing his own election, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law won emergency litigation in predominantly black areas of Georgia to extend voting times.\n\nBefore the election, 53,000 voter applications were put on hold in Georgia because of alleged problems with identification information.\n\nWithout comprehensive national data about problems like broken ballot machines, it is hard to calculate the full scale of Tuesday's problems, but evidence suggests that alleged vote suppression was more widespread this year than in previous mid-terms.\n\nCalls to the largest non-partisan voter helpline in the country, run by the Election Protection Committee, were up by one-third in comparison with 2014, with 31,000 calls on Tuesday.\n\nPurges of voters from electoral rolls are more frequent than in 2010 and there is evidence that the numbers of voters requiring provisional ballots also increased, Vanessa Williamson at the Brookings Institution research group, who has written on the topic, said on Wednesday.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Stacey Abrams is contesting the results in her bid to be Governor of Georgia\n\nProvisional ballots are issued when a voter's eligibility is in question and are often only counted in a close race.\n\nOn Wednesday, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois also accused Republican lawmakers of trying to \"make it as hard as possible for people to vote\".\n\nAlleged vote suppression and intimidation tends to happen in areas with high African American, Hispanic or poor populations, where their vote could alter the status quo.\n\n\"Officials pursue voter suppression tactics to lock out voters of colour with the end goal of distorting electoral outcomes,\" said Kristen Clarke, president of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, part of the Election Protection Committee, on Wednesday.\n\nHer organisation tracks alleged voter suppression efforts throughout election cycles and won a lawsuit against Mr Kemp in Georgia in 2016, but nonetheless the scale of claims of problems on Tuesday were \"startling\", Ms Clarke said.\n\nGeorgia, Arizona, Texas and North Dakota, Florida are the front line of their efforts.\n\nResearch has previously shown that alleged vote suppression in the form of ID laws does not seriously affect election outcomes.\n\nBut in places like Georgia, where Mr Kemp may have won the race by fewer than 85,000 votes, it is easy to see why citizens would be concerned that an election was stolen from them.\n\n\"In very close races, an enormous number of factors contribute to the margin of difference.

one of the most harmful particles for human health.\n\nThe levels are way above the recommended WHO guidelines for concentrations of PM2.5.\n\nWhat are PM 2.5 particles?\n\nParticulate matter, or PM2.5 is a type of pollution involving fine particles fewer than 2.5 microns (0.0025mm) in diameter\n\nA second type, PM10, is of coarser particles with a diameter of up to 10 microns\n\nSome occur naturally - e.g. from dust storms and forest fires, others from human industrial processes\n\nThey often consist of fragments that are small enough to reach the lungs or, in the smallest cases, to cross into the bloodstream as well\n\nAround this time of year, Delhi and other cities in northern India, experience worsening air quality because of a combination of factors, not just because of Diwali fireworks.\n\nThese include:\n\ncrop burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana states\n\nexhaust emissions from vehicles\n\nconstruction and industrial activity in Delhi and surrounding areas\n\nweather patterns across the region trapping pollutants in the atmosphere\n\nSince the air quality is bad anyway at this time of year, how do we know what contribution Diwali makes?\n\nDiwali impact\n\nA recent study that has attempted to answer this question says there is a \"small but statistically significant\" effect from Diwali fireworks.\n\nThe study focused on five locations across Delhi, and looked at data gathered between 2013 and 2016.\n\nDiwali is set according to the Hindu lunar calendar and usually happens in late October or early November.\n\nThe different dates are important because they enable the authors to take into account crop burning as a factor, because that only starts at the same time of year.\n\n\"We used Nasa satellite data to establish when crop burning was happening in northern India,\" Dhananjay Ghei, one of the authors of the report told the BBC.\n\nIn two out of the four years, crop burning did not coincide directly with Diwali celebrations.\n\nAnd they also point out that industrial activity in one location stopped because of the holiday, and factored the weather conditions into their calculations.\n\nThey found increases in concentrations of PM2.5 of almost 40% by the second day of the festival.\n\nThis then falls back to existing background levels soon after the end of Diwali.\n\nAnd when looked at on an hourly basis, there was a rise of 100% for the five hours after 18:00 local time - the evening darkness period when most celebrations take place.\n\nA report by Delhi's Environment Pollution Authority also shows significant spikes around the Diwali period in both 2016 and 2017.\n\nOther pollutants\n\nIt should be pointed out here that not all fireworks produce a lot of PM2.5 particles, although the bigger ones tend to have larger concentrations.\n\nThe other caveat is around vehicle traffic, which increases in the Diwali period when people go out to buy gifts and visit family and friends.\n\nCould the higher concentrations of PM 2.5 be because of more traffic on the roads rather than fireworks?\n\nThe authors say they want to address this in future research.\n\nThat being said, fireworks do contain other toxic substances, including heavy metals.\n\nA separate study that has been done in the Indian city of Jamshedpur found significantly increased levels of the following substances during the Diwali period:\n\nPM10 particles\n\nsulphur dioxide\n\nnitrogen dioxide\n\nozone\n\niron\n\nlead\n\nmanganese\n\ncopper\n\nberyllium\n\nnickel\n\nThe government's own Central Pollution Control Board lists 15 substances in fireworks which it says are \"hazardous and toxic\".\n\nAgain it needs to be added that some of these substances are also produced by vehicle emissions.\n\nHowever, there probably is some logic to attempts to restrict the use of fireworks - if only on the basis that they contribute to an existing problem in cities that are already some of the most polluted on earth.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Media playback is not supported on this device Wilson on foster care and Cherries' 'difference in mentality'\n\nBournemouth striker Callum Wilson has overcome some \"incredible setbacks\" on his way to becoming Gareth Southgate's latest recruit.\n\nThe 26-year-old has been rewarded with his first call-up to the senior England squad after an excellent start to the Premier League season - but international football is a far cry from Wilson's challenging childhood.\n\n\"I was in foster care for a bit when I was younger,\" said Wilson in an interview with Football Focus in October.\n\nThe situation at home and \"erratic\" form as a teenager nearly saw him leave the game on two occasions.\n\nBBC Sport looks at the striker's journey from playing in local cages to England international.\n\n'He couldn't get a lift to the academy'\n\nWilson's first taste of a professional set-up came as a schoolboy on the books of hometown club Coventry City.\n\nThe young striker's pace and power were evident from a young age, but his domestic setting was already threatening to derail a career that had not yet begun.\n\n\"Callum was in and out of the academy,\" said Coventry City academy manager Rich Stevens.\n\n\"After coming in as a 12-year-old, he then left because he couldn't get a lift to the academy.\"\n\nAlthough he had been released from the Sky Blues' youth system, Wilson's development continued on the streets, away from the sheltered environment and immaculate facilities at the Alan Higgs Centre.\n\n\"He went out of the programme and played with his mates, who are older than him, in the local cages and on the streets,\" added Stevens.\n\n\"Callum was reintroduced to the academy at 15, which is when I first met him. He was driven, hungry and very athletic.\n\n\"He scored goals, but there were also lots of injuries through his youth and he had big ankle and shoulder issues.\"\n\n'He wasn't a player the club were looking at for the future'\n\nWilson progressed through the youth ranks at City, before spending time on loan in the non-league.\n\nHowever, injury concerns and inconsistent performances meant the striker was set to be released for a second time at Coventry.\n\nFormer Sky Blues manager Steven Pressley said: \"When I first arrived at Coventry, Callum's contract was due to expire at the end of that season and he was training with the development squad rather than the first team.\n\n\"He wasn't a player the club were looking at in terms of the future.\n\n\"After my first session in charge of the senior side, I went to watch the development squad train and Callum was one of two players who stood out.\n\nCallum Wilson scored 22 goals in 49 games for Coventry\n\n\"Sometimes it is just a matter of luck, and a matter of timing, as he could have had a poor training session that day.\"\n\nDespite an \"erratic\" pre-season, Pressley took a leap of faith in the youngster and opted to start the academy product alongside Leon Clarke.\n\nWilson, buoyed by the manger's confidence in his ability, never looked back.\n\n\"We got him fitter and sharper than he had ever been,\" added Pressley. \"He had incredible pace and power which was always going to disturb opposition defenders at any level.\n\n\"It wasn't a smooth pathway for Callum and he had some incredible setbacks including several serious injuries, but he is very determined and he is a brilliant lad that I cannot speak of highly enough.\n\n\"He always trained with good energy, he was very popular in the changing room and he truly deserves everything that is coming his way.\"\n\nCan he make an impression for England?\n\nEngland enjoyed their best finish a World Cup in 28 years during the summer, as captain Harry Kane won the Golden Boot for finishing the tournament with six goals.\n\nThe Spurs striker is expected to lead the line for Southgate's side for the foreseeable future, but Wilson's pace and direct running could provide an alternative option, or even support alongside Kane should the formation allow.\n\nWilson, who joined Bournemouth in 2014, suffered anterior cruciate ligament injuries in both knees during a 16-month spell with the Cherries, but he appears to be growing in confidence each week.\n\nHe has scored six goals in the league so far this season, as many as Kane, and he has been involved in more goals than any other Englishman in the top flight, adding four assists to his goal tally.\n\n\"Callum is developing all the time under a very good coach in Eddie Howe, and the system at Bournemouth suits him,\" said Pressley.\n\n\"A Kane/Wilson partnership would go against what England are trying to do, but I think they could be suited to play together.\n\n\"Callum likes to stretch

It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries, handling 2.9 million lorries last year. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben.\n\nBut that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage.\n\nDover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value, handling 17% of the UK trade in goods.\n\nAmong critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum - suggested Mr Raab should have \"done your homework before backing Leave\".\n\nThe Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was \"relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy\".\n\nShe added: \"While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade.\"", "Video\n\nParaplegic athlete Justin Levene speaks to the BBC following Luton Airport's recent decision to introduce 10 self-propelled wheelchairs.\n\nMr Levene has dropped legal action against the airport after an incident where his wheelchair was left behind by an airline.\n\nPreviously released footage shows the passenger dragging himself through the airport after refusing the replacement option offered by staff.", "Sergio Garcia finished strongly as he carded three successive birdies from the 15th hole\n\nNedbank Challenge - first-round leaderboard -8 S Garcia (Spa); -4 C Schwartzel (SA), M Korhonen (Fin), M Lorenzo-Vera (Fra) ; Selected -3 A Sullivan (Eng), M Wallace (Eng), L Oosthuizen (SA); -1 L Westwood (Eng), S Lowry (Ire), R Fisher (Eng), M Fitzpatrick (Eng); Level R McIlroy (NI); +1 P Harrington (Ire)\n\nSergio Garcia fired an eight-under-par 64 to take a four-shot advantage after day one at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa.\n\nThe Spaniard, 38, didn't drop a shot as he made an impressive start to his bid for a second straight win after his Valderrama Masters triumph.\n\nGarcia is four clear of another former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel plus Mikko Korhonen and Mike Lorenzo-Vera.\n\nRory McIlroy dropped three late shots to finish on level par.\n\nThe Northern Ireland's disappointing finish included a double bogey at the 17th as his faint hopes of overhauling Race to Dubai leader Francesco Molinari suffered a blow.\n\nEighth-placed McIlroy is almost \u00a31.75m behind Molinari and needs to win at least one of the remaining two events to overhaul the Italian, who enjoys a lead of just under \u00a31m from Ryder Cup partner and defending champion Tommy Fleetwood.\n\nMcIlroy, 29, was within touching distance of Garcia as a birdie on 13 moved him to three under.\n\nRory McIlroy double bogeyed the 17th after an errant drive and poor bunker shot\n\nHowever, he dropped a shot at the long 14th before worse followed on the penultimate hole as an errant drive and poor bunker shot led to his double-bogey six.\n\nGarcia is aiming for a third victory in Sun City after previous triumphs in 2001 and 2003.\n\nIt was the Spaniard's lowest opening round score of the season by two shots and matched the biggest first-round lead on the tour in 2018.\n\n\"I made some good putts here and there.

Yet nothing else was forthcoming, and pragmatics outweigh principles,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to break the cycle of debt. The best place to teach is in the classroom - I hope this textbook will help make that easier.\"\n\nAnswers\n\n1. Compound interest means you get interest on interest. So if you earn interest in year one, in year two you get the interest both on what you saved and on the interest in the first year. Simple interest does not do this, meaning that at the same rate, over time the compound interest method will generate a higher amount in interest.\n\n2. Daily calculation is better for a saver (this is actually the method most financial institutions use).\n\nFor example:\n\nTake a look at the following table, which shows what would happen if banks were to calculate the interest payable on \u00a35,000 at a rate of 3% for five years over different compounding periods.\n\nYearly: \u00a35,796\n\nQuarterly: \u00a35,805\n\nMonthly: \u00a35,808\n\nDaily: \u00a35,809\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n3. A basic rate taxpayer (20% tax on income) can earn \u00a31,000 interest on savings per tax year without paying tax on it.\n\nHigher rate taxpayers (who move into the 40% tax bracket) can earn \u00a3500 interest on their savings before being taxed.\n\nAdditional rate taxpayers (whose income extends into the 45% tax bracket) get no allowance.\n\n4. The interest rate you receive when you save money in an account is known as the Annual Equivalent Rate (AER). The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is what you are charged for borrowing products. This includes any fees and charges.\n\n5. Pay As You Earn. This is the way most employees pay tax - it is deducted by the employer - so the amount of money received comes after tax is taken off.\n\n6. Standing order. You are in control, you instruct your bank to pay the money to a particular person or company, it is your responsibility to change the payment details (eg the date or amount) if they need to be changed. Direct debit is an instruction to your bank to release money from your account to pay bills and other amounts automatically, the billing company has control.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n7. If you return a faulty item within 30 days, you are entitled to a full refund. You can still return the item after this, but the supplier can then offer a repair or replacement instead.\n\n8. The official UK interest rate (often called the base rate) is reviewed and set eight times a year by the Bank of England. Many lenders, especially with mortgages, tend to move their rates in line with this rate - so when it rises so do they.\n\nSome rates are directly linked to it, at other times the lender can choose whether and how much it tends to match it depending on its own competitive advantage. Yet some rates such as fixed rate mortgages, or high interest credit cards may not move at all.\n\n9. FSCS protects up to \u00a385,000 per authorised institution or up to \u00a31,000,000 for six months after major life events (eg death, or sale of a house).\n\n10.

need 447 runs to win Scorecard\n\nKeaton Jennings ended his two-year wait for a Test century as England moved into a formidable position on day three of the first Test against Sri Lanka.\n\nJennings scored a brilliant 146 not out to allow England to declare late in the day on 322-6.\n\nSri Lanka closed on 15-0 and must bat the final two days for a draw or score a record 462 to win to deny England a first away win in 13 Tests.\n\nJennings's century was his first since his ton on debut in 2016.\n\nHe batted patiently early on as England lost wickets in the morning session, before attacking after reaching three figures for the first time in 22 innings.\n\nThe tourists had lost Rory Burns and Moeen Ali in poor fashion before lunch, with captain Joe Root also falling, but Jennings put on 107 with Ben Stokes, 77 with Jos Buttler and 61 with Ben Foakes.\n\nThe late contributions ensured Sri Lanka must make the highest successful run chase in Test history, at a ground where the highest winning chase is just 99.\n\nWhen the hosts began their mammoth chase England tried five different bowlers in seven overs before the close, but Sri Lanka's openers safely kept all 10 wickets intact.\n\nIt is currently the rainy season in Sri Lanka but so far any forecast rain has stayed away, and if it continues to do so then England look likely to earn their first Test win overseas since 2016.\n\nA win would also be their first in Tests at Galle and would put them 1-0 up in the three-match series.\n\nJennings returns to form\n\nJust 3.2% of the balls faced by Jennings\u2019 were hit for boundaries, the lowest percentage in a Test century by an England player since 2006\n\nJennings has been one of the most criticised England batsmen in recent months as he struggled to repeat the success of his debut century in Mumbai against India in December 2016.\n\nHe was dropped from the team in 2017, after one fifty in five matches, before being recalled in June and averaging just 19.20 against Pakistan and India this summer.\n\nThat meant his place was under threat for this series but England stuck with the Lancashire player following the retirement of fellow opener Alastair Cook.\n\nIn this innings he faced more deliveries of spin than in his 10 matches in England combined, and he looked far more comfortable than he did in the swinging and seaming conditions back home.\n\nHe batted sensibly, pushing the ball into open spaces for the majority of his innings and persistently looking to reverse sweep, one of his favoured shots.\n\nSri Lanka chose not to review an lbw decision just after Jennings passed 50 which replays showed would have been out had they done so, but that was the only chance he gave in the innings, other than a sharp caught and bowled effort when attacking late on.\n\nHe was unbeaten on 98 at tea but afterwards safely reached three figures before kicking on to better the 112 he made in Mumbai in conditions which also favoured spin.\n\nLower order impress again after more early failure\n\nStokes' fifty was his third this year\n\nEngland had started the day on 38-0 with both Jennings and Burns at the crease but debutant Burns, who was out for nine in the first innings, did not seem to settle.\n\nHe was frantic throughout and then, on 23, he called for a single to mid-on and was run out a yard short by Dimuth Karunaratne's direct hit.\n\nEngland persisted with Moeen Ali batting at number three and his dismissal was equally poor, chipping his 11th ball to mid-on off Dilruwan Perera for three.\n\nRoot was less to blame for his dismissal, caught behind off a good delivery from Rangana Herath for three, but that left England 111-3 at lunch, 250 ahead.\n\nStokes impressed alongside Jennings after lunch however, and the pair took the game out of Sri Lanka's reach.\n\nAt first Stokes was watchful but he then became increasingly aggressive in his 93-ball 62, which included three sixes and four fours, and he was only dismissed when he received a brilliant delivery from Perera which pitched outside leg and hit off stump.\n\nButtler batted in a similar vein, becoming more aggressive during his 35, and debutant Foakes once again made an impression.\n\nIn the first innings he batted calmly for his debut century but on day three showed his ability to attack when the situation requires, scoring 37 off 34 balls with three sixes.\n\nThe performance did little to answer the questions about the balance of England's team, where they seem to have plenty of middle order batsmen but few scoring runs in the top three.\n\n'I took risks at the right time' - reaction\n\nEngland opener Keaton Jennings on BBC Radio 5 live: \"It would be huge to win this game. We have six sessions to do it, the pitch is harder under foot and starting to crumble, we can create 10 chances.\n\n\"What pleased me most is that we are in a position where we can push on and win.

and now turns more attention on manager Hughes.\n\nReed arrived when Saints were in the third tier of English football and worked alongside managers such as Pochettino and Koeman when Southampton established themselves in the upper reaches of the Premier League.\n\nSouthampton also defied logic by flourishing despite constant managerial changes and the regular sale of their prized assets - particularly the likes of Van Dijk, Mane and Lallana to Liverpool.\n\nReed, however, had also been working in tandem with Pellegrino during his failed regime that saw a struggle against relegation last season and while the late appointment of Hughes saw Saints stay up, they now sit only one point above the relegation places after the 6-1 thrashing at Manchester City last Sunday.\n\nSouthampton's statement said it was time to take \"constructive action\" and also confirmed a review into the club's football operation has begun.\n\nIt remains to be seen what ramifications Reed's departure has for Hughes but it has certainly increased the urgency for him to get results.", "Image caption The isolated case involves Boghead Farm in Lumsden\n\nFour cattle culled at a farm in Aberdeenshire where BSE was discovered did not have the disease, tests have revealed.\n\nSo-called \"mad cow disease\" was discovered last month at Boghead Farm in Lumsden.\n\nThree \"cohort\" animals of the confirmed case and one offspring were culled and sent for testing at a specialist facility in Dumfries.\n\nInvestigations are under way to try to trace the source of the outbreak.\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"We welcome the news that the precautionary tests recently carried out on a further four animals were negative for BSE.\n\n\"\u200eVets from the Animal and Plant Health Agency have now commenced a veterinary epidemiological investigation to establish, if possible, the source of the disease.\"\n\nThe farmer involved -

Senator Susan Collins and Mitt Romney said it should not be impeded in any way.\n\nMr Mueller is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, resulting in a series of criminal charges against several Trump associates.\n\nMr Trump has vehemently denied any collusion took place, and repeatedly called for the inquiry to be shut down, calling it \"the greatest political witch hunt in history\".\n\nDemocrats see this latest move as an attempt to do just that.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chuck Schumer: Timing of Sessions' firing 'suspect'\n\n\"It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions' firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine and end Special Counsel Mueller's investigation,\" Ms Pelosi - a front-runner to become speaker of the House of Representatives following this week's mid-terms - tweeted.\n\nShe went on to argue that, \"given his record of threats to undermine and weaken the Russia investigation\", Mr Whitaker should follow in Mr Sessions' footsteps and recuse himself.\n\nHer words were echoed by Democratic party Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who added: \"Clearly, the president has something to hide.\"\n\nWhy was Sessions fired?\n\nThe sacking followed months of Mr Trump criticising Mr Sessions, mainly for his decision to step aside from the Russia inquiry in March 2017.\n\nMr Sessions removed himself from the probe after Democrats accused him of failing to disclose contacts he had had with the Russian ambassador as a senior adviser to Mr Trump's campaign.\n\nIn July 2017 Mr Trump told the New York Times: \"Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Relations between Trump and Sessions soured in 2017\n\nIn a resignation letter, Mr Sessions - a former Alabama senator who was an early supporter of Mr Trump - made clear the decision to go was not his own.\n\n\"Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation,\" he wrote in an undated letter.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nMr Whitaker can now assume control of the Mueller inquiry, which has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until now.\n\nThe president cannot directly fire the special counsel. But Mr Sessions's replacement will have the power to do so, or end the inquiry.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Matthew Whitaker was announced as the acting attorney general\n\nMr Whitaker expressed concerns over the investigation. In August 2017, he wrote a piece for CNN in which he stated that looking into Mr Trump's personal finances, or those of his family, \"goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel\".\n\nHe went on to call on Mr Rosenstein to \"order Mueller to limit the scope of the investigation\" or risk the inquiry starting \"to look like a political fishing expedition\".\n\nThe deputy attorney general appointed Mr Mueller to lead the inquiry after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey in 2017.\n\nThe special counsel has also been investigating whether Mr Comey's firing amounted to obstruction of justice.\n\nThere has also been a question mark over Mr Rosenstein's future since it was alleged that he had discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Trump.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Mueller probe?\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington\n\nThere had already been hints that Robert Mueller's pre-election \"quiet period\" was about to come to an end. And, in fact, if the former FBI director is as meticulous as he's reputed to be, he might have already made plans to deal with exactly this contingency.\n\nThat's stepping into the unknown, however.\n\nWhat's certain is that if the special counsel tries to issue new indictments or expand his inquiry, Matthew Whitaker is now in a position to rebuff those requests. If Mr Mueller files a report detailing his conclusions, the new acting attorney general could keep the document from ever becoming public.\n\nThose would be half-measures and insurance policies to limit damage. The president may also decide to instruct Mr Whitaker to fire the entire Mueller team - something Mr Trump says he has the power to do.\n\nThere's some doubt about whether the president is right, but with the mid-terms behind him he could be itching to settle this Mueller business once and for all. And he's one step closer to being able to do just that.\n\nThat almost certainly wouldn't be the end of this story, but it's the beginning of a new, fraught chapter.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images; Reuters Image caption Possible attorney general candidates Rudy Giuliani (left), Pam Bondi (left-centre), Lindsey Graham (right-centre) and Chris Christie (right)\n\nWho could replace him?\n\nMr Whitaker is not tipped to remain in the top role for long.

You hear about team rooms, cryotherapy chambers and altitude rooms, but rarely - if ever - get a chance to enter the inner sanctum.\n\nHowever on the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast, we were invited behind-the-scenes in the Wales camp.\n\nWith hooker Ken Owens as our tour guide, we were given exclusive insight into the Centre of Excellence, a world-class facility designed to prepare the players for the rigours of Test rugby.\n\nSporting a broken nose - something regularly referenced by his sympathetic team-mates - Owens is up against it from the start, as fly-half Dan Biggar yanks down his shorts before scampering off to lunch.\n\n\"He has been spending too much time with James Haskell up at Northampton,\" Owens mutters before regaining his composure.\n\nAfter watching a unit session from the balcony, with head coach Warren Gatland taking a hands-on role, we wander into 'The Barn', an indoor training facility equipped with a 3G pitch.\n\nA broken nose helped Ken Owens avoid the cryotherapy for the day\n\nCaptain Alun Wyn Jones and kicking coach Neil Jenkins are deep in conversation, while head of strength and conditioning Paul Stridgeon and podcast co-host Ugo Monye share an intimate embrace, recalling their friendship from the Lions tour of South Africa in 2009.\n\n\"We got a lot closer back in 2009!\" Stridgeon quips.\n\n\"Paul brings the energy and keeps pushing you hard,\" adds Owens. \"He's a great addition to our management, an all round good bloke, and he's learning Welsh as well.\"\n\nWho's in charge of the music?\n\nFrom 'The Barn' we go into the gym, where some of the backroom staff, led by the granite-chested Huw Bennett, have taken the opportunity to shift some tin of their own with some 1990s R&B an unusual soundtrack: \"No-one really is taking ownership of the music,\" Owens laments.\n\nThe gym is next door to the Altitude Room: \"It takes the oxygen out of the room and makes your body work a lot harder. You are training at a higher level, and it's a lot tougher to be in here than at the stadium,\" Owens explains.\n\nAs we walk back across The Barn, full-back Leigh Halfpenny does a quick session on a bike - in between stints in the Cryotherapy Chamber - while scrum-half Aled Davies spends half an hour practising his passing as he works his way back to match sharpness.\n\n\"As a professional rugby player you take pride in what you are doing, and you know what you need to do to be right for the Saturday - whether that is extra recovery or extra skill work,\" Owens says.\n\nBecause of his stitched-up nose, Owens has escaped cryotherapy for the day - where temperatures plummet to minus 130 degrees - although Alun Wyn Jones and Rhys Patchell have not been so lucky. We bump into both men as they emerge from the frosty chamber in masks, gloves, long socks and clogs.\n\nWhat will Davies follow up his John Cena try celebration with?\n\n\"The whole process of the Cryotherapy is to take the blood from the extremities of the body to the core, so when you come out more red blood cells flow round the body,\" adds Owens.\n\n\"It's not dangerous, it's about being smart. I have seen a couple of instances when boys have perhaps rushed it and not been quite dry enough and had a little bit of surface burning. But it is not too serious. It is worth it, it definitely helps.\"\n\nWho fancies a trip to the pub?\n\nFollowing lunch in the team room, with protein ice cream a welcome dessert for Monye, George North and Jonathan Davies stop by to join us on the podcast. Both men seem re-energised and relaxed on their return to Wales colours.\n\nDavies discusses his next try celebration, after mimicking WWE great John Cena following his score against Scotland, while North opens up on how settled he feels back in Wales after his stint in England with Northampton.\n\nOur final stop is to watch the afternoon training session on the outdoor pitch, where the extended Wales squad go through their drills on an identical surface to the Principality Stadium - from the dimensions to the Desso grass.\n\nWales' long-standing team manager Alan 'Thumper' Phillips offers us a cup of tea, as defence guru Shaun Edwards prepares some light defensive drills.

A point was the least they needed to have a chance of qualifying for the last 16 but winning was amazing, and now they are in a strong position to make the knock-out stage.\n\nSubstitutions changed the game\n\nThis was not a great United performance but it was an outstanding result. United deserved their win because they took their chances and Juve didn't.\n\nAnd, if you can come to Allianz Stadium and take three points from a team as good as Juve, then you have done something right.\n\nAs I said on 5 live, I would not single out any of United's players for praise. They worked hard, but nobody stood out,\n\nMata and Fellaini replaced Ander Herrera and Alexis Sanchez with 11 minutes to go. A few minutes earlier, Marcus Rashford came on for Jesse Lingard\n\nIt was their substitutes, Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini, who helped make the difference after coming on in the 79th minute, so Mourinho deserves credit for that change.\n\nWith Fellaini on the pitch, Juve fell back and became more defensive. That changed the balance in midfield and left Juve disjointed.\n\nStraight after Mata had put United's equaliser in the net, I saw Fellaini drop back into a holding position alongside Nemanja Matic to shore things up.\n\nBut he went jogging forward into the box for Ashley Young's free-kick a couple of minutes later and caused panic in the Juve defence.\n\nFor the ball to bounce in off Sandro's head was an ugly way for United to clinch the win but it gave them the result they wanted, so who cares?\n\nUnited need more luck on Sunday\n\nWednesday was the third time in their past six matches that United have come from a goal down to win.\n\nIf you keep beating teams like that - from behind and without playing especially well - then that starts to build belief.\n\nYou always think you have a chance in any game, even if you concede first, and also if you are not playing well - which is the way you could describe some of United's performances in the past few weeks.\n\nIn Turin, yet again, they stayed in the game and did not allow Juve to get too far in front, then got a bit of luck at the end to win it through Alex Sandro's own goal.\n\nWith a bit more luck, they might be able to get something out of Manchester City at Etihad Stadium on Sunday too, but they will need some extra quality as well.\n\nUnited are seventh, nine points behind leaders Manchester City\n\nMan City are better than Juve\n\nI am expecting the Manchester derby to follow the same pattern as Wednesday night, with City having more possession and United defending for long periods.\n\nUnfortunately for United, if City create chances like Juve did - and the Italian champions had two other clear-cut openings as well as their goal - then City will score.

Massively watch out for her.\"\n\nDid you know: Atapattu is the first Sri Lankan woman to play in the big overseas T20 leagues - lining up for Yorkshire Diamonds in England's Super League, and for Melbourne Renegades in Australia's Big Bash.\n\nDeandra Dottin (West Indies)\n\nRole: Right-handed middle-order batter, right-arm seamer\n\nT20 international record: 102 games; 2,089 runs (average 25.47, two centuries); 46 wickets (average 20.00, economy rate 6.27)\n\n2018 form: An unremarkable year by her standards, averaging under 20 in eight T20I appearances - with a 44-ball 59 in an ODI being a highlight.\n\nEbony's view: \"She's broken records before, and she can bowl some of the most lethal yorkers at the death.\n\n\"Although she's not fired for a long time, she's a quality player. I saw she took three wickets in a warm-up game - and playing at home, I'd watch out for her.\"\n\nDid you know: Dottin's century against South Africa in the opening match of the 2010 tournament, from 38 balls, was the first scored in women's T20 internationals. It remained the fastest in men's or women's T20 international cricket until beaten by David Miller and Rohit Sharma (both 35 balls) in 2017.\n\nSophia Dunkley (England)\n\nRole: Right-handed middle-order batter, leg-spin bowler\n\nT20 international record: Uncapped\n\n2018 form: Won the Kia Super League with Surrey Stars, impressing coach Mark Robinson enough to name her as one of three uncapped - and uncontracted - players in the England squad.\n\nEbony's view: \"When a team think they've got you on the ropes, she can come in at six or seven, knock the ball around, hit a couple of boundaries and change the dynamic of a game.\n\n\"She's got some handy leg-spin and she's an interesting player I'm looking forward to seeing.\"\n\nDid you know: Although this is her first official England call-up, Dunkley trained with the full side during the summer series against New Zealand.\n\nAshleigh Gardner (Australia)\n\nRole: Right-handed batter, off-spin bowler\n\nT20 international record: 17 games; 220 runs (average 18.33, strike rate 136.64); 11 wickets (average 24.81, economy rate 7.00)\n\n2018 form: Established herself at number three for Australia, recently hit 63 not out from 37 balls against Pakistan.\n\nEbony's view: \"She can be absolutely destructive when it comes to batting - she scored a hundred in the Women's Big Bash League last year. She hasn't played in the Super League, although I'm sure everybody wants her, and her potential is incredible.\n\n\"We know Australia have Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry, but if Gardner fires, it's going to be very dangerous.\"\n\nDid you know: Last year, Gardner became the first indigenous Australian to play for the national women's cricket team since 1958.\n\nAmelia Kerr (New Zealand)\n\nRole: Right-handed batter, leg-spin bowler\n\nT20 international record: 17 games; 22 runs (average 5.50, strike rate 81.48); 14 wickets (average 23.78, economy rate 5.66)\n\n2018 form: Burst on to the scene at age 17, hitting a world record ODI score of 232 not out against Ireland in June - then took 5-17 in the same game.\n\nEbony's view: \"She's a young leg-spinner who made history with that double century and five wickets against Ireland. She's only just turned 18 and is a serious talent.\n\n\"Spin is always important in women's T20, and she has an excellent googly which she doesn't mind bowling first ball. With that potential variation on West Indies wickets, she will be vital to watch.\"\n\nDid you know: Kerr comes from a cricketing family - her maternal grandfather Bruce Murray played 13 Tests for New Zealand between 1968 and 1971, while her father Robbie Kerr played first-class cricket for Wellington.\n\nLizelle Lee (South Africa)\n\nRole: Right-handed opener\n\nT20 international record: 53 games; 1,107 runs (average 24.06, strike rate 103.45)\n\n2018 form: Smashed 104 from 58 balls in the final to help Surrey Stars win the Super League. Hit three half-centuries for the Proteas, flogging England for six sixes in a 37-ball 68 at Taunton in June.\n\nEbony's view: \"She's the best ball striker in the game, as she showed with that hundred in the Super League final. If it's her day, pitch the ball in her half and it's going out of the park.\n\n\"She used to go gung-ho from ball one, but over the past couple of years, she's learned to be patient. Now, you might see her nudging the ball around for two or three overs and that's where she's most dangerous.\"\n\nDid you know: Lee played for Somerset in the Women's County Championship in 2015, alongside England vice-captain Anya Shrubsole - also turning out in club cricket for Bath where her team-mates included BBC Test Match Special commentator Isabelle Westbury.\n\nSmriti Mandhana (India)\n\nRole: Left-handed opener, vice-captain\n\nT20 international record: 47 games; 868 runs (average 21.17, strike rate 112.28)\n\n2018 form: Started the year well, hit T20 half-centuries against South Africa and Australia, and two against England, averaging 49 from eight innings between February and March - but has only averaged 10 from 10 since June.\n\nEbony's view: \"I'd say the best cricketers I've watched in the last 10 years in the women's game would be Australia captain Meg Lanning, and Smriti Mandhana.\n\n\"She's an unbelievable talent, a very classical left-hander who's beautiful to watch but hits with so much ease - the sixes go flying but it looks effortless. If she gets going, India will qualify, simple as that. If she doesn't, I think they might struggle.\"\n\nDid you know: Mandhana top scored in the Super League with 421 runs from nine innings for Western Storm, including a century at Old Trafford - but had to miss Finals Day to attend an India training camp.\n\nHayley Matthews (West Indies)\n\nRole: Right-handed opener, off-spin bowler, vice-captain\n\nT20 international record: 33 games; 641 runs (average 20.03, strike rate 107.19); 34 wickets (average 16.79, economy rate 5.83)\n\n2018 form: Was top scorer in the West Indies' regional T20 championship, and recently hit 70 from 52 balls against South Africa.\n\nEbony's view: \"When West Indies won this tournament in 2016, she hit a quickfire 66 off 45 balls in the final against Australia.\n\n\"She was only 18 then, now at 20 she's going to be at home, she's matured as a player and she's definitely one to watch.\"\n\nDid you know: Matthews is not only the number two all-rounder in the ICC women's T20 rankings (behind her captain Stafanie Taylor), but her all-round skills also extend to throwing the javelin, the sport at which she represented Barbados up to under-18 level.\n\nEbony's verdict: Who will reach the semi-finals?\n\nCould India and West Indies meet in the semi-finals?\n\n\"England will get through - but their chances of winning the tournament might depend on whether they finish first or second in Group A. If they finish first and Australia finish first in Group B, they won't meet in the semi-finals. If they end up clashing, that could cause a problem.\n\n\"It's a tough call, but I'm going for South Africa to go through with them as they're a little more disciplined than West Indies. Bangladesh have been starting to win games in the Asia Cup, where they've beaten India and Pakistan. While they might not qualify, they might cause an upset.\n\n\"Australia will qualify from Group B. I might give India a shout because of Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur. New Zealand might miss out this time, which is rare because they're a very good team, but I think they might just miss the boat.\"\n\nAnd what about Ireland?\n\n\"While they have qualified for the past couple of T20 tournaments, they've been disappointing and we've not seen consistency from them.

With the ink barely dry on the ballot papers, Jeff Sessions was fired. Why? Well, the attorney general's job is to represent the US in legal matters and give advice to the president. But on a crucial issue, Mr Sessions refused to do that. He stepped aside from the investigation into links between the president and Russia because of a potential conflict of interest. Mr Trump felt that move let him down and left him exposed.\n\nThe BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington says the duty of overseeing the Russia probe has now shifted to a man who has been a critic of it. It's possible this is just the opening move of a White House effort to shut it down, our correspondent adds.\n\nShortly before Sessions' defenestration, the president offered an olive branch to his rival Democrats after they seized control of the House of Representatives. It means they can investigate Mr Trump's business affairs, including tax returns, while thwarting his legislative agenda. The president suggested the parties could co-operate on issues such as infrastructure, trade and health - but threatened to adopt a \"warlike posture\" if they started serving legal writs against him. The mood at the press conference was testy to say the least and led to a stand-up row with one reporter.\n\nWe've got so much good stuff to help you make sense of the mid-terms.

Kids themselves also need to learn how they're being \"datafied\" - and what to do about it - she says, while the government should look at introducing tougher data protection laws.

Everyone has an opinion and it's as valuable as that - i.e. not very\".\n\nHe added that he did not think Hamilton would necessarily win each year in this fictional battle.\n\n\"But if they kept coming back every year to do battle in some sort of Valhalla-type confrontation, more often than not it would be Lewis wearing the crown at the end of the year,\" Allison said.\n\nBBC Sport asked readers on 28 October to vote for their greatest driver of all time - the results are below.\n\nAllison worked with Schumacher at Ferrari from 2000-05, with Alonso at two teams - Renault from 2005-06 and Ferrari from 2013-14 - and with Vettel at Ferrari from 2015-16.\n\nAsked to analyse how Hamilton differed from the other three, Allison said: \"Of that cluster, I think he is the quickest, at his best, and he shows us his best extremely frequently.\n\n\"I think he is the best of those in qualifying. It's not by accident that he is the all-time pole record holder. He just has a better turn of speed than the others.\n\n\"He has a record of finding clean but utterly improbable overtakes that surpasses the others. [Hamilton is] maybe not quite at Michael's machine-like consistency, season-in, season-out, year after year. But the Lewis we have seen in the past two seasons here is flawless.\"\n\nFour-time champion Alain Prost told the programme Hamilton had performed \"in a very brilliant way sometimes\" in 2018 as he and Mercedes defeated Vettel and Ferrari.\n\n\"From the beginning, we knew it could be an interesting year and it has been even more interesting than we thought,\" Prost said.\n\n\"At the beginning of the year, the Ferrari was maybe a little bit better, a little bit more consistent. And then we had a fight between the teams and also between the drivers and the psychology of the drivers.\n\n\"We have reached the point where everybody can say that Mercedes [have come out on top] on one side - but more than the teams, the drivers, Lewis has done a fantastic job this year.\n\n\"Just look at his calm when things are not going well. And he has performed in a very brilliant way sometimes in qualifying and races. On the other side, Sebastian did some mistakes, much more than he is used to doing in the past.\n\n\"Lewis really deserved his titles this year, maybe one of the best of his five.\"\n\nDamon Hill, the 1996 world champion, added that Hamilton's ability to create the balance he wanted, in both professional and private spheres, had been decisive in enabling him to raise his game in the past two seasons.\n\n\"At times [in previous years] it looked like he was a little bit distracted,\" Hill said, \"and maybe he had a bit too much jet lag, because there were some races when you thought: 'Well, hang on, where's Lewis gone?'\n\n\"And he has to admit that was true - sometimes he went missing and maybe his off-track lifestyle was contributing to that.\n\n\"But when you look now at what he's done, you'd have to say he has provided himself with the happiness and contentment in his other life that you need in order to be able to cope with this intense experience of being an F1 driver.\n\n\"He has taken the pressure off himself. But he has these other things he does and then he can turn up, jump in and win. So there's a smartness. To know yourself that well and to create the right conditions is part of the job of a sportsman, and Lewis has done that.\"", "Video\n\nRick Astley has headlined a secret gig at a student bar, organised within a few hours.\n\nThe pop star, famous for his 1987 hit, Never Gonna Give You Up, asked to appear at King's College, Cambridge.\n\nThe hour-long, Tuesday night gig followed his official tour date at the Cambridge Corn Exchange.\n\nOrganisers had just 12 hour to arrange it, and students were not told who was going to be performing until 10 minutes beforehand.\n\nEntertainment officers were contacted about Astley's request at 08:00 GMT on Tuesday by his manager's daughter, a former King's student.", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe Duke of York has said his initiative to support entrepreneurs should continue \"engaging\" with Saudi Arabia, despite the killing last month of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nKhashoggi, a critic of Saudi rulers, was killed inside the country's consulate in Istanbul on 2 October.\n\nThe Duke said the journalist's death was an \"awful state of affairs\".\n\nBut he added Pitch@Palace should not stop \"encouraging and supporting, starting and growing businesses\".\n\nHe told the BBC young Saudis should not \"take the blame for something that they had nothing to do with\".\n\nPrince Andrew was talking to Radio 4's Today programme ahead of the latest round of his Pitch@Palace initiative.\n\nThe not-for-profit organisation, which he established in 2014, gives budding entrepreneurs the chance to \"pitch\" to an audience of professionals who could become their mentors, distributors or investors and help them to expand their businesses.\n\nThe events take place twice a year and Thursday's will see 42 entrepreneurs from around the UK coming together at Buckingham Palace to pitch to a room full of top investors and other businesspeople.\n\n'Great success'\n\nPitch@Palace Global holds similar events for entrepreneurs in various countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It's sometimes considered quite a difficult market to enter but they were the first country to ask us to take Pitch outside the UK, and we went in 2015 and it was a great success,\" the Duke told business presenter, Dominic O'Connell.\n\nThe Duke said Khashoggi's killing last month was an \"absolutely awful state of affairs and how and what and why is beyond my knowledge and ability to answer\".\n\nHowever, he added: \"Do I think that we should be engaging with Saudi Arabia?\n\n\"From a Pitch perspective and Pitch alone, I do not believe that we should stop for one moment encouraging and supporting starting and growing businesses.\n\n\"They need to diversify their economy, they've got a very young population that is growing and needing things to do and so if we are just one of a whole range of activities that are going on, then I think that they shouldn't necessarily take the blame for something that they had nothing to do with.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The Duke of York was made chancellor of Huddersfield University in 2015\n\nLast week, University of Huddersfield students called for the Duke's resignation as Chancellor after he spoke about forging further links with Saudi Arabia via Pitch@Palace.\n\n'Appalling record'\n\nSaudi Arabia admits Mr Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in Istanbul last month, but its accounts of what happened have changed several times.\n\nWhen he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive.

These powers allow the police to conduct a search if they have \"'reasonable grounds\" to suspect someone of carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something which could be used to commit a crime, such as a crowbar.\n\nSection 60, on the other hand, allows officers to search anyone in a designated area without \"reasonable grounds\". It applies when the police have intelligence that serious violence has taken place or may take place.\n\nSection 44/47A allows the police to conduct searches when there is \"reasonable suspicion\" an act of terrorism will happen. Before last year it had not been used since 2011, but 149 searches were carried out using the power following the Parsons Green bombing in September 2017.\n\nUnfair targeting\n\nThe police used a combination of all these powers to search 282,000 people across England and Wales last year.\n\nThat represents an 80% drop from the 1.4m searches in the year ending March 2010.\n\nStop and search occurrences began falling in 2009, following fears that it was being used too widely and was unfairly targeting ethnic minorities, especially young black men.\n\nThe government brought in measures to limit its use in 2014 and this led to the creation of a revised code around its use.\n\nSection 60 searches quadruple\n\nWhile stop and search has fallen overall, the Home Office's data reveals that searches carried out under Section 60 rose last year.\n\nIn the year ending March 2018, they quadrupled compared with the previous year - 2,501 were carried out in 2017/18 compared to 631 in 2016/17.\n\nThis was the first rise in Section 60 searches for nine years.\n\nWhen used, Home Office guidance recommends that a Section 60 should initially last no longer than 15 hours.\n\nThe police should publicise - usually through social media - where and for how long a Section 60 order is in place.\n\nFor example, the Metropolitan Police imposed a 15-hour Section 60 order across the whole of this year's Notting Hill Carnival in August. It said the decision was based on \"detailed analysis of intelligence\".\n\nImage copyright Lambeth police / Twitter Image caption Police forces will often use social media to alert the public when a section 60 order is in place\n\nWhy has Section 60 use increased?\n\nMost of the increase in Section 60 stop and and search incidents has been driven by the Metropolitan Police, which carried out 73% of all Section 60 searches last year.\n\nIn an interview with the Evening Standard in April, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said she would give the go-ahead for her officers to use the Section 60 power to crack down on gang violence.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The majority of Section 60 searches are carried out by the Metropolitan Police\n\nThe Met's Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt says the use of Section 60 is an important way of preventing violence.\n\n\"It's a legitimate and powerful tool,\" he told BBC Reality Check.\n\n\"Disputes between young people can quickly turn into violence and Section 60 is a preventative measure based on police intelligence,\" he argues.\n\nDoes stop and search work?\n\nThe government's Serious Violence Strategy, published in April, acknowledges that knife crime, gun crime and homicide have all risen as stop and search has fallen. But it dismisses any link, pointing out that knife crime fell between 2010-11 and 2013-14 - a period that also coincided with a fall in stop and search.\n\nLast year the College of Policing published a study examining Metropolitan Police stop and search data. It found that higher rates of stop and search, under any power, only led to \"very slightly lower than expected rates of crime in the following week or month\".\n\nAnother way of trying to assess the effectiveness of stop and search is to look at arrest rates.\n\nAnd on that measure, the data shows that as fewer people are searched, the more likely those people are to be subsequently arrested.\n\nLast year nearly one in five of the 282,000 people searched under Section One were taken into custody - that compares with almost one in 10 in 2009-10.\n\nThis suggests that as Section One stop and searches fall, it is being better targeted.\n\nThe statistics also reveal that 87 people subjected to Section 60 searches last year were found to be in possession of a weapon, a total of 3.5% of all Section 60 searches.\n\nAdvocates of stop and search say it needs to increase to act as a deterrent. A report published by the Centre for Social Justice - a think tank founded by the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan-Smith - said that some young people were no longer scared of the police, because they believed the risk of being searched was now very low.\n\nOn the other hand, if stop and search is used too widely, it can create resentment between the public and the police, argues Leroy Logan, a former Metropolitan Police superintendent.\n\nHe says this can worsen community intelligence and that the answer to rising knife crime lies in better engagement with young people.\n\nWhat do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

But Armistice Day wasn't always so sombre.\n\nAt 11:00 on Tuesday 11 November 1919, ex-service personnel, relatives and friends of the dead and millions of others gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Great War.\n\nA year after the conflict had ended, villages, towns and cities held parades, church services and observed two minutes' silence.\n\nThat was during the day. The evening of 11 November was different. Thousands of people - most of them young - wanted to have fun.\n\n\"Victory balls\" - charity fundraising events involving fancy dress, dancing, singing and copious drinking - were held to cater for this need.\n\nPath\u00e9 footage of the biggest ball that year, held at London's Royal Albert Hall, shows partygoers in costumes including turbans, doublets and hose, and a stars-and-stripes dress. One imperious-looking woman poses as Britannia.\n\n\"These events often had a celebratory air about them, as soldiers wanted to mark the fact that they had lived through the war,\" says Chris Kempshall, teaching fellow in modern European history at the University of Sussex.\n\n\"They celebrated with their comrades and marked the sacrifices of their fellows by living and enjoying their own lives.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The 1918 Armistice saw mass celebrations in the UK\n\nThe balls continued, raising money for veterans and charities.\n\nVictory Dance, a poem by the writer and academic Alfred Noyes published in 1920, showed disgust at the frivolity on show:\n\nShadows of dead men\n\nStand by the wall,\n\nWatching the fun\n\nOf the Victory Ball.\n\nBut any criticism remained muted until, on 19 October 1925, the Times newspaper published a letter from Richard \"Dick\" Sheppard, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, central London.\n\nHe called for the annual Albert Hall ball to be cancelled.\n\n\"Dancing is frequently the obvious and fitting form of gratefully commemorating a glad event,\" he wrote, \"but a fancy dress ball on a vast scale as a tribute to the Great Deliverance which followed on the unspeakable agony of 1914-1918 seems to me not so much irreligious as indecent.\"\n\nSheppard, who had been chaplain to a military hospital in France during the war, argued that balls and similar \"thoughtless and ill-conceived\" celebrations in hotels and restaurants \"should not be encouraged, at least while this generation retains the heartache of a tender and thankful remembrance\".\n\nImage copyright Hulton Archive Image caption Alfred Noyes was an early critic of Armistice balls\n\nThe Times was inundated with letters agreeing or denouncing Sheppard as a killjoy.\n\nOne contributor, described as \"Company Commander\", argued that, as the sole survivor of four brothers, \"the last thing that they would wish is that they should stand in the way of our enjoying ourselves\".\n\nBut another contributor, Roger Lawrence, agreed with Sheppard, saying a fancy dress ball was \"grotesque\" and a \"piece of vulgarity\".\n\nThe popular press, sensing the value of the controversy, took it further. The Daily Mail campaigned for the balls to end for fear of offending the bereaved. It claimed upper-class socialites, some of whom had not served, were enjoying themselves at the expense of the fallen.\n\nHowever, the Daily Express, engaged in a sales war with its rival, championed the rights of veterans to have a good time and relive their camaraderie, having risked their lives in war.\n\nThe Archbishops of Canterbury and York took the same position as the Mail.\n\nEventually the Albert Hall Victory Ball's organiser, Lord Northampton, gave in to the appeals, postponing it to 12 November. For 11 November, existing ticket holders could attend a service of remembrance - conducted by Sheppard.\n\nWho was Richard \"Dick\" Sheppard?\n\nBorn in Windsor in 1880, Sheppard volunteered for service in the Second Boer War, but was injured on his way to the train station, leaving him unable to serve and disabled for life\n\nHe took part in the BBC's first religious broadcast, in 1924, but had to stop work on the radio in 1926 because of asthma-related problems\n\nIn 1927, he announced his conversion to pacifism\n\nAfter Sheppard died in 1937, 100,000 people filed past his coffin\n\nSource: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n\nThe number of balls dwindled during the late 1920s, when Armistice Day began to take on the more or less entirely sober character it has today.\n\nOne former officer stopped taking part in commemorations, describing them as \"too much like attending one's own funeral\".\n\n\"Set against the sombre nature of these moments is the fact that, in reality, 88% of British soldiers survived the First World War,\" says Dr Kempshall, \"and they wanted to be able to undertake their own commemorations and activities in the light of that fact.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption VE Day is remembered for its party atmosphere\n\nThe debate during the 1920s must be seen in the context of society at the time, argues Elisabeth Shipton, author of Female Tommies: The Frontline Women of the First World War.\n\n\"With a rise in pacifism and growing austerity, parties with alcohol, dancing and excess were felt to be increasingly inappropriate,\" she says.\n\n\"Furthermore, was it a 'victory' given such a large of loss of life?\"\n\nAround 750,000 UK military personnel died during World War One. But, while almost 400,000 UK service personnel died during World War Two, commemorations of Victory in Europe (VE) Day have a far jollier tone, dancers and actors re-enacting famous scenes of the street celebrations of 8 May 1945.\n\nWhat is sometimes forgotten is that UK cities also saw spontaneous parties when the Armistice was announced on 11 November 1918. Thousands massed outside Buckingham Palace, as in 1945.\n\nYet the differences in commemoration continue.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"The two world wars set the tone for how we understand and rationalise wars in this country,\" says Dr Kempshall.\n\nThe crimes of the Nazi Reich make it easier to see the opponent as \"clearly 'evil'\", while much of the popular memory of World War One is of \"mud, blood, trenches and incompetent generals\", he adds.\n\nWorld War One \"appeared to be less conclusively resolved\", meaning it \"has a huge impact in how we talk about modern wars like Iraq and Afghanistan which have mixed outcomes and, at times, limited popular support\".\n\nCharity-supporting balls, held on or around 11 November, are making a slight comeback in the UK, US and around the Commonwealth, notes Ms Shipton.\n\nBut Sheppard's view of Armistice Day, shaped by his time tending to wounded and dying soldiers on the Western Front, continues to dominate.", "Image copyright Holly McGlynn\n\nWe're all used to seeing pictures of adorable newborns on our social media feeds, bundled up and button-nosed.\n\nBut what's seen less often is the reality of a woman's body at 40 weeks pregnant, usually tired and anxious about the journey ahead.\n\nBlogger Clemmie Telford bared (nearly) all in May with a photo of herself taken on the day her third child was due - sitting on the loo in her knickers, make-up free and staring at the viewer.\n\nNow she's followed that up with a naked picture of herself with daughter Greta at nine months old on the same toilet, captioning it \"40 weeks in vs 40 weeks out\".\n\n'Strength and tension'\n\nHer expression is worlds apart from that in the first picture, smiling with joy as she holds her little girl.\n\nSo why did she want to share such uncompromising pictures with the world?\n\n\"The first picture was taken as part of a series (by photographer Lara Downie)\", explains Clemmie, curator of Mother of all Lists.\n\n\"As my second child had been born on that toilet, I said: 'Why don't you get a picture of me here?'.\n\nImage copyright Lara Downie/Ben Telford Image caption Clemmie says there's a stark contrast between the two images\n\n\"When the image came back, I wasn't sure if I liked it - but I respected it.

Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others.\n\nIt has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to his heartfelt \"black spider\" handwritten letters raising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention.\n\nIt has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop?\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Brady Image caption Prince Charles alongside his grandson Prince George\n\nThose who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his \"campaigning\".\n\nPrince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother.\n\nHowever, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king.\n\n\"You operate,\" he says in the BBC documentary, \"within the constitutional parameters.\"\n\nIt is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power.\n\nWhat has he campaigned on?\n\nArchitecture\n\nIn 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London.\n\nHe said it looked like a \"vast municipal fire station\" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend\".\n\nIndeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years.\n\nAnd this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation.\n\nIn 1992, he said: \"I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness.\"\n\nClimate change\n\nThe heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability.\n\nIn 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment.\n\nHe added: \"Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic.\"\n\nBBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: \"The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change.\n\n\"It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat.\"\n\nWildlife conservation\n\nPrince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, he said: \"With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left.\"\n\nHomeopathy\n\nPrince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself.\n\nIn 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy.\n\nClarence House later said: \"Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics.\"", "Image copyright Scott Barbour\n\nA two-minute silence on Armistice Day has been observed since the first anniversary of the end of World War One in 1919.

Town in 1862 and was a pupil at the city's George Watson's College.\n\nImage copyright Bettmann Image caption Armistice Day at the London Cenotaph in Whitehall in 1925\n\nAccording to research by writer and educator Joan Abrahams, Mr Brydone emigrated to South Africa when he was 22 and carved out a successful career in insurance.\n\nDuring World War One, Mr Brydone, by then in his 50s, was a member of the town council in Cape Town.\n\nImage caption Robert Rutherford Brydone was born and raised in Edinburgh\n\nMs Abrahams' research says Mr Brydone was actively involved with the recruiting meetings in the city's Drill Hall.\n\nAt a meeting held early in 1915, it is reported a man in the audience said: \"You will forget us as soon as we are gone.\"\n\nMr Brydone is said to have promised that the city would not forget its sons during their absence.\n\nImage caption A bust of RR Brydone gifted by the Cape Town authorities\n\nAs an outward sign, he arranged a monthly meeting to remember the soldiers fighting in Europe.\n\nIn early 1918, Mr Brydone and Cape Town mayor Sir Harry Hands decided to take the remembrance further.\n\nThe death of Sir Harry's eldest son in the war led them to consider new ways of marking soldiers' sacrifice.\n\nMr Brydone suggested the firing of the city's Noonday Gun could mark a \"pause\" in activity during which people could pray for the men fighting in the war.\n\nAccording to Ms Abrahams, Mr Brydone and Sir Harry organised an area of the city where the traffic would be brought to a standstill for the duration of the pause and the first silence was observed at Cartwright's Corner in Adderley Street on 14 May 1918.\n\nAs soon as the city fell silent, a trumpeter on the balcony of the Fletcher and Cartwright's Building on the corner of Adderley and Darling Streets sounded the Last Post.\n\nThe Reveille was played at the end of the midday pause.\n\nArticles in the newspapers described how trams, taxis and private vehicles stopped, pedestrians came to a halt and most men bared their heads.\n\nThe pause was originally three minutes but was reduced to two \"in order to better retain its hold on the people\".\n\nImage copyright Jeff J Mitchell\n\nIt was repeated daily for the duration of the war and only ended in December, after the conclusion of the conflict.\n\nThe stated aim of the pause was silent remembrance, fulfilling a debt of honour to the fallen and demonstrating to those who survived that the sacrifice of the dead did not go unnoticed or unappreciated.\n\nAnother South African, Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, is rightly credited as being the driving force behind the annual two-minute silence on Armistice Day.\n\nHe took the idea to King George V who introduced it on the first anniversary of the end of the war and it has been repeated around the world ever since.\n\nHowever, Ms Abrahams says Sir Percy acknowledged that the idea came from Mr Brydone's Cape Town pause.\n\nHe said that other towns followed its example but \"nothing was as dramatic as the Cape Town observation simply because of the midday gun\".\n\nIn Cape Town there is a plaque entitled \"commemoration of an honourable tradition\".\n\nIt reads: \"When the Noonday gun was fired from the Lion Battery, Signal Hill, on 14 May 1918, it brought Cape Town to a dead stop for a Two-Minute Silence.\n\n\"One minute in 'Remembrance for those who died for their cause', one minute in 'gratitude' for survivors.\n\n\"The idea was initiated by Mr RR Brydon and the mayor of Cape Town, Sir Harry Hands.\n\n\"Sir Percy Fitzpatrick submitted the

The Fraser of Allander report suggests that could be 2.7% per year until 2021-22.\n\nThat would push health spending to 50% of Holyrood's budget, having been 41% at the start of this decade.\n\nHowever, the report points to pressures for spending increases on health and social care that could require a 3.5% annual increase each year, if public health measures fail to cut back the growth in demand for health services.\n\nThe less constrained budget means Mr Mackay can also protect the SNP priorities of police, childcare, universities and welfare.\n\nBut the Fraser of Allander economists reckon that would mean a 4% squeeze on non-priority areas, such as councils, by the 2021 election.\n\nImage caption Derek Mackay and the Scottish government \"face challenging decisions\", according to the Fraser of Allander Institute\n\nIt notes that budgets are projected to rise up to 2021, but that even then, the impact of a decade of squeezed public spending is a cut of about 7% per head.\n\nThat picture could be altered by the amount of Scottish income tax revenue, which last year came in below expectations. Mr Mackay could again reject calls to mirror Westminster's tax cut for higher earners, while again redistributing the tax burden.\n\nToday's report on budget options is positive about the growing political pressure for sweeping reform of council tax, to remove its unfairness.\n\nIt says there are options for taxes on tourists, workplace parking or vacant land, though they would not raise significant revenue.\n\nIt goes on to highlight what it calls \"a strong case for reform of council tax,\" saying \"political momentum for reform appears to be growing, and the enthusiasm for reform held by the Scottish Green Party - who have supported the minority government's budget proposals in the last two years - will push this issue further up the agenda\".\n\nOne option could be a repeated change to the ratios between council bands, having implemented one in 2017. That could raise just over \u00a3100m next year, and make bills less unfair, \"but it would not address the underlying weaknesses with council tax\".\n\nIncome tax\n\nIf Mr Mackay were to add a penny on the basic, intermediate or higher rates of income tax, as he did last year, he could raise about \u00a3170m, \u00a3130m or \u00a360m respectively.\n\nTo raise the threshold at which higher earners start paying higher rate tax, from \u00a343,400 to \u00a350,000, is calculated to reduce revenue by \u00a3280m.\n\nTo illustrate ways that ministers could address long-term spending pressures, the Strathclyde economists model a \u00a37,000 annual tuition fee for Scottish students, backed by loans, saying that could eventually save the Scottish government \u00a3800m per year.\n\nThe report says \"further tweaks to income tax are possible, but the government will, in time, need to consider a wider range of options to raise revenue and/or take a more strategic look at areas of the public sector where cutbacks will have to be made, no matter how politically challenging\".\n\nDavid Eiser, lead author of the report, commented: \"Over time, such incremental changes to spending priorities are amounting to a substantial change in the distribution of the Scottish budget.\n\n\"in the last two Scottish budgets, the finance secretary raised money from income tax. These changes have been progressive, but opened up a tax differential with the rest of the UK that is increasingly visible for Scotland's 14% highest income taxpayers.\n\n\"The finance secretary does have other options to raise revenue, but may need to consider other ideas over the longer terms,\" he added. \"Austerity may be ending, but the Scottish government will still face challenging decisions on revenue raising and the distribution of expenditure.\"", "Image caption Kati Rossi was looking for a second-hand bookshelf\n\nWith her daughter and baby son, Kati Rossi is prowling a suburb of Helsinki in the hunt for a second-hand bookshelf.\n\nAcross the road looms a Swedish furniture giant, but Kati is scouring a huge municipal re-use centre instead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to IKEA,\u201d she tells me. \"I will find something much more interesting here, and much more original.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have the same furniture as everyone else.

He came up with a three-storey, curved structure that allowed every room to have good sea views.\n\nDuring its heyday, theatre stars performing at the nearby Winter Gardens, such as George Formby, Jimmy Clitheroe and Billy Bennett, were guests and parties were reputed to go on through the night.\n\nImage copyright JB Helsby Image caption Pictured shortly after its opening in 1933, the Midland is thought to be the UK's first Art Deco hotel\n\nThe outbreak of World War Two gave the Midland a new role - as a military hospital. On the ground floor the dining room became a large ward with about 40 beds, while the circular caf\u00e9 was adapted into a physiotherapy centre.\n\nTwo upstairs suites were turned into operating theatres and there were also X-ray facilities, a dental surgery and a dispensary.\n\nAfter the war, the hotel changed hands a number of times, underwent unsympathetic refurbishment and fell victim to financial mismanagement.\n\nIt closed and fell into disrepair and was on the original at risk register in 1998. However, the redevelopment company Urban Splash spent \u00a311m restoring its original features, including the grand staircase. It is now officially saved.\n\nImage copyright Heritage Images Image caption Pictured in 1999, the Midland was run down and neglected\n\nTynemouth station, Tyne and Wear\n\nImage copyright Station Developments Ltd Image caption In Victorian times, people would travel to Tynemouth station just to see its famous foliage\n\nThe extravaganza of Victorian ironwork that is Tynemouth station, in Tyne and Wear, was opened in 1882. It was added to the register in 2004 and removed in 2012 after the owners and Historic England provided cash for its renovation.\n\nOnce decorated with a rich display of flora, the station was a destination in itself. However, the rise of the motorcar alongside more people going abroad on holiday contributed to its decline.\n\nAlthough it has always remained a working station, the structure began to show a lack of care, as paint peeled from the metalwork and the glass canopies became dirty and cracked.\n\nBut a \u00a33.68m restoration, which included fitting 4,600 new panes of glass, returned it to its former glory. A weekend market is now held on the station concourse and displays of artwork are regularly seen in the central section of the bridge and hanging from the roof area.\n\nThe station concourse is also used as an events area during the annual Mouth of the Tyne Festival.\n\nThe project won the Historic England Angel Award for Best Craftsmanship on a Heritage Rescue for 2012.\n\nImage copyright Historic England Image caption Following its restoration, Tynemouth station is shiny, clean and off the heritage danger list\n\nKirklees Priory Gatehouse, West Yorkshire\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The gatehouse, pictured in 1912, is said to be where Robin Hood died\n\nThe timber-framed Kirklees Priory Gatehouse in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, had been on the register since 1998 but following repairs funded by Historic England, it was removed last year.\n\nAlthough most of it was built in the early 16th Century, parts of its timber framing came from a medieval nunnery founded on the site during the reign of Henry II (1154-89).\n\nA favourite haunt of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, it is also claimed to be where Robin Hood died.\n\nFolklore suggests the prioress was his aunt and she sheltered him when he fled from the Sheriff of Nottingham. Another version of the story is that in old age Robin Hood fell ill and went to visit his cousin (rather than aunt) the prioress, so that he could be bled and restored to health.\n\nHowever, his cousin conspired with her lover, Sir Roger of Doncaster, to kill Robin. So she opened a vein, locked Robin in the upper room of the gatehouse, and let him bleed to death. It's also said that he decided his own burial site by shooting an arrow from his deathbed in the gatehouse.\n\nThe arrow, somewhat implausibly, flew more than a mile. But still, that's where his grave is.\n\nImage copyright Historic England Image caption Robin Hood is said to have died in one of the upstairs rooms at Kirklees Priory Gatehouse\n\nRoundhouse, Derby\n\nImage copyright North Midland Railway Image caption Pictured in 1905, the roundhouse was built by a team including George and Robert Stephenson\n\nStrictly speaking, the Roundhouse in Derby is a hexadecagon, but we won't quibble. Built in 1839 by four rival rail companies, the huge 16-sided engine repair shed is known to be the earliest railway roundhouse in the world.\n\nOne of the companies that built it was the North Midland Railway, where George Stephenson and his son Robert were engineers.\n\nRobert was the engineering brain behind the roundhouse, which was built for the sum of \u00a362,000 and included a 12-metre engine turntable.\n\nBut the entire Derby Railway works complex became redundant and it was added to the at risk register in 1998, where it remained until 2009.\n\nA project beginning in 2008 restored and updated the site. The original turntable has been kept in the renovated building as an example of manufacturing and railway heritage.\n\nBoth the roundhouse and the nearby engine sheds were converted into a venue for Derby College, and the space has been used for a variety of functions, including as a location for the TV programme Antiques Roadshow, the BBC Spending Review, and Ultra White-Collar Boxing. Sadly not all at the same time.\n\nImage copyright The Roundhouse Image caption The Roundhouse in Derby is now used to host a variety of functions\n\nThe Kasbah, Grimsby\n\nImage copyright Alun Bull Image caption The Kasbah Conservation Area in Grimsby was given listed status in 2017 and added to the at risk list this year\n\nFor all the success stories, there are 5,160 entries on the 2018 at risk register. While that is 94 fewer than last year, there remains much to be done to preserve some of the country's historical sites.\n\nAdded to the latest at risk list is the Kasbah area in Grimsby, a year after it was designated a Conservation Area.\n\nGrimsby was once home to the UK's largest fishing trawler fleet, but the fishing industry has been in decline for several decades. Most of the fish at the town's daily auction are now caught by crews from the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nThe town's \"traditionally smoked fish\" has been cured in the Kasbah smokehouses since the mid 19th Century, However, only a handful now exist in the area, which has become rundown.\n\nIts owner, Associated British Ports, along with North East Lincolnshire Council and Historic England, are trying to attract funding for a repair programme.\n\nImage copyright Dan Kitwood Image caption The site's owners are trying to attract investment to revitalise the area\n\nHMS Invincible, off Portsmouth\n\nImage copyright Bournemouth University Image caption The original HMS Invincible ran aground off Portsmouth in 1758\n\nThe wreck of HMS Invincible lies on Horse and Dean Sand off Portsmouth. The wooden sailing vessel capsized while departing for Louisburg in Canada in 1758 and the wreck was discovered by a fisherman in 1979.\n\nThe ship was built in 1744 and captured from the French in 1747 at Cape Finisterre, whereupon it was taken into the Royal Navy. It was the first to bear the name Invincible.\n\nSandglasses, a bronze adze and cooper's setter used to open barrels, and cartridge cases have been recovered from the site as have army buttons from 13 different regiments. Some cannon lie 200 metres to the south, confirming that the quarterdeck cannon were jettisoned when the vessel got into difficulty.\n\nStorms and shifting sands have left the site vulnerable to biological and physical decay. Historic England placed it on the risk register in 2012, and ongoing work to conserve and record the artefacts is being carried out by the Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust, along with Bournemouth University.\n\nImage copyright Mike Pitts Image caption A well-preserved gunpowder barrel was retrieved from the seafloor near the Invincible\n\nBattle of Newburn Ford, Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nImage copyright Historic England Image caption The site of the Battle of Newburn Ford has been subject to piecemeal, peripheral development\n\nKing Charles I's attempt to impose a new prayer book on the Scots led to military conflict in the summer of 1640, and the Battle of Newburn Ford, Newcastle upon Tyne, was the only battle of the Second Bishops' War.\n\nThe Scottish Army took Newcastle by defeating the English, forcing Charles I to pay them off.\n\nThis expense meant Charles had to recall Parliament, which proved to be a critical step towards the English Civil War.\n\nThe battlefield has been subject to piecemeal, peripheral development but an outline action plan has been agreed between Historic England, the local authorities and the Battlefields Trust.\n\nThe area is heavily industrialised, yet areas of historical and natural heritage interest are numerous. Standing at either end of Newburn Bridge provides a good view of the land over which the battle took place.", "Video\n\nA rescue drone that can find people who are lost in the forest is being developed in Latvia.\n\nResearchers have equipped a drone with a thermal camera that can pick out the body heat of people among the trees.

The next highest was Iran's own National Iranian Tanker Company with 51 ships, followed by Denmark, China and Japan.\n\nAlthough Greece is one of eight countries to be given a 180-day extension by the US - with the others being China, India, Italy, Japan, Turkey, South Korea and Taiwan - the White House has told those nations to start reducing their Iranian oil orders.\n\nAnd with every other country told to stop immediately, or else face their own knock-on trade penalties from the US, Greece's oil tankers may be about to see a substantial drop in business.\n\n'High risk'\n\nDimitrios Lyridis, associate professor of maritime transport at the National Technical University of Athens, says that most Greek shipping companies will comply with the ban, because the US is also targeting individual firms doing business with Iran.\n\nAs a result, continuing to ship Iranian oil could see Greek firms banned from doing business in the US and from using American ports.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Iran is currently the world\u2019s sixth largest exporter of crude oil\n\n\"[Most] Greek shipping companies will comply with Trump's order,\" says Mr Lyridis.\n\n\"Many of these companies are on the US stock market, so the risk of non-compliance is just too high.\n\n\"I see them diversifying towards other markets, for instance, the Saudi one, currently under pressure to increase its oil output.\"\n\nGeorge Vaggelas, researcher and consultant on port economics, management and policy issues, at the University of the Aegean on the Greek island of Chios, agrees that Greek shipping firms listed in the US - such as Navios Maritime Holdings and Tsakos Energy Navigation - will comply.\n\n'Laxer way'\n\nHowever, Mr Vaggelas thinks that some Greek shipping firms without links to the US financial markets may continue to ship Iranian oil.\n\n\"These - though few - might continue serving Iranian oil exports at an increased risk,\" he says.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump hopes that the embargo will weaken the Iranian economy\n\nThe shipping firms themselves are unwilling to comment given the seriousness of the situation, and none of those we contacted were prepared to give us a statement. The main Greek shipping trade unions also declined to provide a quote.\n\nMr Vaggelas is hopeful though that in practice the US will offer numerous countries - not just the eight given an extension - wiggle room.\n\nHe sees France and other European Union countries applying the oil embargo in a \"laxer way\" than the US, both to secure supplies, and because they want to keep the 2015 agreement on Iran's nuclear programme alive.\n\nIt was President Trump's decision to rip up this deal, negotiated by the administration of predecessor President Obama, that paved the way for the reinstatement of the embargo on Iranian oil exports.\n\nUS accusations\n\nPresident Trump has called the 2015 agreement the \"worst deal ever negotiated\".\n\nHis administration also says it wants to stop what it calls Iran's \"malign\" activities, including support for terror groups in the Middle East, and ballistic missile tests.\n\nThe US hopes that the sanctions will force Iran back to the negotiating table.\n\nGreece's shipping industry\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe combined value of the Greek merchant shipping fleet is estimated at $100bn (\u00a377bn), the most in the world.\n\nJapan is in second place on $89bn, with China in third position on $84bn\n\nGreek-controlled ships account for 20% of all global seaborne trade\n\nThe fleet totals 4,749 ships of more than 1,000 gross tonnage\n\nOut of all these vessels, 35% are oil tankers\n\nWhile the ships are Greek-owned, only 18% are Greek-flagged. The rest fly more than 40 national flags, predominantly the Marshall Islands, Liberian and Maltese ones. The reasons for doing this are financial, regulatory and administrative\n\nThe industry employs more than 200,000 people, and has remained a success while other parts of the Greek economy were mired by the country's debt crisis over the past decade\n\nYet despite Mr Vaggelas' optimism that European nations will continue to source Iranian oil, he does not dispute that the number of Greek-owned tankers involved in Iranian exports will dwindle.\n\nOther commentators are more confident about the future for Greece's oil tankers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cargo ships at Greece\u2019s Port of Piraeus in Athens\n\nSome, such as Court Smith, trade analyst at UK-based Vessels Value, which tracks the global shipping industry, thinks that the Iranian ban may actually give Greek shipping firms a boost.\n\nHis argument is that countries will need to source the oil they used to get from Iran from elsewhere, which may be further away, and therefore give more profits to the owners of the oil tankers because their ships will be spending much longer at sea.\n\n'Unsustainable'\n\n\"A good example of this is India, which is very close to Iran,\" says Mr Court.\n\n\"It will [probably] be purchasing more crude oil from other sources, which are further away [such as countries in West Africa, Brazil and the Caribbean].\"\n\nImage copyright IRANIAN PRESIDENCY/HANDOUT/Getty Images Image caption Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has poured scorn on the US sanctions\n\nWhen the dust settles, however, it remains to be seen how long the embargo against Iran - the world's sixth largest oil exporter - will remain in place.\n\nProf Lyridis says this is dependent upon global oil prices, and whether the price rises significantly as a result of Iranian exports being curtailed.\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\n\"With Iran being a huge crude oil exporter, maintaining the penalty might prove unsustainable because global oil prices will [potentially] skyrocket,\" he says.\n\nProf Lyridis adds that this, coupled with President Trump's unpredictability, could mean the embargo is relatively short-lived.\n\nThe Greek government declined to comment.", "Image caption Children watch Andy Pandy in 1950\n\nMore than 7,000 people still watch TV in black and white more than half a century after colour broadcasts began.\n\nLondon has the most TV licences for black and white sets at 1,768, followed by 431 in the West Midlands and 390 in Greater Manchester.\n\nA total of 7,161 UK households have failed to start watching in colour despite transmissions starting in 1967.\n\nBBC2 was the first channel to regularly broadcast in colour from July that year with the Wimbledon tennis tournament.\n\nThe number of black and white licences has almost halved in the past five years and is down from 212,000 in 2000.\n\nThe figures were released by TV Licensing in what appears to be a reminder that anyone watching television must by law have a TV licence.\n\nSpokesman Jason Hill said: \"Whether you watch EastEnders, Strictly or Question Time in black and white on a 50-year-old TV set, or in colour on a tablet, you need to be covered by a TV licence to watch or record programmes as they are broadcast.\n\n\"You also need to be covered by a TV licence to download or watch BBC programmes on iPlayer, on any device.\"\n\nLast month the organisation said more than 26,000 young people aged 18 to 25 were caught watching live TV or BBC iPlayer without a TV licence in the past year.

EFF lawmakers reacted angrily, calling him a \"white racist\". A brawl quickly followed.\n\nSo what is the scandal about?\n\nFor many years, VBS was a distinctly modest entity - a mutual bank, largely owned by its depositors, that helped rural communities, living on land owned by tribal chiefs, to secure mortgages or save for family funerals. Almost no-one outside the northern province of Limpopo had even heard of it.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Limpopo is one of the poorest areas of South Africa\n\nBut with staggering speed, VBS was allegedly transformed into a slush fund for corrupt politicians, local government leaders and their business cronies, by way of a breathtakingly elaborate and cynical pyramid scheme.\n\nThe bank's owners are accused of bribing local officials in some of South Africa's poorest and most dysfunctional municipalities - persuading them to divert, or to pretend to divert, their budgets into VBS's coffers in return for cash and gifts. They deny the allegation.\n\n\"These people were stealing from their next-door neighbours - aunties, grannies. There is real anger about this. People want to see those people punished,\" said David Lewis of Corruption Watch.\n\nIt was only once VBS was put under the control of South Africa's central bank in August that investigators discovered the full extent of the alleged looting and political intrigue.\n\nWho was behind the alleged corruption web?\n\nA total of 53 individuals and businesses have since been implicated in the destruction of a bank that had, for years, proudly boasted of its disruptive credentials as a black-owned business seeking to support \"radical economic transformation\" in an industry it claimed was still dominated by white capital.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Deputy finance minister Mondli Gungubele (R) has spoken of alleged criminality at the bank\n\nThe \"Heist\" report lays most of the blame for VBS's collapse on the bank's leadership.\n\nIts chairman, Tshifhiwa Matodzi is accused of masterminding the alleged looting, with the support of a team of highly qualified accountants and lawyers, and a dizzying network of apparently fraudulent shell companies and subcontractors.\n\nBut from the moment the authorities began to question VBS's actions and its liquidity, the bank insisted that it did not do anything wrong and painted itself as a victim of racism.\n\n\"Our greatest sin\u2026 was running a successful black bank,\" wrote Mr Matodzi in a furious open letter to the central bank earlier this year.\n\nHe said the bank's dreams of \"radical economic transformation\" were falling victim to an elaborate conspiracy led by a white-dominated banking sector \"which does not tolerate growing black banks and black excellence.\"\n\nSouth Africa is still wrestling with the economic legacies of the racial system of apartheid and with the merits of black-empowerment schemes designed to correct decades of discrimination.\n\nHowever, VBS's claims were swiftly condemned by a range of South Africans.\n\n\"There is nothing black about this. This is criminality,\" said deputy finance minister Mondli Gungubele.\n\n\"The looters have been using that phrase - radical economic transformation - as a pretext for years,\" said political analyst Prince Mashele dismissively.\n\nHow did the alleged scam work?\n\nEvery year South African municipalities lose, steal, or otherwise fail to account for about $2bn worth of public funds. A staggering sum. It is, surely, no coincidence that the municipalities which agreed to cooperate with VBS were among the poorest and most dysfunctional in the country.\n\nThe \"Heist\" report quotes an alleged WhatsApp conversation that reveals the way VBS allegedly dangled cash in front of municipal officials to buy their loyalty.\n\n\"We gave her 300k [$21,500] and she cried\u2026 We said we will consult with you and will sort her out,\" a middleman allegedly texted to the bank's chairman, in reference to a local mayor who apparently felt she wasn't getting a big enough \"Christmas\" present from VBS.\n\n\"Go ahead\u2026 but she must know the formula,\" Mr Matodzi allegedly replied.\n\nMr Matodzi has denied the allegations against him, describing the report as \"not balanced.\"\n\nSouth Africa's banking regulators have since announced that the 14 municipalities that invested about $113m in VBS are unlikely to receive a bail-out or compensation, leaving their struggling communities to bear the brunt of their leaders' alleged corruption.\n\nWhat has been the governing party's response?\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC), which has governed South Africa since the advent of democracy in 1994, has tried to distance itself from VBS's troubles, condemning all those involved and ordering prompt disciplinary inquiries within the party.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Ramaphosa's ANC will seek to extend its rule in elections next year\n\nBut, as with so many other high-profile investigations, it is struggling to convince the public that its own reputation is not on trial in the VBS scandal.\n\n\"We all agree this never should have happened,\" said the Minister for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Zweli Mkhize, strongly condemning \"the wanton fraud displayed in this saga\".\n\nBut the suspicion - fleshed out by recent newspaper reports - is that some of the money looted from VBS made its way into the ANC's coffers.\n\n\"There is a toxic interplay between party and state. If the ANC doesn't move quickly and really come down on these guys I think it will cost them hugely at elections,\" said Corruption Watch's David Lewis.\n\n\"The bloodsucking leeches and parasites that have fed off the savings of some of our country's poorest citizens must be held accountable,\" said DA MP Kevin Mileham.\n\nWhy is the EFF under fire?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The EFF's Floyd Shivambu (l) and Julius Malema portray themselves as revolutionaries\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has gained a small, but growing following in South Africa by lashing out at the corruption of the Zuma era.\n\nBut in parliament recently, the party's deputy leader suffered the humiliation of having his own anti-corruption catchphrase - so often spat out against former President Zuma - directed back at him.\n\n\"Pay back the money!\" MPs from a range of parties shouted, gleefully, at the EFF's Floyd Shivambu.\n\nHe has dismissed the allegations, saying at a press conference that it was \"pure insanity\" to claim he got money from VBS.\n\nMr Shivambu and his boss, EFF leader Julius Malema, both come from Limpopo province, where VBS operated.\n\nAlthough neither man has been directly implicated in the \"Heist,\" Mr Shivambu's brother Brian, who worked within the EFF, is named as the alleged recipient of about $1.1m for one year's consultancy work.\n\nBrian Shivambu has denied receiving any money from VBS.\n\nThe EFF has also denied any corruption, but questions remain about unconfirmed payments into its accounts. Many observers also wonder why, as VBS was sinking into trouble, the party went out of its way to defend the bank and to attack those involved in trying to regulate it.\n\nDidn't auditors pick up the problems?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The global auditing firm's reputation has been damaged\n\nA pattern has emerged in recent South African corruption scandals, and VBS is no exception.\n\nWhen large, seemingly reputable organisations start to go rotten, they look to prestigious international companies - particularly auditors - to shore up their credibility and, on occasion, to provide direct help in covering up or facilitating their crimes.\n\nThe list of foreign companies that have been forced to apologize for wrongdoingin various scandals range from SAP, to McKinsey, KPMG and Bell Pottinger.\n\nIn this case, KPMG has once again hit the headlines after their lead auditor was condemned in the \"Heist\" report for accepting a lucrative fee but then failing to spot, or report, VBS's looming liquidity crisis.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thuli Madonsela was at the helm of the South African anti-corruption watchdog until late 2016\n\nVBS \"is corrupt and rotten to the core. Indeed, there is hardly a person in its employ in any position of authority who is not, in some way or other, complicit,\" said the report, recommending that KPMG pay damages for its role.\n\nKPMG has removed one partner implicated in the VBS scandal and has promised to cooperate with any investigations.\n\nIn a statement, the firm said it had \"already taken many steps\" to deal with the issue and it welcomes the \"independent scrutiny\" of the regulatory board for auditors.\n\nWere there bigger fish?\n\nUp to this point, VBS's behaviour could be seen as a localised, provincial, containable scandal. But in truth, it wasn't - or rather, the bank had ambitions far beyond Limpopo.\n\n\"The Heist\" report spells out in great detail how VBS sought to tap into some of the biggest pots of public money in the country, and came alarmingly close to succeeding.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Jacob Zuma has denied several allegations of corruption\n\nSouth Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC) controls some $143bn in state pensions and other social funds.\n\nThe report shows how VBS allegedly bribed two senior PIC officials in order to gain access to loans that promptly vanished from the bank's fraudulent books and were instead handed out in new bribes.\n\nThe full extent of the PIC's alleged involvement and exposure has yet to be revealed.\n\nMeanwhile VBS went after South Africa's giant railway utility, Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). And it is here that the process becomes explicitly linked to national politics, and to a furious power struggle between factions within the ANC.\n\nVBS sought, the report alleges, about $70m in deposits from Prasa, and allegedly began smoothing the path with bribes to union officials and others.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption South Africa's railway company has been hit by a series of corruption scandals\n\nBut it seems there was one, crucial, factor which would determine the scheme's success - the result of an ANC leadership battle, which VBS hoped would be won by Mr Zuma's preferred candidate.\n\nWhen, instead, Mr Ramaphosa won an election in December to lead the party and, later, the nation, the attempt to lure Prasa into VBS's alleged scam apparently stalled.\n\nHow did the scandal come to light?\n\nIt was, curiously, a personal loan to the former president that first put VBS in the headlines back in 2016.\n\nMr Zuma, who has repeatedly denied corruption allegations, was still president at the time, and in need of money to reimburse the state for funds illegally spent on refurbishing his private Nkandla homestead.\n\nVBS stepped out of the shadows with a home loan of about $550,000.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Satellite images showed Mr Zuma's growing residence\n\nThat loan, it is alleged, was a turning point for VBS, signalling its willingness to be drawn into the ANC's national power struggles - between Mr Zuma, and the man who would soon replace him, Mr Ramaphosa.\n\nThe report details how VBS money was allegedly paid to Mr Zuma's own family foundation.\n\nPerhaps significantly, the bank's subsequent claim that it was trying to promote \"radical economic transformation\" was a phrase lifted straight from Mr Zuma's own increasingly populist rhetoric, as he sought to prevent Mr Ramaphosa's faction from gaining power.\n\nPerhaps there are some silver linings to this sleazy tale.\n\nFor a while, it looked as though thousands of rural investors - who angrily besieged VBS branches in Limpopo fearing that the money they had saved for mortgages and funerals - would lose everything when the bank went into administration.\n\nInstead, the authorities have stepped in, promising to guarantee individual savings of up to $7,000.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nMore broadly, it is important to note that South Africa's regulatory authorities did do their job.\n\nThey took control of VBS, investigated it, and are now likely to see their conclusions form the basis for a string of criminal trials against those allegedly involved in the looting.\n\nSomething similar happened at Prasa, where a courageous official refused to go along with alleged \"political\" plans to funnel cash into VBS.\n\nSo, the system still works. Up to a point. But it will require a sustained, collective effort, over many years to end corruption in South Africa.", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: 'I didn't speak to Whitaker' about Russia probe\n\nPresident Donald Trump has defended his new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, as opponents call for his recusal from the Russia investigation.\n\nMr Whitaker was named to replace former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who was fired by Mr Trump on Wednesday.\n\nControversy arose over Mr Whitaker's previous comments about ending the probe into alleged Russian meddling in favour of Mr Trump's election in 2016.\n\nAs the top law enforcement official, Mr Whitaker could take over the inquiry.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia on behalf of the Department of Justice.\n\nCurrently, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is overseeing Mr Mueller's investigation - a role he took on when Mr Sessions recused himself.\n\nCritics have pointed to some of Mr Whitaker's remarks on CNN last year on curtailing Mr Mueller's investigation as reason to remove him from any oversight role.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Mr Trump called Mr Whitaker a \"very well respected man\" whose selection \"was greeted with raves\", though he made sure to distance himself from his new appointee.\n\n\"I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Mr Trump said while fielding questions of how he might influence the Russia investigation.\n\nBut the president has probably interacted with Mr Whitaker numerous times, US media pointed out, as he was Jeff Sessions' chief of staff.\n\n\"Making comments on shows doesn't mean you're unqualified,\" Mr Trump added. \"You didn't have any problems with him when he worked for Sessions.\"\n\nWhy was Jeff Sessions fired?\n\nEarlier this week, before the dust had even begun to settle on the results of the November mid-term elections, long-embattled Mr Sessions released a letter confirming he was out of a job.\n\n\"At your request,\" Mr Sessions wrote to President Trump, \"I am submitting my resignation.\"\n\nMinutes later, the president announced his replacement via Twitter: \"We are pleased to announce that Matthew G Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States.

He went on to play tight end in the Holiday Bowl and the Rose Bowl for the Iowa Hawkeyes in the 1990s.\n\nWhitaker graduated from the University of Iowa College of Law, and then went into practice as a lawyer, for a time as corporate counsel for a chain of grocery stores.\n\nPresident George W Bush appointed him US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, where he prosecuted white collar and drug trafficking crimes. He held that office from 2004 until 2009.\n\nHis wife Marci is a civil engineer, and the couple has three children.\n\nPolitical life\n\nMr Whitaker first took a shot at public office in 2002 when he ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer of Iowa as a Republican. He ran for United States Senate in 2014, losing the party's nomination to Republican Senator Joni Ernst.\n\nIn his campaigns, Mr Whitaker positioned himself as a fiscally conservative opponent of the Affordable Care Act, and said his political role models were Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. He courted the anti-abortion, evangelical Christian vote, saying at one candidate's forum that he would scrutinise nominees for federal judge to ensure they had a \"biblical view of justice\".\n\nHe further built up his conservative credentials when he served as campaign co-chair for Texas Governor Rick Perry in 2012 and became the executive director of the conservative watchdog group, Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust in Washington DC.\n\nHe was hired as Sessions chief of staff in October 2017.\n\nImage copyright Chip Somodevilla Image caption Whitaker participates in a US Department of Justice roundtable discussion\n\nFrom commentator to acting attorney general\n\nPrior to joining Mr Sessions' staff, Mr Whitaker was a conservative legal commentator for CNN, and penned several opinion pieces that may shed light on how he might approach his new role in the Justice Department, in particular when it comes to his possible oversight of the Russian election-meddling investigation lead by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIn July 2017, Mr Whitaker appeared on CNN and mused on possible ways that President Trump could crush the probe, which included the departure of Mr Sessions.\n\n\"I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\" Mr Whitaker said.\n\nIn August 2017, Mr Whitaker wrote a piece called \"Mueller's investigation of Trump is going too far\". In it, Mr Whitaker argued that Mr Mueller had overstepped the boundaries of his inquiry when he began looking into the Trump family's finances. He called this a \"red line\" that Mr Mueller should not cross, warning that it would render the investigation a \"witch hunt\" - a term that the president himself has become quite fond of.\n\n\"The Trump Organization's business dealings are plainly not within the scope of the investigation, nor should they be,\" Mr Whitaker wrote.\n\nSpeculation that Mr Whitaker would one day take a more central role at the Justice Department has been bubbling for months.

It was an administrative, military and cultural centre for the Mughal Empire, which ruled most of India and Pakistan in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThis legacy continued during British colonial rule, and after independence in 1947, the city remained a major political and cultural hub in northern India.\n\nIt still plays a big role in the Hindu faith. It hosts the Kumbh Mela every 12 years near the confluence of two holy rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna. The event, which attracts tens of millions of devotees, is often described as the world's largest religious gathering.\n\nPeople from all faiths come together to welcome devotees, and hundreds of kiosks offering free food to people are set up during the mela.\n\nAllahabad's history is shared by Hindus, Muslims and Christians alike.\n\nAnd every corner of the city has its own share of history: from Anand Bhawan, the home of Nehru; to Sangam, the confluence of the two rivers; to the giant fort built by Akbar, which prevented flooding and helped attract people to settle in the city.\n\n\"That is why it's hard to imagine these places with any other name,\" says Azimur Siddiqui, a management teacher. \"These places represent Allahabad.\"\n\nImage copyright Ankit Srinivas Image caption The Ganges and Yamuna rivers meet in Allahabad\n\nSo why change the name of the city?\n\n\"It's politics,\" says Professor Heramb Chaturvedi, who teaches history at Allahabad University. \"We have general elections coming up in 2019 and this decision seems to have been taken to appease the city's Hindu majority,\" he adds.\n\nThis is not the first decision of its kind.\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh government recently changed the name of the iconic British-era train station Mughalsarai, naming it after a BJP ideologue, Deendayal Upadhyaya.\n\nJust this week, the state's chief minister announced Faizabad district would now be called Ayodhya.

The place has been mentioned in several Hindu scriptures as well. But it was never a city,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that Akbar laid the foundation of a new city in 1574 and named it Ilahabas.

Two-thirds of its men were from Jamaica, the rest hailing from the Bahamas to then British Guiana.\n\nDespite receiving a heroes' welcome when they arrived in England, the Caribbean soldiers were not permitted to fight as equals alongside their white counterparts.\n\nMost served for lower pay in the Labour Corps transporting ammunition, digging trenches, building roads and railway lines.

Nationally, 67% of that age group voted Democrat.\n\n'Everything shifts' in 2020\n\nIn 2014, 54% of voters in that age group voted Democrat, CNN said.\n\nThat rise clearly isn't down to Taylor. There are many factors - especially the change of occupant in the White House - that mean young voters are more motivated to vote, and to vote Democrat.\n\nBut Prof Lucas believes the influence of figures like Swift in helping to mobilise a young electorate could be key in the next presidential race in two years' time.\n\n\"If I'm looking at 2020, if you get an increase in voter participation among 18-24s like we had yesterday and it keeps going, everything shifts in US politics,\" he says.\n\n\"That's where Taylor becomes important because they did get a surge in voter registration, especially among young people.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

A number of Western countries are understood to have held discussions with Asia Bibi's family about granting them asylum.\n\nThe mother-of-five was released from prison in the city of Multan on Wednesday and the foreign office says she is in \"a safe place in Pakistan\".\n\nAlso known as Asia Noreen, she was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours.\n\nThe Pakistani government has said it will start legal proceedings to prevent her going abroad after agreeing the measure to end the violent protests.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Asia Bibi's acquittal sparked protests by Islamists\n\nMany of the protesters were hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws and called for Asia Bibi to be hanged.\n\nOne Islamist leader said all three Supreme Court judges also \"deserved to be killed\".\n\nA spokesman for the hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) party, which blocked roads in major cities for several days, said Asia Bibi's release was in breach of their deal with the government.\n\n\"The rulers have showed their dishonesty,\" TLP spokesman Ejaz Ashrafi told Reuters.\n\nThe deal also saw officials agree not to block a petition for the Supreme Court to evaluate Asia Bibi's acquittal in the light of Islamic Sharia law.\n\nWhat was Asia Bibi accused of?\n\nThe trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi had with a group of women in June 2009.\n\nThey were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean.\n\nProsecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response.\n\nShe was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation.\n\nAcquitting her, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on unreliable evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd \"threatening to kill her\".\n\nWhy is this case so divisive?\n\nIslam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong.\n\nHard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base.\n\nBut critics say the laws have often been used to exact revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence.\n\nThe vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community who identify themselves as Muslims but are regarded as heretical by orthodox Islam. Since the 1990s scores of Christians have also been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population.\n\nThe Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance.\n\nSince 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy.", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump hopes for \"beautiful bi-partisan situation\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he is ready to work with Democrats after they won control of the House of Representatives in mid-term elections.\n\nBut during a testy news conference, he vowed to adopt a \"warlike posture\" if Democrats investigated him.\n\nThe Republican president also clashed repeatedly with reporters at the White House, ordering them to be quiet.\n\nTop Democrat Nancy Pelosi offered to work with Mr Trump, but pledged due oversight of his administration.\n\nHas bipartisanship broken out?\n\nIn Wednesday's news conference, Mr Trump extended an olive branch to Democrats, proposing both parties work together on joint legislative priorities.\n\nHe suggested they could co-operate on issues such as infrastructure, trade and health.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The return of the woman Republicans love to hate\n\nBut he said that if Democrats start serving legal writs against him, Republicans would retaliate in kind.\n\nMs Pelosi, who is favoured to pick up the House speaker's gavel, promised her party would serve as a counterweight to the White House.\n\nAt her news conference, she said Democrats would seek compromise with the president, but \"must stand our ground\".\n\nDemocrats will now control lower chamber panels that can investigate Mr Trump's business affairs, including tax returns, while thwarting his legislative agenda.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump listed some of the losing Republicans candidates who didn't embrace him and his message\n\nWhat else did Trump say?\n\nMr Trump hailed \"tremendous success\" and an \"incredible day\" for his party in Tuesday's elections.\n\nHe took credit for Republicans having \"defied history\" by consolidating their grip on the Senate.\n\nThe president also mocked Republicans who did not \"embrace\" him on the campaign trail, and went on to lose their election races.\n\n\"They did very poorly,\" Mr Trump told reporters. \"I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad but I feel just fine about it.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The story of election night in two minutes\n\nIn ill-tempered exchanges, he called CNN correspondent Jim Acosta \"a rude, terrible person\" and told an NBC reporter: \"I'm not a big fan of yours either.\"\n\nThe president became irate when questioned about his characterisation of Central American migrants heading towards the US as an \"invasion\".\n\nThe White House has since suspended Mr Acosta's access.\n\nMr Trump told a black reporter who asked whether his self-professed nationalism would embolden white nationalists that it was \"such a racist question\".\n\nFollowing the press conference, he announced in a tweet he had fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Anthony Zurcher explains what losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nBipartisanship - with conditions\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News\n\nDonald Trump came to the East Room of the White House with olive branch in hand, but it sometimes seemed like his fingers were crossed behind his back.\n\nHe told the nation he would love to work with Democrats - that it might, in fact, be a good thing that they won control of the House of Representatives - but he refused to back away from any of his divisive campaign rhetoric.\n\nPrevious presidents who have suffered mid-term setbacks have professed humility and said they learned valuable lessons.

Or smartphone and tablet space, I guess you could say.\n\nA new form factor can be a huge boost to device-makers, but only if it makes sense.\n\nA flip phone made previously big devices pocket-sized, and then smartphones brought button-less interaction to our palms.\n\nBut what will foldable screens bring?\n\nOne of the reasons why Samsung teased this device at its developers conference was to give software-makers a chance to think about how to make the most of the new possibilities a foldable screen might bring.\n\nThere's a reason why just about every new smartphone up until today looked the same: it worked.\n\nTo go foldable, there's likely to be big trade-offs on price, screen quality and perhaps weight - the device Samsung teased today did look chunky.\n\nI'll hold back on a verdict until I get a chance to hold one for myself.\n\nIBM Simon: The first mobile phone to offer a touchscreen user-interface - but its battery only lasted an hour.\n\nSiemens S10: The first handset with a colour display - although only red, green, blue and white could be shown.\n\nLG Prada: The handset debuted a capacitive touchscreen - detecting finger taps by changes in the display's electrical field rather than pressure.\n\niPhone: Apple made use of \"multi-touch\", detecting several points of contact - allowing pinch-to-zoom and other interactions.\n\nNokia N85: First phone with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display, letting it show deeper blacks and better contrast.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note: Although not the first \"phablet\", the handset proved there was demand for a 5+ inch display, despite claims it was \"comically huge\".\n\nLG G Flex: The curved design was derided as being a gimmick, but points the way to the true \"bendy\" phones of the future.\n\nSharp Aquos Crystal: The phone's \"edgeless\" look foreshadowed today's trend to keep bezels to a minimum.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note Edge: Samsung's first handset to wrap its screen over one its sides used the extra space for notifications and app shortcuts.\n\nSony Xperia Z5 Premium: The smartphone premiered a 4K display before it was easy to obtain such ultra-high definition mobile content.\n\nEssential Phone: The start-up beat Apple to featuring a camera notch in its display, which allowed the rest of the screen to extend upwards.\n\nRoyole FlexPai: The California-based start-up surprised the industry when it revealed the \"world's first foldable phone\" last month.", "Image copyright Rockstar Games Image caption Several videos of a women's vote campaigner being killed had been posted to YouTube\n\nYouTube has deleted several videos posted to its platform of a suffragette being beaten and killed in the video game Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nThe Google-owned firm said the recordings had breached its rules on acceptable content.\n\nAt least one of the clips had attracted more than one million views before it acted.\n\nSeveral users had joked about the fact they were able to attack a \"feminist\" in the linked comments.\n\nThe Western-themed Red Dead Redemption 2 is set at the end of the 19th Century, about two decades before women were given the vote in all US states.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the BBC asked the firm whether 10 clips breached its policies.\n\nYouTube has since removed eight of them.\n\nOne of the creators involved had over 473,000 subscribers at the time and has had his channel shut down as a consequence.\n\n\"YouTube's Community Guidelines prohibit among other things, gratuitous violence, nudity, dangerous and illegal activities, and hate speech,\" said a spokeswoman from YouTube.\n\n\"Creative formats such as video games can be challenging to assess, but when content crosses the line and is flagged to our attention, we take action as necessary.\"\n\nThe videos had included the computer-controlled character being beaten, shot at, fed to an alligator and dropped down a mineshaft.\n\nThe firm has allowed a clip titled \"hog-tying feminist\" to remain in which the suffragette is caught with a lasso, pulled to the ground and has her hands bound, but is not killed.\n\nThe other remaining clip shows the woman being punched unconscious.\n\nImage copyright YouTube Image caption YouTube allows clips in which the suffragette is assaulted but not killed\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 has attracted very positive reviews, and attained a score of 97 out of 100 on Metacritic, which collates critics' reviews.\n\nMany of the 18-certificate game's non-playable characters can be attacked, but there has been criticism of a decision to allow the suffragette to be vulnerable given the controversy this could attract.\n\nSuffragettes also appear in another part of the game, but attacking them there leads to the failure of the mission.\n\nThe BBC has asked developer Rockstar Games for comment.", "Mayweather (left) said he was \"blindsided\" at a news conference in Japan\n\nFloyd Mayweather says he has not agreed to face Tenshin Nasukawa in an official bout and had \"never heard\" of the Japanese kickboxer until this week.\n\nThe former five-weight boxing world champion was said to have agreed to face Nasukawa in Japan on 31 December.\n\nMayweather, 41, says he had only been asked to compete in a non-televised event for \"wealthy spectators\".\n\n\"Once I arrived to the press conference, my team and I were completely derailed,\" said Mayweather.\n\n\"We should have put a stop to it immediately.\n\n\"I can assure you that I too was completely blindsided by the arrangements that were being made without my consent nor approval.

Sunday's march was expected to be far bigger.\n\nAmong the Polish flags last year were smoke bombs, along with racist and anti-Semitic chants and banners. Some of the marchers were far-right agitators from countries including the UK and Italy.\n\nA smaller counter-protest attracted some 2,000 people.\n\nThe march was cited in a European Parliament resolution last month, which called for a ban on neo-fascist and neo-Nazi groups.\n\nPresident Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki had originally said they planned to take part in Sunday's 100th anniversary march but decided not to, because the organisers could not guarantee that offensive banners would not appear, our correspondent says.\n\nWhat does the mayor say?\n\nThe mayor of Warsaw, a member of the opposition Civic Platform party, explained that security was a concern on Sunday and her appeals to the government for help had fallen on deaf ears.\n\nStrike action by police would also make it difficult to secure the event properly, she said, and Warsaw had suffered historically from aggressive nationalism under German occupation.\n\n\"Poland's 100th anniversary of independence shouldn't look like this, hence my decision to forbid it,\" she said. Poland's second republic was established on 11 November 1918 at the end of World War One, after more than a century of rule by Prussia, the Austro-Hungarian empire and Russia.\n\nMs Gronkiewicz-Waltz also complained that no charges had been brought against people who had broken laws at last year's march.", "Video\n\nCharging pupils for music tuition means only the \"elite\" can afford to learn to play an instrument while poorer children miss out, MSPs have heard.\n\nSchool music tuition remains free in some council areas, while others charge more than \u00a3500 a year.\n\nSchool pupil Alice Ferguson told a Holyrood committee that her school band had lost members because they could no longer afford music lessons.\n\nAnd she said charging for music tuition was \"increasing inequality\".\n\nAlice and fellow Scottish Youth Parliament member Catherine Mackie were giving evidence to Holyrood's education committee as part of its inquiry into music tuition in schools.", "Image copyright EPA\n\nThousands of Central Americans who form part of a migrant caravan moving north to the United States are resting in a stadium-turned-shelter in the Mexican capital, Mexico City.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nThe authorities in Mexico City have turned the sports stadium into a temporary shelter for the migrants.

A third hand stencil - an example of abstract, rather than figurative art - had a maximum age of 51,800 years, even older than the animal painting.\n\nThe authors conclude that rock art locally developed in Borneo between around 52,000 and 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe second phase of painting in the cave is characterised by the use of purple-coloured paint, and dates to between 16,000 and 21,000 years ago. This phase includes some apparent depictions of humans.\n\nMaxime Aubert said: \"It looks like there was a transition from depicting the animal world to [depicting] the human world.

They contain images of a veritable prehistoric menagerie, including cave lions, hyenas, horses, deer, rhinos and bison.\n\nBut a paper published earlier this year in the journal Science pushed the dates for cave art in Europe back to as much as 65,000 years. These paintings pre-date the known arrival of modern humans in Europe, leading to the study's suggestion that they might have been made by Neanderthals.\n\nOne of the authors of that paper in Science was Prof Alistair Pike, an archaeologist from the University of Southampton. Prof Pike - who was not involved with the new research - welcomed the findings, but expressed reservations about the date for the oldest figurative painting.\n\n\"I have no doubt that they have dated painting to at least 40,000 years at their oldest site, and this is an exciting result as it shows that cave painting wasn't an isolated event... but that it had a wide geographical distribution,\" Prof Pike explained.\n\nImage copyright Pindi Setiawan Image caption The caves also contain paintings of humans; these ones date to 13,600 years ago\n\n\"But there are some doubts if their dated sample overlies the figurative art... it appears to lie over some pigment 15cm away from the animal figure, and while it once might have formed part of this figure (which is very weathered), they have not demonstrated it is part of it.\"\n\nProf d'Errico also sounded a note of caution, explaining that the discovery didn't tell us much about the geographical origins of art.\n\n\"I think things develop independently. There may be other areas where people were producing something similar but we haven't found it yet, or that it wasn't preserved,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I think that symbolic thinking and abstract representation have a long history.

Yet last week Malcolm Turnbull was in Bali, meeting senior Indonesian leaders in an attempt to calm diplomatic tensions created by the man who ousted him, Scott Morrison.\n\nIndonesians could be forgiven for feeling confused.\n\nCertainly, they are perplexed and angry, following Mr Morrison's announcement last month that Australia is considering moving its embassy to Jerusalem and recognising the contested city as Israel's capital.\n\nThe news was bound to be received poorly in neighbouring Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country.

Flanagan let Nikolai Rasskazov run off him to latch on to Popov's slide-rule pass and, when the cross came in, Goldson sliced it wildly with his right foot past the bemused Allan McGregor.\n\nSpartak had not finished supplying their own gifts and Morelos was able to squeeze the ball through to Middleton to hammer past the goalkeeper for a half-time lead that could have been more emphatic had the Colombian not had a strike ruled out for offside.\n\nMcGregor was immense once more for Rangers - and he had to be given what was going on in front of him.\n\nHe saved well from Hanni twice but could do nothing after the rebound from the midfielder's second effort was headed in by Adriano.\n\nWorse quickly followed as Hanni picked up possession from the restart and fired in a shot that took a wicked deflection off Goldson and looped over McGregor.\n\nRangers did not trouble the shaky Spartak rearguard until the final seconds when Tavernier hit a post, but the Russians could have been further ahead by that point as Bocchetti hit the bar with a header and forced another great save from McGregor on the rebound, while Goldson appeared to have capped a nightmare performance by conceding a penalty that was not given.\n\nRotation turns group table on head - analysis\n\nRangers captain James Tavernier was denied by a post in stoppage-time\n\nThis was a sore one for Gerrard to take. The Glasgow side's manager will surely be furious at taking nothing from a match they led on three occasions.\n\nThis is a blow to Rangers' hopes of qualifying but far from the death knell.\n\nBoth of their remaining matches - at home to Villarreal and away at Rapid Vienna - are winnable, but only if Rangers can vastly improve defensively.\n\nGerrard again tinkered with his central defence for this match - replacing Joe Worrall with Nikola Katic. Although the Croat had formed a solid-looking partnership at the start of the season, he and Goldson looked vulnerable all evening.\n\nFew successful sides are built upon a rotation policy in such an important area of the field.\n\nThis was one that got away for Rangers and it is a harsh lesson that must be learned quickly.", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stigma against same-sex relationships is widespread in Tanzania\n\nTen men have been arrested for allegedly conducting a same-sex marriage ceremony on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar.\n\nThe arrests were made on Saturday night at a beach resort, a senior police officer told the BBC.\n\nIn recent years there have been a number of measures that appear to have targeted homosexuals in Tanzania.\n\nBut this week the Tanzanian government distanced itself from anti-gay rhetoric from a prominent politician.\n\nNo charges have yet been brought against the men, all Tanzanian, who are being held at a police station.\n\nSix other men escaped after police, who are believed to have received a tip-off from members of the public, raided the party, according to rights group Amnesty International\n\nAmnesty's East Africa Deputy Director Seif Magango said that it was \"mind-boggling that the mere act of sitting in a pair can assume criminal proportions\".\n\nHe added that he feared the men may be subjected to forced anal examination and called for their immediate release.\n\nSurveillance squads\n\nThe arrests come after Paul Makonda, the regional commissioner for the commercial capital Dar es Salaam, last week called on the public to report the names of suspected gay men to the police.\n\nHe further said he would set up a surveillance squad to track down gay people.\n\nTanzania's government, however, distanced itself from the move, saying that \"Mr Makonda was only airing his personal opinion\", not government policy.\n\nIt added that the government would \"continue to respect and uphold all human rights as provided for in the country's constitution\".\n\nAnti-gay rhetoric\n\nHomosexual acts are illegal in Tanzania, where statements against homosexuals have been on the rise since President John Magufuli's election in 2015.\n\nLast year, the country's deputy health minister defended a threat to publish a list of gay people.\n\nTanzania also deported three South African lawyers after they were accused of promoting homosexuality.\n\nThey were among 13 people arrested for taking part in a meeting to discuss challenging a law stopping private health clinics from providing HIV and Aids services.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Kors has been on a shopping spree, buying up Versace and Jimmy Choo, in a bid for growth\n\nShares in Michael Kors plunged on Wednesday following weaker-than-expected sales at its namesake brand.\n\nSales at Michael Kors stores open for at least 12 months fell 2.1%, while licensing revenue was down almost 7%.\n\nThe US fashion firm has responded to the struggles at its core brand by taking over luxury European labels Versace and Jimmy Choo.\n\nHowever, the benefits of those multi-billion dollar acquisitions are yet to be seen.\n\nProfits for Michael Kors sank 37% to $137.6m for the three months to 29 September compared with the same period last year.\n\nTotal revenue was up 9% to $1.3bn, boosted by last year's takeover of Jimmy Choo, the British luxury footwear maker made famous by Sex and the City, for almost \u00a3900m.\n\nBut at Michael Kors - which accounts for the bulk of the firm's business - total revenue from retail, licensing and wholesale was roughly flat, while sales at stores in Europe fell by 10%.\n\nThe firm blamed the declines partly on overly aggressive efforts to limit stock, as it tries to cultivate a more exclusive, luxury image.\n\n\"The consumer is absolutely responding to the brand,\" chief executive John Idol said. \"We've got to get more inventory into the stores to be able to really build consumer demand.\"\n\nShares were down 14% at $49.42 in afternoon trading in New York.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThe firm's acquisition of Versace - announced in September and expected to be completed in the next six months - will position the company for growth over the long term, he added.\n\nThe company, to be renamed Capri Holdings, plans to boost spending on marketing and open new Versace stores, with the goal of more than doubling the brand's annual revenue to $2bn over the next few years.\n\nCoty struggles\n\nWeakness in Europe also hurt US cosmetics company Coty, whose many brands include Covergirl, Max Factor, Bourjois and Rimmel.\n\nThe firm posted a loss of $12.1m in the quarter, as revenues shrank by more than 9% year-on-year to $2bn.\n\nThe poor results sent shares tumbling 18% in New York to $9.14.

The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.1 million people.\n\nThe offensive on Hudaydah, which is led by the United Arab Emirates, began in June.\n\nPro-government soldiers and militiamen made swift progress initially, capturing the city's southern suburbs and airport. But they did not push into the city centre, where rebel fighters set up sniper positions, dug trenches in streets, and laid landmines.\n\nThe escalation in fighting last week came after the US - which has provided logistical and intelligence support to the coalition along with the UK and France - called for a cessation of hostilities and the start of peace talks by late November.\n\nTwo hundred air strikes were reported in and around Hudaydah on Saturday alone, and aid workers say there have been intense clashes around the airport, to the east of the city, and near a university to the west.\n\nOn Wednesday, Save the Children said a health facility it supports in Hudaydah had come under attack, damaging a pharmacy supplying desperately needed medicine.\n\nArtillery shells had also hit residential areas and temporary roadblocks had prevented people from leaving or entering the city overnight, in effect trapping them in an active conflict zone, it added.\n\nThe UN Children's Fund (Unicef) warned on Tuesday that the fighting was \"dangerously close\" to the Al-Thawra hospital in southern Hudaydah, putting the lives of 59 children, including 25 in intensive care, at imminent risk of death.\n\n\"Medical staff and patients in the hospital have confirmed hearing heavy bombing and gunfire.

for buying her then 15-year-old daughter abortion pills.\n\nLawyers for the mother and daughter, who have been granted anonymity, argued the PPS decision to bring criminal charges breaches their human rights.\n\nThe woman could face up to a five-year jail term if convicted.\n\nLord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said the three Judges would give their decision as soon as they could.\n\nUnlike other parts of the UK, terminations are only legal in Northern Ireland to protect the pregnant female's life or if there is a risk of serious damage to her well-being.\n\nThe mother faces two charges of unlawfully procuring and supplying drugs with intent to procure a miscarriage, contrary to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act.\n\nA lawyer representing the Public Prosecution Service told the court on Wednesday that a possible interpretation of the circumstances was that the 15-year-old was \"the potential victim of a criminal offence\".\n\nFurther issues had been raised about the disclosure of information from a GP, and child and adolescent mental health services as part of the police investigation.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained\n\nAccording to the prosecution, the doctor's notes contain disputed \"hints\" that the daughter felt pressured over taking the medication.\n\nIt was also argued that a key question was whether the girl was beyond the 10-week mark in her pregnancy when the pills were sought.\n\nThe relevant online questionnaire had been filled in by her mother when it should have been completed by the daughter, the court was told.\n\nThe Belfast High Court also heard from the Attorney General for Northern Ireland, John Larkin QC.\n\nHe said that the case amounted to a \"collateral\" challenge to the ongoing criminal proceedings.\n\n'Both lives matter'\n\nMr Larkin argued that the challenge was not merely to the decision to prosecute, it was also in some way founded on the supposed legality of the provisions of the legislation that are being enforced by the PPS.\n\nHe told the court an attempt to change Northern Ireland's abortion regime had been \"comprehensively rejected\" by the Stormont Assembly in February 2016.\n\nHe said that \"the law in Northern Ireland considers that both lives matter\" seeking to protect both the mother and child, and he invited the court to continue to uphold that.\n\nIn June, a majority of the Supreme Court Judges said that the current law in NI on abortion was incompatible with Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, commented that the failure of the legislature to make clear what was to happen as a result of that ruling was \"unsatisfactory\".\n\n'Procuring and supplying poison'\n\nThis is the first time a prosecution relating to Northern Ireland's abortion law has been challenged.\n\nEarlier in the case, it had been claimed that the teenage girl was removed from a classroom and spoken to by police about the abortion pills purchase without her parents knowledge.\n\nBut a lawyer for the PSNI responded that the officer involved was focused only on her state of well-being, and never intended to question her.\n\nHow does the law in NI differ from the rest of the UK?\n\nTaking drugs to bring on a miscarriage without doctors' consent is an offence anywhere in the UK under the 1861 act.\n\nBut in England, Scotland and Wales, an abortion can be legally carried out up to the 24-week limit and can be legal beyond that limit in cases where the mother's health is threatened or if there is a substantial risk the baby will have serious disabilities.\n\nWomen in Northern Ireland only have access to abortions when a woman's life is at risk, or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health.\n\nWomen in England will be allowed to take an early abortion pill at home, under a government plan due to take effect by the end of the year, bringing the law into line with Scotland and Wales.", "Ryan Christie was involved in all three Celtic goals as they brushed Hearts aside in

Most efforts have failed.\n\nAssuming ExoMars can overcome this hurdle, it will use a package of instruments to look for signs of past or present life, employing a drill to extend the search below the harsh conditions that persist at the planet's surface.\n\nThe meeting at Leicester's university has been convened by the European Space Agency (Esa) and comprises senior academics and officials from industry.

They are ancient landscapes that contain abundant clays - the type of sediments which result from the alteration of rock through prolonged contact with water.\n\nIt is in just this kind of setting where you might find evidence for ancient microbial life.\n\nCuriosity, the American rover currently operating on Mars in a deep bowl known as Gale Crater, has detected clay minerals in mudstones that very probably formed in lakes and the streams that fed them.\n\nThe sediments of interest at Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis likely had similar sorts of origins.\n\nImage copyright ESA/DLR/FU Berlin/NASA/MGS/MOLA Image caption Oxia Planum was the preferred choice had the rover launched in 2018\n\nImage copyright ESA/DLR/FU Berlin/NASA/MGS/MOLA Image caption Mawrth Vallis: The ellipses describe zones that can be targeted with confidence\n\nIs science the only consideration?\n\nFar from it. Great scientific prospects count for nothing if you cannot land the robot in one piece.\n\nEurope's previous touch-down effort, the Schiaparelli mission, crashed into Mars' surface in 2016 when the probe's onboard computer became confused about its altitude during the descent and switched off the braking thrusters far too early.\n\nSchiaparelli smacked into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nExoMars will be using a similar entry, descent and landing strategy that incorporates a capsule, a parachute system and retro-rockets.\n\nA factor that will bear heavily on the Leicester discussions is the knowledge that Oxia is at a much lower elevation than Mawrth - by about 1,000m. This would give the descending robot's parachute much longer to bite Mars' thin atmosphere and slow the supersonic approach towards the surface.\n\nWhat else has to be thought about?\n\nIn addition, Mawrth's position is slightly to the north of Oxia.\n\nThe angle of approach required to get to this higher latitude necessarily produces greater uncertainty in the eventual touch-down point.\n\nEngineers talk of confidence zones that are elliptical in shape. For both locations these ellipses are 19km wide, but, in the case of Mawrth, the length is 190km.

Not even the football hipsters could make a confident claim on this one.\n\n\"I'm not well known in Wales or the UK so I could see how it would come as a surprise to many, but I knew it was in the works and there was a possibility of it happening,\" says the 26-year-old Lawrence.\n\nIt is a fair bet to say Lawrence's footballing story and rise to his recent international selection would be met with nods of approval from those who like their back stories more continentally quirky than conventional.\n\nAfter all, the centre-back from Henley-on-Thames will arrive in the Cardiff camp next week via a European education in the Netherlands and Slovakia.\n\nAnd that's before mentioning studying for a degree, being inspired by Johann Cruyff and having survived a heart scare.\n\n\"Yeah, I've definitely been though a lot,\" says Lawrence, who left behind youth football at Arsenal - where he was a very early team-mate of Harry Kane - and QPR when his parents Steve and Lynne moved to Amsterdam 10 years ago, sending off emails in the hope of a trial.\n\n\"We got a reply from a small club called Haarlem and I went there just to continue playing football and to enjoy it and it turned into something much, much more.\n\n\"I got scouted for Ajax and it was then I thought 'Wow, I can make a go of this'.\"\n\nWithin a short time at the iconic Eredivisie club, Lawrence was staring starry-eyed at his new coach and looking ahead to a very different career than he might have imagined.\n\n\"Working with Dennis Bergkamp was a dream come true,\" Lawrence says.\n\n\"I'd looked up to him for most of my childhood and, although I already had expectations of such a big club like Ajax, they were completely blown out of the water when he walked in.\n\n\"My time there was very educational; it took my playing and thinking about the game to another level.\n\n\"The Dutch way and their idea of football really helped me develop my game into the player I am now. It's why I think I've fitted into things so well in Belgium with Anderlecht.\"\n\nJames Lawrence (right) played in the Europa League for Slovakian side Trencin\n\nHis transfer this summer came after a move from Dutch youth football to the senior game in Slovakia with AS Trencin, where he spent four years and collected two domestic titles, playing in Europe along the way.\n\nAgain, hardly the conventional route.\n\n\"I've always just gone with the flow,\" Lawrence says.\n\n\"I've not thought too much about where I was but more what I was doing.\n\n\"To me the decisions were easy to move to Europe and try to play at the highest level I could. It was the same moving to Slovakia, playing for the champions and winning the double and playing in Europe.\n\n\"In England there's no way I would be doing that.\"\n\nPerhaps the leaps into the unknown make a little more sense given the jolt Lawrence received a year into his time with Ajax when a health scare saw him require heart surgery.\n\nFirst put down to a flutter, the step-up in intensity after going full-time saw him diagnosed with tachycardia, where his heart rate would worryingly race during training.\n\n\"It was pretty scary at the time. I was a young lad and I had to have an operation to burn a piece of the wall of the heart off so it could function normally,\" he recalls.\n\n\"It was scary not knowing whether I could continue and I was very lucky that it could be operated on. I managed to come back fit and I've not had any trouble since so I count my blessings.\"\n\nAs a back-up to his career - and with one eye on the future - Lawrence undertook a masters degree in international sports business management at the Johan Cruyff Institute in Amsterdam.\n\nHis father still works as a consultant for the Johan Cruyff Foundation that provides and supports sporting activities for disadvantaged children, where Lawrence also spent time volunteering and got to meet the icon of 'Total Football'.\n\n\"He was a huge inspiration, someone who had a real presence about them - when he had something to say, you listened,\" he says.\n\nSince his father and agent made the Football Association of Wales aware of his eligibility, via a grandmother from Pembrokeshire, Lawrence has been listening out for the phone call from Giggs.\n\n\"I knew they were having a look at me and to get the call and the chance to work with such prestigious players and coaches is a dream come true,\" he adds.\n\n\"I do think that my time in Europe can help. I've experienced different styles from youth football in England, Dutch football, Slovakian, Belgium, European, and I think it makes me more adaptable which coaches like.\n\n\"I can look back and think how far I've come and what I've been through to make it to this point and l think it can help.\"\n\nAs he prepares to join up with his new Wales team-mates, the European unknown with the unconventional route to the red shirt is ready for his next step.", "Image caption Four men are accused of rape and sex trafficking offences\n\nTwo 15-year-old girls were threatened with being left in the middle of nowhere if they refused to have sex with older men, a court has heard.\n\nThe girls were allegedly picked up from a children's home near Wrexham, taken to hotels and given alcohol between December 2011 and April 2012.\n\nJohn Delaney, 33, denies rape, sex trafficking and sexual assault.\n\nJohn Purcell, 31, and Todd Wickens, 28, deny rape and trafficking charges.

Their business interests include hotel operations and leasing of properties across Asia.\n\nWigan spent eight successive seasons in the Premier League between 2005 and 2013 and lifted their first major trophy, the FA Cup, three days before being relegated from the top flight.\n\nOff the pitch, Whelan also funded the construction of the 25,000 all-seater DW Stadium, which opened in 1999 at a cost of about \u00a330m.\n\nWhelan, now 81, stepped down as chairman of the Latics in 2015, leaving his grandson Sharpe in charge.\n\nMore recently, Wigan have twice won the League One title in the past three seasons and are currently 16th in the Championship.\n\nA 'special' story\n\nDave Whelan funded Wigan Athletic's move to the DW Stadium in 1999\n\nRoberto Martinez both played and managed Wigan, most notably leading them to their 2013 FA Cup victory against Manchester City at Wembley.\n\nThe Spaniard was in charge between 2009 and 2013 and went on to manage Everton and later Belgium.\n\n\"It's a very special story, what happened at Wigan Athletic, and I don't think we'll see it again,\" Martinez told BBC Radio Manchester.\n\n\"It's difficult to explain in words and do it justice.

From the basement of the Football League to the top tier in a decade, staying there for eight years, lifting the FA Cup and then playing in Europe takes some beating.\n\nBut you can see why the change had to take place.

How deep are their pockets? Will the new owners make the same bold prediction as Dave Whelan did when he arrived and proclaim their target will be to reach the Premier League?\n\nThere are pluses.

Moeen 4-66, Rashid 2-30, Leach 2-41 England lead by 177 runs Scorecard\n\nEngland bowled out Sri Lanka on day two of the first Test to move into a dominant position in Galle.\n\nDebutant Ben Foakes reached his first Test century before falling for 107 as England added 21 to their overnight total to post 342.\n\nThe tourists then produced a fine all-round bowling performance, with Moeen Ali taking 4-66, to bowl the hosts out for 203 in 68 overs.\n\nEngland reached 38-0 at the close, 177 runs ahead.\n\nJack Leach and Adil Rashid took two wickets each for England, with seamers James Anderson and Sam Curran getting one apiece.\n\nSri Lanka were 64-4 at lunch before a patient partnership of 75 between Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews, which was ended when Rashid dismissed Chandimal for 33 shortly before tea.\n\nMoeen then had Mathews caught at short leg from the first ball after tea and the final five wickets fell in 18.3 overs in the evening session.\n\nEngland are now in a strong position to secure their first overseas Test victory since October 2016 and end a 13-game winless run away from home.\n\nEngland's spinners shine\n\nEngland have not won any of their past four away Test series - drawing against Bangladesh and losing to India, Australia and New Zealand\n\nEngland's first-innings total had looked like a par score at best but their bowlers have put Joe Root's side in one of their most dominant positions in an overseas Test in recent years.\n\nThe team's quick bowlers are expected to play a less significant role in this series as spin comes to the fore but Anderson had Dimuth Karunaratne caught behind from the second ball of the hosts' innings.\n\nFor a few overs at least, both he and Sam Curran, who shared the new ball, found a hint of swing; the latter trapped Kaushal Silva lbw in the fourth over.\n\nOnce the swing stopped, Root introduced his spinners, with Jack Leach coming into the attack after the seventh over, and all three impressed.\n\nPlaying in his second Test, Leach bowled accurately and had Kusal Mendis caught at slip for his first wicket of the match, while Moeen bowled Dhananjaya de Silva in his first over shortly before lunch.\n\nMathews and Chandimal offered some resistance but then Rashid produced a fine leg-spinner that dipped and turned sharply to have Chandimal stumped.\n\nAfter tea Moeen then turned the game decisively in England's favour. He took the three quick wickets of Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella and Akila Dananjaya before Leach and Rashid returned to take the final two wickets.\n\nLeach and Moeen did the majority of the work throughout the day, bowling 39 overs combined to Rashid's nine, but all three were impressive.\n\nFoakes impresses with bat and gloves\n\nBen Foakes became the fifth wicketkeeper to make a century on Test debut\n\nFoakes had done the majority of the work needed to reach his century on day one by helping his team recover from 103-5 to close on 321-8, and without him England's dominant position would not have been possible.\n\nHe had been calm throughout his first day in Test cricket and continued in that vein on day two, stroking the first ball of the day for four through extra cover.\n\nLeach was dismissed with Foakes on 95, increasing the possibility of Foakes being left stranded before reaching three figures but Anderson survived the remainder of the over, giving Foakes the chance to reach the landmark.\n\nThe Surrey wicketkeeper-batsman then pulled a boundary behind square on the leg side to move to 99 and hit a fine back-foot drive through mid-on to complete his century from 200 balls.\n\nIn doing so he became only the second England wicketkeeper to score a hundred on his debut - following Matt Prior in 2007 - and just the fifth wicketkeeper to do so for any team in Tests.\n\nHe then claimed the joint-fastest dismissal by a keeper on his Test debut when taking a catch off Anderson to dismiss Karunaratne on the second ball of the hosts' innings.\n\nFoakes also showed good glovework to stump Chandimal off Rashid and took a smart catch when standing up to the stumps as Moeen claimed the scalp of Akila.\n\nSri Lanka fall flat\n\nFor Sri Lanka this was a seriously disappointing day.\n\nThe hosts had England in trouble at 103-5 on day one but might now need rain to avoid defeat.\n\nTheir batsmen seemed not to learn from the wickets of the England top order on day one, with a number of them also falling to attacking shots.\n\nDhananjaya departed in a similar fashion to Ben Stokes on day one, trying to sweep fine but getting bowled around his legs, and Chandimal, struggling with an injury, came aggressively down the pitch and was stranded out of his ground.\n\nAnd where England's lower order - Foakes, Curran and Rashid notably - were able to drag the tourists to a respectable total, Sri Lanka's final batsmen fell chipping to close fielders.\n\nAnalysis\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social\n\nOutstanding from England. They have played the proper way since lunch on the first day and Sri Lanka need rain or streakers from here.\n\nEngland can go and bat for the whole day tomorrow. Get one or two players to 100 - that can give them confidence for the rest of the tour and beyond.\n\nTake out the first session - England's last five sessions have been high class.\n\nThe pitch will only get worse to bat on.

It couldn't have gone much more to plan really. The guys had a word and said we did what we set out to do today.\n\n\"Foakesy got his hundred which was great and we got as many runs as we could, and then it was a case of trying to build some pressure on them and get some early inroads.

It was great to be involved in that group of spinners, I really enjoyed it.\n\n\"I feel like we complement each other nicely.

The company does well - much better than expected - and your promised bonanza duly arrives.\n\nHooray! Or rather, oh no, if your name is Jeff Fairburn.\n\nThere was no issue with the way he ran the company, it was just reputational damage caused by the \u00a375m pay award.\n\nThe public concern was stoked by the feeling that some of Persimmon's success was thanks to public subsidy - the Help to Buy programme has helped fuel the housing market, with Persimmon one of the beneficiaries.\n\nThere is also a wider concern - which is beginning to surface among economic commentators - that the big housebuilders are simply doing too well, with their enormous returns to shareholders over recent years the result not of good management but of the exploitation of what has become an oligopoly.\n\nWhat did Mr Fairburn say?\n\nMr Fairburn had previously said he would give a \"substantial proportion\" of the bonus to charity in an attempt to defuse the row.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that had not worked, partly because he never disclosed how much would be handed over.\n\n\"It is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down,\" he said.\n\nWhy was the bonus so big?\n\nThe bonus was based on awards of shares, the value of which rose sharply when low interest rates and a government house buying scheme helped raise Persimmon's performance.\n\nWhen the LTIP was set up in 2012 the shares were trading at \u00a34 but by the time bonuses were handed out last year the shares were trading at \u00a324.\n\nAs there was no cap on the award of shares, it meant there was no limit to the payout.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nHas anyone else left?\n\nChairman Roger Devlin replaced Nicholas Wrigley, whose resignation was announced in December.\n\nJonathan Davie, the non-executive director who was head of the remuneration committee, left at the same time.\n\nThe company said they had resigned because they realised the bonus scheme should have had a cap.\n\nThe company took further steps to attempt to defuse the row before April's annual general meeting by announcing that Mr Fairburn's bonus payout would be cut by \u00a325m by reducing the number of shares he was entitled to.\n\nAt that meeting AGM 48.5% of investors' votes were cast against the remuneration report.\n\nWhat are shareholders saying?\n\nEuan Stirling of Aberdeen Standard Investments said Persimmon's reputation had been \"tarnished\".\n\nAshley Hamilton Claxton, from Royal London Asset Management, said the company's move was \"understandable\", but was sorry to see \"changes to what we believe have been one of the best management teams in the industry\".\n\nWho is taking over?\n\nDavid Jenkinson, currently managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive from 31 December.\n\nHe had also been caught up in the pay row, as along with Mr Fairburn, and chief financial officer Mike Killoran he stood to share in a \u00a3200m payout.\n\nMr Jenkinson's share awards were cut by \u00a32.5m to \u00a340m ahead of the AGM.\n\nThe company said Mr Jenkinson's pay would not change while he was interim chief executive.", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The story of election night in two minutes\n\nThe Democrats have clawed their way back to a measure of power in the US federal government. The era of unified rule for Donald Trump and the Republicans is over.\n\nCalling just two years an \"era\" may be a stretch, of course, but in the age of Trump even days and weeks can seem like an infinite and expanding series of news cycles.\n\nFor the duration of his presidency, Mr Trump has benefited from a friendly Congress - generally supportive of his words and deeds, accommodating of his policy priorities and deferential when it comes to oversight.\n\nIn two months, when the new Democratic-controlled House arrives in Washington, all that will change.\n\nThe House of Representatives, which reliably churned out hard-line immigration legislation, Obamacare repeal and steep cuts to social programmes under Republican rule - even though many of the bills died in the Senate - will now start offering up progressive priorities.\n\nFirst on the list, according to the likely Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, is a package of government ethics and election reform measures.\n\nNow it's Democrats' turn to see their efforts languish in the Senate, but liberals finally have a platform to showcase what they would do with full control of Congress - and, perhaps, the presidency in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump's only hope of achieving any signature laws is by working across the aisle - which may be a heavy lift for a man who spent the past few months disparaging his political opponents in the starkest of language at rallies across the country.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nOf more immediate concern for the president, however, is that Democrats now have some teeth behind their efforts to scrutinise his administration.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, which ran the chamber's investigation into 2016 Russian investigation meddling, will be under the control of outspoken Trump antagonist Adam Schiff, who has pledged to look deeper into the president's foreign financial dealings.\n\nIt may not be long before the president's tax returns, that Holy Grail for some of the president's liberal antagonists, are revealed to the public.\n\nOther members of the Trump administration may also be open to scrutiny. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke may be first under the spotlight following accusations that he took official actions that benefited his business interests.\n\nThen there's the i-word - impeachment.\n\nIt takes a simple majority of the House to undertake the first step to removing a president, and the Democrats now have that majority.\n\nUp until now, members of the Democratic congressional leadership have been downplaying the prospect of starting that particular ball rolling. If Special Counsel Robert Mueller files his report into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump 2016 presidential campaign in the coming days (weeks or months) and it contains damning information, that calculus could quickly change.\n\nAlthough the president may be in for a rude awakening from House Democrats, the Republicans' ability to hold - and expand - their majority in the Senate is unequivocally good news for Mr Trump.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Democrats had moments to cheer\n\nThe Republican Party's conservative pipeline to the federal judiciary remains open. The president has already appointed 84 judges to the courts, including two Supreme Court justices. Democrats are left hoping that the four liberal members of the bench remain in good health for the next two years.\n\nIt will now also be less difficult for the Senate to confirm new high-level Trump administration officials who might have been blocked or significantly delayed if Democrats had taken over.\n\nThis makes it easier, say, for the president to fire and replace \"beleaguered\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions with someone who would curtail Mr Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nAsk a question\n\nAt some point the president may even decide to nominate a new director of the Environmental Protection Agency, a position that has been filled on an interim basis since Scott Pruitt resigned under an ethical cloud on 6 July.\n\nBeyond the nuts-and-bolts reality of partisan control of Congress, the mid-terms have larger implications for Mr Trump's political power - and his prospects for re-election.\n\nFor two years he's governed the nation with an eye toward satisfying his loyal base both with policy and rhetoric - on trade, immigration, government regulation and foreign policy. Unlike his predecessors, he's made little effort to broaden his national appeal.\n\nThat probably helped his party win some Senate seats in states where the president remains popular, but the verdict was far from universal. Joe Manchin once again defied political gravity in West Virginia, and contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania that may have seemed in reach in the days after the president's 2016 victory were comfortable wins for the Democratic incumbents.\n\nMeanwhile, the preach-to-the-choir strategy may have proven costly in suburban, traditionally Republican congressional districts with wealthier, better-educated populations. These voters stuck by Mr Trump in 2016, but they deserted his party in droves this year.\n\nIf that trend continues, states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan may prove more difficult for the president to carry in a 2020 re-election campaign. Mr Trump has liked to boast about all the House Republicans who won special elections during his administration, but this time around, as voters headed to the polls across the nation, his political losses had a sizeable body count.\n\nIf Mr Trump is eying his re-election prospects - and, let's be honest, that's what every first-term president does pretty much from inauguration day on - Tuesday's results have some bright spots, however.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Gone are the days of allies leading the House\n\nA Trump-adoring Republican, Ron DeSantis, won the governor's mansion in Florida, as did Republicans in Iowa and Ohio. If Mr Trump's party can win state-wide in those battleground states in the current political climate, there's no reason to think they can't swing the president's way again in two years.\n\nEven handing over power to Democrats in the House of Representatives may have a bit of a silver lining for the president. Now he'll have someone to blame if the economy takes a turn for the worse (and, given business cycle realities, it might). He's got a ready-made explanation for why he can't get anything done in the next two years - and a pitch for what needs to change in the next election.\n\nDay in and day out, he'll have a set of clear political opponents to contrast himself with.\n\nBoth Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost control of the House in their first term in office and went on to win re-election. History, serving as a guide, predicted this would probably be a bad night for the president.\n\nHistory also indicates that while the road may be rocky, better days could be ahead.", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption M&S boss Steve Rowe says he is 'protecting the magic'\n\nMarks & Spencer has reported falling clothing and food sales and warned that it sees little improvement in sales this year.\n\nLike-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were down 2.2% for the six months to the end of September.\n\nFood sales were down 2.9% and clothing and home sales slid 1.1%.\n\nM&S warned trading conditions for the remainder of the financial year will remain \"challenging\".\n\n\"We are expecting little improvement in sales trajectory,\" the firm said.\n\nM&S chief executive Steve Rowe told the BBC that food was \"trading behind our expectations\", but the retailer was \"reshaping\" its business with prices lowered on hundreds of food items.\n\n\"What we are doing is making sure we protect the magic of M&S,\" he said.\n\nRevenue fell 3.1% to \u00a34.96bn, but underlying pre-tax profits ticked up 2% to \u00a3223.5m.\n\nShares ended the day 0.5% lower at 300.9p, valuing the company at \u00a35bn.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter\n\nMarks & Spencer has an organisation that is \"silo-ed, slow and hierarchical\". Not the words of a hedge fund looking to short the shares of one of the nation's favourite retailers, but the verdict of the company's own chief executive, Steve Rowe.\n\nThe damning judgement is delivered in the company's half-year results. They show the same pattern of trade of recent years - clothing in a slow slide, food a bit worse than expected, with like-for-like sales down nearly 3% - but are remarkable for their clear-eyed view of what needs to be done to break that pattern.\n\nFewer stores - 100 will close - a better online offering, and in general a tightening-up of management and structures that should save \u00a3350m a year.\n\nSome critics will say that Mr Rowe is not going far enough, or fast enough, with some advocating a break-up of the company or other radical surgery.\n\nThere is a clue, though, in the half-year figures as to why stronger medicine has not been adopted. The average leasehold commitment that M&S has on its stores is 20 years. Going faster in closing stores or shrinking them would be extremely expensive.\n\nRetail analyst Steve Dresser, director of Grocery Insight, tweeted: \"You can't run a business on meal deals and 25% off wines forever but these things take time to back out of.\n\n\"Closures of established stores will also impact food as it's not always the case they didn't perform - onerous leases also impacted.\"\n\nM&S plans to close 100 shops by 2022, as announced in May - a move it says is \"vital\" for its future.\n\nMr Rowe said the retailer was \"continuing to review\" its store closure programme and did not rule out further closures, especially as a third of its business would be online in future.\n\nHe said 32 million people visited M&S stores every year, so the retailer had \"a broad range of customers\".\n\n\"What we have to do is have a broad range of merchandise available that suits all their tastes,\" he added.\n\nUnder its plan, M&S intends to have fewer, larger clothing and homeware stores in better locations.\n\nThe retailer points out that its clothing and homeware business has \"an ageing customer base, a very wide range, a weak supply chain and and ageing store portfolio\".\n\nIt is facing heightened competition from online retailers, as well as discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Primark.\n\nIts directors were not awarded bonuses this year because of the disappointing results.", "Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri takes a rueful look at the Champions League trophy after failing to guide his side to victory over Real Madrid in the 2017 final at the Principality Stadium\n\nIt's the 2017 Champions League final, Casemiro scores Real Madrid's second and Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri looks at his bench to find nothing but mediocrity.\n\nMario Lemina, Juan Cuadrado - who was eventually sent off - and Claudio Marchisio, an outstanding player who never looked the same after his cruciate ligament injuries, are the options.\n\nJuventus had once again found themselves on the brink of winning the big one, desperate to prove their time was now.\n\nIt wasn't, again. They would go on to lose 4-1.\n\n\"We played brilliantly in the first half, but in the second we were beaten up. We found ourselves under pressure and had no solution,\" remarked Allegri.\n\nHe simply didn't have the weapons Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane had on the bench.\n\nWhile the Frenchman could bring on Alvaro Morata, Marco Asensio and Gareth Bale, Allegri had limited resources. Rather upsetting for a coach rated largely for his ability to make the right substitutions at the right time to change the game.\n\nAllegri confessed he found it difficult to continue at Juve after that match. It was draining. You could play the best football, united in a mission and outstanding at the back but lose to a moment of individual brilliance from stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nBuying Ronaldo must be the solution then. An Italian giant starving for European honours, Juventus are doing everything they can to win the Champions League trophy they have chased for over two decades and nothing announced that desperation more than the purchase of the reigning Ballon d'Or winner, a 33-year-old CR7.\n\nCosta the truffle hog searching for delicacies\n\nCristiano Ronaldo and Juventus team-mate Douglas Costa during Champions League victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford\n\nThe world's best player's arrival in Turin certainly stole the headlines and Juventus have had their best start to a Serie A season, winning every game in every competition except for one. But in truth, Ronaldo is the icing on the cake, not the whole cake.\n\nRather than depend on Ronaldo - sent off in Juve's opening match and without a goal so far in this Champions League campaign - Federico Bernardeschi dazzled and Miralem Pjanic converted against Valencia and Paulo Dybala hit three alongside Mario Mandzukic against Young Boys.\n\nNo Mandzukic against Manchester United? No problem. Dybala started alongside Cuadrado and Ronaldo and all three combined to score the only goal of the game.\n\nWhen Allegri looked at his bench in search of solutions that fateful night in Cardiff last year, few presented themselves. This season, he's simply overwhelmed by his options, all capable of changing the game.\n\nAt Old Trafford, he introduced both Douglas Costa and Bernardeschi from the bench to keep Juve unpredictable at the top. The former has faced a spot of trouble at Juventus this season after spitting at an opponent in the match against Sassuolo but his performances for the Italians prior to that incident has been nothing short of excellent.\n\nLike a truffle hog in search of delicacies, Costa identifies and exploits space at full speed and like no other.\n\nWhile he once played with his head down and no direction, clinging on to the ball for too long, Costa has improved under Allegri, making clever decisions and an impact off the bench. Brazil coach Tite recognised the quality of the player when he regularly looked at Costa to make the difference at the World Cup.\n\nIntroduce him against a tiring opponent and Costa's quality becomes harder to ignore. Gazzetta dello Sport calculated that as a substitute, Costa has secured 15 points for the Bianconeri.\n\nDybala finally making impact\n\nPaulo Dybala scored the only goal for Juventus in last month's victory over Manchester United\n\nBernardeschi was the other man chosen to come on against Manchester United. Capable of playing as a winger, in midfield or even as a false number nine as he does for Roberto Mancini in the Italy team, Bernardeschi boasts intellect, speed and insane technique. He simply elevates the level of play in the final third and reads the game well.\n\nAgainst Valencia, the winger positioned himself well, delivered accuracy, vision and consistent ideas. Against Frosinone, he played in midfield and injected imagination, speed of thought and speed of movement to the game.\n\nThen there's Dybala. A player with infinite potential who has struggled to impress in the big moments when all eyes have been focused on him, but this season he's thriving alongside the many team-mates he knows are competing for a place in the starting XI.\n\nScoring the winning goal at Old Trafford, Dybala has played in a number of different positions and formations and is slowly learning how to impose his talent whatever the circumstances. Against Cagliari over the weekend, the diminutive Argentine took only 42 seconds to open the scoring for Juventus.\n\nIf it's not him starting, then it will be another. Ronaldo brings supreme quality and a winning mentality but the talents flanking him and the club's squad depth is the main reason why Juve could be the team to beat in Europe. Especially when you consider those talents are in the hands of Allegri, the master of substitutions, versatility and balance.\n\nIs there an anti-Juve?\n\nThe Juventus team and squad now gives manager Massimiliano Allegri plenty more options than was at his disposal in defeat in the final of the Champions League two seasons ago\n\nIn Italy, the media is obsessed with finding the 'anti-Juve' - the team who journalists feel will challenge Juventus at the top of the Serie A table. Will it be Inter, the physical side that know how to bully and harass and make the most of their chances while securing clean sheets? Or will it be Napoli, the side blessed with technical players who rotate the ball beautifully and ping it from side to side to uncover gaps and opportunities?\n\nThe truth is there is no 'anti-Juve' because only Allegri's side can field two separate teams of stars and play both styles of football.\n\nThey can deploy Mandzukic and Ronaldo upfront with Emre Can and Sami Khedira in midfield and bully their way from top to bottom, making the most of their aggression, strength and power.\n\nOr they can rely on Dybala and Rodrigo Bentancur who, as evidenced in that match against Jose Mourinho's men, is the master at positioning himself well, cutting out passing lanes and delivering technique and accuracy.\n\nThere is a player available for each type of style and football Juve are looking to play.\n\nBeautiful football is not based around possession or fluent interchanging of passes but in executing a game plan perfectly.\n\nJuventus have often been criticised for not playing a particularly exciting brand of football but offer them a challenge this season and they'll present you with arguably the best football in Europe played in a multitude of ways and utilising a full squad of players Allegri is happy to rotate.\n\nYes Ronaldo is the difference maker, but to focus only on him would be a mistake.", "Tommy Seymour does not \"feel any jealousy\" for those picking the Scotland team\n\nAutumn Test: Scotland v Fiji Venue: Murrayfield, Edinburgh Date: Saturday, 10 November Kick-off: 14:30 GMT Coverage: Watch on BBC One, listen on BBC Radio Scotland, text commentary on the BBC Sport website\n\nScotland's depth has \"improved massively\" to give Gregor Townsend a selection headache, says Tommy Seymour.\n\nHead coach Townsend has Stuart Hogg and Finn Russell back in contention this week, but the likes of Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings offer alternatives.\n\n\"Looking down at the youth we have coming through and the competition for positions, it's no longer an easy selection process,\" said wing Seymour.\n\n\"I don't feel any jealousy for the coaches having to pick a team.\"\n\nSeymour's Glasgow team-mate Hogg has returned to the Scotland squad ahead of Saturday's Test with Fiji and is now in the final stages of his recovery from the ankle injury he picked up nine weeks ago.\n\nForwards coach Danny Wilson indicated on Monday that Hogg still has \"some boxes to tick\" to be available for selection, suggesting Edinburgh's Kinghorn, 21, could retain his place at full-back, having started there in Saturday's loss to Wales.\n\n\"Obviously if you take the likes of Hoggy out of any team then you're going to see a difference,\" said Seymour.\n\n\"But I've trained with Blair now over a number of camps and he's an unbelievably exciting prospect and an incredible player.\"\n\n'One of the biggest defensive challenges in world rugby'\n\nHastings deputised for Racing 92 fly-half Russell in Cardiff, with the first match of Scotland's autumn series falling outside the designated international window.\n\n\"Adam's done really well at 10 and he's been great for Glasgow this year,\" said Seymour. \"A lot of it comes down to experience and getting used to the Test-match level and what it takes to adapt and fit in with that.\n\n\"We are amassing a really talented young squad that's competing in every position bar none, and that's a great thing for us going into what will be a huge year with the World Cup.\n\n\"With the amount of games we've got to look forward to between now and then, we'll be in a really good place going into it.\"\n\nTownsend has described Fiji as \"the equivalent to Brazil in football\", with outstanding individuals such as Edinburgh number eight Viliame 'Bill' Mata and Seymour's former Glasgow team-mate Leone Nakarawa.\n\n\"They're going to be a huge challenge for us,\" added the wing, who has scored 16 tries in his 44 Tests. \"It's easy to see where Fiji's traits lie - incredible athletes, dynamic with the ball in hand, powerful.\n\n\"And then couple that with their rugby ability, their skill, their offloading and footwork.

It enables them to thwart his agenda, and as our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher puts it: \"After two years in the darkness, Democrats have a means to fight back.\" As well as more effectively blocking legislative plans, the Democrats could now launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest.\n\nBut it hasn't been the tsunami many on the left were hoping for, Zurcher adds. Mr Trump's Republicans have stayed in control of the Senate and even look likely to strengthen their majority, leading the president to declare the night \"a tremendous success\". Controlling the Senate means Republicans can confirm any appointments to Mr Trump's administration or the judiciary, and it also makes it easier for him to replace officials.\n\nSo what does a divided Congress mean?

She wasn't a team-mate and she most definitely wasn't a friend.\n\nBartrip hates what Ana did to her. She had control of her life and \"played her like a puppet\" - yet Ana wasn't a real person.\n\n'Ana' was the name Reading defender Bartrip gave to the voice inside her head during her teenage battle with anorexia.\n\n\"It was like this evil person on my shoulder who wanted me to fail,\" she tells BBC Sport.\n\nNow 22, Bartrip is a fit, strong and healthy athlete. But at the age of 14, she \"self-destructed\" after a torn hamstring and subsequent non-selection for the England Under-15s left her thinking the opportunity of ever representing her country was gone.\n\nFor six months, Bartrip did all she could to avoid eating. She would hide her food when her parents weren't looking or throw it out of the window.\n\nBut while football was the trigger for Bartrip's demise, \"it was also my cure\", she says.\n\nThis is her story.\n\nAged 14 - 'Ana' takes control\n\n\"Ana told me everything I needed to do. 'You need to go for an extra run today', 'look at the calories in this'. She had control of my life and played me like a puppet,\" Bartrip says.\n\n\"I couldn't fight her back, and I really thought I was going to give up at one point.\"\n\nAna was a plague on Bartrip's life, but whatever she said went. It was an incredibly tough time for Bartrip's family but she felt no guilt towards them.\n\nAt her lowest, Bartrip was self-harming - she would lock herself in her room, climb under her bed and hurt herself.\n\n\"I don't know why I did it - it was Ana,\" she says.\n\nAs anorexia and Ana took hold, Bartrip's decline was rapid.\n\nInternational hopes slip\n\nBartrip - pictured with her younger brother Joseph - on holiday in the USA aged 14\n\nBartrip has loved football from day dot. After being scouted while playing for a local boys' team, she enjoyed spells at Tottenham, Charlton and Arsenal.\n\nIt was during her time at the Gunners that England came calling. But the day before their first game in the Netherlands, Bartrip was injured and was forced to watch the match from the stands, away from her team-mates.\n\n\"I remember seeing my mum, dad, brother and grandparents in the stand. I was sat a bit higher up, and my mum turned around to me and was crying, because she wanted me on the pitch,\" Bartrip says.\n\nShe wasn't selected for the next England camp and that's when, Bartrip says, she \"lost her head\".\n\n\"I don't know how to explain what happened at that moment, I just knew I wasn't OK and then gradually started to eat less and less,\" she says.\n\n\"When I didn't get selected, I thought that was the end of the world for me - that was my chance of ever playing for England gone.\"\n\nDoctors said it was 'obvious' it was anorexia - the diagnosis\n\nGrowing up, Bartrip loved food. Bacon and a packet of crisps - though perhaps not together - were her favourites, and her schoolmates would be jealous of her packed lunches.\n\nBut after missing out on international selection, she \"lost control\", eating less and less every day and throwing her lunches away. It was only when her best friend caught her doing so that her mum found out.\n\n\"My mum took me straight to the doctors. I'd lost so much weight in about three weeks, and the doctor said it was obvious I had anorexia nervosa,\" Bartrip says.\n\nBartrip was \"sneaky\" in how she avoided eating but her parents had a few tricks of their own, including putting full-fat butter in the tubs of low-fat spread in a bid to help their daughter put on weight.\n\n\"Sometimes when I got weighed, I would put extra clothes on so it looked as though I was heavier than I was, or I would put something in my pocket like my phone,\" she says.\n\n\"That was Ana playing me, that was Ana telling me it was fine to do.\"\n\nBartrip was at her lowest weight.\n\nLiver failure - and light at the end of the tunnel\n\nBartrip eventually became so ill that her parents took her to hospital. Her BMI was dangerously low, her liver had started to fail and soft, downy hair had started to grow on her body. Had her BMI been just 1% lower, doctors would have been forced to tube-feed her.\n\n\"That was really scary,\" she says. \"I was basically killing myself at the time, which was quite drastic.\n\n\"From that moment, I knew I needed to change.\"\n\nRemarkably, it wasn't that moment that provided the \"kick up the bum\" Bartrip knew she needed. In fact, it was looking at an Arsenal squad photo that had been posted on Facebook.\n\n\"Everyone on it looked huge. I looked at myself at that point and thought 'maybe I'm never going to play football again because I can't play football with those girls',\" she says.\n\n\"That was the moment I realised I did actually want to be playing, I wanted to reach my dream. It was definitely not a light switch moment, but each day I got better; each day I began to try and eat more.\"\n\nBartrip joined Reading from Arsenal in 2014\n\n'Dad, I want a curry' - on the road to recovery\n\n\"The one question I always feared was 'what is for dinner?' My dad would ask it but I would never answer,\" Bartrip says.\n\n\"But this one day, I suddenly turned around and said 'Dad, I really fancy a curry'. I don't think I've ever seen him run so quickly in his entire life - he was straight down to the nearest curry shop.\"\n\nBartrip knew at that point that she was going to get better, that she had the mental strength to beat the illness that for so long controlled her life.\n\n\"That was me basically punching this person on my shoulder,\" she adds.\n\n\"I was definitely eating more and Ana got quieter and quieter. That was when I knew I was beating her. I didn't hear her as much and it was the best feeling in the world knowing I could knock that person out.\"\n\nSuch was the damage she had done to her body, Bartrip didn't gain weight for years, despite returning to eating normally.\n\nNot until five years later could Bartrip face eating bacon again, and it was at that moment, aged 19, she knew her recovery was complete.\n\nSince her recovery, she has joined Reading and played for England's youth teams on countless occasions. She screamed when she received her first call-up post-illness.\n\n\"I had to be with my family at that point,\" she says. \"I was starting at right-back, I sang the national anthem and I was thinking 'I've done it, I've actually done it'.\"\n\nHer life since has not been without its ups and downs, however, having faced both anxiety and depression. But for now, Bartip says she feels \"on top of the world\".\n\n\"Right now I feel that I can do whatever I want,\" she says.\n\nFor details of organisations which offer advice and support with eating disorders, visit bbc.co.uk/actionline", "Reading Women defender Molly Bartrip speaks out about overcoming anorexia as a teenager and the voice called \"evil Ana\" who controlled her.\n\nREAD MORE: How football went from trigger to 'cure' -

Abortions may have become harder to obtain in some states, while cannabis smoking will be easier in others. Alcohol, transgender rights and chickens were also on the ballot.\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\nSan Francisco's tax on tech\n\nVoters in the Californian city have voted in favour of Proposition C - a controversial measure supporters say will greatly help the city solve its crippling homelessness crisis.\n\nIt will bring in an estimated $250m-$300m (\u00a3190m-\u00a3228m) a year in added taxes from about 400 of the city's biggest companies, to be spent specifically on the problem.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are reported to be at least 7,000 homeless people in San Francisco\n\nNaturally, this means the measure has been seen as a tax on the tech giants which dominate this part of the world - firms that are often blamed for driving up living costs, pushing thousands onto the streets.\n\nMore than $7m was spent on campaigning, most of it ($5.7m) in support of the measure.\n\nA deepening crisis on the streets of America\n\nProp C's biggest supporter was Marc Benioff, the charismatic chief executive of Salesforce - a firm which would be among those taxed. Benioff, widely suspected of harbouring political ambitions of his own, backed the campaign with about $1m of his own money.\n\nThose opposed included Twitter's Jack Dorsey, who engaged in very public debates with Benioff on, where else, Twitter.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The story of election night in two minutes\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, one critic of the tax was San Francisco Mayor London Breed. She cited a lack of adequate accountability for existing funds to fight homelessness as a reason not to gather even more.\n\nHowever, it passed. The money will go to things like rent subsidies, permanent housing help, hygiene measures and more. It won't solve homelessness overnight, but as far as a majority of San Francisco voters are concerned - it's a start.\n\nMany a proposition - including for chickens\n\nCalifornians were asked to vote on a number of propositions that ranged from housing help for veterans, the elderly and those with mental health issues to approving the renovation of children's hospitals.\n\nThey rejected a proposal to limit the amount dialysis clinics can charge patients - prompting a jump in healthcare stocks - and a proposal to repeal gas tax increases approved by lawmakers last year.\n\nBut voters agreed to allow the state legislature to decide on daylight saving time, and approved a ban on the sale of meat and eggs from any animals (including chickens) not housed in adequately-sized spaces.\n\nAbortion on the ballot\n\nVoters in Alabama and West Virginia approved amendments to their state constitutions that could restrict access to abortion.\n\nWith most votes returned, people in Alabama approved by a clear margin an amendment that makes it state policy to \"recognise and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The results in West Virginia and Alabama are a win for pro-lifers\n\nThe margin was narrower in West Virginia, where voters approved an amendment that says \"nothing in this constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion\". The measure prevents federal money being used to fund abortions, and could affect women on low incomes.\n\nVoters in Oregon appear to have rejected a similar measure to restrict state funds for abortions, according to partial returns.\n\nWomen's rights groups say the measures approved by Alabama and West Virginia could lead to a full ban in those states if the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturns the 1973 ruling that legalised abortion.\n\n'Brunch Bill'\n\nA referendum in a number of Georgia communities to introduce an earlier drinking time on Sundays got overwhelming approval.\n\nSome 87 counties and cities across the state, including in the capital Atlanta, voted on what has become known as the \"Brunch Bill\". Local media reported there was around 75% approval in many of the cities.\n\nIt means sales of alcohol can begin at 11:00 on a Sunday instead of 12:30.\n\nVoting rights for Florida's ex-convicts\n\nAn estimated 1.2 million Florida residents who served time in prison have regained the right to vote, thanks to passage of a new state constitutional amendment.\n\nAmendment 4 received 65% of the vote, according to the Miami Herald, changing 150-year-old language in the state's constitution.\n\nPreviously, Florida was one of just four states in the US that automatically and permanently revoked voting rights from anyone who had been convicted of a felony-level crime. They could seek clemency, but needed to wait five years until after their release and then apply to the governor's office. Since 2011, Republican Governor Rick Scott has only given the vote back to about 2,000 people.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The constitutional amendment needed approval from 60% of Florida residents\n\nTo be eligible now, former prisoners must have completed their sentences and all the terms of their release, including probation. The language of the amendment excludes those convicted of murder and serious sexual offenses, but supporters still estimate that more than 1 million Floridians who have served time in prison will become newly eligible to vote.\n\nA cross-party, grassroots coalition gathered about 800,000 signatures to get the amendment on the 6 November ballot. The measure needed 60% to pass.\n\nLanguage stripping the vote from felons was written into the state constitution 150 years ago, during the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era, as a means to prevent African-Americans from voting.\n\nSupporters of the amendment argued for months that preventing former inmates from voting unfairly disenfranchised men and women who had repaid their debt to society, and prevented them from fully integrating back into society. They also argued that such laws disproportionately impact African-Americans.\n\nIt had powerful backing, including from celebrities such as singer John Legend and Orange is the New Black author Piper Kerman.\n\nTransgender rights in Massachusetts\n\nVoters in Massachusetts approved a measure that provides protections for transgender and non-binary people - making it the first state in the US to do so.\n\nThey agreed to uphold a law, first signed in 2016, that forbids discrimination on the basis of gender in public places.\n\nLegalising cannabis\n\nVoters in four states were asked to decide on the legalisation of cannabis - for recreational use in Michigan and North Dakota, and for medical use in Utah and Missouri.\n\nNot all the votes have yet been counted, but projections suggest only North Dakotans voted against legalising the drug.\n\nIf the result is confirmed, Michigan becomes the first US Midwest state to allow adults over the age of 21 to both possess and grow small amounts of marijuana. It will also levy a 10% sales tax on businesses selling the drug.\n\nUtah's measure allows privately-owned chemists to sell cannabis to people with qualifying illnesses while in Missouri, patients have been given permission to grow their own cannabis for medicinal use.\n\nThirty-one US states have now legalised cannabis for medicinal use, while nine states have approved it for recreational use.\n\nJury changes in Louisiana\n\nLouisiana, like Florida, also threw out a post-Civil War ruling; this one had allowed for split verdicts in serious felony cases, such as murder or drug dealing.\n\nVoters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment requiring juries to be unanimous in their verdict or declare themselves deadlocked.\n\nUntil now a verdict could be given if 10 of 12 jurors agreed. Oregon is the only other state that allows for split juries, although not for murder cases.", "Image copyright Home Office Image caption A man suspected of being the driver of the lorry has appeared in court\n\nTwenty-one people, including children as young as 12, have been found inside a refrigerated lorry entering the UK.\n\nThe group, thought to be from Vietnam, was concealed among a load of sparkling water at the port of Newhaven in Sussex on Thursday.\n\nDetails of the Border Force operation have only just emerged, but a criminal investigation is under way.\n\nA Romanian man, believed to be the driver, has been charged with assisting unlawful entry into the UK.\n\nIt had earlier been reported 15 children had been found in the lorry, but the figure was later revised by the Home Office.\n\nA spokesman said the group included 17 people claiming to be aged between 12 and 17 who \"presented themselves as Vietnamese\".\n\n\"A total of 11 were later confirmed to be minors.

I worked as a chef before I became a barber.\n\n\"I also taught myself to DJ when I was a teenager after watching someone DJ at a party, and I have been playing ever since,\" he adds.\n\n\"That's how I learn - by copying others and then remembering how they did it.\"\n\nRecognising dyslexia\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDyslexia Scotland estimates that 1 in 10 people have dyslexia.\n\nDyslexia is classed as a disability under the Equality Act and although there is no \"cure\", practical things can be done to help overcome some of the barriers it presents.\n\nSpotting it early is important, and with support those with dyslexia can find ways to learn which suit them better.\n\nCompared to when John was at school 20 years ago, teachers are now more equipped and prepared to deal with dyslexia and children are often better supported.\n\nDyslexia Scotland's chief executive Cathy McGee said: \"In Scotland there has been a lot of work involved in raising wider awareness and equipping teachers with the knowledge, skills and confidence to identify and support dyslexia in schools.\"\n\nTeachers can complete online training modules, with some local councils now making these compulsory for all newly qualified teachers, she added.\n\n'Huge challenges'\n\nEvents like Dyslexia Awareness Week also help \"encourage young people to talk about their dyslexia and ask for support\", she said.\n\nHowever, Dyslexia Scotland said teachers and schools still faced \"huge challenges in supporting all pupils in the classroom\".\n\nMs McGee said cuts to classroom assistants and support-for-learning staff had put extra pressure on teachers and limited their time to take part in training and learning opportunities.\n\nShe added: \"We hear every day from parents and others calling our helpline who are experiencing delays, frustrations and barriers in their children's dyslexia being identified and supported.\n\n\"Therefore, although we know that there is a lot of very good practice, there is still a very long way to go.\"", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe first phase of an NHS Grampian action plan to tackle the downgrading of maternity services at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin is to be published next week.\n\nWomen considered to be at risk now have to have their babies elsewhere following the downgrading, which was due to staff shortages.\n\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman has visited Dr Gray's for discussions.\n\nNHS Grampian medical director Nick Fluck said progress has been made.\n\nThe downgrading came into effect in July.\n\nIn August, Ms Freeman said the plan for returning a full consultant-led maternity service needed to improve.\n\nNHS Grampian recently announced it was reintroducing elective Caesarean sections earlier than planned, after recruiting additional staff.\n\n'Unsettling time'\n\nDr Fluck said of Wednesday's talks: \"We continued our positive discussions.\n\n\"Phase one of our action plan will be published next week.

What a Lovely War\" and the BBC series \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", which satirised the tactic of sending large numbers of men out of the trenches to advance towards the enemy guns.\n\nIt claimed the aim of every military effort on the Western Front was to move Haig's drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin.\n\nImage copyright 1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right Image caption The BBC's Blackadder Goes Forth lampooned Field Marshal Haig's tactics\n\nHowever Prof Gary Sheffield, of the department of war studies at Wolverhampton University, said Haig deserves better than to be regarded as a \"pantomime villain\".\n\nHe said the field marshal's record should not be viewed through the prism of hindsight.\n\nProf Sheffield said Haig, who was born in Edinburgh in 1861 into a life of privilege, was very much a late 19th-Century figure.\n\nImage copyright Hulton Archive Image caption A childhood portrait of Douglas Haig in Edinburgh from about 1870\n\nThe historian said it was not right to judge him, either in personality or approach, by 21st Century standards.\n\nHaving presided over the horrific slaughter of the Somme offensive in 1916 and the equally bloody battle of Aras the following year, Haig had undoubtedly learned valuable lessons, Prof Sheffield said.\n\nThese paved the way to ultimate victory in 1918, with a series of victories unmatched in Britain's military history, he claimed.\n\n\"It makes little sense to compare him to any other previous general because actually warfare changed so profoundly during the First World War,\" Prof Sheffield said.\n\n\"He was a war manager as much as anything else, managing this vast army, helping it to train, equip, as well as being a general on the battlefield.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The Field Marshal's interest in the welfare of injured servicemen led to the establishment of the Earl Haig Fund\n\nThe historian also said that Haig's role as an advocate for veterans reflected well on him.\n\nHe said that even before the Armistice, Haig had worked to help servicemen left disabled by war wounds.\n\nThe Earl Haig fund he established still provides support for those wounded or widowed by conflict.\n\nImage copyright Topical Press Agency Image caption Earl Haig watches the stamping of poppies by ex-servicemen during a visit to the British Legion poppy factory at Richmond in 1926\n\nThe poppy factory in Edinburgh, established by Earl Haig's wife, is at the forefront of the immense fundraising effort and is her husband's legacy today, according to its manager Major Charlie Pelling.\n\nHe said: \"Haig was a Scot.

working-age population is set to fall from 2018 onwards\n\nScotland's ageing population poses a \"real risk\" to the country's budget in future, a Holyrood committee has said.\n\nThe working-age population is set to fall from 2018 onwards, alongside a big increase in the number of over-75s.\n\nThe rest of the UK is set to see its working-age population grow, which the Scottish Fiscal Commission said would place a drag on economic growth north of the border.\n\nThe finance committee said this posed \"fundamental questions\" going forward.\n\nAt present, Scotland's economy is forecast to grow more slowly than that of the UK for each of the next four years.\n\nThe committee's report said a \"key factor\" behind this was demographic change and population growth, with the number of people in the 16-64 working-age bracket set to shrink in the immediate future.\n\nThe Scottish government's fiscal outlook states the issue is \"set to accelerate from 2021 onwards\", and at a faster rate than in the rest of the UK - adding that this challenge \"will continue for at least the next 25 years\".\n\nThe committee also raised concerns a decrease in immigration relative to the rest of the UK could pose a \"real risk\" to the budget, with Scotland disproportionately affected by any drop in numbers after Brexit.\n\nImage caption Committee convener Bruce Crawford said the report raised \"fundamental questions\"\n\nFinance committee convener Bruce Crawford said the risks identified in the report raise \"fundamental questions\" about Holyrood's powers and the fiscal framework underpinning the devolved budget.\n\nHe said it was \"essential that both of these fundamental questions are fully considered as part of the review of the fiscal framework\".\n\nHe added: \"The bad news is that while our ageing population is not new, it is set to accelerate from 2021, and this is happening faster than rest of the UK.\n\n\"In the longer term, all future Scottish governments will need to respond to the pressures this creates.\"\n\nScottish migration minister Ben Macpherson said the country was \"in a very different demographic position compared to the rest of the UK\", saying Scotland needs \"a tailored approach to migration policy\".\n\nDemographic change\n\nThe UK government has opposed devolving powers over migration to Holyrood, or having a specific migration policy for Scotland.\n\nDuring a session at Holyrood in September, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss told the committee \"the Scottish government has levers to influence demographics in Scotland\", such as housing, planning and skills policies.\n\nGiven the parliament's block grant from Westminster is based on the overall population, she argued that there are protections in the fiscal framework against demographic changes.\n\nShe said: \"The Scottish government is protected against risk with regard to population size relative to the tax take in both countries.\"", "Image

supermarket chains have given confusing or incorrect information on potentially lethal food allergens in their bakeries, the BBC has found.\n\nBranches of Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco gave wrong or unclear details to Watchdog Live's undercover reporters.\n\nIt comes after a 15-year-old girl died after eating a baguette from Pret A Manger, which did not specify the presence of sesame in the sandwich.\n\nThe retailers said they would review their labelling and staff training.\n\nUndercover reporters for the BBC's consumer programme visited 24 supermarket bakeries, five of which showed cause for concern.\n\nThe EU says that consumers must be made aware when one or more of 14 particular allergens - including nuts, sesame, milk, eggs and wheat - is used as an ingredient in food products.\n\nHowever, in the UK freshly handmade non pre-packaged food does not need to be individually labelled on packaging, but stores must ensure clear and accurate information is readily available.\n\nBut that is not always the case, the programme found.\n\nIn one Asda bakery, staff said an item did not contain the allergen sesame, when it was in fact listed as an ingredient for the product on the store's website.\n\nIn other Asda stores, the programme found staff were able to give a general warning that products may contain nuts or seeds, without being able to identify specific allergens contained within the recipe.\n\nThe sesame allergy that killed a teenager\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Natasha Ednan-Laperouse suffered a cardiac arrest after eating a baguette from Pret A Manger in 2016\n\nIn September a coroner ruled that sandwich chain Pret A Manger's labelling was inadequate, after a girl suffered a cardiac arrest after eating one of its baguettes.\n\nNatasha Ednan-Laperouse visited the Heathrow Airport branch in 2016 before getting a flight with her family.\n\nDespite having two EpiPen injections while on the flight, the teenager died in a hospital in Nice.\n\nNatasha's family said food labelling laws \"played Russian roulette with our daughter's life\".\n\nSince then the sandwich chain has said it will list all ingredients, including allergens on its freshly made products.\n\nReporters for the programme found Tesco did list allergens on most of its products, but not for unwrapped bread rolls, paninis and pastries in some stores.\n\nAt one branch, an undercover reporter posing as someone with a milk allergy found a senior member of staff who was unable to locate any ingredients information for an unpackaged panini that contained milk.\n\nSainsbury's did not list any of the 14 allergens on packaging or shelf labels in their in-store bakeries, but did tell customers to \"ask a bakery colleague\" about allergens.\n\nA staff member at one branch told an undercover reporter a raisin whirl was free of nuts - but when the staff member found a product information guide it listed almonds as an ingredient.\n\nSainsbury's said it would update its labels \"to include more specific allergen information\".\n\nTesco said it exceeded \"the current legal requirements\", but in light of the Watchdog investigation a spokesperson said the food retailer would be \"reviewing how allergy information is displayed moving forward\".\n\nAsda said in all the instances flagged up by Watchdog Live, its staff \"ultimately advised the customer not to buy the product\".\n\nBut a spokesman added the supermarket was \"also working to implement detailed allergen labels on our in-store bakery products\".", "Image copyright Getty/BBC\n\nYou might have noticed something different when ordering a drink in a bar or restaurant recently.\n\nMany companies now use paper straws in their drinks. Some have done away with straws altogether. Others keep plastic straws behind the counter, only available on request.\n\nIt might not sound like a huge deal - but it's a sign of the significant change in the attitude the public, the government and major corporations have towards plastic.\n\nAnd, as Prime Minister Theresa May has acknowledged, that change is largely thanks to Blue Planet II - the nature series fronted by Sir David Attenborough, broadcast last winter.\n\nBut, the presenter tells BBC News, influencing government policy isn't his top priority when making such series.\n\n\"We all have responsibilities as citizens, but our primary job is to make a series of programmes which are gripping, truthful, and speak about something quite important,\" he says.\n\n\"These aren't ecological programmes, they're not proselytising programmes, they're not alarmist programmes, what they are is a new form of filmmaking, and a new form of wildlife filmmaking.\"\n\nHot on the heels of Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II comes this year's Attenborough-fronted programme: Dynasties.\n\nThe five episodes of this series, which begins on Sunday, are broken down into chimpanzees, lions, penguins, tigers and wolves.\n\nAfter Planet Earth II's snakes and iguanas chase won a TV Bafta for must see moment, is there a similarly breathtaking sequence in Dynasties?\n\n\"Not one, there are several, there are truly several,\" Sir David says. \"There's certainly one in the opening programme, which is when an old chimp is beaten up.\n\n\"What we have said is, we will show what happens. We are not going to tart this up, we're not going to distort it in any way. If it's a triumph, fine, if it's a tragedy, that too we will show.\"\n\nDynasties may not have quite the same overt political message as Blue Planet II, but there was one issue which kept recurring, says executive producer Michael Gunton.\n\n\"This series is about the problem, for a lot of these creatures, that there just isn't enough space for them to survive,\" he explains.\n\n\"Space is not as sexy as plastic, it's a harder thing to get your head around, it's a much bigger issue, so [with] the individual struggles in these creatures lives, that's a very good way of bringing it to attention.\"\n\nGunton singles out tigers as a prime example. He says a successful breed of tigers in a reserve means a \"pressure cooker\" is created by their increasing population.\n\n\"They're very good breeders, good at looking after their young... it's just they don't have the space,\" he explains.\n\n\"And then all these issues start to occur - they leave the park, they cross paths with humanity and often that's not with very happy results.\"\n\nThat particular episode sees one tiger in India take the risky decision to leave her reserve to hunt for food, as rival tigers, seeking their own territory, are encroaching on her hunting lands.\n\nIt's not long before people spot her and call the forest department, who tranquilise her and eventually return her to the reserve.\n\n'Terrible problem'\n\nOne issue that has repeatedly cropped up with nature documentaries in recent years is whether filmmakers should interfere with what they see while shooting.\n\nSir David has previously said: \"If you're a film cameraman you are trained as it were to be the observer, a non-participant. That's very important.\"\n\nBut witnessing animals in distress can be difficult for crews, who have been known to occasionally intervene.\n\nIn 2016's Planet Earth II, the BBC confirmed producers had stepped in to rescue some stranded baby turtles.\n\nLast year, Blue Planet II producer James Honeyborne said: \"If you see a turtle trapped in a plastic bag or you see a humpback whale wrapped up in fishing gear, you've got to step in, that's human nature isn't it?\"\n\nThe episode of Dynasties focusing on emperor penguins threw up a similar dilemma.\n\nA number of females are seen getting blown into a gully in a storm, unable to to get out because of the steep walls of snow and ice they are surrounded by.\n\n\"They have this terrible problem that they can't move very well when they've got the chicks on their feet, because if the chicks fall to the ground and when they're that age they'll die,\" Gunton says.\n\n\"And there was this very steep side, and they couldn't climb out because they couldn't move their feet effectively enough. So some of them had to make a horrible decision, which was to save themselves and abandon their chicks.\n\n\"One individual managed to use her beak effectively as an ice pick and work her way up and get to the top of this ice wall and escape.\"\n\nThe camera crew then took a break from filming as another storm moved in, but they returned to the gully soon after.\n\n\"It was clear that unless [the other penguins] had the wit to do that, which most of them didn't seem to have, they were all going to die,\" Gunton continues.\n\n\"We talked to a scientist there and said, if we can just reduce that slipperiness of the slope, we're not going to touch any of them, that might mean they can find their way out. And that will mean a significant number of these precious creatures will survive.\"\n\nThat is precisely what the team ended up doing. They created little notches in the slope, effectively creating some steps for the penguins to find their own way up and out.\n\n\"Weirdly, if people knew we'd had the opportunity to do that and we hadn't, that would've been a much more difficult thing to answer,\" Gunton says.\n\nPerhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the nature documentaries Sir David fronts is their huge popularity with young audiences.\n\nHe acknowledges that escapism might be a key part of the appeal of such series. Regardless of what side of the political divide you're on, often, you just want to switch off.\n\n\"I think all of us faced with what we are faced with, Brexit, every time you turn on the television set, you get it,\" he says.\n\n\"I certainly watch the news all the time, and to get a programme about something which is more fundamental and more elemental, and also absolutely true, I wouldn't say it's an escape, because it's reality, but it's a great change and a great relief.\n\n\"The fact that it has overtones and implications into our own lives and our own decisions, is as it should be. But it's as far as you can get away from the political landscape which otherwise dominates your thoughts.\"\n\nDynasties begins on Sunday 11 November on BBC One at 20:30 GMT.", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nLady Gaga says Oscars glory \"is not the real reward\" - but we're sure she would have a big smile on her face if she was to win one in February 2019.\n\nThe singer told Radio 1 Newsbeat that being linked to the Oscars for her role in A Star Is Born is \"humbling\".\n\n\"But you know for me the real reward in this entire experience was making the film with a brilliant man.

But I was having absence seizures,\" says Olivia Salvati, 21.\n\n\"It's not like daydreaming - it's like having a horrendous nightmare that leaves you feeling completely drained.\"\n\nOlivia found that her absence seizures - a type of epilepsy - meant she was often perceived as not concentrating.\n\nTo raise awareness, she is fronting a campaign by the charity Young Epilepsy to help educators recognise the signs.\n\nThe charity says most schools in the UK will have at least one student who has epilepsy and that teachers should be aware that signs can often go unnoticed for many years.\n\nIn a survey of 507 young people who experience absence seizures - sometimes called \"petit mals\" - or their parents, the charity found one third were unhappy with the support on offer at school, college or university.\n\nThe poll also suggests:\n\nmore than four in five (81%) children and young people with absence seizures fall behind in the classroom\n\n60% have trouble taking part in sports and other outdoor activities\n\n55% avoid social situations\n\n46% are made to feel embarrassed by their classmates\n\n41% are made to feel embarrassed by teachers and other staff\n\nOlivia's absence seizures were diagnosed when she was 11. She was also diagnosed with tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures at the age of 14.\n\n\"It's like a daydream - you blank out for 30 seconds to a minute. They're really hard to identify. You've got no idea it's happening and you come round.\n\n\"I have other types of epilepsy seizures too, but absence seizures are the worst for me because they're not obvious.\"\n\nShe says that while she didn't experience bullying as such, she often felt excluded by her peers.\n\n\"I got lots of little comments like 'You can't come along because of your epilepsy and we want you to be ok' so I often felt excluded.\n\n\"And teachers have so much on their hands, they haven't got the time to deal with you.\"\n\nWhat does the charity say about its campaign?\n\nCarol Long, CEO of Young Epilepsy says: \"Parents and teachers should be mindful that absence seizures often go unnoticed for many years.\n\n\"By spotting a few tell-tale signs, it's in their power to get a proper diagnosis before a child's wellbeing and education are affected.\"\n\nImage caption Olivia says she is enjoying life and is in her third year of university\n\nProfessor Helen Cross, The Prince of Wales's Chair of Childhood Epilepsy, adds: \"The most commonly recognised symptoms of epilepsy are shaking uncontrollably and falling to the ground.\n\n\"However, absence seizures are one of the most common forms of epilepsy in children.\n\n\"Parents and teachers need to know how to spot it, to help prevent young people from struggling socially and educationally.\n\n\"It is also important to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Thankfully most children living with absence seizures respond very well to treatment.\"\n\nHow would I spot the signs of an absence seizure?\n\nDuring an absence seizure, those affected have a sudden loss of consciousness for a short period of time.\n\nYoung Epilepsy says symptoms can include:\n\nstaring into space and not responding to anything - this could be mistaken for daydreaming\n\nstopping unexpectedly in the middle of a sentence or activity\n\nbeing unable to recall what has taken place during this time.\n\nWhat advice does Olivia offer to those with a recent diagnosis?\n\nOlivia, who is now in her third year at university, says that while it takes time to work out the best medication and dosage for each individual, managing seizures does get easier over time.\n\n\"No matter how difficult it is now, it does get better.\n\n\"Go to the people who really care about you -

However, both have health problems of their own and cannot breed naturally.\n\nThe southern white rhino is found in southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.\n\nNumbers dropped to a few hundred individuals around a century ago, but conservation efforts led to a recovery. About 20,000 exist in protected areas and private game reserves.\n\nWhat would it take to save the northern white rhino?\n\nThe survival of the northern white rhino looks bleak, and relies on last-ditch hotly-debated conservation efforts, which involve IVF and cloning.\n\nA priceless store of frozen sperm from male northern white rhinos still exists, but conservationists are divided about how it should be used.\n\nIn July, one team took eggs from female southern rhinos - which number around 20,000 in the wild - and fertilised them with frozen sperm from a male northern white rhino, to create hybrid embryos.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Southern white rhino at Londolozi Reserve in South Africa\n\nThe new study suggests this sort of approach might pay off, given that the two rhinos are closer genetically than once thought.\n\n\"We think it improves the chances,\" said Prof Bruford. \"It is difficult to predict what might happen if we cross the two subspecies but given the current options for the northern white rhino it becomes a more viable option, should other approaches fail.\"\n\nOther options include using frozen tissue from a wider pool of northern white rhinos to generate stem cells that have the capacity to develop into eggs and sperm.\n\nThis would avoid diluting the gene pool, but is more challenging to achieve.\n\nThe research, by scientists in the UK, South Africa, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and the US, is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "What do American voters care about?\n\nThe US is about to go to the polls to pick its new Congress.

All young unmarried rich men used to be described as dashing.\n\nI think those who said he was handsome were in the majority in the newsroom and for a long time a big poster of him came to adorn a wall behind the desk of one of the young women in the office.\n\nDancing to highlife music\n\nForty-one years later, Prince Charles has visited Ghana again, with his second wife, Camilla Parker Bowles, and, according to the British High Commission in Accra, some of the events on his itinerary form part of the celebrations for his 70th birthday.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Prince Charles was a bachelor when he visited Ghana in 1977\n\nThe couple have been busy doing what royals do, visiting sites, looking earnest and joining in with dancing groups.\n\nOn Sunday, they were guests of the Asantehene, the monarch of the Ashanti, one of Ghana's main ethnic groups, who laid on a special ceremony with so much gold on display that it led to some questioning why we would be asking for any kind of aid from anyone.\n\nThere was a state banquet on Monday, where the couple danced to highlife music, the country's well-known musical style.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ghana was the second stop of the prince's current African tour\n\nGhana's President Nana Akufo-Addo had made an elaborate toast and decorated Prince Charles with the highest state honour. I wondered if there was a room somewhere in Buckingham Palace where these sashes and gongs are kept.\n\nIt was on Monday, the fourth day of the visit, that we finally had a chance to hear the prince speak publicly, by which time some of us were beginning to think he had come to our country to be seen but not heard.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Asantehene, King Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II, arranged a special ceremony to welcome the couple\n\nHe, however, made up for his three days of silence.

She recovered with the help of therapy - and by creating a character who personifies her obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\n\"She's got the big ears, because she's like a startled hare, she's listening out.\n\n\"She's bedraggled, because she's been through a lot and she's normally having some kind of panic.\n\n\"The big eyes are about making sure she's keeping an eye out for danger.\n\n\"The big legs - for running,\" like a frightened hare, says Catherine Benfield.\n\nAnd she can change too - very quickly. She can be quiet one moment, but then her mood will swing and she'll suddenly be feeling at the end of her tether, forlorn, broken and, at her worst, absolutely beaten.\n\nYou have now met Olivia.\n\nShe is a visualisation - a character created by Catherine to personify the condition she has lived with since she was a child.\n\nThe O in Olivia stands for OCD, an abbreviation for obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nPeople are often mistaken about OCD, Catherine says. So many people think it's about being very fastidious and organising your pens very precisely on your desk but it's actually a serious anxiety-related mental health condition, involving intrusive obsessive thoughts, images and fears.\n\nIn an effort to prevent one of her fears coming true, Catherine would feel compelled to carry out a repetitive physical or mental act - in technical terms the fear is the \"obsession\" and the repetitive act is the \"compulsion\". This would provide temporary relief from the anxiety, but then it might return, compelling her to repeat the behaviour again and again.\n\nCatherine says OCD often preys on kind and caring people.\n\n\"They're compassionate, they're sensitive to the needs of others,\" she says. \"They love the people around them to an intensity where they will do anything to stop harm coming to them.\"\n\nBetween the ages of four and five, Catherine would stand staring out of the window for long periods, waiting for family members to return home and fearing that they had come to harm.\n\n\"I thought somehow the silent vigil would help bring them home safely,\" she says.\n\nImage caption Catherine aged six\n\nAs a teenager she was terrified to be the last one to leave the house, because of the fear that it would burn down once she had gone - she would compulsively check the cooker was switched off and switches unplugged. And to ensure everyone was safe she would compulsively lock all doors and windows, and remove all trip hazards.\n\nThese routines could take hours to perform, and if one thing disturbed the process she would start all over again.\n\nAs time went on she became so busy with her studies and her job as a teacher that OCD had less of an impact on her life. It wasn't until she had her baby son at the age of 31 that she became really unwell.\n\n\"I had a horrible labour. I came away, I was very weak and I just couldn't do very much physically, it gave me a lot of time to think,\" she says.\n\n\"Almost immediately I started staying up all night to check he was breathing. Every parent has been known to check their child's breathing, particularly when it's newborn, but it grew to the point where I didn't feel like I could leave him at all. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating.\"\n\nAt first she was terrified that something or someone would hurt him. Then she began to worry that she might harm him herself.\n\n\"I remember sitting on the sofa looking at my mother-in-law holding my kid in front of a wall and thinking how easy it would be to get up and throw him against it,\" she says.\n\n\"I could see it all, it was absolutely horrible and really detailed, very vivid, accompanied with images in my head of my future and what I'd have done to my family and my friends as a result.\"\n\nShe didn't know it, but what she was experiencing was perinatal OCD. Women with this condition would never actually carry out the actions they visualise, but Catherine's intrusive thoughts left her feeling anxious, depressed and isolated.\n\n\"I didn't know it was OCD,\" she says. \"I thought I wanted to do it. I thought, 'What kind of mother has thoughts like that about their child?'\"\n\nConsultant psychiatrist Dr Lynne Drummond says life events, both good and bad, are often a trigger for OCD.\n\n\"Childbirth is quite a major life event,\" she says. \"Let alone the whole issue of suddenly having somebody who is completely and utterly dependent on you. Plus your [changing] hormones, plus you're knackered and you're probably at times down in the dumps and your body has had a huge change. You're physically at a lower ebb. Emotionally you have to come to grips with your change in role.\"\n\nCatherine began to avoid anything that could hurt her son. She threw away all the knives in the house as she imagined herself hurting him with them. She was terrified to go on a station platform with the pram after having intrusive thoughts about pushing her son under a train.\n\nShe eventually became so anxious that she couldn't leave the house with her son.\n\n\"I was never suicidal, but I do remember at one point thinking, if the very worst comes to the very worst and I can't get through this, that is an option for me,\" she says.\n\n\"If you believe that you're a danger to your child, you'll do whatever you can to remove that danger and that was, I suppose, the ultimate thing that I could do.\"\n\nShe says no-one - including medical professionals - recognised her symptoms.\n\n\"I literally got to the point where my husband said, 'You need to come to the doctor's right now,' and so we went,\" says Catherine. \"I walked in and I was literally like, 'I'm worried I'm going to harm my son,' and just burst into tears.\"\n\nThe GP told her it was anxiety and gave her medication. But when she tried to come off it her condition deteriorated again. One day, in desperation, she typed into Google \"OCD and fear of harming son\" and dozens of stories popped up.\n\n\"I hadn't thought that was going to happen,\" she says. \"I thought I was a monster, and immediately everything that I had been thinking and feeling and going through was written down in front of me by all these other people.\"\n\nCatherine had finally got a diagnosis - from the internet - after battling with OCD all her life. She then sought medical help, and about 18 months after she had her son Catherine started therapy.\n\nThis included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a talking therapy which focuses on how your thoughts and attitudes affect your behaviour and feelings, and exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP), a form of CBT treatment where you are asked to confront your obsessions or fears and resist carrying out the compulsive behaviour.\n\nDr Lynne Drummond on \"graded exposure\" ERP therapy\n\nWhat I'd do is get the patient to create a hierarchy of situations. I use a zero-to-eight scale with zero being no anxiety and eight complete panic. I'd get them to rate how anxious they would feel doing each thing without \"putting things right\" - in other words, performing the compulsion. I'd start with something that had an anxiety rating of three or four - mild-to-moderate anxiety - and encourage them to expose themselves to their fears for one to two hours without \"putting things right\". They would find that the anxiety would remain high and it would be absolutely horrible, but actually over that time it would go down - and each time they do it will be just that little bit easier.\n\nThis helped enormously, but Catherine found there was a big stumbling block on her road to recovery.\n\n\"Unless I could get a handle on the fact that actually I wasn't this monster, I wasn't going to be able to carry on getting better,\" she says. \"And that's where Olivia came in.\"\n\nOlivia was a way for Catherine to separate herself from her condition. Olivia personified her obsessions and her compulsive behaviour - but she could feel compassion for Olivia, and this enabled her to feel compassion for herself.\n\n\"If I had a really horrible thought about harming someone, I would imagine that it was Olivia hopping up and down and she was the one who was frightened, she was the one who was scared - and I'd feel for her.\n\n\"I'd be like, 'Come on don't be daft, this is just anxiety,' and by doing that I could then talk to myself in that way.\"\n\nIt was while she was washing up one day that the idea of Olivia came to her. She instantly visualised what Olivia looked like and decided to write a blog. Then she told her artist husband, Pete, who drew the otherworldly creature his wife described.\n\nThe impact was immediate. Catherine even went out and bought a set of knives for the house again.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nOCD Action\n\nOCD UK\n\nMaternal OCD\n\nMind - Perinatal OCD\n\nOCD Youth\n\n\"When I was getting the intrusive thought about the knives I could imagine Olivia bouncing up and down in a rage beside me and all I wanted to do was go, 'Look don't be silly, this is nothing, it's nothing.'\"\n\nOlivia Bamber from the charity OCD Action says therapy is the recommended treatment for OCD and that medication can also be helpful. But so can \"separating OCD from yourself\" - as Catherine has.\n\nCatherine says she knows some people with OCD have called their condition \"the bully\", but she didn't want Olivia to be like this.\n\n\"I couldn't bear the thought of trying to imagine myself living with this evil face hovering over my shoulder. So I decided to have a character that I could show love and compassion,\" she says.\n\nAt the same time, Catherine worked hard on tasks set by her therapist.\n\nShe had become too terrified to go into a department store because of intrusive thoughts about throwing her son from the escalator. As part of her ERP therapy she was asked to start facing her worst fears and to travel up and down the escalators carrying her then two-year-old son in her arms.\n\n\"It was something that absolutely terrified me at first, but I went up and down those escalators so many times and on so many different occasions that I don't even think about it any more,\" she says.\n\nShe also had to stand on a station platform and deliberately bring on the thought of pushing her son under the train until it got to the point where she faced no anxiety at all.\n\n\"I don't see recovery as never having a symptom,\" she says. \"I see recovery as being able to manage them or them not interfering massively in my day-to-day life.\"\n\nOccasionally, Catherine says, OCD does try and nudge its way back into her life.\n\n\"As I was walking out of [my son's] bedroom last night, having said goodnight, there was a book on the floor and I thought if he gets up in the night and runs in to me he could trip on that and fall and hit his head, and so I moved it, that is what mums do, it makes sense,\" says Catherine.\n\n\"I got back into bed and I was like, 'Ah did I move it far enough out the way?' I knew I did, but I had to go back and I had to move it and then I was like, 'Stop it, stop it!' And that's where I employed all the stuff I learnt through using Olivia.\"\n\nShe didn't go back to check a second time, proving how far she has come.\n\nBut will Olivia ever disappear from her life?\n\n\"I still use that visualisation sometimes and I still use the things that I learnt from that every single day, even in areas of my life that are nothing to do with OCD,\" she says. \"If I start having a negative thought about something - 'Did I do that right or wrong?' - I remember that self-compassion, and it started with her, so I don't think I will ever say goodbye to her.\"\n\nThrough her blog, Taming Olivia, Catherine now tries to help new mothers recognise the symptoms of OCD, and encourages them to show compassion towards themselves.\n\n\"It's our job to recognise our Olivias,\" she says, \"but not to give into them.\"\n\nAll illustrations of Olivia by Pete Benfield\n\nDr Lynne Drummond is the author of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: All You Want to Know about OCD\n\nSome of your comments:\n\nOver a year ago I created a character called Alice because I experienced psychosis so whenever I felt/feel it creeping near I tut and say, \"No Alice we're not going down the rabbit hole today.\" Earlier this year I read a book by Bryony Gordon called Mad Girl and learnt this creation of a character was quite healthy and a useful technique, a great thing to read as I felt this character creation may be perceived as mad despite it allowing me to grasp and control my mental illness. Katie, Bristol\n\nMy daughter who is eleven years old today was born three weeks early - leaving me with OCD symptoms. Id be in a panic most of the time because I thought I had \"so much to do\". I didn't see life as having a new born baby, I saw it as a minefield of things I must do and hardly felt any enjoyment. I lost all my confidence and thought everyone was judging me but I was in fact judging myself. I felt a complete failure and was very protective of her and worried for her every moment of the day. I refused to let a family member hold her for fear of her being dropped or harmed. Susan, Bridgwater\n\nAlthough I have not had intrusive thoughts about my son I can fully understand this story I used to check windows doors cooker hundreds of times I'd get angry if I was interrupted and have to start again, everything had to be in multiples of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and so on I could never count 60 seconds. My GP sent me to the Community Psychiatric Nurse and she advised CBT. I will never look back. I am a totally different happy person. My GP says it's the biggest transformation she's seen in anybody and I love it. I would recommend it to anyone. Melissa, Aldridge\n\nI had exactly the same type of thoughts regarding harming my daughter when she was born. I removed all of the knives from the house and thought I must be a monster if I could think like that. I ended up having CBT and taking anti-depressants. Thankfully, I can deal with the thoughts now as I now know what they are and that I am not a horrible person. They are just thoughts. Unfortunately my daughter has inherited the same illness. She has regular issues with needing to be reassured everyone is OK. L Williams\n\nI suffer from severe OCD too - intrusive thoughts about harming others and myself. I also created an avatar for my illness. A crow, who is unfortunately slightly more acidic than Olivia - my psychologist at the time advised against it but told me that if it made me feel better then at the end of the day, it was OK. I imagine a crimson knight who is the face of my self-harm and a gorgon who is the personification of my struggles with looking into mirrors - that I have now mostly overcome. My life was at a standstill for years, suffering intrusive thoughts from the age of nine. I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my twenties, and although I'm not on medication or seeing a professional these days, I feel that I have overcome the worst of my OCD by my own efforts explained in my blog. I can't explain how terrifying my thoughts have been. Yan, Norfolk\n\nI'm pretty sure I have this too! I too was mistaken in thinking OCD was about repetitive obsessions such as hand washing or tidiness. I had no idea these thoughts and feelings are OCD - I too have just been thinking that there must be something wrong with me. I have three children and although I have had symptoms since I was a child, it is only been since their births that I have really struggled. It's horrific! I can picture clearly the face of one of my little girls as a car hits her, I can picture another daughter's shocked expression as a knife falls on to her and I can clearly see, like a photograph in my head, the faces of all three as they lay hurting somewhere from injuries I don't even know. And sometimes, as in the story here, it's me doing these things. So scary and awful. I have never mentioned any of this to a doctor or anyone in fact, for fear they might think my children were at risk from me, whereas in actual fact, I was so scared of them being hurt, my mind was running through the ways it could happen so that I might be able to prevent it (keeping knives away from the edge of the work surface, holding hands tightly when out and about etc). I was diagnosed with anxiety almost two years ago after suffering what have been diagnosed as panic attacks - I thought they were heart attacks! While the medication has helped with the attacks, they didn't really stop the panicked thoughts and living nightmares. It has however improved immensely since I started working again. Having retrained while having my little girls, I started teaching two years ago. Just being so busy has meant I don't have as much time to think as I once did, so my mind doesn't dwell on things too much. But unfortunately, there are days when I'm sitting marking books, and suddenly, i can see, perfectly clearly, my mum's hand losing grip for just a second as my three year old pulls her hand away to run after a stray toy that has fallen in the road, just as a lorry is... It makes me feel panicky just to write it, so imagine how it feels to think it. So if you ever see a teacher suddenly jump up and start shaking their head, or slapping at their cheeks, singing a really happy song quickly and loudly, don't worry- it's just me, dealing with my own Olivia. Maria, Norfolk\n\nI have OCD and my symptoms mirror this story. When my second daughter was born I had intrusive thoughts. When holding my child I would visualise and fear that I would pinch her and drop her, whilst she was sleeping I would stand and watch her and my OCD would convince me that I wanted to smother her with a pillow. Another OCD thought of mine was that I would poison my children by putting our dog's medication into their food. The list is endless but I sought private specialist treatment and have now learnt to manage my OCD. Emma, Exeter\n\nMy Olivia is called Mr String. He's a big red angry ball of string jumping up and down demanding to be heard. He's screaming and yelling in my thoughts telling me, \"What if you didn't do x? What if you did do x?\" He tells me I've left the cooker on, taps on, car handbrake off? Anything that will cause harm to strangers, friends family or my children. He made me believe I had HIV and that I was a murderer and thief and that I'd run people over with my car and that I'd poisoned people. But far worse, he made me believe I was a paedophile. He tarnished and jeopardised my love for my children because what if I was? What if he was right? I knew I wasn't but I couldn't be sure - I couldn't be absolutely sure with him always taunting me with those dreadful three little words... \"But What If?\" I couldn't go to the playground and when I did I wore sunglasses so I could keep my eyes closed without anyone seeing. If I couldn't SEE any children I certainly couldn't hurt them. If I saw a child abuse case in the news I would check that I didn't know anyone in that area, of that I'd never been there so I could be absolutely SURE I hadn't been involved. Medication, CBT, ERP, a support group and a hell of a lot of research, reading and support online later, I know it's OCD and not my fault. So now I know if any statement, any thought anything starts with \"But What If?\" then it's Him, Mr String, and I refuse to enter into it with him. He will not win. And I have a total ban on the words BUT WHAT IF. He's still there, lodged somewhere in my brain like a tumour but I've realised he's not in charge... I am. This is a short video I was involved in as a project through OCD Action. Anna, Stowmarket\n\nAfter having my last son after a 11-year gap from my daughter, almost immediately I started suffering severe intrusive thoughts of harming him, things like poisoning him, or scared I would drown him in the bath. I had to remove every knife in house, I got to the point I was scared to be left alone with my son. It was the worst time of my life. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist who taught me to allow the thoughts into my head and not fear them. It took a long time but slowly I learnt to cope. Russell, Sheffield\n\nI started having intrusive thoughts whilst pregnant with my son. I didn't understand what they were and immediately thought I was evil. I became unable to eat, work or even leave the house. It was like living in a nightmare. Once my son was born it got worse, I would worry I had put bleach in his Perfect Prep machine instead of water and so would avoid doing it. I couldn't even look at a knife without feeling sick. It reached a peak when I thought the only way out was to remove myself (suicide). My mum dragged me to the doctors - they sent the crisis team out to see me. I [took medication] to stop the panic attacks I was having. I did a course of CBT therapy where I found the exposure technique helped, but I finally found release when I had many sessions of ISTDP (intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy). We have decided I cannot go through having another child, I am too scared my OCD will flare up again.

She went to eight states and visited more than 60 studios. Some subjects welcomed the lens while others - such as one of the twins in the photograph above who came in for their \"birthday pictures\" - did not.\n\nImage copyright Ketaki Sheth/PHOTOINK Image caption Jagdish Photo Studio, Manori, Maharashtra, 2015\n\n\"The idea of a book took hold only when I felt I had enough good pictures,\" Ms Sheth said.\n\nThe result is Photo Studio, a collection of 69 startling portraits.\n\nThe images range from shots of inanimate objects - props and backdrops - to intimate portraits of the studio's customers.\n\nImage copyright Ketaki Sheth/PHOTOINK Image caption Babas Studio, Trivandrum, Kerala, 2016\n\nThe couple in the photo above, for instance, were in the studio to have their passport photos taken. But when Ms Sheth asked them if they would pose for her on the loveseat, they agreed.\n\n\"Apart from their haunting pairing, the folds on her tunic form an essential part of the image,\" Ms Sheth says. \"And against the dreamlike backdrop painted with its flora and architectural columns, and her flowing tunic, there seems to be a mist in the backdrop which further enhances the surreal quality to the image.\"\n\nImage copyright Ketaki Sheth/PHOTOINK Image caption Krishna Digital Photo Studio, Jaipur, Rajasthan, 2016\n\nSimilarly, this farmer had come to the studio because he needed a photograph for documents pertaining to his land.\n\n\"My photographs are a residual memory of a moment once cherished, but now fast eroding in the age of the smartphone,\" Ms Sheth writes in a detailed note that explains the process and motivation behind this series.\n\nWhile some studios remain busy, many are dilapidated and lack a steady stream of customers. So Ms Sheth often found herself enlisting locals to pose for her.

She recalls that the woman had come to what was her favourite studio to be photographed. But she was tired and refused Ms Sheth's request to take a portrait of her.\n\nSo Ms Sheth decided to refocus the shot. \"The studio photographer became the protagonist here,\" she explains. \"My image is him stooped over his camera and his subject is the bride - it works because of these absences despite their presence.

That's according to the latest statistics from the International Society of Women Airline Pilots (ISWAP).\n\nZoom Air, a regional Indian airline, tops the leader board. ISWAP says it employs nine female pilots out of a total of 30.\n\nKathy McCullough, communications chairwoman for ISWAP and a retired female captain, said that Indian companies have \"aggressively encouraged more women to become airline pilots in what they see as an upcoming pilot shortage.\"\n\nA report by Boeing found that with a growing middle class in India, commercial air travel is expected to become more frequent.\n\nIn the UK, about 4.77% of airline pilots are women.\n\nHow much do pilots earn on average?\n\nA typical day for an airline pilot could include flying passengers or cargo to short-haul or more far-flung destinations.\n\nCommercial pilots' salaries depend on the airline they're working for, the type of aircraft they fly and their level of experience.\n\nStarting salaries range between \u00a320-30,000 for those in the cockpit.\n\nFor experienced captains, pay can reach more than \u00a3140,000.\n\nThat's higher than the \u00a3105,250 you could earn as an air commodore in the Royal Air Force, according to the National Careers Service in the UK.\n\nBut what about the gender pay gap?\n\nEarlier this year, UK companies with more than 250 employees were required to report their gender pay gap figures for the first time.\n\nBritish airlines were cited as having large gender pay gaps, which is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for all male and female staff.\n\nThe average median pay difference between men and women was 9.7% across all industries.\n\nRyanair reported the largest gender pay gap for an airline (71.8%). EasyJet had a 45.5% pay gap, but said that men and women in the same roles are paid equally.\n\nBut much of the gap can be explained by one thing - the proportion of male pilots.\n\nAt EasyJet, for example, pilots make up a quarter of its UK employees. 6% of its UK pilots are women - a role which pays \u00a392,400 on average. Lower-paid cabin crew, 69% of whom are women, earn an average salary of \u00a324,800.\n\nThe airline says it has set a target that 20% of new entrant pilots should be female by 2020.\n\nWhat other obstacles do potential pilots face?\n\nBefore starting their training, potential airline pilots need to hold a Class 1 Medical Certificate. Most training schools and airlines also require five GCSEs and two A-levels in the UK.\n\nIf you meet those requirements, there are several ways to get off the ground:\n\nGetting an Airline Transport Pilot's Licence , or a 'frozen ATPL'. It can take around 18 months to finish the course, which is a mix of theory and flying. Costs for the course can range between \u00a360-90,000. After at least 1,500 flying hours, you can apply for a full ATPL.\n\n, or a 'frozen ATPL'. It can take around 18 months to finish the course, which is a mix of theory and flying.

During the summer season, palm fronds hang from the roof, dance music pulses from the speakers and lithe, young beachgoers drop by for a late lunch and cold Spanish beers.\n\nBut like many of the island's open air venues, Sa Trinxa has recently found itself having to fall in line with tough new regulations.\n\nThis year, the bar was told it would have to turn down the music, and a limiter was installed to control the volume.\n\n\"People come here because of the music,\" says manager \u00c1lvaro. \"I like quiet places on my day off but this is Sa Trinxa.\"\n\nImage caption \u00c1lvaro has worked at Sa Trinxa for 12 years\n\nThe Ibizan authorities say that music in open air venues like Sa Trinxa must be capped at 65 decibels (dB) - slightly louder than a normal conversation but quieter than most vacuum cleaners.\n\nAndreas Simon is part of a community group called Musica Si, or \"Yes to Music\", that's been set up to fight the changes.\n\nHe shows me a video that the group is sharing on social media. It points out that the average sound of traffic noise is 70dB, while an airliner landing reaches a volume of 110dB.\n\nMr Simon says the authorities came to install a music limiter in one beach bar in the town of San Antonio at 7am one morning.\n\nAlthough the bar was empty and the music was off, the limiter showed a reading of 72dB. \"The owner asked, 'So who do you fine? The sea or the waves or the wind?'\"\n\nMr Simon says the authorities' blanket approach to regulation isn't working. \"What we ask for is a specific solution for every venue. [If] one venue has no neighbours, it can have louder music.\n\n\"The government here wants to make people understand that music is noise. Music is not noise, music is a part of the culture. There has to be a reasonable solution because without music, this island is dead.\"\n\nMarta, an Ibizan DJ who performs under the stage name Hofmann Lali\u00f3parda, agrees.

Across the four Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Formentera, Majorca and Menorca tourism accounts for 45% of GDP and a third of all jobs.\n\nBut balancing the tourism sector with the needs of local residents is proving increasingly difficult.\n\nWhen a socialist coalition took control of Ibiza's governing council in 2015, reining in tourism was central to their manifesto.\n\nImage caption Tourism makes up almost half of Ibiza's economy, though visitor numbers fell this summer\n\nVicente Torres Ferrer is Ibiza's director of tourism. He says there is no problem with loud music in closed clubs and that Ibiza has \"the best discos in the world\", but when it comes to outdoor venues the residents must be considered.\n\n\"We know that music is very important for our offer in Ibiza, we don't want to stop that. The problem comes when we have illegal parties in private villas or music till very late at night in open places.\"\n\nMr Torres Ferrer says modern audio equipment can be used to keep music inside a venue, at a lower volume.\n\n\"If you have a terrace and you just have one unit hanging from a wall, you have to play the music very strongly so that it arrives at the last table.\n\n\"But if you have four units in a certain way, then the music doesn't go away. You can hear the music a little bit but it's very low.\"\n\n'Not enough police'\n\nOther changes are being made to tone down the island's image as a party destination. Bars in San Antonio's West End drinking strip now close at 3am instead of 5am.\n\n\"The early closing doesn't mean that San Antonio doesn't want nightlife. If you want to continue having a party, you can move to the discos and continue celebrating your fiesta there,\" says Mr Torres Ferrer.\n\nImage caption Some say closing bars early has caused more problems than it's solved\n\nBut many say the earlier curfew has simply pushed revellers on to the streets, and the real problem with San Antonio is a lack of police.\n\nCarlos is a taxi driver and an Ibizan native. \"There are so many drug dealers and there are not enough police in the street,\" he says.\n\nMartin Makepeace agrees. He moved to Ibiza from the UK in 1991 and describes himself as a prominent businessman in the San Antonio area.\n\n\"[Closing bars early has] caused more problems than it's solved. It's put thousands of people on the street earlier. At the end of the day, it's the crime on the streets that's the problem.\"\n\nI ask him about reports of prostitution and mugging in San Antonio.\n\n\"It's true. There are gangs around who are intent on causing these kinds of problems,\" he says but argues it would be easy for the authorities to stamp out that behaviour if they wanted to.\n\nImage caption Ibiza needs to balance the needs of both residents and tourists, says Martin Makepeace\n\n\"Ten more police on the street on a nightly basis would solve more or less anything, but unfortunately they're not able to do that.\"\n\nSpending cuts\n\nSo why aren't there more police? Ibiza's tourism director Vicente Torres Ferrer lays the blame squarely with the former government in Madrid and the budget cuts applied by then-Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"We had this economical problem all over the world, but Spain in particular had a very big problem,\" he explains.\n\n\"So they made very strong restrictions in order to contain the money spent by public administrations.\"\n\nIbiza has asked the new government in Madrid to allow it to spend more on basic services and employ more police.\n\nThe island has also cracked down on accommodation sites, in an attempt to bring spiralling rental costs under control.\n\nIt's now illegal for tourists to rent apartments on the island, while houses or villas can be rented only if property owners obtain a licence.\n\nIsland exodus?\n\nDespite the changes, pressure is building for more to be done. A local group called Prou! - Catalan for \"Enough!\" - has 8,000 Facebook members.\n\nThe group aims to \"defend and protect\" Ibiza from over-tourism and the crime, illegal construction and environmental damage it says comes with it.\n\nImage caption The island is famous for its beaches and its party scene\n\nYet some locals are running out of patience. Taxi driver Carlos says some of Ibiza's 140,000 permanent residents are considering leaving the island for good.\n\n\"Many local people who've lived here for the last 40 years, we're thinking about leaving because we don't like this Ibiza for our children,\" he says.\n\nIn the last 10 years, many have left Ibiza to start new lives on Majorca or the Spanish mainland, he adds.\n\nThe changes to music venues, bar opening hours and caps on accommodation do seem to be having an effect - tourist numbers were down 4% for the month of July and 3% in August, compared with last year.\n\nSan Antonio businessman Martin Makepeace says the island is grappling with the age-old problem of how to balance the needs of residents and tourists.\n\n\"It's a chicken and egg situation. Without the residents you haven't got the tourists; without tourists, you haven't got the residents. We've got to find a compromise.\"\n\nListen to Vivienne's full report from Ibiza on Business Daily.", "Image copyright WeWork\n\nFlexible working spaces are set to grow by up to 30% annually for the next five years across Europe, according to property firm Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL).\n\nAnd it says that will change the way thousands of businesses of all sizes organise their work force.\n\nJLL described it as one of the biggest shifts in the property industry.\n\nFirms like WeWork and IWG offer office space and services, allowing clients to shrink or grow their number of desks, or the period they need them for.\n\nFounded in the US in 2010, WeWork is already London and New York's largest private office occupier.\n\n'Reshaping business models'\n\nSo far this year, flexible workspace operators have taken up one sixth of all new commercial property in the UK capital and last year their footprint outside the capital tripled with Manchester and Birmingham seeing the fastest growth.\n\nInitially popular with small start-up companies, these facilities are increasingly being used by large multi-national organisations who need to expand or reduce their workforce in line with the volume of work they have.\n\nDan Brown of JLL says: \"The consumerisation of real estate is reshaping business models.\"\n\nThe rapid growth in this \"office on demand\" business has seen the value of WeWork balloon to $20bn and is not without risk.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOne technology investor warned that it was beginning to look like \"a bubble\".\n\nSome property investors have pointed out that when any company buys up a huge amount of the stock of office space in the hope of selling it on in bits and pieces, there is a risk you can be left with a lot of empty offices if the economy takes a turn for the worse.\n\nFree beer\n\nWeWork has borrowed heavily to finance its expansion and the ratings agencies have given it a \"junk\" or risky credit score.\n\nHowever, the flexibility of this new model is proving popular with small employers and workers who enjoy the modern collaborative feel of a shared office, as well as larger employers who are not forced to sign long leases on expensive, bespoke, trophy buildings.\n\nPerks such as free beer for tenants of WeWork offices in New York proved so popular that the company was forced to impose a four pint limit per person after reports of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nFour pints is still enough to create a feel good mood about one of the biggest disruptions for decades in the way we think about heading to \"the office\".", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nBrittany Ferries has said customers are delaying booking Channel crossings for next summer amid concern over the impact of Brexit.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, UK citizens have enjoyed friction-free travel to the EU.\n\nIf the UK can reach some kind of exit deal then those arrangements would be likely to continue.\n\nIf talks fail then existing agreements between the UK and EU will end, and it is not clear what would replace them.\n\nWhile ferry bookings have fallen, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) says that bookings for package holidays in summer 2019 are positive - up 15% on this time last year.\n\nTravel journalist Simon Calder says that is a good move by holidaymakers: \"The smart thing to do is book a package holiday which means if the holiday doesn't happen you will at least get your money back.\n\n\"The danger with booking a hotel, car and flight separately is that the flight, for example, may not go but you may still need to pay for the rest.\"\n\nSo what are the travel companies saying?\n\nAirlines\n\nMajor airlines all appear confident that flights will continue to take off even if there is a no-deal Brexit.\n\nEasyJet has said that both the UK and the European Commission have indicated that they will put an agreement in place and they believe that connectivity should not be disrupted.\n\nThis has been echoed by IAG, the parent company of British Airways.
