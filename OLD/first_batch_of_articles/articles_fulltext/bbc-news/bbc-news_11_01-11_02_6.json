Several countries have offered her asylum.\n\nWhat was Asia Bibi accused of?\n\nThe trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009.\n\nThey were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan\n\nProsecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response.\n\nShe was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday though the Supreme Court acquitted her, saying that the case was based on flimsy evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd \"threatening to kill her\".\n\nWhy is this case so divisive?\n\nIslam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong.\n\nHard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base.\n\nBut critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence.\n\nThe vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population.\n\nThe Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance.\n\nSince 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy.", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat is Mike Ashley's game plan?\n\nThe founder of Sports Direct seems intent on taking over the UK's High Streets.\n\nThis week the businessman, who has a retail empire that spans budget sportswear and luxury fashion, added Evans Cycles to the High Street names in his sprawling and intertwined retail empire.\n\nThe cycle chain came wrapped for a quick sale in a special arrangement which freed it of its debts. The price tag was just \u00a38m for the cycle chain after it had been placed into administration.\n\nIt followed the \u00a390m deal by Sports Direct in August to buy House of Fraser, after the department store chain had been placed in administration.\n\nRichard Hyman, a strategic adviser to retailers, said: \"I don't really think he's got a strategy as such. He's an opportunist.\n\n\"But I need to make clear that I don't mean that in a pejorative sense!\"\n\nThe deals have been bolted on to a business that traces its roots to 1982 when Mr Ashley started Sports Direct with one store and a \u00a310,000 loan from his parents.\n\nIn 2007, Sports Direct was floated on the stock market, by which time it had more than 400 stores, owned Lillywhites in London and brands such as Donnay and Slazenger.\n\nNot all of his interests are held through Sports Direct, but they now include a substantial property business, clothing chain French Connection, lingerie chain Agent Provocateur, the upmarket clothing outlets Flannels and Cruise and more brands, including Firetrap and Lonsdale, and, of course, Newcastle United football club.\n\nRichard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, doesn't think there's a concrete plan. He says Mr Ashley's deals are a \"combination of both strategic and opportunistic\".\n\nBut the purchase of the Evans Cycles chain - where Mr Ashley admits he will shut half of the 62 shops - does fit with his plans for dominance in the field of sports.\n\n\"There are [acquisitions] that are clearly relevant. Evans is in that camp. In conversation with Mike five years ago [about] areas of sports and leisure he wasn't involved in, he'd put cycling and fishing in that camp. Evans is relevant to the sports retailing business,\" said John Stevenson, analyst at stock brokers Peel Hunt.\n\nGoals Soccer Centres, the five-a-side football business in which he also holds an interest, also falls into the category.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOthers, though, are less obvious. Think Debenhams - in which Sports Direct has a-near 30% stake - and Game Group, where it has also amassed shares.\n\nThe stake in Debenhams - partly amassed through a complex financial trade - is not being used as a prelude to a full takeover. That was set out in September when Simon Bentley, a non-executive director of Sports Direct, clarified remarks he had made that he did not intend to infer a merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams was being discussed.\n\nFiguring out what Mr Ashley is planning is not made easy by his less-than-warm relationship with the investment establishment. Mr Stevenson said they \"don't engage with the City about what their strategy is\".\n\nBut Mr Ashley has perhaps tried to define his own strategy through eye-catching slogans: The \"Selfridges of Sport\" for Sports Direct and the \"Harrods of the High Street\" for House of Fraser.\n\nThese, though, have provoked some scepticism. \"There are hundreds of High Streets in Britain but only one has a got Harrods on it. I think there's a message there,\" said Mr Hyman.\n\nBut Mr Ashley is finding opportunities at a time when analysts talk about a period of unprecedented turmoil on the High Street.\n\nSo what does he look for in a deal? Mr Lim said he will have \"a stringent set of tests\" as he seeks out well-known brands.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mike Ashley paid \u00a38m for Evans Cycles three years after it was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners for \u00a375m\n\nBuying a company out of administration allows him to \"trim off the fat\", Mr Lim said. Half of Evans Cycles stores are to be closed.\n\nAnd the purchases also come with lots of goods. Richard Hyman points to the stock that the chains are carrying. Evans, Mr Hyman said, carried \u00a328m of stock. House of Fraser, Mr Hyman said, was \"largely about buying a pile of stock at a heavily discounted price which he can then sell and make a handsome profit from\".\n\n\"This is what I mean by opportunistic. Evans Cycles is not a bad fit. Is he following a strategic plan? I don't think he is. Is he positively opportunistic? Yes. Has got the resources to take advantage of opportunities that come his way? Yes.\"\n\nMr Hyman adds: \"Has he got courage? Yes\".\n\nIf nothing else, his shopping spree has been a bold one.", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nLloyds Banking Group has confirmed it is reissuing debit cards to customers affected by cyber-attacks on Ticketmaster and British Airways.\n\nThe bank has reissued debit cards to all customers that have made purchases on Ticketmaster's website.\n\nIt is also working with BA to establish which customers have had their details compromised during two cyber-attacks.\n\nLloyds said it had a \"range of approaches\" designed to protect customers from fraud.\n\nA Lloyds Banking Group representative told the BBC: \"In all cases, we take all possible steps to minimise time without a card.\"\n\nIn the case of debit cards, the bank immediately issues a new card if it detects fraud.\n\nBut when it comes to credit cards, Lloyds first writes to customers telling them that it intends to reissue their cards, and customers are given the option to opt out.\n\nLloyds said it had already written to customers affected by the Ticketmaster breach, which made up about 1% of all credit card customers.\n\nBarclays Bank has confirmed that in the event of a data breach, it would replace the debit cards of customers who may have been affected as a precautionary measure.\n\nA representative for HSBC told the BBC: \"Protecting our customers and their money is an absolute priority for us, which is why we have put in place additional monitoring on cards that may have been affected by recent issues, but we are happy to replace a customer's card if that is their preference.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted RBS for comment, and is waiting for a response.\n\nCyber-attacks\n\nIn September and October, BA revealed that two cyber-attacks had been carried out on its website.\n\nAfter the first attack, BA owner IAG revealed in a stock exchange announcement that 185,000 people had had payment card details stolen, with 77,000 customers having their name, address, email address and detailed payment information taken.\n\nHowever, it did not reveal details of how many people had been affected by the second attack.\n\nIn June, Ticketmaster admitted that it had suffered a security breach to its website that affected up to 40,000 UK customers who purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between February and 23 June 2018.", "Image copyright Reuters\n\nA successful American political strategist once said \"it's the economy stupid\" or something very similar.\n\nIt was a statement about the key issues a good election campaign needs to focus on.\n\nJust a few days before the Congressional elections, President Trump had some helpful economic news - on employment - to put some wind into his sails.\n\nThe final bit of major economic news before the election showed another month of strong gains in jobs and the unemployment rate staying at its lowest in almost half a century.\n\nEmployment is perhaps the economic variable that matters most politically.\n\nWhat did the new figures show?\n\nThe number of people with jobs increased by a quarter of a million in October and the unemployment rate was 3.7%. Average hourly earnings were 3.1% higher than a year earlier.\n\nThe unemployment rate hasn't been lower since December 1969.\n\nHow has the US done in terms of job creation since the financial crisis?\n\nThe recovery in employment since the financial crisis and recession it caused has been impressive.\n\nThe number who do have jobs hit a low in February 2010. By the time the White House changed hands last year, the number had increased by 16 million. Another four million have been added since.\n\nWhat about the unemployment figures?\n\nStrong job creation obviously helps bring unemployment down, but you can't read directly from one to the other. The population is growing, and there is a third way of classifying people - \"not in the labour force\". More on that last group below.\n\nThe unemployment rate peaked at 10% in 2009, and was down to 4.7% by the time President Trump took over from Barack Obama. The decline has continued.\n\nThe low unemployment rate is particularly striking. Many economists think that there is an unemployment rate below which inflation will pick up; it's sometimes called the natural rate, or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. To the extent that this theory is right, if unemployment goes below that level, you are likely to get a problem with increasingly rapid price rises.\n\nMany thought that the US would run into that problem long before it got to current unemployment rates. It hasn't happened.\n\nWhat about earnings?\n\nWage rises have gathered pace however, after several years of sluggish performance.\n\nThe new figures are the strongest since April 2009 and well above inflation, which means they suggest rising real pay. The rise in pay may reflect the fact that over the last few months, official figures show more job openings than people seeking them.\n\nSo all is rosy in the US jobs market?\n\nNot quite, though it is worth repeating that the market is very strong. The unemployment rate doesn't tell the whole story. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies people as unemployed \"if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks, and are currently available for work\". This is based on a widely used definition known as ILO (International Labour Organization) unemployment.\n\nPeople who have not actively looked for work are classed as \"not in the labour force\".\n\nThere are many reasons people can come into that category. They may not want to work, if they are retired or are a full-time housewife or househusband. They may have other caring responsibilities that prevent them taking paid employment.\n\nBut they may have simply given up looking if they don't think there's any realistic chance of getting work. Or their own health may be the reason.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOne way of getting a quantitative handle on this is to look at the percentage of the adult population who are in work. The latest figure is 60.6%. That's higher than when President Trump took office and a lot better than the low it hit after the financial crisis. But it is still significantly below the levels of before the crisis.\n\nAnother measure we can look at is called the participation rate. That is made up of people who are employed or unemployed; that is people working or seeking work. There's a similar pattern. Much better than the low point after the recession, but still short of the levels before that.\n\nNow there is no question that an important part of this story is the ageing of the US population. You would expect that to be reflected in more people retired, not wanting to work and thus being classified as \"not in the labour force\".\n\nBut it is not the whole story. The chart shows the history of the participation rate among people aged 25 to 54.

Their guest of honour is Deb Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, who is on the brink of becoming the first Native American woman ever to be elected to the US congress.\n\nHer own struggles as a single mother will be familiar to many Americans regardless of their race - she talks of relying on government food stamps and struggling to pay off student debt.\n\nIf she defeats her Republican opponent, Janice Arnold-Jones, as polls and early voting data suggest she will, Ms Haaland wants to use her position to shift New Mexico's economy away from the extraction of oil and gas which, she says, is scarring the landscape and threatening sacred land such as Chaco Canyon, a historic site which sits at the heart of a pre-Columbian civilisation which flourished from the middle of the ninth century AD.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The \"Pink Wave\": How women are shaping the 2018 US elections\n\n\"On my mom's side I'm a 35th generation New Mexican,\" says Ms Haaland. \"My ancestors have been in New Mexico since the late 1200s.\"\n\nWith the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th Century, those ancestors - who lived in compact communities and were therefore known as Pueblo Peoples from the Spanish word for town - entered into an epoch of struggle.\n\nMs Haaland recalls how even as recently as the mid-20th Century the federal government's Bureau of Indian Affairs tried to indoctrinate native Americans into white, Christian society by compelling them to attend boarding schools where they were forced to renounce their traditional clothing, hairstyle, language and even their own native names.\n\nThe objective was to steal land, says Ms Haaland, whose grandmother was sent to an Indian Boarding School more than 100 miles (161km) from her family from the age of eight until she was 13.\n\n\"It was traumatising to whole generations of Native Americans,\" says the candidate who is running as a Democrat for the US House of Representatives in the state's first congressional district.\n\nShe is far from alone.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA record number of Native Americans - 104 by one measure - are running for state and federal office this year. Fifty-five are women. More than 75 are Democrats. Together they represent more than 50 of the 573 federally-recognised tribes in the United States.\n\nTwo Native American men sit in Congress at present, both Republicans.\n\nMark Trahant, the editor of digital news site Indian Country Today, has been tracking the increase in Native American candidates and calculates that this year the number is up 80% in congressional races and 300% in contests for state-wide offices such as governor.\n\nClearly no two candidates are propelled into politics by exactly the same circumstances, but when discussing this phenomenon two factors come up time and again. One has its roots in the frozen plains of North Dakota; the other in the bright lights of Hollywood.\n\nFirst, Standing Rock, a Native American protest camp against an oil pipeline which ran from 2016 until early 2017. Not since the Sioux successfully defended their land against US General George Custer's 7th cavalry in 1876 at the Battle of the Little Bighorn (known to the tribes involved as the Battle of the Greasy Grass) had native people gathered in such numbers. Deb Haaland was among them.\n\nThe protest was suppressed, at times brutally, and ultimately failed to stop oil flowing through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) but it led to a political awakening for a generation of activists, many of them Native American.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protests at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation swelled for more than six months as it grew into a national movement\n\nNow many of the same people in North Dakota feel as if they are under attack again - this time from voter identity legislation which the US Supreme Court allowed to take effect in the state on 9 October, requiring citizens to provide an ID with their name, date of birth and residential street address before they can vote.\n\nAccording to Gabriel Sanchez, professor of political science at the University of New Mexico, the law may prevent around a third of North Dakota's indigenous voters, some 20,000 people, from casting a ballot because they live on reservations and use post office boxes instead of street addresses for their mail.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'?\n\nOther estimates for the numbers affected vary and Republicans who introduced the law say it is intended to tackle voter fraud.\n\n\"It's one of these things where it's so obvious it's painful,\" says Prof Sanchez. \"It's pretty obvious that you're alienating a very specific segment of the population\u2026it took a long period of time to gain the right to vote. And now it feels to them as though that right is being stripped away.\"\n\nThe effect could be momentous. The Republicans have a one seat majority in the US Senate, and North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is a top target for Mr Trump's party in Tuesday's mid-term elections.\n\nShe won her seat in 2012 by fewer than 3,000 votes with significant Native American support and politicians in the Republican-controlled state legislature began debating the voter ID law almost immediately.\n\nA big last-minute effort is under way to find ways to register North Dakotans, but analysts are split on whether the measure will succeed in suppressing turnout or whether the outrage will drive more people to the polls. Either way the validity of ballots - and therefore the race itself - could end up being decided in court.\n\nImage caption Volunteers for Deb Haaland's campaign\n\nThe second event which candidates and analysts say galvanised some Native Americans to run for office was the #MeToo movement against the abuse and mistreatment of women in the film industry and beyond.\n\n\"Through the centuries women have been oppressed,\" says Deb Haaland. \"We've been beat up and jailed and killed because we wanted the right to vote. We've been paid less than men for centuries.\" Native American women have particular challenges, she says, including an \"epidemic\" of \"missing and murdered native women\".\n\nMs Haaland has a very good chance of victory, reckons Mark Trahant of Indian Country Today, although she has competition to become the first Native American congresswoman in the former of former mixed martial arts fighter Sharice Davids.\n\nMs Davids, a member of the Ho Chunk Nation, is also thought to have a decent chance of victory, even though she is running as a Democrat in conservative Kansas.\n\nIn a campaign advert which could legitimately and literally be described as punchy, she alludes to her struggles as a gay indigenous woman who was raised by a single mother.\n\n\"Truth is, I've had to fight my whole life because of who I am, who I love and where I started,\" she says in the advert.\n\nSuch tough talk feels like a theme this year.\n\nBack in the Albuquerque cultural centre, as the little dancers were being taken home to their beds, Geneve Platero, a Navajo woman, felt as if a turning point has been reached.\n\n\"It's a big step forward,\" she said, although the path had been long and painful.\n\n\"The oppression, the damage from one traumatic event, violence on our people. It's been one after another, one after another,\" Ms Platero added.\n\n\"To heal, it's taken this long.\"", "Jack Grealish scored his first goal in 24 games to get Villa off to a perfect start\n\nAston Villa eased to their second straight home win under new boss Dean Smith as they eventually saw off free-falling Bolton Wanderers.\n\nJack Grealish's fourth-minute strike gave Villa the perfect start, but all they could add to it was a second-half header from skipper James Chester.\n\nVilla's victory was only their fifth in 16 Championship games this season.\n\nIt lifts them four places to 13th going into the rest of the weekend fixtures, just four points off a play-off place.\n\nBut Phil Parkinson's Bolton have now managed just one win in 12, having picked up only one point out of a possible last 18.\n\nGoalgetter Grealish\n\nGrealish had been given a pre-match nudge by new Villa boss Smith to spend less time chasing the ball and concentrate on the area where he can do most damage, closer to the opposition goal.\n\nAnd he took less than four minutes to show he had listened to that advice as he scored his first goal in 24 games - since his late winner in the 1-0 home victory over Cardiff City on 10 April.\n\nFrom Tammy Abraham's nicely-weighted pass through the Bolton defence, Villa's prize asset coolly rounded keeper Ben Alnwick before side-footing into the empty net.\n\nIt was exactly an hour later, in playing time, when captain Chester, who had a first-half header disallowed for offside, added the second with his head from Grealish's dipping free-kick.\n\nBut in between, it was certainly not all plain-sailing as Villa - Abraham in particular - proved wasteful and were frustrated by too many offside decisions and a lack of protection of their players at times from referee Oliver Langford.\n\nIt took an extraordinary, acrobatic clearance on the line by Chester to keep out a goalbound header from Jack Hobbs. And it needed a scrambled near post save from home keeper Orjan Nyland, who still looks far from assured, to keep out Craig Noone.\n\nAlthough Villa did hold out for a second home clean sheet under Smith, Bolton pressed throughout - and a side who have scored just three times in two months were only denied something by their glaring lack of any genuine goal threat.\n\nAston Villa head coach Dean Smith told BBC Sport:\n\n\"We deserved to win, but I didn't think we were anywhere near our best. Of the four games we've had since I came in, that was probably the least dominant we've been.\n\n\"After we scored the second goal, we had a 15 or 20 minute spell in which we were excellent, but there's still a lot for us to work on. That brief spell showed me the levels this group can get to.\n\n\"There was a distinct averageness about other things we did. But keeping a clean sheet will have given Orjan Nyland a lot of confidence.\n\n\"Jack Grealish did just what was asked of him in getting in the box and scoring. And James Chester put in a really good performance. Quite apart from his goal, that goal-line clearance he pulled off was like another goal.\"\n\nBolton boss Phil Parkinson told BBC Sport:\n\n\"We just need something to go for us. We had the chances. One cleared off the line and a lot of scrambles in the box.\n\n\"Conceding so early was disappointing. Was it concentration levels or was it a good link-up play between Abraham and Grealish? Probably a bit of both.\n\n\"But, for their second goal, how has the ref has given a free-kick? I'm gobsmacked. Joe Williams has won the ball cleanly with a great tackle.\n\n\"The officials have got to give us a helping hand by getting simple decisions right. I was livid. It's unacceptable at this level. They were probably not up to the standard required.\"", "Image copyright Sky handout Image caption Actors Kit Harrington and John Bradley in international TV hit series Game of Thrones\n\nThe term 'sanctions' will turn off all but the most devoted current affairs nerds.

A message, \"It's not illegal to be White... yet\", and the image of a noose had been printed on the other. At the same time, stickers were found on benches in a nearby public park, saying \"White People Rock!\"\n\nAlarms were raised. It was not the first time that residents of this tight-knit community, which dates back to the 1920s, had suffered anti-Semitic abuse; yet, some were left scared.

A sign, they said, that their perpetrators felt emboldened enough to break the law and carry out their acts.\n\n\"Anti-Semitism is a complicated, stubborn phenomenon,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL's chief executive. \"[The cases] are disturbing and upsetting, and they demonstrate that we live in a nation where bigots still foment fear and hate.\"\n\nAs to be expected, anti-Semitic speech has also increased online, where neo-Nazis, white nationalists, conspiracy theorists and others have found places to freely spread their messages in anonymity, despite notable efforts to limit them.\n\nThe alleged Tree of Life gunman, aged 46, had posted anti-Semitic content on the social network Gab, a place widely used by far-right figureheads banned from mainstream platforms. The bio on his account read \"Jews are the children of Satan\".\n\nHostile rhetoric on the rise, too\n\nThe dramatic rise in anti-Semitic incidents comes as incendiary rhetoric by top politicians and other prominent personalities in the last few years have deepened tensions.\n\nIt is not a coincidence, many observers say, with some even blaming President Donald Trump for stirring divisions, a claim he has repeatedly denied - reacting to the shooting, Mr Trump called for national unity, angering those who say he is part of the problem.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption White nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus last year\n\nThe tragedy in Pittsburgh was the worst nightmare of America's Jewish community which, last year, watched in shock white nationalists march in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting \"Jews will not replace us\".\n\n\"The political rhetoric [in the US] has headed toward the gutter. Things are being said that weren't said before,\" said David Harris, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group. \"Jews aren't excluded from what has been happening.\"\n\nThe anti-Semitic threat was also real from far-left and Islamist groups, he said, with a warning: if things did not change, we would all pay a heavy price.\n\nThe days before the attack had been particularly tense, and perhaps a sign of that. In Kentucky, a 51-year-old white man shot dead two African-Americans, aged 67 and 69, in a supermarket, after he tried to enter a predominantly black church in Jeffersontown. Officials are investigating it as a hate crime.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"It's a horrific crime scene. One of the worst, and I've been on plane crashes\"\n\nAt the same week, a 56-year-old man allegedly sent more than a dozen explosive devices to critics of President Trump, including top Democrats, CNN and Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, who is Jewish and has been vilified by many on the right for being a \"globalist\".\n\nIn this perverse narrative, Mr Soros - who has been publicly criticised by Mr Trump himself - and other \"globalists\" are a nasty force who want to disrupt their predominantly white, Christian societies through unlimited immigration and, therefore, need to be defeated.\n\nHours before his rampage in Pittsburgh, the suspected gunman criticised refugee aid group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), saying he could not \"sit by and watch my people get slaughtered\". He now faces hate crime charges which could lead to a death sentence.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The billionaire financier and philanthropist has become a divisive figure in global politics in recent years\n\nTree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was at the synagogue when the attack happened and, this week, welcomed Mr Trump to Squirrel Hill, despite protests. Mr Trump was joined by First Lady Melania, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism when she married him.\n\nSome of the demonstrators carried placards saying \"Make America Kind Again,\" a play with the president's slogan.\n\n\"[But] this is not about politics. Hate doesn't know political party, religion, colour, persuasion or anything,\" said Mr Myers, who led the funerals of some of his own friends, shot dead at the synagogue.\n\n\"We do need to have strong leadership from all our elected leaders, not any one person, all of them from all political parties. We need to stop the hate.\"\n\nUnusual here, common abroad\n\nIn the last decades, American Jews watched their fellows being targeted in Europe and thought they were relatively safe. Brutal attacks have taken place in France, which has the Continent's largest Jewish community, Germany and beyond.\n\nIn the UK, the Labour Party has been embroiled in a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism.\n\n\"I'm from Europe, it's much more common everywhere. For Americans, it's shocking because it's unusual,\" said 30-year-old Nathan Rittri, who lived a few houses from Tree of Life, as he walked with his wife and two young children to light candles in front of the synagogue on the morning after the shooting.\n\n\"It's something that is part of the day-to-day lives in other countries.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The attack was the deadliest against the Jewish community in the US in recent history\n\nIn some European cities, Jewish buildings are secured by armed officers and followers have adopted precautions, such as avoiding displaying religious symbols. (Mr Trump said the outcome in Pittsburgh would have been different if there were armed guards outside the congregation.)\n\nIt was still early to say if any measures would be taken in this country, and residents in Squirrel Hill were determined that nothing would change. For some others, though, change has already happened.\n\n\"There was a kind of wishful thinking here that we were somehow immune,\" said Mr Harris.\n\n\"Pittsburgh, in a way, destroyed whatever innocence was left in American Jews.\"", "Media playback is not supported on this device We will do Vichai proud - Jamie Vardy on 'tough' week at Leicester\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy last weekend which saw Leicester City owner and chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four other people die in a helicopter crash outside King Power Stadium, BBC Sport asks if sport can provide healing in times of grief.\n\nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy says the team want to pay tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha when they play against Cardiff City in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nIt will be the first time the Foxes will have taken the field since the crash and Leicester manager Claude Puel gave his squad the option of whether or not to play.\n\nVardy says each one of them wanted to, so they could \"do Srivaddhanaprabha proud on the pitch\".\n\nHow have different sportsmen and women dealt with competing at the highest level despite losing someone close to them?\n\nBBC 5 live's Friday Sports Panel spoke to long jump gold medallist Greg Rutherford, England netball captain Ama Agbeze and four-time Superbike world champion Jonathan Rea.\n\nOlympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford:\n\nRutherford's grandfather died just before he flew out to Beijing for his first Olympic Games, in 2008.\n\nHe was somebody I was incredibly close to and it was the first person I'd ever experienced pass away in my direct family. I think I was very lucky to have a granddad until I was 21.\n\nBut when he died, it hit me incredibly hard, so I then left for Beijing, to train and get ready for that. But physiologically, it really did affect me and I started doing really odd things during the competition.\n\nI started having this strange belief system that something so bad had happened to me, that now all of sudden something really good is going to happen. So I'm now going to go to the Beijing Olympics, I'm going to compete, and it's all going to go great.\n\nFunnily enough, qualification went incredibly well, but actually with the stress, the lack of sleep, and everything else that I'd been experiencing, I woke up for the final and - little did I know how bad it was at that time - but I basically contracted tonsillitis, a kidney infection, and bronchitis.\n\nPeople talk about the air quality, but actually I think a big part of it was that I was so emotionally drained, so exhausted, that all these things managed to get in, and basically I changed everything I was normally doing in a competition, just because of what had happened.\n\nThen the worst thing happened - I finished 10th after it all went incredibly wrong for me in the final. And then you think 'well, what on earth was the point of me even going to this Olympic Games?', because I missed the funeral, I wasn't around my family at the time.\n\nI was dealing with it very poorly, and I felt that all I had done was waste about three or four weeks of my life - it was very hard to get my head around it.\n\nEngland netball captain Ama Agbeze:\n\nJust before the 2015 Netball World Cup, the father of England coach Tracey Neville died. Neville Neville had travelled to Australia for the competition, where Agbeze was a travelling reserve with the squad.\n\nIt was in Sydney and he travelled out and was taken to hospital. It obviously significantly affected Tracey, and that had a knock-on effect on the support team and the team themselves. And that was really difficult. They ended up with a bronze medal, so it was credit to her, and Tracey stayed around and dealt with the issues after the World Cup.\n\nAgbeze also had a difficult personal decision to make before the Commonwealth Games in April this year, when her husband's best friend passed away.\n\nIt's quite difficult being in a team situation, because you're not just there for yourself, you're there for the team, and obviously I'm the captain. It was in the build-up to the Commonwealth Games, so the Games hadn't actually started, but there was talk of me not going, to be there in New Zealand [where she lived with her husband].\n\nI did go for about two days to support my husband. I think it's a really difficult situation, because it's not our direct family, but the way things are in New Zealand, your close friends are treated as your family.\n\nSo I think it was difficult for the management to understand that it was, in effect, my family. And the leadership group supported me, and said I should go. And I think it was really important that I went for my husband, not necessarily just for me.\n\nFour-time Superbike world champion Jonathan Rea:\n\nJonathan Rea's close friend Craig Jones died in 2008 after a crash during a race they were both competing in.\n\nHe was a few places behind me and we were racing bar to bar for the race win that weekend. As soon as the race got red-flagged, I was a little bit frustrated because I was leading the race, and as soon as I heard the news that Craig had died, it was horrible.\n\nThat tragedy was very close to home for me, and was very sad, because I was very close to him and his family.\n\nBut there's something in the back of your brain, that you feel it's never going to be you. You face it in any sport, with injuries, and you see people have career-ending injuries, or much worse, and you kind of have that mentality that you think it's not going to be you, because of whatever reasons.\n\nWhether it be the fans, or the people who take part in the sport, or media in general - everybody stands together.\n\nIt was incredible to see how many well-wishers Craig had. Everyone standing together gave you more power to go out and give a good performance, and I'm sure the Leicester City players and fans are going to put on a great show this weekend.", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen?\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for the first time accused the Saudi government directly of murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"We know that the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government,\" he wrote in an article in the Washington Post.\n\nBut stressing Turkey's \"friendly\" ties with Saudi Arabia, he added that he did not believe King Salman was involved.\n\nKhashoggi was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October.\n\nTurkish investigators believe the journalist, who was living in exile, was strangled when he visited to collect documents for his forthcoming marriage to a Turkish citizen.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Questions persist about what went on behind the door of the Saudi consulate on 2 October\n\nHis body has not been found and an aide to President Erdogan, Yasin Aktay, has said he believes it was dissolved in acid after being cut up.\n\nThe murder, initially covered up by Saudi officials, caused a diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and its allies.\n\nThe Saudis have since arrested 18 suspects who, they say, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia.

I said you've been here six years James, I've been here 50,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"All the people of my generation understood that it was a peaceful, symbolic protest. The steward who came over to escort me out of the stadium said 'I agree with you mate, but what can I do?'\"\n\nColborne ended up in court, was fined and now cannot go to home or away games. He says the protest wasn't pre-meditated and was out of character, but was born out of frustration because of the way the owners had run the club.\n\nHe describes security at the stadium, handled by stadium operators LS185, as \"pathetic\" and sympathises with players who might confront a \"psychopath\".\n\nBut asked if those concerns jarred with him running onto the pitch, Colborne said: \"I don't think it's hypocrisy, sometimes you need to have courage in your convictions. I could have been a nutter, and security needs to be stepped up.\"\n\nLS185 says: \"Safety and security is paramount at London Stadium and all matches are staffed in line with the Met Police's categorisation of the fixture.\"\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Hibs boss Neil Lennon struck by object at Tynecastle\n\nDo players and managers feel safe?\n\nFormer Sunderland and Everton winger Kevin Kilbane, who made 325 appearances in the Premier League, says he has seen plenty of fans rush onto the pitch and \"never felt frightened or intimidated in any way\".\n\nBut he told BBC Sport: \"If it goes over the mark, and you think back to when Chris Kirkland was punched by a Leeds fan playing for Sheffield Wednesday, that sort of thing is unacceptable. When a player or a manager is put at risk, I have a major problem with it.\"\n\nKirkland was approached from behind and hit, leaving the former England goalkeeper \"shocked, upset and angry\".\n\nSimilarly, Hearts keeper Zlamal and Lennon looked shaken when they were assaulted, with the Hibs boss now set to \"reconsider his position\".\n\nBut Kilbane, who also played for Wigan and Hull, believes the most recent incidents are blips rather than a worrying trend of violence.\n\n\"It has happened over the course of football history, and you would think that in this day and age supporters would know that stepping out of line risks a lifetime ban,\" he said.\n\n\"Fans have to take responsibility. They have to recognise that there will be repercussions for their actions. As for stewards stepping in, why would they want to put themselves at risk?\"\n\nCrystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson also says he \"deplores\" fans running onto the pitch.\n\nHe added: \"I think in most incidences the stewards and the people whose job it is to prevent that do an excellent job, I don't think one should start trying to be over critical when one or two people get through the net.\n\n\"It's harder for fans to invade pitches today than it was and it seems to be harder for fans to throw things onto the field than it once was.\"\n\nDyche, who takes his team back to London Stadium on Saturday, said he was not worried by a return so soon after the latest pitch incursion.\n\n\"I'm sure the right people will deal with anything that's needed,\" he said.\n\nWest Ham's Arthur Masuaku and Declan Rice attempt to remove a pitch invader\n\nAre incidents on the rise?\n\nRecent incidents may cause concern but they must be placed in a historical context.\n\nMany players, managers and fans say that football is a far safer environment now and bears little resemblance to the 1970s and 1980s when pitch invasions were rife and hooliganism was a constant backdrop.\n\nWhile those issues still exist, they do not occur at the same regularity.\n\nHome office figures show that arrests for pitch incursions at games in England and Wales have actually been on the rise over the last five seasons from 155 in 2012-13 to 204 in 2016-17 - the most recent season they account for.\n\nBut they are yet to reach the 269 arrests made in 2009-10 or reach the 333 made in 2002-03 - the highest figure since these figures were recorded in 1993-94.\n\nFigures from the last seven seasons also show that football-related arrests have dropped from 3,089 in 2010-11 to 1,638 in 2016-17, with a high of 6,185 arrests in 1988-89 since figures were recorded.\n\nPerhaps that lends weight to arguments that football is getting safer, although there has been criticism of the decision to use more stewards at games rather than police, which may also account for the drop in arrests.\n\nLennon, who said he was \"furious\" after being struck on the jaw by a coin, might disagree that the game is safer.\n\nWorryingly, figures for games in England and Wales show a sharp rise in arrests for throwing missiles - jumping from 59 in 2015-16 to 91 in 2016-17.", "Video\n\nClocks go back an hour on Sunday 4 November in the US, something countries around the world have been doing for more than a century.\n\nFrankie McCamley looks at the historical, political and social reasons behind changing the clocks and the varying time zones around the world.\n\nProduced and edited by Phoebe Frieze", "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mohammed bin Salman's rise to power has been meteoric - but can he survive the Khashoggi scandal?\n\n\"He's toast\". \"He's toxic\". \"He's my hero\". \"We love him\".

\"This case is not about Celtic Boys Club, it's not about football\".\n\nThe advocate depute told the court the case was about allegations of \"systematic abuse\" carried out by Torbett who \"used his

Torbett.\n\nHe branded a part of the 46-year-old's evidence as \"fanciful\" and mentioned text messages that the man had sent Mr Torbett as an adult, after hearing about allegations.\n\nHe read some of the messages that included \"You will always have a place in my heart until my last breath, you always tried to make me a better person\" and \"Thinking about you, big man, stay positive.\"\n\nMr

This would benefit Iran, and anger Americans at the petrol pumps.\n\nThe US has increased its own production to fill in the gap left by Iran's oil and urged others to as well, especially Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt has also granted permission to eight countries to continue imports of Iranian oil after intense lobbying by some of them. Officials haven't said which ones yet, but the list is expected to include India and possibly China, two of Iran's biggest customers.\n\nBut this is at reduced levels and only for six months, at which point the administration will reassess the oil markets.

We are different - Africans are different. My weakness is that I'm a foreigner in a different country so I've got to be excellent at what I do to get noticed.\"\n\nIt's clear to see how his background is one of his biggest motivations and helps guide him when coaching.\n\n\"We have to survive in Africa. To survive we don't stand still. I tell my players, every lion wakes up in the morning and he's looking for the next meal.\n\n\"Every gazelle wakes up that morning thinking 'how am I going to escape the lion.' That's how we survive in Africa, you're waking up to be the lion or to be the gazelle.\"\n\nAs the youngest of six boys, Dino has always had to fight. Whether he's a lion or gazelle, his route into football is extraordinary.\n\n\"I got obsessed with football in 1978 World Cup. Back then, Tunisia were the only African team to represent the continent. That team really inspired a generation and one of them was me.\"\n\nAs well as being the only African team, they were the first African team to win a game at a World Cup, beating Mexico 3-1.\n\n\"To make it from where I come from you have to be obsessed with it, you've got to have resilience, you have to believe in what you're going do, in your dream and you have to be prepared to come back from setbacks.\"\n\nDino would certainly encounter plenty of the latter.\n\n\"I was 16 when I was when I got spotted playing bare feet on the playground by a lorry driver. He wrote my name on a matchstick and then one of the big clubs in Tunisia came for me.\"\n\nDino aged 16. Bottom row third from right.\n\nHowever his family were against him playing instead encouraging him to pursue an education.\n\n\"Where I come from education is everything and there was no such thing as professional football.\"\n\nDino reluctantly turned down that opportunity but his career is one of chance encounters.\n\nPlaying as a striker for his local side, La Marsa where he won a Tunisian FA Cup in 1994, he was spotted by a Burnley scout who happened to be in the country on holiday.\n\nMaamria joined The Clarets in 1995 but his career with the club would be cut short due to a bad leg break.\n\n\"The easy decision would have been to quit and to go back home. But in the early 90s there was a lot of Tunisian players who went to Europe and then came back. I didn't want to do that, this is the home of football and I wanted to make it here.\"\n\nIt was decisions made during his rehab that have helped him break a glass ceiling. Rather than returning home to Tunisia, he began taking his coaching badges at the age of 25.\n\n\"I thought what am I going to do when I finish playing, I wanted to coach.\"\n\n\"I was doing my coaching badges in the night time with Burnley academy and then I was playing in the day. I'd take a team on Sunday, I had the likes of West Brom striker Jay Rodriguez.\"\n\n\"I made sure I got as qualified as possible. I'm as qualified as Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola. I know I am different and I don't want anyone to be more qualified than me, more knowledgeable than me.\"\n\nDino's love of the game and competitive spirit drove his desire to get his coaching badges young. He now has a UEFA Pro License, something commonly associated with Premier League coaches.\n\nAfter leaving Burnley, he played across a number of lower league clubs but it was at Stevenage where he made his biggest impact.\n\n\"This club is the closest to my heart in England,\" says a man who coached at the club under Graham Westley. I've spent the past 14 out of 18 years at this club as a player or coach.\n\n\"I take it personally that they do well because it's my town and I want to push them on in the Football League and put them on the map.\"\n\nSince taking charge, after spells in non-league football with Southport and Nuneaton, Stevenage owner Phil Wallace decided to trust him with the job and since he joined in March the Boro have seen a vast upturn in fortunes.\n\nBack then, the club were 16th in the league. Maamria kept them up and this season his team have started well and find themselves in the hunt for promotion.\n\n\"The best coaches in the world, they say, are the Spanish, the Germans, the Portuguese, some English. The trend goes that way.\"\n\n\"Clubs in our leagues, leagues above us, they're looking for Spanish or Portuguese. They're not better than us (Africans). It's because the trend is to go that way.\n\n\"Unfortunately no African [coaches] have come to English football and done well. Because that market hasn't been tried and trusted, there's a reluctance from chairmen to give jobs to Africans.\n\n\"But it's my opportunity now and hopefully I'll do well and many more African's will be in English football.\"", "Image copyright PA Image caption Research suggests sunscreen could contribute to coral bleaching\n\nPalau has become the first country to impose a widespread ban on sunscreen in order to protect its vulnerable coral reefs -

It will provide propulsion, an electricity supply, thermal control, and all the gases and water needed to sustain any humans riding inside the capsule.\n\nFully loaded, an ESM will weigh 13 tonnes. Most of that will be fuel to drive the module's main engine and its 32 smaller thrusters.\n\nBremen is home to a major manufacturing facility for European aerospace company Airbus.\n\nThe firm has led the construction of the ESM over the past four years under contract to the European Space Agency. Esa formally passed the hardware on to its American counterpart, Nasa, at the German airport.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: Orion and its service module will launch atop a new rocket\n\nOn Monday, an Antonov cargo aircraft will ship the ESM to Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It is there that the service module and Orion will be linked together via a structure called an adaptor.\n\nAn extensive series of tests are then planned - including several months in a space environment simulator - ahead of the June 2020 mission.\n\nThat flight will see the combo travel 64,000km beyond the Moon in order to demonstrate system capabilities and their readiness to support astronauts on EM-2, which is currently projected for 2022.\n\n\"We're building a grand, new exploration system,\" said Mark Kirsasich, the manager of the Orion Program at Nasa.\n\n\"It incorporates something called the Space Launch System, which is our new rocket; it will be the largest rocket that humans have ever built.

The US-European relationship on Orion is intended to be a long-term one.\n\nThe service module represents a barter arrangement between Europe and the US; it is an \"in kind payment\" Europe makes to America to cover its subscription to use the International Space Station.\n\nIn the future, the arrangement will likely be extended to a project known as the Lunar Gateway. This is envisaged as a kind of space station that would operate in the vicinity of the Moon.\n\n\"We really hope that we'll build more service modules,\" said David Parker, Esa's director of robotics and human spaceflight. \"What Nasa is looking for is one a year.

But the government has ratcheted-up tensions with plans that could see shale gas projects fast-tracked in future.\n\nThose tensions were particularly apparent this week at a packed out parliamentary debate.\n\nConservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs lined up to lambast the proposals and call for a rethink.\n\nIt comes as Cuadrilla announced that it had produced the first natural gas from its site in Lancashire.\n\nSo what's causing all the consternation?\n\nWell, one idea that the government's recently consulted on is whether non-hydraulic shale gas exploration projects should be granted planning permission through \"permitted development rights\".\n\nFor anyone who's built a kitchen extension or conservatory, it may be a familiar phrase.\n\nPermitted developments, in the government's own words, provide a \"simpler, more certain route to encourage development\".\n\nCrucially, that removes the need to put in a planning application to the local council although the relevant licenses and environmental permits would still have to be obtained.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nLeading this week's Westminster Hall debate, the Conservative MP for Fylde, Mark Menzies, said that the idea was \"nothing short of irresponsible and downright bonkers\".\n\nHe described some of the infrastructure and traffic that can surround shale gas sites and asked, \"Who on earth thinks that is equivalent to building a little extension on the side of your bungalow?\"\n\nFracking was temporarily halted this week at Lancashire's Preston New Road site after a 1.1 magnitude tremor.\n\nShale gas firm Cuadrilla said the tremor was no cause for concern and, now it's seen the first signs of natural gas flowing to the surface, the industry may feel a renewed sense of confidence.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the current hydraulic operations there would not have fallen under the government's proposed permitted development scheme.\n\nBut the tremor has provided fuel for critics of the government's fracking policy.\n\nFormer Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the government's proposals as a \"subversion\" of local democracy.\n\n\"Permitted development was created for conservatories, small extensions and outhouses none of which to the best of my knowledge have ever created an earth tremor,\" he said in the debate.\n\nMinisters have also consulted on the planning process for fracking sites should they reach the actual hydraulic production stage.\n\nWhat is fracking?\n\nHydraulic fracturing is a technique used to extract gas or oil by injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals, at high pressure, into the earth via drilled boreholes.\n\nThe water mixture opens up cracks in the rock and the sand lodges into the spaces to keep them open, allowing for the release of gas.\n\nThe government's proposals, for permitted development, would only apply to non-hydraulic shale gas exploration.\n\nThis works without the use of fluid pressure but allows companies to drill for core samples.\n\nHowever, many argue that even exploration sites can cause considerable disruption to local communities.\n\nThe government is looking at whether such applications could be included in something known as the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime or NSIPs.\n\nThink major new roads, railway lines and airports.\n\nNSIPs typically see a Planning Inspector present a report and recommendations to the relevant Secretary of State.\n\nLocal councils get to \"inform\" the decision, but they certainly don't get to make it.\n\nGiven the government's much-trumpeted commitment to \"localism\", the irony has not been lost on Conservative MPs.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nEast Yorkshire's Sir Greg Knight said: \"If the government is being consistent, shouldn't local communities have more say on fracking matters and not have their voice taken away?\"\n\nHe was one of 10 Tory MPs to express concerns at this week's debate and there are more.\n\nMisgivings range from cautious scepticism to outright anger.\n\nNorth East Derbyshire is a marginal seat where a company recently won permission, through appeal, to look for shale gas.\n\nThe constituency's Conservative MP, Lee Rowley, has described the government's proposals as \"ludicrous\", adding that, \"fracking in my view will not work in this country\".\n\nMinisters point to the fact that permitted development rights do contain exclusions and restrictions that can mitigate a development's impact.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cuadrilla's Preston Road fracking site\n\nThey also say that NSIPs do see local communities consulted at an early stage while councils can submit written representations during the examination process.\n\nBut there has been a hint this week, perhaps, of some political nervousness.\n\nOn the back of two consultations, that many argued amounted to undermining local democracy, a third consultation has appeared all about \"strengthening community engagement\"; specifically whether it should be compulsory for shale gas firms to consult communities at the pre-application stage.\n\nPlanning Minister Kit Malthouse this week told MPs: \"We believe this could further strengthen the role local people play in the process.\"\n\nBut it's led to claims that the government is now \"all over the place\" on its fracking policy.\n\nLabour MP Sir Kevin Barron said: \"This is the most inconsistent, confusing thing that I've seen in all my 35 years in parliament.\"\n\nThe government's determination to explore the potential of fracking is based on the hope that it could deliver greater energy security, jobs and cheaper gas for consumers.\n\nThere is also some considerable frustration at the sluggish, yet fraught, way in which shale gas applications can currently be processed at a local authority level.\n\nEnergy minister Claire Perry has previously said it is \"a morass of protest and counter-prevailing information and frankly I pity any local councillor that gets an application on their desk because they will shortly have a travelling circus of protestors most of whom do not hail from the areas where those sites are located.\"\n\nMinisters do insist that they remain fully committed to ensuring that local communities are properly involved in any application whilst also ensuring that the process is sped up.\n\nHowever, when it comes to controversial shale gas schemes, there is a real question over whether those two aims can easily be reconciled.\n\nAnd also whether the government can contain the evident displeasure and disquiet amongst some of its own MPs.", "Ex-Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown is being treated for bladder cancer.\n\nThe former MP for Yeovil told Somerset Live that he had been diagnosed three weeks ago and while the outcome was \"unpredictable\" he had \"complete confidence\" in the care he was getting at the Somerset town's hospital.\n\nThe ex-marine commando led the party between 1988 and 1999, during which it became a growing force in UK politics.\n\n\"I've fought a lot of battles in my life,\" he told the website.\n\n\"This time I am lucky enough to have the magnificent help of our local hospital, and my friends and family, and that gives me great confidence\".\n\nLater, he tweeted that he had been \"moved\" by people's reactions, but it \"did not merit a fuss\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @paddyashdown I have been so moved by all the lovely comments here.

He's also made the migrant caravan and immigration issues central part of his mid-term election push.\n\nBoth \"real\" social media users and what appear to be bot accounts have been spreading disinformation aimed at Mr Soros and his Jewish background, even after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting which left 11 worshippers dead.\n\nSoros the bogeyman\n\nMany Twitter users have been enthusiastic in following the right-wing narrative that George Soros is deeply involved in funding liberal causes, from paying people to protest against Brett Kavanaugh, to handing out cash to encourage migrants in the south of Mexico to move toward the American border.\n\nRumours that Mr Soros has been funding migrant caravans go back months, with one item on right-wing website One News Now dated 1 May bluntly proclaiming that \"Leftist billionaire George Soros is funding the well-organised anti-Trump migrant caravan invasion from Central America\" which is \"attacking the US border\" as part of a \"refugee invasion\".\n\nIt takes as its source, other right-wing websites, WorldNetDaily and CNS News.\n\nAmong the slurs against the financier is the continued spreading of the discredited story that he was a member of the Nazi SS.\n\nImage copyright TWITTER Image caption This is not George Soros: A meme repeats the lie that he was a member of the SS\n\nOne Twitter user tweeted a meme last week which repeated the accusation, receiving more that 6,000 retweets before it was deleted following a strong rebuke from the Auschwitz Memorial account.\n\n\"This is a lie. The man in the picture is Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, a member of the SS garrison of the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp,\" the site commemorating victims of the Nazi genocide said.\n\nBut the strength of polarised opinion around the meme, still available on Twitter shows that the \"alternative facts\" broadcast both in right-wing media and on social platforms are being believed and shared by many users ahead of the mid-terms.\n\nImage copyright GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP Image caption Some sections of the US media and some social media users claim that the migrant caravan is trying to 'invade' the United States\n\nViewed over 2.4m times on Facebook, for example, is a video posted in April by former Fox News presenter Glenn Beck titled \"George Soros is funding the migrant 'caravans' to the US\". The video has been re-purposed by right-wing Twitter users to justify their support for President Trump sending troops to defend the southern US border.\n\nAmerican press reports say that the slow-moving caravan, numbering around 7,000 people, is still more than 1,000 miles away from the US border, but Twitter users, such as @MrFreddyColon who has over 64,000 followers, claim that the number could be as high as 50,000 before the caravan reaches the US.\n\nThis echoes stories seen on right-wing US TV networks, which describe the immigrant group as \"diseased\", \"violent\", or a likely cover for terrorists and criminals.\n\nWith the same narrative being pushed by the US president , it's hardly surprising that there is no shortage of people posting anti-immigrant opinions on social media.\n\nFacebook fakery\n\nDisinformation on George Soros is also present on Facebook, with groups such as \"George Soros Exposed\" and \"Arrest George Soros\" becoming more active in the weeks before the elections.\n\nThe latter group entertained a rumour in September - spread by QAnon activists - that Mr Soros may already have been arrested.\n\nGeorge Soros Exposed posted a meme calling him \"the most evil man on this planet\" along with a list of his alleged \"crimes\".\n\nThese groups tend to share memes already posted on other conservative pages spreading an extreme right-wing agenda, along with the predictable claims that the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting were a \"false flag\" operation set up to discredit the right.\n\nImage copyright FACEBOOK Image caption Evidence-free claims are a staple of anti-Soros Facebook groups\n\nMemes and hashtags battle it out\n\nWhile genuine social media users from all parts of the US political spectrum post their opinions, there are also networks of accounts hoping to skew the conversation in their preferred direction.\n\nAmong the accounts identified by the BBC, @AnnaApp91838450 displayed typical partially-moderated bot behaviour \"conversing\" with other very similar accounts to look more \"human\" to the casual observer.\n\nWith nearly 80,000 followers, and TwitterAudit suggesting most are genuine users, the account seems to have gained a large follower base through its unrealistically high number of follows - over 50,000, and at least partial human curation with memes specific to the account.\n\nIt also shares large numbers of pro-Trump, pro-GOP and pro-right wing posts with other, similar accounts which feature typically patriotic names (George Washington's Axe - now suspended, Vet With A Cause, Deplorable Doug) and large follow-to-follower ratios.\n\nImage copyright TWITTER Image caption Twitter users spread rumours that the migrant caravan is a cover for Islamic terrorists trying to reach America\n\nBut what sets them apart from regular Twitter users is the sheer volume of posts.

Herring were just enough for Ulster to claim their second away win of the season.\n\nBenetton were left to count the cost of their failure to convert their chances as Hame Faiva's early score was their only try from a dominant first half.\n\nThe Italian side pressed for a winning score in the final quarter but Ulster's defence held firm for a scrappy win.\n\nThe victory moves Ulster up to second place behind Leinster in the Conference B standings while Benetton's bid for a play-off spot has suffered a significant set-back after their encouraging start to the season.\n\nBenetton's Irn\u00e9 Herbst and Ulster's Sean Reidy\n\nBenetton set the tempo\n\nBenetton's defeat by Leinster in round seven was their first loss of the season at the Stadio di Monigo and the Italian side were clearly stung into action as they began the game at a furious pace that Ulster struggled to match.\n\nFly-half Tommaso Allan set a relentless tempo for the hosts, whose high-risk off-loading game was rewarded almost immediately when Faiva burst from the back of a powerful lineout maul to muscle his way across the line with just two minutes on the clock.\n\nBenetton remained in control throughout the opening half and were unfortunate not to add to their try tally as they repeatedly probed and stretched the visiting defence.\n\nFijian wing Iliesa Ratuva was a constant menace and it took a last-ditch tackle by Henry Speight to prevent him from grounding the ball over the line after a slick Benetton attack down the right wing.\n\nOn a rare Ulster foray out of their own half, Billy Burns converted a long-range penalty but the visitors were relieved to only trail by four points at the break after another despairing tackle by James Hume forced a knock-on by Tommaso Benvenuti as he looked certain to get his side's second try.\n\nMarcell Coetzee was influential for Ulster before he was forced off with a late head injury\n\nUlster show clinical edge\n\nHaving spent most of the opening half camped inside their own 22, Ulster showed greater attacking intent after the restart and were quickly rewarded.\n\nStuart McCloskey was prominent in the early stages and the bruising centre burst up to within five metres of the line before Reidy pounced on a quick recycle to dive over the line and push the visitors into the lead.\n\nThe Irish province demonstrated a greater ability to convert the chances that came their way as McCloskey almost added a second try shortly afterwards before the Television Match Official ruled that he had failed to get enough downward pressure on the ball as he stretched for the line.\n\nUlster were undeterred and, with Michele Lamaro off the field for spoiling a maul, the visitors went back into the corner and hooker Herring forced his way through a splintering defensive wall to score.\n\nBenetton regained control of the game in the final quarter and Allan's penalty brought the home side back to within a try of their

Aix galericulata - has found fame in the Big Apple after he appeared in Central Park.\n\nHis colourful plumage quickly earned him a keen following on social media.\n\nIt all started on 10 October, when a video of the colourful bird was shared on Twitter by Manhattan Bird Alert.\n\nThe city's bird-watching community rushed to catch a glimpse of the mysterious visitor.\n\nThe species is native to east Asia, and many speculated it has escaped from a \"private owner\".\n\nThe account suggested the arrival had dethroned the wood duck as the \"prettiest duck in the park\".\n\nThe duck's vibrant appearance is perhaps the perfect Instagram fodder, and may go some way to explain his rapid rise to social media stardom.\n\nThe platform has since seen 19,200 posts using the hashtag #MandarinDuck.\n\nAlso, the bird is hardly inconspicuous, with his purple and blue mohawk, pink bill and orange 'sail' feathers.\n\nInstagram user @pjmdvm, a microbiologist and veterinarian, said she had \"stalked a lot of birds, and he was one of the easiest to find\".\n\nMarisa Cespedes shared a video of the assembled press and bird-watchers clamouring to get the perfect shot of Central Park's new \"rock star\".\n\nHolly Mascaro, a New York based bird watcher, described the duck as \"the hottest bachelor in NYC\", and wrote that he was \"trying to fit in with the mallards\".\n\nSpeculation over where the duck came from has been rife, given that this breed of duck is native to east Asia.\n\nMany on Twitter highlighted a small tag on the duck's leg, and asked if he had escaped from the local zoo.\n\nCentral Park Zoo, who do have a mandarin duck, confirmed the one currently making a splash in the park does not belong to them.\n\nManhattan Bird Alert suggested that the bird may have escaped from a \"private owner\".\n\nTo the consternation of Friends fans everywhere, it is illegal to keep a duck as a pet in New York City.\n\nThe NYC Department of Park and Recreation shared a video of the city's \"hottest celebrity\" to welcome him to the park.\n\nAnd the bird's arrival has inspired some social media users to create artistic tributes to the eye-catching animal.", "Alexandre Lacazette's 82nd-minute equaliser was his sixth goal of the season\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side made \"life a bit too easy\" for Arsenal to fight back for a hard-earned 1-1 draw in a thrilling encounter at Emirates Stadium.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette's late equaliser extended the Gunners' unbeaten run to 13 games.\n\nJames Milner's powerful strike just after the hour, drilled home after Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno's clearance rebounded off Rob Holding, looked to have put unbeaten Liverpool on course for victory.\n\nLacazette, however, had other ideas and drew the Gunners level eight minutes from time with a superb finish on the turn after he had taken the ball away from Liverpool keeper Alisson.\n\n\"It was very intense, Arsenal are in a very good moment,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"A point at Arsenal will always be a good result, so we take that and move on.\"\n\nThe point puts Liverpool back on top of the Premier League but they will feel hard done by after a first-half strike from Sadio Mane was incorrectly ruled out for offside, while Virgil van Dijk hit the post with a header and forced a fine save from Leno after the break.\n\n\"I think it was a goal, it should have been a goal,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"He runs to the ball because he doesn't think he is offside and then the referee whistles.\"\n\nArsenal's persistence deserved reward despite those escapes and their display confirmed their development under new manager Unai Emery.\n\nArsenal answer the questions\n\nDespite Arsenal's unbeaten run, questions remained unanswered about the new Emery regime, no matter how impressive their results since defeats in their opening Premier League games at home to Manchester City and away at Chelsea.\n\nIt was felt Liverpool's potent attack would provide their most severe test - and to come through against Jurgen Klopp's unbeaten side with a point will do wonders for belief and self-confidence.\n\nArsenal still have much to do to catch Liverpool but Emery's era is in its infancy and there was much to admire about the Gunners - even though they got lucky with the first-half offside call that saw Mane's goal ruled out for offside.\n\nThey showed real urgency in the first half to shade an enthralling first 45 minutes but arguably even more satisfying will be the manner in which they dug in to rescue a point after Milner put Liverpool ahead and Klopp's side looked in the mood to finish Arsenal off.\n\nArsenal, with Lucas Torreira a fine addition and Lacazette a force up front, stuck to their task and were rewarded with a point.\n\nThey remain a work in progress but in a match many felt would see the new Arsenal's flaws exposed, Emery and his players can regard this as a highly satisfactory result and performance.\n\nVan Dijk the tower of strength\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was prepared to play a game of patience to land Virgil van Dijk after his initial move to sign the Netherlands captain from Southampton in the summer of 2017 ended in acrimony.\n\nKlopp was not interested in any other target and as soon as the January transfer window opened Van Dijk was through the door at Anfield for \u00a375m, a world record fee for a defender.\n\nAnd with every passing game, Liverpool's lavish pay-out looks money well spent.\n\nVan Dijk was the focal point as Arsenal's first half excellence put Liverpool's defence to the test, demonstrating not only his aerial prowess but also his uncanny knack of making vital interceptions and deflections at the vital moment.\n\nHe was also a threat in the air, hitting the post with a header in the first half and bringing a fine save from Arsenal keeper Leno after the break.\n\nHe has solved an obvious area of vulnerability in Liverpool's team and gives them an added dimension. He will be a central figure in their Premier League title pursuit.\n\nEmirates Stadium alive again\n\nArsenal's home games in Arsene Wenger's final season were soulless and acrimonious in varying degrees - but not now, as the home fans relish the positive approach of Emery's side.\n\nWenger spoke of the stadium's \"negative environment\" in his latter days, as supporters who had lost faith in their long-serving manager, combined with Arsenal's failure to mount a serious Premier League title challenge, watched with mounting discontent.\n\nIt is clear that during the course of Arsenal's unbeaten 13-match run Emery has not only rekindled hope and optimism but restored some of the heart and soul to this vast arena.\n\nEmery's own urgency in the technical area transmits itself to the stands with, especially during the first half, a thunderous atmosphere in a place that seemed to have forgotten how to enjoy its football last season.\n\nArsenal's supporters gave their team a warm reception at the final whistle and will have seen enough to confirm that Emery is on the right lines after succeeding Wenger.\n\nMan of the match - Lucas Torreira (Arsenal)\n\nLucas Torreira gained possession 10 times, as well as winning 80% of his duels and having a pass completion rate of 89.1%\n\n'Maybe we deserved more' - what they said\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool: Draw is a 'logical' result - Jurgen Klopp\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: \"A point is a good result - Unai Emery can say the same, but we had clear chances. When Arsenal chase the game they throw everyone on the pitch which is really cool and we were not as compact as I wanted.\n\n\"Our workhorses in midfield, we put too much on their shoulders.

On Sunday, the defender will walk out at Firhill for a Scottish Cup final.\n\nAged 20, Welsh had given up on football. Repeated attempts to battle back after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament two years ago had only ended in more pain and frustration.\n\nBut one phone call from coach Eddie Wolecki Black gave her the belief to try again. And, on Sunday in front of a live TV audience, she will line-up for Motherwell against Hibernian.\n\n\"I didn't think I would ever be on this stage,\" Welsh told BBC Scotland. \"I was trying to come back and it just wasn't working.\n\n\"I just thought that was it. I dropped out of coaching, I obviously wasn't able to play football - I took myself out of the game completely.\n\n\"Eddie gave me a call in May and asked me to come back into Motherwell and that's when I found my drive for football again.\"\n\nDespite being understandably concerned about suffering another injury set-back, she could not say no to Wolecki Black, under whom she came through the Glasgow City youth system, when asked to help with Motherwell's promotion push.\n\n\"I had been back a few times,\" she said. \"I'd been excited about it and then hurt myself again. It was just that cycle of disappointment.\n\n\"But Eddie didn't have to coax me into it. If Eddie asks any player, you jump at the chance. He's got such a good track record, he's such a great manager.\"\n\nUnder Wolecki Black, Motherwell took firm control of the SWPL 2 title, eventually finishing the season 21 points ahead of nearest rivals Kilmarnock.\n\nThat success helped convince Celtic to make Wolecki Black their new head coach, with Donald Jennow taking over Motherwell at the end of August.\n\nJennow has already made his mark, leading Motherwell past top-flight Spartans in the semi-final.\n\nHibernian will provide an altogether different proposition on Sunday. Searching for their sixth domestic knockout cup win in a row, they missed out on the league title by the slimmest of margins - losing just one game all season.\n\nWelsh says Motherwell are happy to be underdogs, after being written off at the start of the season.\n\n\"The girls were older - people thought the squad wouldn't amount to much,\" she added. \"But they've won the league unbeaten and then progressed to the Scottish Cup final.\n\n\"It gave us extra motivation. No-one likes to hear that people are putting you down.

And how did a man once seen as a stereotypical Iranian hardliner, who left office in 2013, end up speaking to a new generation of politically-active, global social media users?\n\nKey to understanding Mr Ahmadinejad's tweets are his renewed political ambitions.\n\nThe former president has been a highly divisive figure in Iran since 2009, when his disputed re-election triggered the biggest protests in the country since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n\nMillions of people demanded a re-run, but the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei insisted the result was valid and ordered a major crackdown on dissent that saw dozens of opposition supporters killed and thousands detained.\n\nLast year, Mr Ahmadinejad attempted to run for president against the moderate incumbent, Hassan Rouhani, despite being warned by Ayatollah Khamenei that such a move was \"not in his interest and that of the country\". In the end, he was barred by the Guardian Council.\n\nHowever, US President Donald Trump's decision to abandon the landmark nuclear deal negotiated by Mr Rouhani and reimpose crippling economic sanctions on Iran appears to have presented Mr Ahmadinejad with an opportunity.\n\nBranding himself as a \"husband, dad, grandfather, university professor, president, mayor, and proud Iranian\", he has sought to return to the global political stage.\n\nSkip Twitter post 3 by @Ahmadinejad1956 From the bottom of my heart I thank everyone for the birthday wishes.\n\nEvery birth is a beginning of a new world and universe.\n\nwe should congratulate every single person on their birthday; since God congratulated himself on the creation of man.\n\nI wish everyone luck and prosperity pic.twitter.com/41HAsJt8QO \u2014 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (@Ahmadinejad1956) October 28, 2018 Report\n\nAs a non-English speaker, Mr Ahmadinejad is obviously not writing the English-language Tweets himself.\n\nBut the sentiments are very much his own.\n\nThroughout his presidency he embraced a very particular personal philosophy - eschewing religious ideology in favour of his own unique blend of Iranian nationalism, anti-imperialism and mysticism.\n\nIt was a worldview that drew him to left-wing politics and liberation movements in other countries, and to leaders like Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales - often against the wishes of more traditional hardliners in the Iranian establishment.\n\n@Ahmadinejad1956 is clearly aimed mainly at an international audience, but Mr Ahmadinejad also runs accounts in Persian on both Twitter and the messaging service Telegram, which is believed to be used by about 40 million Iranians - almost half the country's population.\n\nIn his native language he is more overtly political, often taking aim at rivals at home.\n\nLast month, he posted online a letter he sent to Ayatollah Khamenei attacking two members of a powerful political family at the heart of the conservative establishment.\n\nHe accused Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, head of the judiciary, and his brother Ali, who is speaker of parliament, of \"disrespecting the law\".\n\n\"Without evidence, they charge people with serious crimes,\" he wrote in the letter. \"Judiciary officials comment as if they are a political party.\"\n\nFor some Iranians, such outspoken challenges to the country's ruling elite are exactly what they've been waiting to hear.\n\nFor others, they smack of rank hypocrisy from a man who presided over a crackdown on dissent after the mass protests in 2009.\n\nWhether Mr Ahmadinejad will be able to replicate his popularity online with success in the political sphere remains to be seen.\n\nBut at a time of uncertainty at home and abroad, his simple message about the need to stand up for the rights of ordinary people has a renewed appeal.\n\nAnd in the era of populist politics, Mr Ahmadinejad's unpredictable and straight-talking \"man of the people\" style no longer looks so out of place.", "Image caption Patricia Hodge as Margaret Thatcher in The Falklands Play\n\nHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?\n\nIt's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.\n\nGary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood.\n\nHowever, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady.\n\nIn 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.\n\nThe film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.\n\nJanet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation.\n\nImage caption Janet Brown's Thatcher impersonation earned her a role in a Bond film\n\nThat's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.\n\n\"You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't\", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.\n\nShe was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.\n\nPatricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as \"Prime Minister\".\n\nIt left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.\n\nWe're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM.\n\nImage caption Thatcher's private dilemmas are part of the drama\n\nPatricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano.\n\nThese were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.\n\nNot every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with.\n\nWhen the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character.\n\n\"What was very important was getting in and out of cars\", she recalls.\n\n\"She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.\"\n\nKika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud.\n\n\"I was told that she liked men,\" says Kika.\n\nImage caption Dan Stevens and Kika Markham in The Line of Beauty\n\nRecalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.\n\nMrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.\n\nThe most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron.\n\nGreg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister.\n\nHe was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, \"I went to public school\".\n\nIn a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted \"Yes\".\n\nImage caption Greg Wise as David Cameron in Dividing the Union\n\nDividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.\n\n\"It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.\"\n\nGreg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him.\n\nI think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox.\n\nThe film \"Churchill\" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by \"The Darkest Hour\", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.\n\nBrian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Brian Cox discusses his portrayal of Winston Churchill\n\nThe actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister.\n\nAlthough he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.\n\nBrian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months.\n\nBorn in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who remembered the former MP with little affection.\n\nYet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce.\n\nAs Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often \"takes you over\".\n\nJudge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November.\n\nAfterwards, you can find it on BBC Sounds.", "Image copyright Roadchef Image caption Roadchef operates motorway service stations across the UK\n\nThousands of former Roadchef workers are closer to receiving compensation after a 20-year battle over shares.\n\nHMRC has agreed to release millions of pounds wrongly paid in tax, meaning a long fight for payouts is in sight.\n\nMany employees were promised shares in 1986 - when the company set up a programme similar to John Lewis.\n\nBut a large number of those shares later moved into another trust and employees say they lost out when the company was sold in 1998.\n\nA legal battle ensured and a settlement was reached in 2015, but it emerged millions of pounds relating to the scheme had been paid in tax.\n\nHMRC has now given that money back to the employee trust.\n\nThe decision affects about 4,000 former employees of the motorway catering firm.\n\nCampaigners, who have kept up the pressure for \u00a310m plus interest to repaid to workers' trustees, hope they can secure tax relief on the payouts and release the money soon.\n\nAirdrie and Shotts MP Neil Gray said he was delighted for constituents who are owed money.\n\n'Absolutely delighted'\n\nMr Gray MP said: \"I am absolutely delighted because it is not often that anyone manages to get any money out of HMRC, but this campaign has managed to get millions of pounds out of HMRC.\n\n\"I am most delighted because that means that my constituents in Harthill are likely to see the payout coming much sooner than was expected.\n\n\"But there is much more that we need to do now in order to make sure that all this money that we have managed to secure from HMRC does not get clawed back in tax.\n\n\"The campaign continues, the work continues, but I am very happy at this stage.\"\n\nMargaret Gibson, 64, a former catering supervisor at Harthill services, said: \"I am really pleased that we have now come to the conclusion that we are going to get some money back.\n\n\"We are not sure how much it is going to be but thankfully there is going to be an end to this.\"\n\nThe fight by workers to secure compensation stems back to a promise made by a former managing director in 1986.\n\nSome 20% of the motorway catering firm's shares were allocated to staff by Patrick Gee, who died before the scheme was completed.\n\nImage caption Former Roadchef worker Margaret Gibson is hoping a payout will now be made\n\nHis successor, Timothy Ingram Hill, was accused of improperly acquiring the shares, disregarding Mr Gee's wishes.\n\nThe shares made Mr Ingram Hill almost \u00a327m when Roadchef was bought in 1998.\n\nIn January 2014, the High Court ruled that Mr Ingram Hill had breached his fiduciary duty to Roadchef employees, but there was no suggestion that he had acted illegally.\n\nBoth Mr Ingram Hill and the Roadchef employees appealed elements of the judge's decision, and an out-of-court settlement was subsequently reached.\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: \"We review the taxation affairs of Employee Benefit Trusts to ensure that tax rules are being followed correctly.\n\n\"Due to taxpayer confidentiality, we cannot comment on the specifics of this case.

Fish catches are collapsing there after years of overfishing, mainly by foreign trawlers, some of whom are fishing illegally. Meanwhile, Senegal\u2019s traditional fishermen have been evicted from the rich waters of neighbouring Mauritania, leading to a vicious circle of rapidly falling catches, economic desperation and yet more overfishing. Some have continued crossing the border, provoking an armed response from Mauritania\u2019s coastguard. Senegal\u2019s main traditional fishing port St Louis has seen anti-Mauritanian violence break out as a result. Alfonso Daniels travels to St Louis to find a community in despair, with some young men now seeing no choice but to join the exodus of migrants trying to reach Europe. He also gains rare access to Mauritania \u2013 usually off-limits to foreign journalists \u2013 and discovers an insatiable onshore fish processing industry now being encouraged across the region, and consuming catches on a vast scale. Much of the industry is fed by big foreign trawlers, and the end product, known as fishmeal, exported to wealthier countries to feed livestock and aquaculture. At the centre of this story is the humble sardinella, a small oily fish which migrates up and down the West African coast, breeding and supporting other species as it moves across borders. With bigger and more nutritious fish routinely exported, sardinella is a staple for several West African countries whose people cannot afford meat. It is also the stock that fishmeal factories typically utilise. Its increasing scarcity threatens millions with malnutrition. As fish stocks collapse and powerful interests vie for those that remain, ordinary Africans are paying the price.\n\nProducer: Michael Gallagher\n\n(Photo: Artisanal fishermen unload their catch on the beach at Nouadhibou, Mauritania's only fishing port.

For clubs in steps three and four of the football pyramid, it will prove to be a critical one.\n\nThe Football Association wrote to a number of non-league clubs warning of relegation if they do not make their dressing rooms larger.\n\nCurrent rules state rooms need to be at least 12 square metres in the seventh and eighth tiers, but this will increase to 18 square metres by March 2019. No ifs. No buts.\n\nWhile some teams have already implemented the changes, other clubs have expressed concern over funding the work.\n\n'I've sort of gambled, but it hasn't paid off'\n\nWarrington Town made headlines in November 2014 when, before the live BBC cameras, they knocked out League Two side Exeter City to reach round two of the FA Cup.\n\nTheir 2,500-capacity Cantilever Park was rocking under the floodlights, as plasterer Craig Robinson headed in the winner.\n\nFast forward four years, and what was good enough for The Wire back then will no longer be good enough for the Northern Premier League (NPL) side next season.\n\n\"People have been asking 'why haven't you got the work done?'\" chairman Toby McCormac told BBC Radio Manchester. \"The reason is - because it was rumoured at one time there may be a tolerance issued by the FA.\n\n\"Even if the FA put a tolerance out of even 5%, I'd have been within it and wouldn't have needed to do the work. I've sort of gambled and I am still 57cm short in one changing room and a metre in the other.\"\n\nWith ambitions of playing at a higher level, Warrington have ensured the work that is needed will take place within their existing budget, rather than needing to raise extra funds.\n\n\"It's been factored in to how I'll set the budget for this year, based on where we want to get to,\" McCormac added.\n\n'Unrealistic' timescale to achieve this\n\nFrome Town have played host to EFL clubs such as Northampton in pre-season friendlies\n\nAnother of the clubs who need to expand their changing rooms are Southern Premier League South outfit Frome Town, who are concerned about the difficulties of meeting March's deadline.\n\n\"The process of getting planning permission, quotes from contractors and finding the money from grants is just not doable in that timescale,\" Frome's football and operations director, Gary Collinson, told BBC Somerset.\n\n\"It's difficult to work out how we can do it, if we can do it. It won't ruin us, but it will affect other things we're trying to do.\n\n\"It could cost an awful lot of money. There is grant funding available but that takes time to process.\n\n\"It's a really short timescale. Our issue is that they haven't given us a realistic timescale to achieve it.\n\n\"We go to places that have far, far inferior facilities, so the size of the changing room, this seems to be something that's relatively petty.\"\n\nFA 'using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut'\n\nSomerset side Taunton Town, who play in the same division as Frome, say the specific requirements for '18 square metres' was only relayed to them earlier this year.\n\nKevin Sturmey, Taunton's chairman and head groundsman, told BBC Sport: \"The letter seemed fairly austere. Virtually all clubs at our level are run by volunteers.\n\n\"We're quite lucky - we've got 4.6 acres - so we've got quite a lot of space, but some clubs' changing rooms are built within their boundary and they have no room to expand. For a lot of clubs, it'll be harder than for ourselves.\n\n\"It does seem like a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, but that's not unusual with the FA and non-league football.\n\nTaunton's stadium has played host to step two sides in the FA Cup\n\n\"There's no advice, no lists of recommended companies. What we need is help and guidance. It does feel like you're given no help whatsoever.\"\n\nOther divisions are more progressive, highlighted by Warrington's experiences in the NPL.\n\n\"We've been fortunate as members of the NPL that they've been hammering clubs for a couple of years now, doing ground inspections and at the same time helping clubs - coming up with suggestions of how to go forward,\" McCormac continued.\n\n\"We'll have to get our work done in between fixtures in time for a March inspection.\"\n\n'The FA don't tell you how to fund it'\n\nNot all clubs have the necessary finances to fulfil the regulations, although there has been plenty of warning.\n\nThe FA said notice of the change was given in 2014, and affected clubs can apply for up to 70% of the funding for any work. Clubs have until July to complete the work.\n\nClubs must deliver planning permission, if required, proof of funding and a completed, enforceable contract to both the FA and their league by the end of March.\n\nThe Football Stadia Improvement Fund, managed by the Football Foundation, can offer partial funding for improvement work.\n\nMossley AFC, of the Northern Premier League West Division, found other means to complete the necessary alterations.\n\n\"It was down to volunteers,\" secretary John Wharmby said. \"We had to take a complete wall out in the corridor to comply with the 18-square-metres ruling.\n\n\"Within the volunteers, a few of the lads were builders, so we started work 12 months ago and luckily the work's been done now and everything has been passed.\n\n\"Plus we had to put in a female changing room as well.

It really does looks like it is going to be a rollercoaster ride.\n\nOne minute, at the highest ground in the country, the Baggies fans were feeling high again, drooling over 19 goals in the space of five home games. The next they were feeling ominously low, gnashing their teeth with frustration after taking one point from a possible nine.\n\n\"Such are the demands of this league, you really are tested as a head coach,\" said Moore.\n\nJay Rodriguez (left) and Dwight Gayle have scored 16 goals between them this season\n\nIn their first 15 league games, Albion have plundered 33 goals - more than the 31 they managed last season in an entire 38-game Premier League campaign.\n\nBut it is the 23 they have conceded - especially the four they shipped at home to Frank Lampard's Derby on 24 October - that most worry their fans.\n\nOnly four other Championship sides have leaked as many goals this season and, after a winless week in which Albion twice missed the chance to go top, already there are question marks - largely over the Baggies' tactics.\n\nThree at the back once worked for Moore in his Albion playing days, alongside Phil Gilchrist and Larus Sigurdsson. It worked when the club had defenders of the aerial ability of Jonas Olsson, Jonny Evans and Gareth McAuley.\n\nBut is it working now? Some concerned supporters suddenly do not think so, and the worries are that playing too cavalier an attacking style going forward can leave them exposed at the back.\n\nAlbion's previous promotions\n\nSeason (manager) Record Goals Top scorers 2001-02 - Gary Megson 46 games, 27 wins, 89 pts (2nd) For 61 Against 29 Dobie 11 2003-04 - Gary Megson 46 games, 25 wins, 86 pts (2nd) For 64 Against 42 Hughes 11, Hulse 10, Koumas 10 2007-08 - Tony Mowbray 46 games, 23 wins, 81 pts (1st) For 88 Against 55 Phillips 22, Bednar 13 2009-10 - Roberto di Matteo 46 games, 26 wins, 91 pts (2nd) For 89 Against 48 Dorrans 13, Brunt 13, Bednar 11 2018-19 - Darren Moore 15 games, 7 wins, 25 pts (5th) For 33 Against 23 Gayle 8, Rodriguez 8\n\nIn eight straight seasons in the Premier League, it was mostly about survival for Albion. And often, especially during the reign of Tony Pulis, that battle against survival simply became played out in too dour a fashion to satisfy their fans.\n\nIt was the fans' disaffection with Pulis that preceded the downturn in results, which led to his removal in November 2017, followed by unwanted headlines on and off the pitch under Alan Pardew and ultimately relegation.\n\nPardew's sacking on 2 April and Moore's appointment as caretaker boss came too late to do anything other than restore spirits throughout the whole club.\n\nThe Albion fans love the man they call 'Big Dave'. \"If only he had replaced Pardew a bit sooner,\" they said. It all led to a summer of hope.\n\nAnd if bringing in Dwight Gayle and Harvey Barnes on loan and keeping hold of Jay Rodriguez were Albion's key moves on the player front this summer, just as vital for Albion boss Moore was bringing in a trusted number two - and he has just that with Graeme Jones.\n\n'We couldn't play that way any more' - Jones\n\nMoore's former Doncaster Rovers team-mate was lured to the West Midlands following more than a decade's service as number two to Roberto Martinez at Swansea, Wigan, Everton and the Belgium national team.\n\n\"Culturally, I know what's gone on in the last four or five years,\" Jones told BBC WM. \"In order to move forward, we couldn't play that way any more.\n\n\"We're West Brom - one of the biggest, if not the biggest side in the Championship. We needed a new style and shape. You have to score goals and win football matches.\n\n\"What did Wolves get last season? 99 points? Draws are sometimes good results in the Premier League. In the Championship, they're not.\n\n\"I believe in having different shapes and different systems. We had three at the back with Belgium. At Wigan, we won the FA Cup playing with a back three. We even played a back three at Everton once or twice.\n\n\"In the World Cup, it was slightly different. We had two number 10s. Here it's two strikers and a number 10. But, whatever system you play, you need a strong team and good players.\"\n\nOf all the summer acquisitions made by Darren Moore, the appointment of Graeme Jones (right) as his number two may prove the most important\n\nGateshead-born Jones, 48, said the timing was right to move on after the end of Belgium's World Cup venture, which was at the same semi-final stage as England's exit.\n\nHe continued: \"I had an offer from Roberto to stay with the national team, but I saw the end of that particular road. For me, it was never going to get any bigger than a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\"There's only one game that's bigger in the world and I was lucky enough to win a bronze medal. You have long periods of doing nothing but scouting, but I missed day to day coaching. I wanted to get back on the grass and back in the UK too.\n\n\"Darren and I first played together 23 years ago at Doncaster. We then didn't see each other but we always spoke. It just felt right and natural. We're very similar. We live for the game. It's not something we do 50% of the time. It's total commitment.\"\n\nAlbion's new direction off the park\n\nOff the field, it has been a year of change at The Hawthorns.\n\nFirst, Mark Jenkins returned as chief executive in February. He first joined Albion as finance director in 2002, then was chief executive for six years before stepping down when Guochuan Lai became owner in 2016.\n\nBut Jenkins returned when chairman John Williams and chief executive Martin Goodman were sacked by Lai in February, and Jenkins then brought in Luke Dowling as sporting and technical director on 26 September.\n\nMark Jenkins returned to West Bromwich Albion as chief executive in February\n\n\"Mark has seen what he built before and wants to get that going again,\" Dowling told BBC WM. \"West Brom had a wonderful reputation a few seasons ago in terms of other teams who looked at West Brom to say 'that's how you run a football club'.\n\n\"A lot can look at the West Brom way and, if they copy it, they won't go far wrong.\"\n\nFor Dowling, it means simply trying to make the job as uncomplicated as possible for the head coach, as Albion's bosses prefer to call the man who picks their team.\n\n\"It's all about overseeing the football side,\" he said. \"This role is becoming more popular with clubs. It takes as many things away from the manager as possible.\n\n\"The day-to-day stuff - just train the team, coach the team, pick the team and win games and leave the rest to us, with Darren having an involvement.\"\n\nIt is simple for Moore and Jones - just win games more regularly.\n\nAnd remember that, in all of their previous promotion campaigns to the Premier League, Albion also had disappointing wobbles like their current one. And they came through them.\n\nGraeme Jones and Luke Dowling spoke to BBC WM's Rob Gurney.", "Image copyright Bank of England\n\nThe new \u00a350 note will feature a prominent British scientist, the Bank of England has announced, with the public being asked for nominations.\n\nIn addition to the Queen, the note will include the portrait of an eminent late scientist from fields such as biology, astronomy and medical research.\n\nThe public can offer suggestions on the Bank's website over the next six weeks.\n\nThere are currently 330 million \u00a350 notes in circulation, with a combined value of \u00a316.5bn, the Bank said.\n\nThe Bank's governor, Mark Carney, made the announcement at the Science Museum in London.\n\n\"There is a wealth of individuals whose work has shaped how we think about the world and who continue to inspire people today,\" he said.\n\n\"Our banknotes are an opportunity to celebrate the diversity of UK society and highlight the contributions of its greatest citizens.\"\n\nNominations can include anyone who worked in any field of science including astronomy, biology, bio-technology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, medical research, physics, technology or zoology, the Bank said.\n\nA shortlist will be drawn up by a committee, including four experts in the field, and a final decision will be made by Mr Carney, with the note entering circulation at a date yet to be announced.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who should be on the new \u00a350 note?\n\nThere will also be a new signature on the banknote - that of Sarah John, the new chief cashier of the Bank of England.\n\nWho might feature on the note?\n\nAnalysis: Paul Rincon, BBC News website science editor\n\nIf a British scientist is to feature on the new \u00a350 note, Prof Stephen Hawking has to be one of the frontrunners.

I had to fade the tunes in and out. I was right at the front, taking it very seriously. I got a lot of praise for that job.\"\n\nHe may finally get his wish to play for England with Buttler during the three-Test tour of Sri Lanka, starting on Tuesday.\n\nIt was Buttler who helped give left-arm spinner Leach his nickname 'the Nut' - bestowed upon him because of his shaven head and the saying amongst friends: \"Keep your nut down.\"\n\nLeach added: \"There was an under-13s game where we batted together - I was number 11 and we were about 80-9. We put 60 or 70 on. I think I scored five of them.\n\n\"There was another game at Glastonbury against Wales. We scored about 150 and I bowled the first 10 overs from one end. I bowled 10 overs, nine maidens, 1-3. We got down to the last few overs, they needed maybe 10 and were eight wickets down. Jos took off his keeping stuff, said he was going to bowl and got the last two wickets.\n\n\"The coach sat us down and said: 'Some people want it in the big moments and that's what Jos did.' I was thinking: 'I bowled 10 overs, nine maidens and that's not even mentioned!'\n\n\"In that game, Jos said to me: 'I want to be in the Somerset academy.' I didn't know what it was, so he had to tell me. I thought: 'That's what I want as well.'\"\n\nHad it not been for the broken thumb, Leach would have almost certainly arrived in Sri Lanka with more than one Test cap, earned in New Zealand earlier this year, to his name.\n\nThat injury was followed by a concussion, sustained when he was hit on the head by Morne Morkel. Leach's misfortunes gave England opportunities to Dom Bess, then Adil Rashid.\n\nNow, in a land of spin, the 27-year-old could form a three-pronged slow-bowling attack with Moeen Ali and Rashid.\n\nLeach was an usher at Jos and Louise Buttler's wedding\n\nLeach is used to spells of adversity - some well documented, others not.\n\nOne night in 2015, when Leach was trying to make his name at Somerset, he fainted in his bathroom, hit his head on the sink and suffered a fractured skull.\n\nFor a while, the joke was that Leach was happier facing fast bowling than taking a late-night trip to the toilet.\n\nNow, he is happy to set the record straight: \"I might have said that, but I will take that back after getting hit on the head by Morkel. I'd much rather go for a pee.\"\n\nA year later, Leach was in the frame for a call-up to England's tour of India, only for his action to be found to be illegal.

I would say it is something that made me a better bowler.\"\n\nThe other oft-repeated fact about Leach is his time working in a supermarket. The misconception is that he was scratching a living while out of the game, whereas in reality he was earning some spare cash during his time with the Somerset academy.\n\n\"It's made out that I went from trolleys to Test matches, which is how Jos puts it,\" Leach said.\n\n\"He always jokes that [Somerset's former director of cricket] Brian Rose was doing his shopping in Sainsbury's and he saw me bowl one down aisle 13 with oats as rough and sticks of celery as stumps.\n\n\"It was just a bit of work to get through and live. It also taught me hard work doing work that you don't want to do. It helps you not take things for granted.\"\n\nThe Test in Sri Lanka series begins on Tuesday, 6 November\n\nIf trolleys, a fractured skull and an illegal action are the stories that follow Leach around, what is lesser known is his struggle with Crohn's disease, the bowel condition with which he was diagnosed at the age of 14.\n\n\"It's something I'm always battling with a little bit, even if I am very lucky to not be affected as badly as some people can be,\" he said. \"Going out to places like Sri Lanka I need to be extra careful.\n\n\"If I was having a bad day with the ball, it would be nice to be able to blame it on the Crohn's, but I've never done that. If there's a day when I'm struggling, I know how to fight through.\n\n\"If I was in the middle of a big flare-up, I would feel at a physical disadvantage compared to other players, but I haven't had one of those since I was about 16.\"\n\nLeach's first \"flare-up\" as a professional cricketer came over the past summer, though he maintains it did not affect his bowling.\n\nHowever, as stress is known to trigger the symptoms of Crohn's, he concedes that the emotion of playing his first Test, followed by a spell out injured, may have played a part.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease? Crohn's is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system or gut. It can affect any part of the gut, though the most common area affected is the end of the ileum (the last part of the small intestine), or the colon.\n\n\"I had a good chat over Twitter with Lewis Moody (a Rugby World Cup winner with England). He suffers with colitis and manages it through diet rather than medication. I've got some ideas from him about what to avoid. The problem is that I'm a big foodie,\" he said.\n\n\"Spicy foods, too many carbs late at night, caffeine and red meat are things I don't want to have too much of.\n\n\"I hope that these little things, the flare-ups, are building my strength of character. If I've got a weakness in my body, I'm stronger in the mind.\"\n\nAnd what about dealing with Crohn's in the merciless world of the dressing room?\n\n\"I don't think it's something that people are massively aware of, but I every now and then I have the odd conversation,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a little bit of banter, but if anyone is complaining to the physio that they have stomach ache or any other symptom remotely linked to Crohn's, I tell them they've got Crohn's.\"\n\nIt can be argued that Leach's chance at nailing down a place in an England side is overdue. In 2016 and 2017, no bowler took more than his 116 wickets in the top tier of the County Championship.\n\nA decent return for a man who, as a youngster, had to be talked out of bowling pace by his father.\n\n\"Me being on this tour is very special for him,\" said Leach. \"He's been so supportive, as has my mum. They watch Somerset whether I'm playing or not. My mum is going to Sri Lanka, but my dad hates flying.\n\n\"The only way he'll watch a Test is if I play in England. I don't think I'll get him on a plane - I don't want to put him through that.\n\n\"Still, I'm very grateful he persuaded me to stick with spin bowling.\"", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nFor many, imagining a sell-out stadium show conjures up the image of the classic rock band line-up; the posturing frontman, the charismatic lead guitarist, the perfect partnership between drums and bass keeping the heavy melodies rolling.\n\nThe music itself can range from the hair metal kings of Guns N' Roses and AC/DC, through to the British institutions of The Rolling Stones or Queen.\n\nIt is that unit, those domineering guitars and those anthemic sing-alongs, that define the \"stadium rock\" sound.\n\nAnd today tickets go on sale for the original hair rockers Bon Jovi, returning to the stage at Wembley Stadium for the first time in 18 years.\n\nBut after a decade of pop acts dominating the hallowed ground - the only artists to have headlined this year being Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran - is it too late?

But we can look at some figures produced by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nEach year, it asks households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime and as part of that it also produces some figures especially for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) broken down by occupation type.\n\nThere were 642,000 incidents of violence at work in 2016-17, according to the HSE, the public body charged with reducing work-related injuries, illness and deaths.\n\nThat equates to 0.5% of people being physically assaulted in their place of work in a year.\n\nSo it looks like people working in hospitals, prisons and police forces are at considerably higher risk of violence than the average.\n\nPeople working in \"protective services\" - that is police and prison officers as well as fire fighters and ambulance workers - are most at risk of assault.\n\nHealth and social care professionals of various types were also more likely than average to experience violence at work.\n\nTeachers and transport workers, while they were nowhere near as at risk as health, police or prison staff, were also subjected to more violence than many other categories of profession, according to the HSE.\n\nIt gave the example of bus drivers being subjected to robberies during which they have been threatened with \"knives, air guns, even samurai swords\".\n\nWhile health and care staff, whose jobs involve going into people's homes, have reported being physically attacked and threatened and, in some cases, shut in rooms and not allowed to leave.\n\nWhat do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

In the 10 years between 2008 and 2017, there were four such nights.

The disused industrial cranes that lined the Thames told the story of a city struggling to come to terms with a rapidly changing world.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1991, London lost 800,000 more jobs than it created, mainly because of the collapse of its manufacturing sector. Its population fell by about a million.\n\nBut the capital has since seen a huge turnaround in its fortunes thanks to an explosion in \"knowledge industries\" like finance, media, marketing and technology.\n\nThese offer higher-skilled, higher-paid jobs, whose main products are information and ideas rather than physical goods.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe result is there are about two million more jobs in London today than in 1991, with world-leading businesses in many different fields.\n\nLondon's story underlines the challenge that most UK cities have faced - how to cushion the decline of heavy industry by creating jobs in emerging industries.\n\nA number of other cities have successfully reinvented themselves as centres of knowledge production.\n\nA century ago, Edinburgh, Bristol and Leeds were home to low-cost, traditional manufacturing. Today they are hubs for finance and creative occupations, with Leeds recently announced as the new home for Channel 4 television.\n\nThey built on an existing history of jobs in activities such as accountancy, bookkeeping and goods trading - the \"knowledge jobs\" of the early 20th Century.\n\nManchester has also made this transition, creating knowledge-based jobs in financial services, law and advertising - driving the resurgence of its vibrant city centre.\n\nBut because of the heavy job losses it suffered through the middle part of the century, it only has 1% more jobs than it did 100 years ago.\n\nMany other towns and cities have struggled to adapt after facing big job losses in their traditional industries. When compared with more successful places, they are arguably worse off in relative terms than they were 100 years ago.\n\nInstead of reinventing their economies, they have had to \"replicate\" them - swapping coal mines for call centres and dockyards for distribution sheds, for example.\n\nThese cities tend to have created more jobs than they have lost in recent decades, but they have generally been in lower-skilled work.\n\nDoncaster is one such example. Little remains of its mining industry, which at its peak in 1931 employed 36,000 people, 50% of the town's workers.\n\nToday, the town actually has more than double the number of jobs than it did a century ago.\n\nBut the challenge is that these jobs are dominated by sectors like warehousing and distribution, which tend to be lower skilled than those in knowledge industries.\n\nThey are lower paid and less secure - with shop, administration and warehouse jobs likely to be among those most at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence.\n\nAs a result, Doncaster has the fifth lowest average wages among the UK's largest towns and cities. At \u00a3447, they are \u00a3100 lower than the national average, although the cost of living is also relatively low.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe same story has played out across many other towns and cities with a legacy in heavy industry, such as Birkenhead, with its strong tradition of shipbuilding, Middlesbrough, the home of steel and chemicals, and Wakefield, which like Doncaster, has a proud mining heritage.\n\nIncreased competition from abroad and the mechanisation of many jobs continues to squeeze their key industries. Many of the services they once offered are either no longer needed, or can be done more cheaply and efficiently elsewhere.\n\nFilling the gap\n\nOther places have struggled to recreate even low-paid jobs.\n\nThe chimneys that punctuate the skylines of Burnley and Blackburn offer a reminder that in 1911 one in every two people worked in the textile industry.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBoth have witnessed decades of decline. They now offer about 50,000 and 40,000 fewer jobs respectively than 100 years ago, while their populations have also shrunk.\n\nThese areas have been unable to adapt in the face of a century of change, although they have been helped by a relatively high proportion of public sector jobs.\n\nMore like this\n\nEducational divide\n\nHow can struggling towns and cities take a greater share of highly paid jobs?\n\nResidents' ability to access higher education is a big part of the puzzle and research suggests a regional divide in this respect.\n\nLondon children receiving free school meals are 40% more likely to achieve good maths and English GSCEs than these children in the north of England. A child receiving free school meals in Hackney is three times more likely to go to university than their counterpart in Hartlepool, for example.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMore than half of London residents have a degree, compared with one in three living in north-west England.\n\nNot only are graduates likely to earn more throughout their lifetime, they also provide a boost to their local area.\n\nKnowledge-based businesses tend to invest in places where they can get the skilled workers they need. They often want to base themselves in the same place as similar businesses, where they can pool resources, network and keep an eye on their competition.\n\nWhat follows is a vicious cycle, where cities that don't offer access to these benefits can't attract high-level jobs, or people with the appropriate skills to do them.\n\nOthers have argued that struggling towns and cities have not always had the tools they need to respond to change.\n\nHistorically, the centralised nature of UK government means many have had little control over policies like planning, investment and transport. This has started to change under devolution and with the creation of seven metropolitan mayors - including those in the Tees Valley and the West Midlands.\n\nThe last 100 years has created winners and losers across the country. The winners have been those cities able to adapt to an ever-changing economy.\n\nIn future, all cities will need the tools to attract tomorrow's industries and adapt to whatever change lies ahead.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nAndrew Carter is chief executive and Paul Swinney is head of research and policy at the Centre for Cities, which describes itself as working to understand how and why economic growth and change takes place in the UK's cities.\n\nEdited by Eleanor Lawrie", "Are Aymeric Laporte, Roberto Firmino and Shane Duffy already in your team?

Because Eddie Howe's side don't have a great recent record against Manchester United, having lost four and drawn one since they won the first Premier League meeting between the sides in December 2015.\n\nAlso, Bournemouth have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of those six matches. United have won their past two Premier League visits to the Vitality Stadium by an aggregate score of 5-1.\n\nBut should Jose Mourinho (and you) bring in Romelu Lukaku? The Belgian has scored six goals in his past three Premier League meetings with Bournemouth, including netting in both matches for the Red Devils last season.\n\nUnited won without Lukaku against Everton on Sunday, so picking him might be a riskier selection for you than it would be for Jose...\n\nRomelu Lukaku started Sunday's win against Everton on the bench - will he stay there at Bournemouth?\n\nClarets sinking?

That would add about \u00a332,000 to the average property value, taking it to \u00a3248,086.\n\nThe slowest rise will be in London, where prices are still the highest and have increased by 72% over the past 10 years, according to Savills.\n\nThe South East and East of England will both see prices rise by 9.3%, it predicts.

at least more than eight characters\n\nMix upper case and lower case characters with symbols and numbers\n\nTry not to use easily guessable words - the names of your children, spouse, pets, favourite sports teams and so on\n\nAvoid sharing passwords with other people\n\nUse different passwords for different sites and services\n\nUse two-factor authentication\n\nConsider using a password manager such as Dashlane, Sticky Password or Roboform\n\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre has also published lots of advice about choosing and using good passwords\n\nMajor data breaches are becoming almost weekly occurrences, with Facebook, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, Reddit, Wonga, and Dixons Carphone joining a long list of corporate victims in recent months.\n\nTwo-factor authentication - using your smartphone or a separate dongle to provide an extra layer of security on top of your main log-in details - is becoming more common, especially using biometrics such as voice, fingerprint, and facial recognition.\n\nBut these are less suited to the corporate environment because desktops don't usually come with fingerprint readers or video cameras built in, Mr Pedersen points out.\n\nWe're also pretty dumb when it comes to clicking on links and downloading content we shouldn't, says Ian Pratt, co-founder of cyber-security firm Bromium.\n\nA lot of these links are loaded with malware - programs designed to burrow though corporate security systems, steal data or even take remote control of machines.\n\n\"More than 99% of [malicious links] are run-of-the-mill criminal malware that are not targeted,\" he says. \"That malware is trying to spread pretty aggressively, but they do not use any clever tricks.\"\n\nThe simple stuff works.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Many cyber-attacks were successful because we clicked on something we shouldn't have\n\n\"More than 70% of the breaches that we hear about have started on a PC with some hapless user clicking on something that lets attackers get on to the network,\" says Mr Pratt.\n\nAnd hard-pressed IT departments have had their lives made even more difficult in recent years by the surge in mobile phones, laptops and tablets we use for work as well as for private purposes.\n\nSo, many large firms are focusing on making the desktop PC idiot-proof.\n\nBromium's tech works by isolating each and every action that takes place on a PC - sandboxing to use the jargon.\n\n\"Almost every task performed effectively gets its own computer,\" explains Mr Pratt. \"As soon as you finish that task we effectively throw that laptop away and get out a new one.\"\n\nThis means that if you click on a malicious link, the malware is isolated and can't escape to infect the rest of the network.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Would face recognition and other biometrics improve security in the workplace?\n\nBut keeping an eye on what we're doing across a sprawling IT network is very hard, says Paul Farrington, a former chief technology officer for Barclays and now a consultant at security firm Veracode.\n\nLarge organisations being clueless about the extent and reach of their IT assets is \"very common\", he says.\n\nA project Veracode carried out for one high street bank discovered 1,800 websites the organisation had not logged.\n\n\"Their perimeter can be 50% larger than they originally thought it was,\" says Mr Farrington.\n\nAnd this ignorance can also extend to the number of computers - or \"endpoints\", in the jargon - sitting on a corporate network, says Nathan Dornbrook, founder and head of security firm ECS.\n\nOne of his clients has more than 400,000 machines to manage, and several other customers have similar numbers.\n\n\"The machines could contain substantial amounts of information and customer data, passwords to internal systems, and all sorts of bits and pieces in the easy single sign-on applications that cache credentials locally,\" he says.\n\nIn other words, just one of these PCs could be an Aladdin's cave to a hacker.\n\n\"If one attack gets inside,\" says Mr Dornbrook, \"you lose the whole enterprise.\"\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nSo given that we're PEBKACs and IT departments are overloaded, automated systems are becoming increasingly necessary, cyber-security experts say.\n\nFor example, ECS uses the Tachyon tool from security firm 1E to help monitor millions of PCs and keep them updated with the latest software patches and security updates.\n\n\"Otherwise you just don't have time to react,\" says Mr Dornbrook.\n\nMany other cyber-security companies are moving from a firewall approach to automated real-time traffic monitoring, looking for strange behaviour on the network.\n\nBut it would certainly help if we all didn't behave like PEBKACs at work and casually give away the keys to the kingdom.", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nHackers appear to have compromised and published private messages from at least 81,000 Facebook users' accounts.\n\nThe perpetrators told the BBC Russian Service that they had details from a total of 120 million accounts, which they were attempting to sell, although there are reasons to be sceptical about that figure.\n\nFacebook said its security had not been compromised.\n\nAnd the data had probably been obtained through malicious browser extensions.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\n'The food supplement that ruined my liver'\n\nHow could a brand new plane crash?\n\nTrick or treat children 'given ecstasy'\n\nFacebook added it had taken steps to prevent further accounts being affected.\n\nThe BBC understands many of the users whose details have been compromised are based in Ukraine and Russia.

Our database includes 120 million accounts,\" the user wrote.\n\nThe cyber-security company Digital Shadows examined the claim on behalf of the BBC and confirmed that more than 81,000 of the profiles posted online as a sample contained private messages.\n\nData from a further 176,000 accounts was also made available, although some of the information - including email addresses and phone numbers - could have been scraped from members who had not hidden it.\n\nThe BBC Russian Service contacted five Russian Facebook users whose private messages had been uploaded and confirmed the posts were theirs.\n\nOne example included photographs of a recent holiday, another was a chat about a recent Depeche Mode concert, and a third included complaints about a son-in-law.\n\nImage caption Samples of the data were posted online to attract interest\n\nThere was also an intimate correspondence between two lovers.\n\nOne of the websites where the data had been published appeared to have been set up in St Petersburg.\n\nIts IP address has also been flagged by the Cybercrime Tracker service. It says the address had been used to spread the LokiBot Trojan, which allows attackers to gain access to user passwords.\n\nWho should be blamed?\n\nPersonal shopping assistants, bookmarking applications and even mini-puzzle games are all on offer from various browsers such as Chrome, Opera and Firefox as third-party extensions.\n\nThe little icons sit alongside your URL address bar patiently waiting for you to click on them.\n\nAccording to Facebook, it was one such extension that quietly monitored victims' activity on the platform and sent personal details and private conversations back to the hackers.\n\nFacebook has not named the extensions it believes were involved but says the leak was not its fault.\n\nIndependent cyber-experts have told the BBC that if rogue extensions were indeed the cause, the browsers' developers might share some responsibility for failing to vet the programs, assuming they were distributed via their marketplaces.\n\nBut the hack is still bad news for Facebook.\n\nThe embattled network has had a terrible year for data security and questions will be asked about whether it is proactive enough in responding to situations like this that affect large numbers of people.\n\nThe BBC Russian Service emailed the address listed alongside the hacked details, posing as a buyer interested in buying two million accounts' details.\n\nThe advertiser was asked whether the breached accounts were the same as those involved in either the Cambridge Analytica scandal or the subsequent security breach revealed in September.\n\nImage caption The BBC contacted five people who confirmed the private messages were theirs\n\nA reply in English came from someone calling themself John Smith.\n\nHe said that the information had nothing to do with either data leak.\n\nHe claimed that his hacking group could offer data from 120 million users, of whom 2.7 million were Russians.\n\nBut Digital Shadows told the BBC that this claim was doubtful because it was unlikely Facebook would have missed such a large breach.\n\nJohn Smith did not explain why he had not advertised his services more widely.\n\nAnd when asked whether the leaks were linked to the Russian state or to the Internet Research Agency - a group of hackers linked to the Kremlin - he replied: \"No.\"", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chris Cornell spoke to Jools Holland in 2012 about his career in music\n\nThe widow of US singer Chris Cornell is suing his doctor, accusing him of overprescribing drugs that ultimately led to his death in 2017.\n\nVicki Cornell alleges that Dr Robert Koblin \"negligently and repeatedly\" prescribed the singer \"dangerous mind-altering controlled substances\".\n\nCornell was found in a Detroit hotel room and his death was ruled a suicide.\n\nTraces of several drugs were found in his body - but a coroner's report said the drugs were not a cause of death.\n\nDr Koblin has so far made no public comments on the issue.\n\nCornell was the lead vocalist of Soundgarden band.

She said the channel's former boss Roger Ailes asked her for sexual favours. When she rebuffed his advances, she says her pay was cut and she was later fired.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption London employees particpated in the Google walkout\n\nMs Carlson's contract with Fox News included a forced arbitration clause, which meant she couldn't settle the case in court.\n\nBut she got around that by suing Ailes directly for violating human rights law.\n\nMs Carlson won $20m and Ailes, who died earlier this year, issued an apology. Her case encouraged other women at the network to come forward with claims.\n\nIt's unclear how exactly she got around the loophole because a confidentiality agreement limits what Ms Carlson can say about it. But her case highlights the secrecy that allegations of sexual harassment can be shrouded in.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Gretchen Carlson attends the 2018 Vanity Fair party after the Academy Awards\n\nThe #MeToo moment might have made it easier for women to share their experiences, but many argue it's done little to change the law.\n\nMore than half (53.9%) of US employers have forced arbitration processes in place, according to the Washington DC-based Economic Policy Institute. For larger companies, with more than 1,000 employees, the figure is even higher at 65.1%.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California\n\nBy their calculations this means that more 60.1 million American workers (both men and women) can't go to the courts to protect their employment rights.\n\nTheir research says this is more common in low-wage workplaces, and those that have disproportionate numbers of female or African-American workers. It also states that the practice is most widespread in Texas, North Carolina and California - which is where Google is headquartered.\n\nThe protests outside the tech giant's offices reflect a growing anger over forced arbitration, which has already forced some big US companies to change course.\n\nEarlier this year both Uber and Lyft did away with mandatory arbitration and confidentiality agreements to settle sexual harassment claims.

If you are Ot\u00e1vio, then yes\n\nThe scene comes from the novela Orgulho e Paix\u00e3o (Pride and Passion), which recently finished its six-month run on Brazil's Globo television network. The lavishly funded drama had several radical twists on five of Jane Austen's novels, introducing sex, violence and intrigue.\n\n\"Taking inspiration from Jane Austen we created a new story with new characters,\" said artistic director Fred Mayrink. \"A new universe that speaks clearly to a Brazilian novela audience.\"\n\nSimilarities and disparities\n\nIndeed, the show ended up in dispute with regulators over explicit content in its 18:00 timeslot but it also won praise for the way it dealt with storylines about homosexuality and feminism.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWith 100 hours of airtime to fill, the soap opera blended the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, Northanger Abbey and Lady Susan. Writer Marcos Bernstein said he wished he could have integrated a sixth novel, Persuasion, but could not find a way.\n\nLike Pride and Prejudice, the central Benedito family has five daughters whom the matriarch Of\u00e9lia is keen to see married to appropriate men.\n\nAnd similarly, the lead character, Elisabeta, is a free spirit ahead of her time who is capable of charming or alienating suitors.\n\nBut then the disparities start. Only three of the daughters - Elisabeta, Jane and L\u00eddia - are from that novel. The other two - Mariana and Cec\u00edlia - are from Sense and Sensibility and Northanger Abbey. Elisabeta's best friend is Ema Cavalcante, from the novel Emma.\n\nImage copyright Courtesy Rede Globo Image caption Five daughters, but not the ones you may be expecting...\n\nImage copyright Courtesy Rede Globo Image caption With lavish costumes and settings, Globo has not skimped on this soap opera\n\n\"The plot of Pride and Prejudice is great but not particularly complex,\" Mr Bernstein said. \"Even a series adaptation takes up about eight hours. With the dynamic rhythm of a telenovela, things need to happen fast. If I had used only one book, it would have finished in three days.\"\n\nInstead of being set in the rarefied country houses of 19th-century England, Bernstein moved it forward 100 years to the era of wealthy coffee barons in the countryside of southern Brazil.\n\nImage copyright Rede Globo Image caption In the Brazilian version, Darcy goes down the mine\n\n\"It allowed us to have these characters who are the children of rich families that don't work and go to lavish parties,\" he said. \"At the time, female emancipation was already beginning.\"\n\nDeemed not suitable for children\n\nPride and Passion has scenes to make the original Mrs Bennet raise her eyebrows. In one, Darcy's friend Camilo (Charles Bingley from Pride and Prejudice) signs up for a clandestine fight club. In another, his mother Julieta overcomes the trauma of having been raped by her husband by having a night of passion with her new fiance.\n\nImage copyright Courtesy Rede Globo Image caption In a modern twist, Camilo signs up for a fight club\n\nSuch scenes led the ministry of justice to reject it as unsuitable for anyone under the age of 12.\n\nThere are also more subtle differences in the translation from the original English characters. Couples are seen kissing and touching each other, even bathing together in a waterfall.\n\n\"It isn't possible to make the characters as reserved or as restrained. Our story takes place 100 years later,\" said Mr Bernstein. \"It is more Downton Abbey than Jane Austen.\"\n\nBut a major plotline, when Elisabeta faces internal conflict when she meets a rich and aristocratic man called Darcy, will be familiar to any Jane Austen fan. \"We decided to try and introduce softer elements to his behaviour,\" said the actor Thiago Lacerda.\n\n\"People immediately understood there was some rigidity but our Darcy was a more Brazilian Darcy.\"\n\nPregnancy not a drama\n\nAnd the Brazilian Mrs Bennet is also more relaxed. Even when L\u00eddia gets pregnant, \"she sees it as something that will pass and as part of everyday life\", says actress Vera Holtz.\n\nThe show has also sought to push boundaries, in one scene featuring a precedent-setting gay kiss.

He believes Armstrong's character and resilience on the bike makes him an icon in cycling, regardless of the biggest scandal to hit the sport.\n\n\"I'm not condoning for one minute what Lance did,\" Wiggins said at an event before his official book tour this week.\n\n\"From the angle I wrote this book at, I couldn't not include him in it.\n\n\"In terms of how I feel, I'm not asking anyone to agree with me, but you can't change the way someone made you feel.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we're all human and if someone asks me now, I'm going to tell them what I think - I haven't got an agenda, I'm not in a team, and not everyone is going to like it.\"\n\nIn the book, Wiggins discusses the idea that Henri Desgrange, the 'Father of the Tour', created the Tour de France in 1903 envisaging a \"perfect winner\".\n\nWiggins believes Desgrange wanted \"the type of super-athlete who would not only defeat his opponents, but also whatever nature might throw at him\".\n\nHe added: \"It was an extreme vision of cycling, and a very French one. But it explains why Tour de France winners tended to be masochistic, obsessive and on occasion borderline sociopathic.\n\n\"Lance's story has been told ad infinitum, but for me one of the most interesting aspects is his transformation from classics rider to post-cancer Grand Tour rider.\n\n\"Taking out what happened subsequently, he won the sprints and time trials in yellow. He brought spectators back, and he was going across the fields after he crashed - and still winning. It's all those things combined which made him get through seven Tours without any real mishaps or retirements. Just getting through one is hard enough, so to do it for seven...\"\n\nWiggins, who refers to Armstrong in the book as \"the archetypal Tour de France cyclist\", added: \"If Desgrange could name the attributes to the perfect winner of the race, I think Lance would tick every box, and in personality as well with the character about him and all that. So that's how I describe it, and I don't think I'm out of place by saying that.\"", "Two goals from England striker Toni Duggan added to City's pain as they lost 8-0 on aggregate to Barcelona\n\nGlasgow City's season is over after they were knocked out of the Women's Champions League 8-0 on aggregate following a 3-0 defeat by Barcelona.\n\nIt was always going to be a tall order for the newly crowned 12-in-a-row Scottish champions, who were 5-0 down after the away leg of the last-16 tie.\n\nEngland cap Toni Duggan scored twice, with Alexia Putellas adding another.\n\nDomestic rivals Hibernian denied City a place in Sunday's Scottish Cup final, meaning their campaign is over.\n\n'Barca ease through the gears'\n\nGlasgow City manager Scott Booth had asked his side to \"embrace\" playing Barcelona, their reward for their efforts this season that has brought home a 12th consecutive league title.\n\nIn order to enjoy it, they needed to see far more of the ball than they did in the energy-sapping defeat in the first leg.

The forward chested down a cross, spun, and volleyed home.\n\nCity were in a battle to keep the score down. Duggan whistled a header wide as she searched for her hat-trick, and Alexander had to deny Putellas three times, who then also missed a sitter from close range.\n\nIt had been Duggan's night, but she was lucky to escape with just a warning when she kicked out at 16-year-old Carly Girasoli off the ball.\n\nAs hard as City tried, they could not make inroads at the other end of the pitch as their season ended on a frustrating note.\n\nGlasgow City did well to reach this stage of the Champions League where the players are professional\n\nBig ask for part-time Scots - analysis\n\nThis was a sore defeat for Glasgow City, but the result has to be put into perspective.\n\nSpanish champions Atletico Madrid, who knocked out Manchester City in the last round, themselves took a painful 10-0 loss on aggregate to Wolfsburg at this stage.

With Mr Gillum, they've opted for a different strategy.\n\nImage caption Supporters of Andrew Gillum listen during a recent debate between Mr Gillum and Ron DeSantis\n\n\"His message is that we can't continue to conduct Democratic politics the way the state has done,\" says Khari Pestaina, a graduate student who attended a Gillum rally at Florida International University.\n\n\"He's willing to fight, and that's what we need on the left, especially in a state like Florida, which owes so much to its people who put in the work day in and day out and don't get back much in return.\"\n\nWhat you need to know about mid-terms:\n\nIf he wins, Mr Gillum would be the first black governor of Florida and only the third elected in US history.

He frequently defends Mr Trump on cable news shows, his campaign website is chock full of pictures of the then-congressman and the president, and he aired a television advert that featured him teaching his daughter how to \"build a wall\" out of toy blocks and reading Mr Trump's The Art of the Deal to his infant son.\n\nAs the president likes to note, Mr DeSantis is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School and served as a lawyer in the US Navy, including a deployment as the legal adviser to a Seal commando team, where he was awarded a Bronze Star.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump and DeSantis embrace at a rally\n\n\"DeSantis has a pretty good record in Congress.

USA!\".\n\nOne sign warned that Mr Gillum would turn Florida into Venezuela - the socialist dictatorship that has become the bogeyman of many on the right, including the president himself.\n\nAnother said \"Fake News, Fake Bombs\" - a reference to what was then the ongoing rash of pipe bombs delivered to Democratic politicians and supporters across the US.

He's repeatedly called for Mr Trump's impeachment and removal from office - a fact that became a topic of animated discussion in the first candidate debate.\n\nElsewhere in the US\n\n\"You need to be able to work with the president, and Andrew can't do that,\" Mr DeSantis said. \"I think I will be better positioned to advance Florida's priorities because I have a productive relationship with the administration.\"\n\nGillum countered: \"This is not Russia. You shouldn't have to kiss the ring of the president of the United States for the president to see to the goodwill of the third largest state in all of America.\"\n\nEarly voting started in Florida more than a week ago, and both candidates are criss-crossing the state in public events and rallies. Time and again, the subject of the president comes up.\n\n\"Anybody who is a Trump supporter or follower who doesn't have the backbone to stand alone and speak out against his bizarre pronouncements and ideas, I don't want to be governor of any state, let alone Florida,\" says Carol Reiter, a retired schoolteacher who cast her ballot at a public library in the toney Miami Suburb of Coral Gables.\n\nShe says she likes Mr Gillum, but the opportunity to \"stick a finger in Trump's eye\" is just frosting on the cake.\n\nImage caption Carol Reiter\n\nPauline Sholk, a retiree who voted at a public library in Aventura - a strip-mall laden area north of Miami - calls Mr Trump a \"terrible person\".\n\n\"There's no ethics,\" she says. \"There's no honour. Anything that my parents taught me, he does not have.\"\n\nAt a DeSantis pro-Israel rally at a bagel shop near that Aventura library, film producer Hera Becker of Fort Lauderdale has a different view.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump is doing a fantastic job,\" she says. \"We need co-operation from the federal government, and I don't see Mayor Gillum being able to do that.\"\n\nStephen Fiske, who runs a pro-Israel political action committee, also loves Mr Trump's accomplishments - but has some reservations about the man.\n\nWhat are the issues at stake?\n\n\"Do I appreciate all the tweets, his demeanour, his mannerisms? No. However, the results are the results - and all the rest are noise.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, the president held a rally for Mr DeSantis and other Florida Republicans in the Gulf Coast town of Fort Meyer. He'll return to the state, up north in Pensacola, on Saturday - one of only two states in which he's making multiple stops.\n\nMost of the destinations in Mr Trump's last-minute national barnstorming tour are deeply conservative states where incumbent Democratic senators are on the ropes. Sharply divided Florida is different.\n\nFor the president, who refers to his private club in Palm Beach as the \"Southern White House\", Florida - and the governor's race in particular - is personal.\n\nCorruption and race\n\nOne of the ways the president has injected himself into the governor's election is by repeatedly calling Mr Gillum a \"thief\" and contrasting him with \"Harvard/Yale educated\" DeSantis. (Mr Gillum went to Florida A&M University).\n\nThe president is referencing allegations that as mayor Mr Gillum improperly took benefits from individuals with business before the Tallahassee government, including accepting a ticket to the Broadway musical Hamilton from an undercover FBI agent investigating corruption in the city.\n\nAt Mr Trump's Fort Myers rally, the crowd responded to mention of the Democrat by chanting \"lock him up!\"\n\nMr Gillum denies the accusations and says he is not under FBI investigation - and the president provided no evidence to support his accusation of theft.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nInstead, Mr Gillum and his supporters allege that Mr Trump's statements are thinly veiled racism.\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that race would become a factor in the governor's contest given the ground-breaking nature of Mr Gillum's campaign, but it became an issue long before the president's tweets.\n\nThe day after the Florida primary, Mr DeSantis said during a Fox News interview that Florida voters should not \"monkey up\" the state's economy by electing a Democrat who supports tax increases and a \"socialist agenda\".\n\nMr DeSantis also declined to return a campaign donation from a conservative activist who once called President Obama a racist slur. He also spoke at a 2012 conference organised by a different right-wing activist who said that blacks owe their freedom to white people.\n\n\"How the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?\" Mr DeSantis said when the subject was brought up during the second debate.\n\n\"I'm not calling Mr DeSantis a racist,\" Mr Gillum quickly countered. \"I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\nHistory in the making?\n\nBlack voters make up 16% of Florida's population - and their turnout could be pivotal to Mr Gillum's campaign. Black people support Democrats in overwhelming numbers and, in 2012, 74% participated in the presidential election. In 2016, that number dropped to 65% - a decline that contributed to Hillary Clinton's narrow defeat.\n\nIn mid-terms, the numbers are even lower. In 2014 42% voted, while in 2010 - a wave election for Republicans nationwide - 33% cast ballots.\n\nIn heavily black Miami-Dade County, early voting turnout is already up more than 160% from 2014, and Mr Gillum could be the reason. Recent opinion polls show Mr Gillum with a small but steady lead - playing in to the candidate's constant exhortations that his voters can prevail if they \"bring it home\".\n\nImage caption Jean Louis\n\nJean Louis walked out of the Aventura public library and into the balmy south Florida evening after casting his ballot for Mr Gillum last week.

an aesthetician and a graphic designer, say they were let go because they were white\n\nA Canadian human rights tribunal says seven resort employees were discriminated against for being white.\n\nThe Human Rights Tribunal in the westernmost province of British Columbia awarded them more than C$173,000 ($132,000, \u00a3102,000).\n\nResort owner Kin Wa Chan said he wanted to hire Chinese employees because he believed they were cheaper.\n\nThe tribunal found the seven staff were forced out in August 2016, and replaced with Chinese workers.\n\nTribunal chair Diana Juricevic ruled this qualified as discrimination based on race, which is against British Columbia's human rights code.\n\nShe dismissed the complaint of an eighth former employee.\n\n\"Over a period of months, Mr Chan repeatedly said that he wanted to replace Caucasian employees with ethnically Chinese employees to reduce labour costs,\" Ms Juricevic wrote in her decision, published last week.\n\nMr Chan bought the Spruce Hill Resort and Spa in rural British Columbia in 2015, and began extensive renovations in January the next year.\n\nThe resort operated at reduced capacity during the renovations, and so Mr Chan let many of the staff go.\n\nSeven of the employees that were kept on during the renovations ended up filing the human rights complaint, after they were fired the following summer or resigned in the course of several days because of what they described as a hostile work environment.\n\nThe largest award, of more than C$62,000, went to Clare Fast, who had worked for the resort for 20 years as fitness and human resources manager.\n\nMs Fast testified she heard Mr Chan say that he would not have to pay Chinese employees overtime.\n\nHer belief that she was fired and replaced with a Chinese employee was corroborated by her colleague and fellow complainant, resort bookkeeper Melonie Eva.\n\nIn a diary entry dated 20 July 2016, Ms Eva wrote that \"[Mr Chan] keeps saying he wants Chinese people\" and \"[Ms Stocks] and [Ms Fast] must go\".\n\nOn 3 August, Mr Chan told Ms Fast her human resources tasks would be given to a new employee, an ethnically Chinese student with no human resources experience. With her hours significantly reduced, Ms Fast asked to be laid off.\n\nIn addition to the findings of discrimination based on race, the tribunal also found that Mr Chan sexually harassed Ms Eva, the resort's bookkeeper, on a business trip to China to purchase supplies for the renovations.\n\nOn the trip, the tribunal heard Ms Eva was dismayed to find he had only booked one hotel room for the two of them.\n\nAccording to her testimony, she became upset and told Mr Chan that they were not sharing a room.\n\nShe remembers Mr Chan saying words to the effect \"relax\" and that \"in China, we do things the Chinese way\".\n\nShe told him she was married and would not share the room, and he booked her another one.\n\nHe said the single room was an attempt to save money, but the tribunal did not find his testimony credible.", "Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'?\n\nFrom the seats up for election to some context on how the vote typically goes - here's what you need to know ahead of the US mid-terms.", "South-east Asia already hosts a grand prix in Singapore\n\nVietnam will host a Formula 1 race on the streets of its capital Hanoi for the first time in 2020, government officials say.\n\nThe Hanoi People's Committee said the grand prix circuit will be unveiled at a gala next week.\n\nThe Vietnamese government said it had given its support for the race but there has been no confirmation from Formula 1's governing body, the FIA.\n\nFunding for the race will come from the private sector, and not the government.\n\nMai Tien Dung, chief of the government office, said in August: \"Hanoi authorities have asked people living in the planned area for their opinions about holding the race and they have all shown their support, to attract tourists.\"\n\nA Vietnamese grand prix would mark the first new entry on the F1 calendar since US group Liberty Media took over the running of the sport at the beginning of 2017.\n\nIt will be the third race to be established in south-east Asia following Singapore and Malaysia - the latter being scrapped following the 2017 race due to poor ticket sales.", "Image copyright Google Image caption The alarm was raised at the BP station on Stockiemuir Road, Bearsden, at about 00:10 on Tuesday\n\nAn investigation is under way after a petrol station was deliberately set on fire in East Dunbartonshire.\n\nPolice Scotland said only a rapid response from firefighters prevented the flames spreading to the pumps at the BP station on Stockiemuir Road, Bearsden.\n\nThe alarm was raised at about 00:10 on Tuesday and the building was extensively damaged.\n\nA force spokeswoman said the incident was being treated as wilful.\n\n'Dangerous and reckless'\n\nDet Con Craig Paterson said: \"This was a dangerous and reckless incident and thankfully emergency services were able to attend to the fire quickly to stop it spreading to the petrol pumps area.\n\n\"From inquiries carried out so far it appears that several vehicles passed by the scene around the time of the incident, and the suspect will have been in full view at the rear of the building.\n\n\"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area just after midnight on Tuesday and may have noticed any persons acting suspicious, or anything at all out of the ordinary, to please get in touch.\"\n\nHe also urged any motorists with dashcams to check their footage in case they had captured anything which could be significant.", "Queens Park Rangers currently train in nearby Harlington, near Heathrow Airport\n\nQPR hope to begin work on the Warren Farm sports ground development, after the Supreme Court rejected attempts to overturn planning permission.\n\nHanwell Community Forum had sought permission to appeal against the planning permission, and whether the council had acted appropriately.\n\nThe High Court and Court of Appeal had previously confirmed as such.\n\nThis dispute has been a long-running affair, as Rangers had initially hoped to move in for the 2013-14 season.\n\n\"We're delighted that all legal avenues to frustrate this process have now been exhausted,\" QPR chief executive officer Lee Hoos said.\n\n\"A new training ground, which brings together the first team and the academy, is an important part of a strategic long-term plan for the club.\n\n\"The delays have been very frustrating.

It's all a process of negotiation and agreement, which is rather complicated.\n\nAt the top of the tree, the Home Office has a list of national threats - such as counter-terrorism (its budget is ring-fenced) - but there's no priority-setting as such.\n\nIn fact, the Home Office's role has gone from clear target setting during the Tony Blair government years to handing a lot of this to locally elected police and crime commissioners (PCC).\n\nThe PCCs agree local priorities with the chief constables they appoint - they produce a weighty document called a police and crime plan - and then theoretically hold them to account for delivering them.\n\nHowever - and this is the twist - the Home Office also controls a great deal of the policing budget. So, given that it has had cut budgets since 2010, chiefs wonder whether ministers should be a little clearer about what exactly they want forces to do less of.\n\nHas 'core' policing decreased?\n\nPolice officers, in England and Wales, have been cut by about 21,000, or 15%, since 2010.\n\nHistorically speaking, using the most reliable measure, crime has been largely falling since the 1990s - but there are now increases in specific types of offences, such as violent crime.\n\nCrime statistics are often misreported - and it doesn't help that there are questions over how good the police are themselves at recording what they hear about.\n\nBut other measures are useful.\n\nFor instance, the number of arrests has been falling. and while this began in 2006, when crime was also falling, it has continued during a period of police recording crime rising.\n\nFigures gathered by the BBC show that the proportion of crimes that led to a charge, in four key areas - violence, sexual offences, robbery and drugs - are all down.\n\nNow, on the face of it, this looks like evidence of the police struggling to get on top of things. But there are hints here and there of what looks like reprioritisation.\n\nPenalty Notices for Disorder (PND) are a local policing tool. Neighbourhood officers issue small fines to people involved in low-level anti-social nuisance and offending in the hope of nipping a minor problem in the bud.\n\nIn 2010, police issued almost 141,000 PNDs. But last year, only 26,000 were issued - an 82% fall in their use.\n\nCannabis prosecutions have also fallen over the past decade - from 18,000 to 15,000 - despite the drug being reclassified as more harmful (from a Class C drug, to a Class B, in 2008).\n\nAre we measuring police forces on their priorities?\n\nNot really - but that's not to say they don't get measured in other ways. The unpronounceable HMICFRS - or Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services - is the national watchdog for policing. It looks at how individual forces are doing in protecting people, by scrutinising how police chiefs allocated their resources.\n\nIt has frequently raised questions about what should be part of the policing \"front line\" and has challenged forces to think of ways of to improve public trust.\n\nWhat about misogyny?\n\nThis is where things get complicated. There has been an increasing focus in recent years on hate crimes that have long gone under-reported. Police chiefs began debating last summer whether they should add misogyny to the list of hate crimes, which currently covers racism and religious hate crime, among others.\n\nNow, police officers regularly record incidents that later turn out not to be a crime.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Police recorded hate crimes have increased in recent years\n\nTwo years ago, Nottinghamshire Police began recording misogyny to see if it would help them keep women safe. This is part of a broader rethink suggesting police should always be focused on \"reducing harm\".\n\nBut the problem is, being a sexist pig, or worse, is not a crime, unless it results in threats or violence.\n\nSo, Sara Thornton's point was to question whether police should spend time recording incidents that are not crimes, when there are defined crimes such as burglary that need investigating.\n\nSue Fish, the former Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire, says she is disappointed at how the misogyny issue is being debated.\n\nShe told the BBC that in most of the misogyny incidents her force had investigated after the initiative had been launched, officers had found a crime had been committed.\n\nMinister of State for Security Ben Wallace told the BBC: \"What is really key is it's about harm. What harm is it causing you, your family and your community? And different crimes cause different harm in different parts of the country. And Sara Thornton is absolutely right that the priorities should be set by the police leaders and the locally elected police and crime commissioners.\"\n\nCan police ignore crimes?\n\nThis is a grey area. Police regularly receive reports of what looks to the member of public like a crime, feels like a crime - but then an officer tells them no crime has occurred.\n\nA classic example would be someone coming home and suspecting a would-be burglar has tried, and failed, to prise open a modern secure window.\n\nAnd even when an investigation is possible, less than 8% of crimes result in a charge or court summons.\n\nAlmost half of investigations are dropped because no suspect can be identified.\n\nBut, interestingly, there are other cases dropped where the police have had a good sense of what happened.\n\nOne in 10 investigations is ended with the \"support\" of the victim after officers explain the evidential problems of landing a conviction. But a further 20% are dropped despite opposition from victims.\n\nCould you sue your neighbourhood police for failing to find the burglar who broke into your shed because they're too busy looking into someone being sexist on social media? Not at all.\n\nThere is a long-standing legal principle that the police cannot be sued for negligence - although in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court recently declared that forces could face claims for breaches of human rights if they botched investigations into the most serious of crimes.\n\nThat was a sign of the law giving chief constables a very clear sign of where their priorities should lie: the crimes that cause the most harm - and then everything else.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions", "Top (right) with his father Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha during Leicester City's Premier League trophy parade\n\nWhen Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's King Power corporation held a news conference in 2010 to confirm it was taking over Leicester City from previous owner Milan Mandaric, his son Aiyawatt 'Top' Srivaddhanaprabha was there at his side.\n\nThe clearly nervous father and son sat at a table at what was then the Walkers Stadium, a glass of water their only distraction.\n\nI could empathise with their nervousness as the announcement was my first big press conference as a local radio reporter.\n\nThe audience of Leicester supporters seemed apprehensive too. The Foxes hadn't long since been on the brink of extinction, having come out of administration in 2003.\n\nNow the Foxes' prospective new chairman after his father's shocking death in Saturday's helicopter crash, Top was then a fresh-faced 25-year-old.\n\nRespectfully, and in broken English, he added to some of his father's answers to the questions, discussing their hopes and dreams for the club, and offering some insight into the duty free empire in Thailand that would now be funding the Foxes.\n\nLater, he told me the reason he decided Leicester was the club he'd like his father to invest in was that as a football-mad youngster he had travelled to England to watch a game in 1997.\n\nThat game was the League Cup final between Leicester City and Middlesbrough - a Boro team containing Nigel Pearson, who would later manage the East Midlands club. Leicester won the trophy after a replay and Top fell in love with the Foxes.\n\nTop and his father Vichai bought Leicester City in 2010\n\nHe and his father invested heavily in the club, not just financially but with time and effort too. They had made their billions as retail experts and the Leicester City shop has seen a few revamps under their ownership.\n\nWhen they opened a Foxes shop in Bangkok I was able to attend, having travelled out for a friendly between Leicester and the Thai national team.\n\nOn the day of the opening there was a media call, and I turned up wondering who would care that what was then a Championship club had a shop in the Thai capital. How wrong I was. There were photographers by the dozen and the interviews took an age to get through.\n\nI was back in Bangkok in 2012, running the city's marathon to raise money for charity. Top not only donated \u00a31,000, he also offered a room in the King Power hotel and sent a car to take me to the start line at 3am and back afterwards. He also arranged for a meal for me afterwards. He didn't need to do that.\n\nWarm and incredibly kind, Top also worked hard to learn from his father's business acumen and sporting involvement - whether it be their polo teams or their multimillion pound horse racing investments under Newbury-based trainer Andrew Balding.\n\nHe's worked his way up into the senior management of King Power, where he now takes care of the enormous operation in Thailand.\n\nFor Foxes fans, the question now will be whether he shares his late father's vision for the club.\n\nThe passion seems to be there. I remember him dealing with a question about his dedication to the football club in 2010 - I asked where he hoped to be in five years and he answered \"celebrating my 30th birthday at the stadium\".\n\nA fine soundbite, perhaps, and certainly the nervous 25-year-old has grown into an accomplished media performer, but I don't think the football obsessed boy who watched that Wembley final all those years ago has changed all that much.\n\nIn his tribute to his late father, Top said: \"He has left me a legacy to continue and I will do everything I can to carry on his big visions and dreams.\"\n\nThose visions, I expect, include creating the \u00a3100m training ground for which they already have planning permission and improving the first team so that they are again competitive at the top end of the table.\n\nGiven the minor miracle already accomplished in turning the club into the Premier League's unlikeliest champions, I would put nothing past them.", "Antonio Conte has won four league titles in five years in charge of Europe's top clubs - having previously managed Arezzo, Bari, Atalanta and Siena\n\nAntonio Conte is \"reluctant\" to become Real Madrid boss, with the club unlikely to meet his demands, according to former club president Ramon Calderon.\n\nThe former Chelsea manager has been linked with the European champions - who sacked Julen Lopetegui after Sunday's 5-1 defeat by Barcelona.\n\n\"He's asked for three years and to come in with five people and have hands free for signings and transfers,\" Calderon told BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily Euro Leagues Show.\n\n\"But that's something the president [Florentino Perez] isn't willing to accept.\"\n\nCalderon, who was Real president from 2006 to 2009, does not think the former Juventus and Italy boss would be a popular choice.\n\nConte was sacked by Chelsea in July - a year after leading them to the Premier League and FA Cup double. He had previously won Serie A in each of his three years in charge of Juventus.\n\nBut Calderon said: \"I don't think Antonio Conte will be the coach the Bernabeu is expecting. He's like Jose Mourinho - a defensive coach with normally three centre-backs playing counter-attacking football.\n\n\"That's not what Real Madrid expect to see. The president tried this before with Mourinho. They didn't win the Champions League and he left the club in a bad situation.\"\n\nReal Madrid are currently ninth in La Liga after four defeats in their opening 10 league games under former Spain boss Lopetegui, who lasted less than five months in the job.\n\nWenger? Martinez? Who else could take over?\n\nBelgium boss Roberto Martinez (pictured with Real keeper Thibaut Courtois) is now the second favourite with bookmakers behind Santiago Solari\n\nReal's caretaker boss is reserve-team coach Santiago Solari, a former Real player.\n\nHis promotion is similar to that of Zinedine Zidane in 2016, although the Frenchman stepped up from the reserve team straight into the Real coach's role on a permanent basis, and went on to lead them to a record three consecutive Champions Leagues before stepping down this summer.\n\n\"Nobody knows\" whether former Argentina winger Solari, 42, will end up taking permanent charge, according to Calderon.\n\nThe ex-president says his first choice would be Belgium boss Roberto Martinez, the former Swansea, Wigan and Everton manager, or Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nBut he thinks Manchester United manager Mourinho, Real's boss from 2010 to 2013, would be Perez's pick if he was available.\n\n\"I'd like Roberto Martinez but he has an existing contract with Belgium. Pochettino also has one with Tottenham,\" Calderon said.\n\n\"The president has got in touch with many people like Martinez, Pochettino, Conte, Mourinho.\n\n\"Mourinho is the only coach that the president has respected or backed even though he did many wrong things in my opinion. He is a coach who is always blaming others for his failures.\n\n\"If Mourinho was free now, he'd be here - you can be completely sure. Conte has been the one to be in the crosshairs of the president but he knows what happens here. He's reluctant.\"\n\nCalderon does not think Arsene Wenger, who stepped down this summer after 22 years as Arsenal boss, would be interested in taking over because of the way the president runs the club.\n\n\"He interferes in the line-up,\" said Calderon of Perez - a man he frequently criticises publicly.\n\n\"He decides the signings because of his whims. There's no football director.\n\n\"He's remodelling the stadium and spending 600m euros in doing that. Nobody was complaining about the stadium. That's why we cannot sign any players - no big players are going to come in for less than 200m euros these days.\n\n\"Wenger could be another contender but he works in long-term planning and that's not the case at Real Madrid now.\"\n\nWhat have previous successful managers had in common?\n\nReal Madrid have won six Champions League titles this century - in 2000 and 2002 under Vicente del Bosque, 2014 with Carlo Ancelotti, and for the last three years under Zidane.\n\nAll three played for their respective countries and won top league titles during their playing career.\n\nThe last two managers - bar Lopetegui - to not win the Champions League, Mourinho and Rafael Benitez, did not have stellar playing careers.\n\n\"We've won the last six Champions Leagues with coaches like Del Bosque, Ancelotti and Zidane - coaches that were top players and knew what it was like to be in a dressing room full of stars because they were one of them,\" said Calderon.\n\n\"So what they did was not to be very complacent with players but motivate them. They would not be protagonists and would stay in the background. [The key is] to motivate them and put out the fire when the egos are appearing in the dressing room. Sometimes when you have very big, top players you need to work in a different way.\n\n\"That didn't happen with Mourinho or Benitez, it's not a matter of a firm hand. The players know what to do on the pitch.\"", "Image caption Michelle Ballantyne said asylum seekers should be allowed to make a \"meaningful contribution\"\n\nScottish Conservative MSPs have joined other parties in urging the UK government to let asylum seekers work.\n\nAt present, asylum seekers are not normally allowed to work while waiting for their applications to be decided.\n\nMSPs called on ministers to relax the rules and allow them to take jobs.\n\nTory member Michelle Ballantyne said she had written to the home secretary arguing that those seeking refuge should have the opportunity to make a \"meaningful contribution\".\n\nThe UK government has said it is \"listening carefully\" to the \"complex arguments\" on the subject.\n\nUnder present rules, asylum seekers are only allowed to work if they have waited more than a year for a decision on their application, and are able to fill a role on the official \"shortage occupation\" list.\n\nMSPs were debating a motion which called for changes to asylum policy to create a \"long term sustainable solution that does not leave people destitute or homeless at the end of the asylum process\".\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives said they had appealed to the Conservative-run UK government to relax rules to let asylum seekers work.\n\nMs Ballantyne told MSPs: \"During the time that it takes to go through the process of seeking asylum, which can be years, we need to ensure that we don't put people's lives on hold, and we don't waste the skills that people have, or prevent them from developing as people.\n\n\"If we don't ensure that asylum seekers have the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to their own lives, as well as their host nation, we do everyone a disservice.\n\n\"While I appreciate that asylum seekers can currently engage in voluntary work, if we really want to ensure that individuals are able to prosper both here, and should they ever wish to return to their countries, the prospect of employment is essential.\"\n\nThe move was welcomed by MSPs from other parties, who were critical of the UK's asylum policy during the Holyrood debate.\n\nCommunities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the Scottish government's key principle was one of \"integration from day one\".\n\nShe said: \"This means that people should be welcomed and supported to integrate from day one, not just when refugee status and leave to remain have been granted.\n\n\"People seeking asylum have to navigate a complex and often frustrating system sometimes over many years before they receive refugee status and are able to get on with their lives.\n\n\"That is often at great cost to their mental health and future prospects.\"\n\n'Complex arguments'\n\nIn a debate at Westminster in October, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said she was \"listening carefully to the complex arguments about permitting asylum seekers to work\".\n\nShe said there was a \"balance to be struck\", and that current policy \"seeks to protect the resident labour market and ensure that any employment meets our needs for skilled labour\".\n\nBut she said there was \"much merit\" in the argument that asylum seekers should be allowed to work, saying she was \"receptive to the views and evidence presented to me on the right to work\".", "Image copyright Google Image caption Helen Evans worked at Llanishen Fach school\n\nA primary

Expectations have changed after six defeats in their last seven matches.\n\nThis autumn, facing South Africa, New Zealand, Japan and Australia, just two wins from four Tests would be a decent result for England.\n\nCoach Eddie Jones has downplayed the importance of the results, claiming that England don't need to win any of their autumn internationals.\n\nAnd as odd as it may sound, I can see what he means.\n\nIf they were to lose to all three of the southern hemisphere big beasts, but produce really good performances and lose with narrow points margins, then there is not masses to be concerned about.\n\nEngland would be close to beating those sides, with another 10 months to fine-tune and close the gap before Japan 2019.\n\nIf England get hammered though and the performances are diabolical, there will be huge ramifications.\n\nEngland will have gone backwards and that falls on Eddie and his team not doing a great job either coaching or selecting.\n\nThe Rugby Football Union may rethink their commitment to the Australian, even this close to the World Cup. But I don't think that situation will arise. England at home will raise their game and find what they have been missing. They have to.\n\nJones still waiting on Tuilagi\n\nEddie Jones debriefs Manu Tuilagi after the Leicester centre's one and only appearance during the Australian's England reign\n\nBefore he even got the job, Jones was talking about England's need to return to their traditional strengths of set-piece, defence and a 'bulldog spirit' after their dismal 2015 World Cup campaign.\n\nA fit Manu Tuilagi would also have been a key part of his plans.\n\nInstead the Leicester centre has been limited to just 17 minutes of action under Jones - coming on late in the win over Wales back in March 2016 - as he has struggled with a string of injuries.\n\nThe 27-year-old was primed for a comeback appearance off the bench this weekend against South Africa but has pulled out with a strain.\n\n'10-12-13' starts under Eddie Jones Fly-half Inside centre Outside centre Source: Russ Petty/ESPN George Ford (28) Owen Farrell (24) Jonathan Joseph (21) Owen Farrell (2) Luther Burrell (2) Henry Slade (6) Danny Cipriani (1) Alex Lozowski (2) Ben Te'o (3)\n\nSaturday's line-up v South Africa Fly-half Inside centre Outside centre Owen Farrell Ben Te'o Henry Slade\n\nJones had already flipped to a strategy that I believe he always wanted for his backline anyway.\n\nPreviously during Jones' reign, England have favoured a double-playmaker pivot with George Ford at fly-half and Owen Farrell at inside centre\n\nWhile they were winning, it was hard to change, especially with the powerful Ben Te'o's own fitness and form fitful.\n\nWith the gainline-breaking power of both Te'o and Tuilagi initially in the squad to face the Springboks however, Jones has switched Farrell inside to 10 and to make way for the heavy-duty ball carrying option.\n\nIt was a similarly direct style that overhauled South Africa in the third Test in Cape Town in the summer.\n\nThere, in wet conditions, they played at their own pace, squeezing the Springboks with possession and territory, and keeping the ball in close quarters more.\n\nIt is less exciting perhaps, but more effective. And having Farrell at fly-half to orchestrate things is only a benefit.\n\nJones not to blame for cap-light back-ups\n\nThere are some stark statistics around the starting XV for Saturday.\n\nA back row of Brad Shields, Tom Curry and Mark Wilson has a total of 10 caps between them.\n\nTom Curry and Brad Shields are part of an inexperienced England back row\n\nProp Kyle Sinckler will be making only his fifth Test start. The man on the opposite side of the front row - Alec Hepburn - will be making his first.\n\nShould Jones' fall-back options be so short of experience? Has he missed the chance to develop his second-string players by exposing them to more Test match action?\n\nAt international level, that is not a fair criticism.\n\nYou have to pick your best team every time you go out. You might get the odd match in an autumn series where you put out a side with less experienced players to give them the opportunity, but those chances are few and far between.\n\nThis current situation has been forced by the unforeseen absences of the likes of Billy and Mako Vunipola, Chris Robshaw and Joe Marler.\n\nThere has been considerable change off the field as well with John Mitchell coming in as a new defence coach and Australian Scott Wisemantel continuing in the attack role that he picked up in the summer.\n\nJohn Mitchell alongside Roger Uttley (left) and Sir Clive Woodward (right) during England's 76-0 defeat by Australia in Brisbane in 1998\n\nThat backroom churn can be disruptive with a change in systems, but it can also be galvanising and challenge the players in new ways.\n\nIt is Mitchell's second spell with England. He previously arrived as an assistant to Sir Clive Woodward in 1997 when I was part of the squad.\n\nHe was a great addition, bringing that breakdown nous to an England forward pack that was used to mauling. The Kiwi mentality around rucks is hard, but also smart.\n\nThey blew people out of the way, but did not over-commit numbers or leave themselves exposed to the counter-ruck.\n\nThe know-how that he added was a key part of what made the England forwards so good in the run-up to the 2003 World Cup.\n\nIf Carling made captains...\n\nAppointed as captain at just 22, Carling quickly became one of the most famous faces of English rugby\n\nOne of my former England captains was announced as another addition to the England set-up this week.\n\nWill Carling will work as a leadership mentor with the team.\n\nSomeone like 21-year-old Bath back rower Zach Mercer was not even born when Will played his last Test, but I still think he can bring something unique to the squad.\n\nWhile the constant social media white noise is not something that we had to deal with, Will played rugby under the most intense scrutiny. He was often on the front pages as well as the back with his personal life and his 1995 stand against the RFU.\n\nHe was made captain at the age of 22 and led a dressing room containing a fair few alpha male characters to three Grand Slams.\n\nAfter retiring he helped companies with their leadership and management cultures and I'm sure that has added to his experience.\n\nEngland's autumn internationals All matches at Twickenham 3 November South Africa 10 November New Zealand 17 November Japan 24 November Australia\n\nWill can potentially reinforce the current squad's mental resilience and hardness, but his biggest challenge will be getting the trust of the players.\n\nAnd a lot of that depends on how he is introduced to the squad and his role is explained.\n\nAnd a lot of that, as with everything else this autumn, will depend on Jones.\n\nJeremy Guscott was speaking to BBC Sport's Mike Henson.", "Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Macedonia's Deputy Prime Minister Bujar Osmani was on board the historic flight\n\nThe first direct commercial flight between Greece and Macedonia in 12 years took off on Thursday evening.\n\nThe Olympic Air flight departed the Greek capital Athens at 18:40 local time (16:40 GMT) for Macedonia's capital Skopje.\n\nThe launch of the twice-weekly service follows a deal between the two nations to end a 27-year name dispute.\n\nMacedonia's deputy prime minister - who was in Greece for talks - was on board the historic flight.\n\nBujar Osmani had travelled to Athens in the wake of the agreement, in which Macedonia said it would formally change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia to assuage Greek fears about claims on its northern region with the same name.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, Mr Osmani said that Greece had become \"our greatest ally\" and that the \"re-establishment of the air corridor\" was a symbol of improved relations.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @Bujar_O After more than 10 years, we are witnessing the re-establishment of the air corridor between Skopje & Athens.

Scrap free licence fees for over 75s\n\nThe report estimates that residual costs to shut down the concession would cost \u00a372 million - or 10% of the cost of continuing with it.\n\nWhen the government introduced the free licence fee for over 75s in 2000, it was argued the benefits would (largely) go to poorer households. However, that argument has weakened with the improvement in living standards for the over-75s.\n\n2. Replace with a 50% concession for all over-75 households\n\nA 50% concession is in line with the current concession offered to those with visual impairments.\n\nIt estimates the cost to the BBC would be around \u00a3400 million in 2021/22, which is 56% of the cost of reinstating the current concession - the extra 6% is due to admin.\n\n3. Increase the age threshold for eligibility\n\nRaise age threshold to 77\n\nAligns with increased longevity and reforms to state pension age but retains an arbitrary threshold.\n\nThe report estimates that it would cost \u00a3645 million which is 87% of the cost of reinstating the current concession in 2021/22.\n\nThey note the vast majority of households containing someone older than 75 also contain someone over the age of 77 so relatively few households would lose out.\n\nRaise age threshold to 80\n\nThis would align with other pensioner benefits that begin at 80 such as the over-80s increase in winter fuel payments.\n\nThe estimated cost is \u00a3481 million - that's 65% of the cost of reinstating the current situation.\n\nPeople over the age of 80 are more likely to live alone so this could help to target the concession at those who are most reliant on television for company.\n\n4. Means-test eligibility for the concession\n\nLink free TV licences to over-75s who get pension credit\n\nPension credit is a government-defined measure of need - so this would improve targeting of those at need of a free TV licence.\n\nIt's estimated this would cost \u00a3209 million or 28% of the cost of keeping the current concession.\n\nLink free TV licences to anyone receiving pension credit regardless of age\n\nImproves targeting and would align with other benefits.\n\nThe estimated cost to the BBC is \u00a3327 million - 44% as much as that of reinstating the current concession.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It says that during the 13-week trial it saw a rise in the number of passengers catching services earlier in the day.\n\nHowever the latest figures from the rail regulator suggest the company needs to improve its punctuality. In the first quarter of 2018, 85% of its trains arrived on time.\n\nNo more peak fares on Friday evenings is good news for passengers but politically-speaking this is a sensitive moment for the rail industry as a whole and many will feel that \u00a386.90 (the off-peak fare) is a fairer price for travelling 160 miles (London to Manchester) on a train.\n\n\"Rather than everyone waiting for the first off-peak train on Friday evening, people can now travel whenever's convenient for them,\" said Virgin Train's commercial director Sarah Copley.\n\n\"This change means we've been able to reduce congestion, whilst helping people save money and make an earlier start to their weekends.\"\n\nThe Rail Delivery Group, which represents the railway, told the BBC that it ran a national consultation in the summer in order to improve rail fare regulations.\n\n\"This is welcome news for Virgin Trains customers.

Ally Miller, a 22-year-old debutant on the open-side flank, 20 and 21-year-old locks Jamie Hodgson and Callum Hunter-Hill all stepped up.\n\nAnd fortunately for Richard Cockerill, he could still call upon Mata, his colossus and the focal point for so much of Edinburgh's play. The monstrous Fijian added another 24 carries - and 84m - to his remarkable league-best haul of 100.\n\nThe behemoth got Edinburgh going in the eighth minute when he rumbled and spun over from a line-out drive, Hickey converting.\n\nWith Scarlets' first attack, they drew level. Kieron Fonotia swerved past Hickey and a smart off-load released Williams, who beat Brown to score. Dan Jones slotted the conversion.\n\nIn between the tries, Scotland call-up Blade Thomson was carried from the field after his head struck the knee of Edinburgh lock Callum Hunter-Hill. It looked like the big New Zealander had been knocked out. A blow for Scarlets and for Gregor Townsend, the Scotland head coach.\n\nScotland call-up Blade Thomson was carried from the field after being struck in the head in a tackle\n\nWhen the lengthy delay ended, Edinburgh revved again. They thundered into rucks, blasting Scarlets jackalers off the ball, but had to rattle through a mountain of phases to breach the whitewash.\n\nThey blew one opportunity when Pyrgos forced a pass, but Mata, as ever, was cannier on the ball. The titan punctured the line, was hauled down a metre or so short, and sent a cleverly delayed off-load out to Brown who scurried in. Hickey's conversion attempt was wide.\n\nBrown, the winger playing just his second competitive game of 2018, went over again with 29 minutes gone after another relentless period of attack and a beautiful floated ball from Pyrgos. Hickey, once more, was off-target from wide on the right.\n\nWith a minute of the half remaining, a dull Edinburgh infringement allowed Scarlets to mount their second serious attack and score their second try. A sumptuous Jones grubber was perfectly weighted for the searing Asquith to gather and score, the fly-half converting to make it 17-14.\n\nEdinburgh had been utterly dominant, but the Scarlets were ruthless. The hosts played with a vicious tempo to their attack, earned over 70% of the possession and territory, scored three tries, yet led by only three at the break. A pitiful and maddening return for their supremacy.\n\nEdinburgh falter but recover well\n\nThey suffered again after the interval, Scarlets powering into the home 22 and pinning Edinburgh there for an age. Raid followed raid. Penalty followed penalty. At the third successive Edinburgh transgression, Hickey was sent to the bin. Scarlets opted for a scrummage and McNicholl stepped Juan Pablo Socino to race home. Jones converted and the visitors led for the first time.\n\nThe Edinburgh response was good, particularly since it came while reduced in number. They kicked a penalty to the corner, and after a few drives, Schoeman blasted over for the bonus-point score. Socino converted.\n\nThe contest ebbed and flowed in the final quarter as both teams sought a knockout blow. Error followed infringement. Ross Ford, the 34-year-old Scotland hooker, made a sensational cover tackle on Fonotia as the centre threatened to break clear up the left flank.\n\nIt was Edinburgh who prevailed. In the final five minutes, the forwards won a penalty, Hickey booted them into the corner, and Simon Gardiner was binned for illegally infiltrating the maul. A second line-out drive was suspiciously halted short when heading for the line at a rate of knots. But Mata's innovative feint-and-leap finish put the game to bed.

Drawing a parallel between the human genome project and the endeavour to have a the first human walk on the Moon, Prof Lewin said that while the specific challenges in each were very different, they had one key thing in common: \"An investment in basic science without knowing exactly where it would lead.\" Conservation: To protect endangered species from threats like climate change, scientists want to understand the genetic code that underlies their adaptations to their environment. Species of particular conservation interest, such as the golden eagle, have already been targeted for genome sequencing. Human welfare: Pinpointing the code for \"useful traits\" could reveal, for example, medicinal properties embedded in an organism's DNA or ways to protect vital crop species from drought and disease.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nThe price tag on an \"inventory of life\" is a projected US$4.7bn (\u00a33.6bn), which, according to the project leaders, will come from charities and governments around the world.

When you start an engine up, sometimes you get some vapour or something coming out.\"\n\nThe experts also agreed that the take-off seemed normal.\n\n\"He takes off, goes up and hovers above the stadium, because then he has got to assess which way the wind is coming and wind speed and everything else,\" said Mr Bray.\n\n\"He's getting to a position where he can see where he's going to go. As soon as he's above the top of the stadium roof there could be a change in wind speed or wind direction, because he's sheltered inside the stadium.\"\n\nMr Rowlands said: \"It all looks very normal in terms of a departure.\"\n\nAt what point did the flight go wrong?\n\nImage caption The helicopter pictured after it turned above the King Power Stadium\n\nThe experts said the flight appeared to go wrong once the helicopter was above the stadium.\n\n\"He climbs up to whatever height he has specified for himself, then starts to transition and move forward, and get a little bit of air speed, but somewhere along the line there, things go wrong very quickly,\" said Mr Rowlands.\n\nThe aircraft starts rotating and can be seen spinning as it descends to the ground.\n\nMr Bray noted that there was no change in the engine sound, which he said meant it was under power throughout the short flight.\n\n\"He goes up and sticks his nose up and has a look around and reads his instruments and starts the helicopter on its course,\" said Mr Bray.\n\n\"It turns three-quarters to us. That's going to be the direction of travel. Then he's going up even further. Then he turns again. At that point something goes horribly wrong.\n\n\"He's now rotating but you can still hear the engine going, so it was still under power.\n\n\"Listening to it, there's no change in the engine sound.

But it would have to be a fairly large drone; I don't think a small domestic one would do it.\n\n\"I would say sabotage cannot be ruled out.\"\n\nMr Bray said a mechanical fault was also possible, but he believes this is unlikely.\n\n\"These things are checked to the nth degree and any professional pilot will want to make sure his aircraft is safe,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously, they are putting their own lives at risk.\n\n\"It's very, very weird.\"\n\nWhat could the pilot have done?\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Eric Swaffer had more than 20 years of flying experience\n\nMr Bray said there was \"absolutely nothing the pilot can do\" once there was no working tail rotor to stabilise a helicopter.\n\nHowever, Mr Rowlands said the pilot would in theory have had a degree of control.\n\n\"You haven't really got it in the yawing plane [rotating], you've got it in roll and pitch, which are the three axes that an aircraft move in,\" he said.\n\n\"The one thing that he would have had control of more than anything else was his rate of descent and when he was going to descend.\n\n\"When you get a tail rotor drive failure without any forward air speed, the only option you've got is to make the best emergency engines-off landing that you can, but this guy really has very little time to do all that.\"\n\nHe presumes the pilot would have practised this kind of emergency in simulators.\n\n\"Certainly in the military you would practise tail rotor drive failures in a simulator almost constantly, and because it's an emergency that requires such an immediate reaction it's the kind of thing that gets ingrained and emblazoned on every operator's mind,\" he said.\n\n\"You enter this autorotative state which is a bit like a sycamore seed spinning to the ground, you are using that lift that's left in the blades to do that.\"\n\nHowever, he admitted that the probability of surviving a tail rotor failure was \"quite low\".\n\n\"Talking through it versus the reality of the real world, there's obviously an incredible amount of forces going on. The aircraft is spinning around all over the shop, you've obviously got a lot of things going on, it's incredibly disorientating.\n\n\"Thankfully, they are not the kind of things that happen often and I certainly don't have any personal first-hand experience of a real one, and I don't know anybody who does.\n\n\"It's not a normal circumstance.

These are used as sun protection factors as they absorb ultraviolet light.\n\nHowever, they are believed to make coral more susceptible to bleaching. Research published in 2015 showed that the oxybenzone could stunt the growth of baby corals and was toxic to several different coral species in laboratory tests.\n\n\"Oxybenxzone is probably the baddest actor out of the 10 chemicals that have been banned,\" said Dr Craig Downs, an expert on the impacts of sunscreens on marine life.\n\n\"It causes corals to bleach at lower temperatures, and it reduces their resilience to climate change.\"\n\nDr Downs says that when there's a disastrous event like mass coral bleaching, reefs should recover over the following years. That has not been happening in many parts of the world.\n\nImage copyright Global_Pics Image caption A diver among the corals in Palau\n\n\"Life doesn't scramble back in where there are tourists,\" said Dr Downs. \"The juvenile phase of coral are more susceptible to chemical pollution than adults. That's why we see these areas not coming back.\"\n\n\"They are coral reef zombies. Only the adults are left and it's only a matter of time before they go.\"\n\nHow much of a threat does sunscreen pose?\n\nResearchers say that the biggest threat to coral reefs is climate change, with estimates that 90% of reefs will succumb to rising temperatures by 2050. The second biggest threat is the suffocating threat posed by algal blooms, triggered by the runoff of nutrients from sewage and farming. Sunscreen is now seen as one of a number of other, lesser threats including ocean acidification.\n\nImage copyright Global_Pics Image caption Sunscreen has already been banned at Jellyfish Lake in Palau\n\nHow widely used are the banned sunscreen chemicals?\n\nIt has been estimated that between 6-14,000 tonnes of sunscreen wash off people and go into reef areas every year. Researchers say that several thousand sun protection products contain the two most threatening chemicals.\n\nFive years ago it was estimated to be in around 75% of products. Experts now say it's found in about half of creams and lotions.\n\nRight now the US Congress is looking at legislation to ban oxybenzone, based on the threat it poses to human health.\n\nWhy Palau and why now?\n\nPalau is located in the western part of the Pacific ocean. It is made up of one large volcanic island and several smaller coral reef associated islands. Despite its small size, it has often taken big steps in protecting the environment.\n\nIn 2015, it designated almost its entire ocean territory as a marine protected zone. Very aware of the threats of climate change, Palau became the second nation in the world after Fiji to ratify the Paris climate agreement in 2016.\n\nWhen it comes to coral reefs, the island nation has largely avoided the negative impacts of extensive coastal erosion from agriculture, pollution and rampant overfishing that have affected reefs elsewhere.\n\nThe ban on sunscreen products means Palau is determined to fight any threat to the reefs, which are visited by thousands of tourists every year.\n\nProf J\u00f6rg Wiedenmann, who studies coral ecosystems at the University of Southampton, UK, said: \"It is a sensible precaution to prevent the exposure of the vulnerable corals from the potential threats by sunscreen products in these places.\n\n\"However, reefs cannot be saved by banning sunscreens alone. There are more destructive drivers of reef decline such as sea water warming, overfishing, nutrient enrichment and pollution that need to be controlled to halt the ongoing degradation of reef ecosystems.\"\n\nHas anyone else looked to ban sunscreen with these ingredients?\n\nYes - several regions have imposed bans, including the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean and the US state of Hawaii which passed a law earlier this year. Mexico has banned sunscreen in nature reserves.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A view of some of the islands that make up Palau\n\nThe Palau restriction is set to be the most comprehensive yet, covering 10 chemicals. They include four that have an antimicrobial effect but have also been shown in the scientific literature to act as endocrine disruptors.\n\nExperts say that dozens of other countries may now look to replicate the Palau ban.\n\nAre there alternatives that don't contain these chemicals?\n\nYes, there are alternatives that don't include the two key chemicals that are being marketed as \"reef-safe\". But some scientists argue that the term is not legally enforceable, and there is no compulsion on manufacturers to demonstrate that their products don't harm coral.\n\nDr Craig Downs says the first line of protection against the sun should be clothing with built-in sun protection.\n\n\"From a conservation point of view, if you wear a sun shirt, you are reducing the sunscreen load by 50%. That's a major conservation victory.\"\n\nAnother approach would be to use mineral-based sunscreen, such as non-nanosized titanium oxide or zinc oxide.\n\nHow are sunscreen manufacturers reacting?\n\nMany of the larger corporations are against a ban on sunscreen products, saying that the evidence of a detrimental impact on coral is not strong enough.\n\n\"The big boys are fighting it. Johnson & Johnson and L'Oreal don't seem to be on board,\" said Dr Downs.\n\n\"But much of the rest of the industry have already come out with what they are calling 'Hawaii-compliant sunscreen', and it is a big marketing boost for them.\"\n\nA group of manufacturers have formed what they call the Safe Sunscreen Council. They welcomed the move.\n\n\"Palau's move to ban ingredients that have been know to cause damage to coral reefs is the right things to do,\" said Caroline Duell from the council.\n\n\"Hopefully, by Palau taking leadership on this issue, not only will they protect their sacred and economically key coral reef network, but they will show the world that it's time to change the way we think. There are many alternatives for sunscreen and personal care products that are safe, effective and enjoyable to use.\"", "Image caption The bypass is one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Scotland\n\nTransport Secretary Michael Matheson has told MSPs that there is no definitive date for the opening of the new Aberdeen bypass.\n\nThe \u00a3745m 28-mile (45km) bypass was approved by Scottish ministers in 2009 but faced legal action.\n\nIt was due to open in the spring but was put back to autumn.

The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.\n\nAs things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.\n\nFor those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half.\n\nThe Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.\n\nHome Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.\n\nBut they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can.\n\nThe US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.\n\nIt is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.\n\nBut the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.\n\nThere was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.\n\nBut Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sajid Javid has met Apple bosses in California to make the UK's case\n\nSources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.\n\nHome Offices sources told the BBC \"we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level\".\n\nBut immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.\n\nShe told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple \"won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function\".\n\nThe Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple Pay has been around since 2014\n\nThe Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.\n\nThe Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.\n\n\"The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.\"\n\nThe Home Office has also signed a \u00a391m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.\n\nIt means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally.\n\nBut given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.\n\nThey are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them.", "From the section\n\nA major redevelopment of the Windsor Park ground was completed in 2016\n\nThe Irish Football Association has launched another bid to host the Uefa Super Cup final at Windsor Park in Belfast.\n\nNorthern Ireland is one of four countries hoping to stage the 2021 meeting of the Champions League and Europa League winners.\n\nThe others are Belarus, Finland and Ukraine.\n\nTwo cities are bidding to stage the 2021 Champions League final - Munich and St Petersburg.\n\nNorthern Ireland's national stadium lost out to Istanbul in the contest to host the the 2019 Super Cup.\n\nWindsor Park, home of Irish Premiership club Linfield, has a capacity of 18,614 for football matches.\n\nIn August, 24,000 attended the boxing bill featuring Carl Frampton's win over Luke Jackson.\n\nIn 2011, the Europa League final between Portuguese teams Porto and Braga was played at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.\n\nThe Irish FA, having expressed an interest in the 2021 Super Cup, must have its final bid dossier submitted by 15 February, 2019.", "Image copyright Reuters\n\nThere were lots of flowers.\n\nThere was lots of cheering.

In a statement released earlier this week, he explained his position.\n\n\"I was aware that at this moment of national peril, the people expected our leadership and protection,\" he said. \"Hence, I accepted the invitation extended to me by the President to assume the position of Prime Minister\".\n\nThe former president is a popular but controversial figure who ended Sri Lanka's civil war in 2009 but faced criticism for the means by which he achieved victory - many thousands of Tamil civilians are thought to have been killed by government forces in the final months of the fighting.\n\nIn his address to the nation, President Sirisena said: \"I categorically state that the appointments were made totally in accordance with the constitution and on the advice of legal experts. With all respect, I completely reject the charge that what was done was a violation of the Constitution.\"\n\nWhat is surprising many observers is that in 2015 Mr Sirisena and Mr Wickremesinghe campaigned on a platform of abolishing the all-powerful \"executive presidency\" in Sri Lanka as embodied by Mr Rajapaksa.\n\nImage copyright Buddhika Weerasinghe Image caption Mahinda Rajapaksa is listed on the official website of the prime minister\n\nWithin months of winning the election they amended the constitution, reducing the powers of the president.\n\nSo, can the president remove the prime minister?\n\nAccording to Nihal Jayawickrama, a legal expert, there's no provision in the constitution that would enable the president to remove the prime minister.\n\n\"There was a time when he could do that. But very dramatic changes were made to the constitution in 2015 when 90 percent of the president's executive powers were taken away. And one of the powers that was taken away was the one to remove the prime minister,\" he said.\n\n\"Everyone is confused. President Sirisena was supposed to give leadership to the change [of government in Sri Lanka]. He did provide it. But for some reason, he backtracked.\"\n\nI asked Mr Wickremesinghe if he felt like he'd been backstabbed.\n\n\"That's to be expected in politics,\" he said with a smile. \"If necessary there will be more protests. The general public opinion does not accept the actions of the president.\n\n\"This type of crisis really causes a big issue for the people, a lack of confidence. Look, you promised to restore democracy, you've done so many steps, and here in the main question, you disregard the powers of parliament.\"\n\nThe episode sets a dangerous trend for a country that voted for change in 2015.

I spent some time around them when I went to their training ground to interview midfielder Mesut Ozil last week and there is a real buzz about the club at the moment.\n\nThe supporters are obviously excited too, because they like what they see. They have been singing \"we've got our Arsenal back\" and there is definitely a connection again between the fans and the team.\n\nEmery has earned 22 points in his first 10 league games as Arsenal manager - the Gunners have only made a better start to the season on four occasions since they last won the title in 2004, and only once (2016-17) did they then fail to finish in the top four\n\nEmery has only been in charge for a matter of weeks but a little bit of expectation has already returned too.\n\nArsenal's first two games of the season were defeats by Manchester City and Chelsea when nobody gave them much of a chance, but their form since has rebuilt some of the belief that had gone missing at the end of Arsene Wenger's reign.\n\nHave they got what it takes to beat Liverpool? My heart says yes, but I am looking forward to finding out.\n\nHard work takes talent to next level\n\nArsenal are fourth in the Premier League with seven wins from 10 games but if scores at half-time counted, they would be 17th, without any victories and with 14 fewer points. Nineteen of their 24 league goals this season have come after the break and, along with Leicester, they have gained the most points from losing positions in 2018-19 with seven\n\nArsenal's 11-game winning run ended with Sunday's draw at Crystal Palace, but their performances have impressed me as much as their results this season - including their display against the Eagles.\n\nThe Gunners did not play very well - again, they had to come back from a goal down and did not really get going until the second half - but it was still another example of what has changed under Emery.\n\nLast season, Arsenal probably would have lost that game. With 11 defeats from 19 league games their away record was very poor anyway, but in the nine games on the road in which they conceded first, they only avoided defeat in two of them.\n\nWhat is the difference this season? Well, the statistics show the players are covering more distance and making a lot of sprints, and the hard work I saw again at Selhurst Park is definitely a part of the team's improvement.\n\nArsenal in the Premier League (and rank) Season km covered per game Sprints per game* *Classification of a sprint has changed this season, so numbers cannot be compared with previous seasons, just ranking 2018-19 114 (1) 118.1 (2) 2017-18 112.3 (8) (5) 2016-17 110.1 (11) (4) 2015-16 110 (9) (4) 2014-15 110 (10) (2)\n\nI am a big believer that you can have all the talent in the world but to win trophies like the great Arsenal sides of the past you need to back it up with the correct attitude and work ethic, and that is what Emery has instilled in his side.\n\nLike Guardiola, Emery always demands more\n\nEmery has not betrayed any of Arsenal's traditions with his tactics - they still play attractive, attacking football - but he has already started to put his stamp on the team.\n\nHe always demands more and you only have to look at what Pep Guardiola has done at Manchester City to see what success that can bring when you are dealing with talented players.\n\nWe had been raving about City striker Sergio Aguero for years because of the number of goals he scored but that was not enough for Pep - he wanted Aguero to run more, press more and offer more to the team than just goals.\n\nSince 2013-14, Arsenal have played 150 Premier League games with Mesut Ozil, and 47 without him. As well as averaging more points and goals per game with him in the team, they also concede fewer goals when he plays - an average of one goal a game with him in the team, and 1.3 without him.\n\nPep was basically saying 'yes, you are at a good level but you can still do better' and I see that as being what Emery is telling his players too.\n\nOzil's treatment this season is probably the best example of Emery's approach.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that Arsenal are a better team with Ozil than without him, and the stats for his first five years at the club back up how important he has been.\n\nAaron Ramsey, who has created a chance every 43.7 minutes (12 chances from 524 mins), is the only Arsenal player to have a better 'minutes per chance created' ratio than Ozil this season. With a chance created every 47.1 minutes (14 from 660 mins), the German is 21st overall in the top flight of players to have played more than 450 minutes. Ozil has finished in the top five in each of his five full seasons in England, twice creating more chances per minute than anyone else. In 2015-16, he created a chance every 20.9 minutes, his best ratio to date\n\nBut Emery has challenged him, and is trying to get more out of him, by telling him he has got to fight for his place and earn the right to play in the number 10 role.\n\nHe has done the same with every player, by creating an environment where they are fighting for their place. For me, that is great man-management.\n\nEmery has taken Ozil out of his comfort zone and been very outspoken about saying he needs to do more for the team, but at the same time he has rewarded him by giving him the captain's armband, which sends a message about how much he values him.\n\nA different side to Ozil - the will to win\n\nWe saw a different side of Ozil when he was replaced with 22 minutes left against Palace, throwing his gloves to the floor and refusing to give his manager a high five.\n\nAfter his masterclass against Leicester, Ozil did not have the best of games and he was clearly frustrated by that, and not being able to stay on the field to rectify things.\n\nOzil pushed his way past Arsenal boss Unai Emery after being substituted during Sunday's draw with Crystal Palace\n\nEmery said afterwards he did not have a problem with his reaction and neither did I. As an Arsenal fan, I want to see our players disappointed when they are substituted, and it doesn't mean there is any conflict with the manager.\n\nWe are not used to seeing that kind of passion from Ozil, but it showed how much he cared.\n\nHe surprised a lot of people, but he did the same when I interviewed him last week and he spoke about how he is always determined to win - whether it is training or in games - and how he has been like that right through his career.\n\nI felt like he wanted to win in the interview as well, because he came across so well. He wanted to do it in German, because it is easier for him, but I explained to him how good it would be for people to see him talking in English.\n\nHe was very open and honest when I asked him questions about his reputation for being lazy and explained what his work ethic is really like.\n\nIt is easy to judge people and have a perception of their character without knowing them properly and I think that is part of the problem he has, not that it bothers him.\n\nHe knows he divides opinion, and people either like him or they don't, but he has got used to that.\n\nOzil does not worry about most of the criticism he gets but, bearing in mind he is now playing for someone as demanding as Emery is, it was particularly interesting to hear him say that he always listens to his coach.\n\nWhat next? Still room for improvement at the back\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Emery 'calm' over Arsenal top four chances\n\nMaybe this season under Emery is the time when Ozil will change what people think about him, and it is possible the Arsenal team as a whole can do the same. We have already seen signs they are not the soft touch they once were.\n\nWhat next? Well, I backed them to finish fourth before the season started and they certainly look capable of making it.\n\nLet's not get carried away and start talking about them as title contenders on the back of this good start, though, because getting back into the Champions League has to be their aim for this season, then they can build on that.\n\nArsenal have faced 141 shots in 10 Premier League games this season - only Burnley (208), Brighton (187), Fulham (165), Newcastle (154) and West Ham (144) have faced more - compared to 89 by Chelsea, 80 by Liverpool and 59 by leaders Manchester City\n\nThe grit and determination they have shown so far will definitely help them get there, although there is still room for improvement, especially defensively - only five top-flight teams have conceded more chances this season.\n\nIf they give a team like Liverpool the kind of openings they gave to Leicester, for example, then they will be punished - and there will be no second-half comeback to celebrate this weekend.\n\nAlex Scott was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "Mason Mount played the full match as Derby lost to Chelsea in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup\n\nWhat's a Chelsea youngster to do when they have ambitions of getting into the England team?\n\nStick it out and fight for a place at Stamford Bridge or head out on loan for guaranteed playing time?\n\nIn Wednesday's Carabao Cup tie between Chelsea and Derby, England World Cup player Ruben Loftus-Cheek came up against another Blues-owned midfielder in Mason Mount.\n\nMount managed an assist and impressed despite Derby losing 3-2, while Loftus-Cheek showed his ability with a few driving runs from midfield in only his fourth start of the season.\n\nHe was then substituted after 69 minutes while Mount, completing his 17th full match this season, came close to scoring in the later stages.\n\nLoftus-Cheek impressed so much during a loan spell at Crystal Palace last season that he earned a place in the England squad - and featured at the World Cup. But his career has stalled again after the Blues refused to let him leave on loan again, while still rarely playing him.\n\nAn injury to the Chelsea man at the time of the last international break opened the door for Mount, who was named in the England squad for games against Croatia and Spain this month, although he did not get on the pitch in either match.\n\nSo has Mount moved above Loftus-Cheek in the England pecking order now, and does the latter need to go back on loan somewhere to press his case?\n\nChanging fortunes\n\nIn 2017-18 Loftus-Cheek, 22, played more first-team minutes for Crystal Palace in one season than he has done in the whole of the rest of his Chelsea career. He played 25 times for Palace - it would have been more but for three injuries - scoring twice and setting up another five goals.\n\nA hat-trick against BATE Borisov in last Thursday's Europa League win more than doubled his previous goal tally at Chelsea, and he added another goal in the 4-0 Premier League win at Burnley at the weekend, meaning he has now scored six and set up five for the Blues in 38 appearances.\n\nPalace were reportedly keen to re-sign him on loan this season, but the Blues held on to him, leaving him to compete with Mateo Kovacic (signed on loan from Real Madrid), Ross Barkley, N'Golo Kante and Jorginho for a place in midfield.\n\nChelsea midfielders Premier League 2018-19 Player Minutes Goals Shooting accuracy Assists Chances created Passing accuracy N'Golo Kante 900 1 40% 1 13 88.98% Jorginho 888 1 66.67% 0 10 90.86% Mateo Kovacic 476 0 75% 1 8 94.59% Ross Barkley 391 3 62.50% 3 6 92.05% Ruben Loftus-Cheek 33 1 50% 0 2 89.13% Cesc Fabregas 12 0 - 90.00%\n\nMount - three years Loftus-Cheek's junior - has already played more football than his potential club and country rival in his career.\n\nHe made 39 appearances for Dutch top-flight side Vitesse Arnhem last season, scoring 13 goals - including five in his last three matches - and setting up another 10. He has followed that up with another productive loan spell at Derby County, scoring five times and providing two assists.\n\nWhat they said\n\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri\n\nOn Loftus-Cheek: \"At the beginning of the season [Loftus-Cheek] was a very good player and now he is a good player that is more suited to my style of football.\n\n\"We have a tactical problem with the midfielders. We have four midfielders and three of them have the same characteristics. They are offensive midfielders. Only one has other characteristics - Kante is a defensive midfielder. So it is very difficult to put in the starting XI two midfielders with the same characteristics.\"\n\nDerby boss Frank Lampard\n\nOn Mount: \"He can be really good. He can be top, top level because he's 19 and plays with ability and quality. Technically he's brilliant but also his work-rate shouldn't go unnoticed.\n\n\"He's so quick to leave midfield to go and press people, whether it be defenders or deep-lying midfield players which makes you the all-round midfield player.\n\n\"He should never be considered a number 10 because there's so much more to his game but he'll score goals like a number 10.\n\n\"At some stage he will go back to Chelsea. I don't want to think about that now, but when he does I think he's going to be a contender.\"\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate\n\nOn Loftus-Cheek: \"Ruben is a very good ball player. Everybody can see his physical size but he has got lovely soft feet. He receives the ball really well when surrounded in tight areas - he is obviously strong enough to hold people off.\n\n\"He has got great acceleration with the ball, driving with the ball at opposing players, and he is a good passer, has good vision.\"\n\nOn Mount: \"Mason stepped up and scored a penalty at Old Trafford [in Derby's Carabao Cup win over Manchester United]. He took it like he had been there all his life. Very often we hold youngsters back a bit too much and I'm always trying to find that balance.\n\n\"The message has got to be correct as it's the very early stages of their career, but it is good for their development to train and be part of the squad.\"\n\nLoftus-Cheek\n\n\"It's hard sometimes to perform at your best when you are not playing regularly.\n\n\"[Sarri] is asking me to improve defensively and positionally. For a manager who has been in the game for a long time, it would be daft for me not to take in what he is telling me. He is a top manager. For me to learn from him is great for my development. I will keep on doing that.\"\n\nMount\n\n\"At first [Lampard] said he was thinking of looking to drop me for the next game, and maybe give me a rest.\n\n\"But then he smiled and said 'no I've just spoken to Gareth, you've been selected for the England seniors'. He's got over 100 caps so he said to see if I can break that.\"", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nStars including Chance the Rapper, SZA and Miguel have paid tribute to Mac Miller at a memorial concert.\n\nDuring the gig in Los Angeles, as well as the performances, video messages from celebrities were also played out.\n\nMac Miller, 26, died in September following a suspected overdose.\n\nThe concert raised money for The Mac Miller Circles Fund (MMCF), which seeks to improve the opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThe gig opened with a video tribute to Mac, mixing home footage of him growing up with backstage shots from his time on tour.\n\nReal name Malcolm James McCormick, he rose to fame after topping the US charts with his debut album in 2011.\n\nAn 'intelligent light'\n\nHe released his latest record, Swimming, earlier this year and was due to go on tour but his body was discovered on 7 September 2018 at his home in California.\n\nDonald Glover aka Childish Gambino recorded a video message: \"Thank you, Mac, for sharing your soul and your beauty with us, especially your love of music.

Only restricted military systems see finer detail.\n\n\"Satellites have improved so much with their spatial resolution,\" explained Hannah Cubaynes, who is affiliated to both Cambridge University and BAS.\n\n\"For the first time we've been able to see features that are truly distinctive of whales, such as their flippers and flukes.\"\n\nImage caption At a resolution of 31cm, species identification becomes much easier\n\nWhat have the scientists done?\n\nMs Cubaynes' team examined WorldView-3 photos in different parts of the globe, looking for fin whales in the northern Mediterranean; humpbacks off Hawaii; southern rights around the Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, Argentina; and Pacific grey whales in Laguna San Ignacio, Mexico.\n\nThese are all baleens (filter feeders) and among the biggest cetaceans, reaching up to 15m or 20m in length.\n\nThe animals are detected just below, or even breaching, the sea surface. The fins and greys proved to be the easiest to identify in the pictures, in large part because their body colour contrasts well with the surrounding water and because they tend to swim parallel to the sea surface.\n\nBut, crucially, the team was able to make out the body shapes associated with the different animals, proving satellite-identification is a viable technique.\n\nImage copyright 2018 DigitalGlobe, a Maxar company Image caption WorldView-3 produces the sharpest pictures in the public domain\n\nWhy count whales from space?\n\nCurrently, most surveys are conducted from the air, from boats and sometimes from a promontory, such as a high sea-cliff. But these are very localised searches, and whales are known to range across hundreds of thousands of square km.\n\nSome of their feeding grounds will be far from land. Without more effective means to track the animals, we cannot really say how well they are recovering after centuries of over-exploitation.\n\n\"This is a potential game-changer - to be able to survey whales unhindered by the cost and difficulty of deploying planes and boats,\" said Dr Jennifer Jackson, BAS's top whale expert.\n\n\"Whales are a really important indicator of ecosystem health. By being able to gather information on the grandest scales afforded by satellite imagery, we can understand something more generally about the oceans' health and that's really important for marine conservation.\"\n\nImage copyright Rose Cole Image caption Counting from boats and planes works - but only over small areas\n\nDon't we already count smaller animals from orbit?\n\nThis is true - to an extent. BAS has already pioneered the use of satellite imagery to monitor penguins and albatrosses, for example. But there are crucial differences.\n\nIn the case of penguins, it is not really individual birds that are counted; rather it is the general size of a colony that is assessed from the black mass of animals huddled together on the their ice habitat.\n\nAnd in the case of albatrosses, the scientists know exactly where to look because the birds' breeding sites are restricted to just a handful of compact locations. A nest is just big enough to show up on a satellite picture, enabling an estimate to be made of the likely number of albatross pairs.\n\nSpacecraft will gather huge image swaths when they pass over the ocean. With the exceptional resolution now available, counting individual whales becomes practical. In a 31cm-resolution image, for instance, a grey whale's fluke will take up 10 pixels.\n\nImage caption Fin whale: Colour contrast helps with their identification\n\nWhere does this research go next?\n\nThe team is now testing various algorithms that can search satellite images automatically.\n\nThe best will shortly be applied to a WorldView-3 dataset covering the Ligurian Sea.\n\n\"The whole area is 36,000 sq km. This is simply too big to search manually,\" said BAS co-researcher Dr Peter Fretwell. \"It's a marine protected area and the worry is that there's a lot of boat traffic moving between Corsica, Italy and France.\n\n\"They're concerned about ship strikes and and we may be able to establish some information about fin whales' behaviour that will be helpful to ships' captains.\"\n\nSatellites continue to improve. DigitalGlobe, for example, plans a new constellation that promises to dramatically increase the rate at which the high-resolution pictures are acquired.\n\nAllied to the latest data analytics techniques, this should be a boon to marine biologists and ecologists.\n\nNot only will they get more robust numbers for live whale populations, but they should also have a much better idea of how many dead animals are stranding on remote coastlines around the the world.\n\nMs Cubaynes and colleagues have published their research in the journal Marine Mammal Science.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Staff leave some of Google's US offices over women's treatment\n\nStaff at Google offices around the world have staged an unprecedented series of walkouts in protest at the company's treatment of women.\n\nThe employees are demanding several key changes in how sexual misconduct allegations are dealt with at the firm, including a call to end forced arbitration - a move which would make it possible for victims to sue.\n\nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action.\n\n\"I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,\" he said in an all-staff email. \"I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society\u2026 and, yes, here at Google, too.\"\n\nA Twitter feed titled @googlewalkout documented the movement at Google's international offices.\n\nGoogle staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption New York\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Dublin\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption London\n\nImage copyright Twitter @TedonPrivacy/@googlewalkout via Reuters Image caption Zurich\n\nImage copyright Walkout organisers Image caption The first walkout was at Google\u2019s Singapore office\n\nWeb developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: \"We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded.\"\n\nWhat led to the walkout?\n\nAnger has boiled over in the past week since the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (\u00a369m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a \u201ccredible\u201d allegation of sexual misconduct.

Medicine will need more of these in coming years if increasing bacterial resistance is not to pose a very serious threat to human health.\n\nWhen they were introduced, in the 1940s, antibiotics were hailed as a \"wonder drug\". But there are major concerns that over-prescription has led to increasing resistance to the drugs.\n\nLast week, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, went as far as to say we were \"at risk of putting medicine back in the dark ages\" - but why has this happened?\n\nWhat are antibiotics?\n\nScottish chemist Alexander Fleming discovered the first true antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928, as a mould on a petri dish that inhibited the growth of bacteria. His discovery revolutionised the treatment of certain types of bacterial infection, saving countless lives in the process.\n\nAntibiotics fight bacteria in a number of ways, including by killing them or preventing them from spreading.\n\nHowever, they also have a major weakness.\n\nResistance\n\nAntibiotics are very effective at killing most, but not all, bacteria. Some bacteria acquire genes that protect them from the drug's attack.\n\nThey survive treatment and reproduce themselves, spreading the key genes more widely so the drug becomes ever less effective.\n\nIf somebody is infected by these drug-resistant bacteria, then it can become harder to deploy antibiotics to treat them successfully.\n\nAt present other types of antibiotic might do the trick but the options are starting to narrow as bacteria develop the ability to block more than one drug.\n\nIn the past four years in England, there has been a 35% increase in antibiotic-resistant blood infections. This is because there have been greater efforts by clinicians and other health professionals to identify sepsis cases.\n\nHowever, even though the absolute number of infections being detected has increased, the relative proportion of blood infections resistant to antibiotics has remained stable.\n\nFrom the point of view of health experts, a key to reduce antibiotic-resistant blood infections is to ensure that resistant bacteria cannot become prevalent in the first place.\n\nA recent report highlights that without effective antibiotics, life-threatening infections linked to operations such as hip replacements and Caesarean sections could increase.\n\nOverprescribing\n\nSince 2013, Public Health England has actively been campaigning to reduce the amount of antibiotics taken by patients.\n\nThey say that over-prescription of antibiotics is a major cause of the increase in resistance to them. This is because the more antibiotics are used are used, the less effective they become.\n\nIn addition, GPs have been prescribing antibiotics to patients who are not infected with bacterial diseases, even though they will never work.\n\nAntibiotic consumption in England has decreased by about 5% since 2013 - but the average daily dose per 1,000 people varies across the country.\n\nPublic Health England points out that antibiotic resistance and prescription are \"inextricably linked - areas with high levels of antibiotic prescribing also have high levels of resistance\".\n\nIts campaign involves ensuring all areas have access to best practices for using antibiotics - in particular in community care, as 90% of antibiotics are prescribed by GPs.\n\nThey want to see patients and carers educated about the inappropriate use of antibiotics and greater efforts by health professionals in preventing infections in the first place.\n\nAnd in 2016 the government called for a 50% reduction in the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics by 2021.\n\nAbout half of all patients with a cough or cold leave their GP's surgery with a prescription for antibiotics.\n\nAnd there are concerns that patient expectations are driving the problem.\n\nRecent research suggests 38% of people expect to be prescribed antibiotics when they go to the doctor.\n\nSo efforts are now being made not only to reduce the number of antibiotics prescribed but also for GPs not to prescribe antibiotics for conditions that will naturally clear up by themselves after a few days.\n\nHow does the UK compare?\n\nOver-prescription is not a problem unique to the UK.\n\nThe European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network has called the spread of drug-resistant bacteria a \"public health threat\", with estimates suggesting that 25,000 people die in Europe from linked infections every year.\n\nCurrently, the UK has below average consumption compared with other EU countries.\n\nEfforts to mitigate future costs related to the problem have led countries with high consumption to learn from others - in particular in northern Europe - who consume fewer antibiotics.\n\nThe global picture\n\nOne of the biggest global concerns regarding antibiotics is over drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB).\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), TB remains the world's deadliest infectious disease.\n\nTreatment has been effective, with an estimated 54 million lives saved through diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2017.\n\nEven so, and with the global incidence of TB falling at about 2% per year, it remains one of top 10 causes of death worldwide.\n\nIn 2017, 10 million people fell ill with TB and 1.6 million died from the disease, mainly in developing countries.\n\nThe WHO says that 490,000 people have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), when bacteria do not respond to the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin.\n\nSecond-line drugs can treat and cure MDR-TB. However, such treatment options can mean that patients have to undergo up to two years of chemotherapy involving costly and toxic medicines.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nIt has been 30 years since a new class of antibiotic became available.\n\nAnd resistance has developed to all those that do exist.\n\nBut antibiotics are expensive to produce and can take a long time to become available to clinicians and patients.\n\nIn 2017, Public Health England warned that a failure to address resistance to antibiotics could lead to an estimated 10 million deaths every year globally by 2050 at a cost of \u00a366trillion in lost productivity to the global economy.\n\nThat is why they, and other health organisations, are calling for a reduction in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.", "Image caption Jodie Comer (l) and Sandra Oh star in Killing Eve\n\nThere's arguably only one drawback to watching Killing Eve, the rip-roaring Phoebe Waller-Bridge TV adaptation of Luke Jennings' Codename Villanelle novella series which concludes this weekend.\n\nAnd that's the amount of time spent rewinding each episode to Shazam the many sublime songs played out as MI5 agent Eve Polastri and psychopathic killer Villanelle track each other across the globe.\n\nMore often than not, these moments come courtesy of Unloved, a band featuring David Holmes -

Government videos warned children not to talk to people they didn't know. But a new message is being trialled in the UK, which its creators think is better at keeping children safe.\n\n\"I tried to get the [old] Stranger Danger message across to my son a few years ago and it backfired badly,\" says Suzie Morgan, a primary school teacher who lives in Fareham, Hampshire.\n\nHe got frightened and confused, couldn't sleep at night and was worried somebody was breaking into the house.\n\nLike any parent she wanted to keep her child safe.\n\nBut she felt the Stranger Danger message she was teaching - which she herself had grown up with - was unhealthy for her six-year-old son, making him too afraid of the world.\n\n\"I didn't know where else to go,\" she says.\n\nSo she was hopeful when her son's school piloted a new safety message. It's called Clever Never Goes and was devised by the charity Action Against Abduction.\n\nIt aims to make children less afraid of the world, by giving them the confidence to make decisions about their own personal safety.\n\nMorgan says it has given her son more freedom and independence.\n\nHowever, it is a message that has not yet been fully evaluated by experts in the field, some of whom have reservations.\n\nAnd for many parents the new teachings may be difficult to accept. The Stranger Danger message is still deeply ingrained in their psyches.\n\nImage caption Police went into schools to discuss Stranger Danger videos\n\nThe old message was promoted by the government during the 1970s and 80s, in a series of hard-hitting films commissioned by the Home Office.\n\nIt followed a spate of high-profile abductions and killings, including the Moors and Cannock Chase murders.\n\nThere were stark warnings such as: \"You don't want to end up dead or in hospital, say 'No' to strangers!\"\n\nChildren were told to \"keep away from people you don't know\".\n\nThe films were given to the British Film Institute and you can watch the 1971 and 1981 films online.\n\nBut there were reservations among civil servants at the time and some worried children's fears were being heightened to an unhealthy degree, according to Geoff Newiss of the charity Action Against Abduction.\n\nNewiss researched Stranger Danger as part of a group assembled by the National Crime Agency four years ago. It inspired him to devise a new safety message for children, which he thinks is more fit for purpose - not least because the majority of abductions are committed by an adult already known to the child.\n\nImage caption The workshop is aimed at Key Stage One pupils, aged five to seven\n\nWith approval from the police and children's safety boards in the county, more than 150 schools are now signed up to teach Clever Never Goes in Hampshire.\n\nA key message of the workshop is that interactions with strangers are not necessarily dangerous.\n\nInstead, the moment children need to be wary of is when an adult, including ones they already know, asks them to go somewhere with them unexpectedly. This is what police call \"the lure\".\n\nIn an interactive class, children are introduced to a character called Clever the Robot. He has a special power for spotting danger, with a dial on his chest that reads \"Safe, Hmmm?, Unsafe\".\n\nHear more\n\nLearn more about Clever Never Goes in the latest People Fixing the World podcast from the BBC World Service\n\nChildren watch a series of videos showing scenarios with adults approaching children, and they have to decide how to react.\n\nSome scenes are reminiscent of the old Stranger Danger videos. A man pulls up in a car and offers some sweets and a ride. Of course the clear message remains that this is unsafe and children must move away and find a trusted adult.\n\nBut there are also scenarios where interactions with strangers are described as benign.\n\nA man approaches a child in a park and chats about his dog.

This could build up trust that a malicious person might capitalise on.\n\nThe hope is that children who adopt Clever Never Goes should still be resilient to this grooming, if they remember not to go with anyone unexpectedly, even if they are familiar faces.\n\nWithout research the new message cannot be endorsed by academics, says Dr Sherwood. The next stage is to evaluate it.\n\nImage caption Geoff Newiss is the driving force behind the Clever Never Goes message\n\nBut can children, who live in a magical world of Father Christmas and tooth fairies, really be trusted to make fine distinctions between safe and unsafe strangers?\n\n\"Absolutely,\" says Halton. \"We are failing in our job if we don't give children responsibility for their own actions.\"\n\nShe is wary of a trend towards \"lawnmower parents\", who sort out all the problems in front of their child, so children never have to figure out how to do things for themselves.\n\nNewiss agrees that we have to give children the tools to manage their own risk.\n\nWhen you look back at the Stranger Danger message, he says, there was a sense that \"a bit of fear won't do them any harm\".\n\n\"I think that's wrong.

Many young fishermen like me who don't have families want to migrate, but I won't try it again.

At the local fish market, dozens of women are busily selling sardinella amid the searing heat, but the frantic activity belies a different reality.\n\n\"A few years ago you used to buy three sardinellas for 100 CFA francs ($0.20; \u00a30.16), but now it costs 400 or 500 CFA francs,\" buyer Hadi Khadiata Diop, 30, says.\n\n\"Our national dish is thieboudienne: rice with fish.

I want them to have an education, I'll never allow them to become fishermen, whatever it takes.\"\n\nThere are reports of dozens of fishermen having been killed, although no-one knows the exact number.\n\nIf they are caught, the Mauritanian coastguard confiscate their boats and equipment, dropping them off on shore to make their way back to Senegal on foot.\n\nMauritania says it is trying to protect its own fish but it recently agreed to let the Senegalese catch 50,000 tonnes with 400 boats every year, in a quest to improve relations with its neighbour.\n\nHowever, this agreement is yet to be implemented, and it represents only a small number as there are thousands of boats in St Louis alone.\n\nChina's hunger for fishmeal\n\nAfter months of trying, I got a permit to cross into Mauritania, travelling hundreds of kilometres across the desert and arriving at Nouadhibou in the north, Mauritania's only fishing port.\n\nIt was a striking sight: thousands of fish being turned into dust to create fishmeal - a kind of powdered protein used for animal feed, exported mainly to China to feed other fish and livestock.\n\nLast year, almost half of Mauritania's fish catch was processed into fishmeal, according to the government.\n\nImage caption Fishmeal factories have been built in Senegal and Mauritania\n\nThis is a hungry industry, with 5kg (11lb) of fish required to produce just 1kg of fishmeal. There are already some 20 plants in Nouadhibou alone. But critics say this industry is creating very few jobs.\n\n\"The Senegalese were replaced with mainly Chinese and Turks who now catch the fish being processed by fishmeal plants, mostly owned by the Chinese and Russians,\" Alassane Samba, a former director of Senegal's oceanic research institute, tells me.\n\n\"Mauritania is protecting its waters not for its people, but for foreigners.\"\n\nHe adds that despite the lack of fish, there are around 15 fishmeal plants in Senegal also, including one in St Louis. Some are being built further down the West African coast as far away as The Gambia.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaking matters worse, some foreign trawlers feeding these fishmeal plants are accused of fishing illegally.\n\n\"Chinese and other foreign trawlers sometimes catch small prohibited fish or operate in protected areas,\" Henoune Ould Hamada, a former fisheries inspector, tells me.\n\n\"We even found evidence of them using dynamite to catch fish,\" he adds, referring to the practice of using explosives to blast thousands of fish to the surface.\n\nMr Hamada says he and many other inspectors lost their jobs and were replaced by a quasi-military inspection team.

This allows them to accurately measure ocean temperatures globally, dating back to 1991, when accurate data from a global network of stations became available.\n\nThe key element is the fact that as waters get warmer they release more carbon dioxide and oxygen into the air.\n\n\"When the ocean warms, the amount of these gases that the ocean is able to hold goes down,\" said Dr Resplandy.\n\n\"So what we measured was the amount lost by the oceans, and then we can calculate how much warming we need to explain that change in gases.\"\n\nWill the heat ever come back out?\n\nYes, say the authors, but over a very long time.\n\n\"The heat stored in the ocean will eventually come back out if we start cooling the atmosphere by reducing the greenhouse effect,\" said Dr Resplandy.\n\n\"The fact that the ocean holds so much heat that can be transferred back to the atmosphere makes it harder for us to keep the Earth surface temperature below a certain target in the future.\n\nImage copyright VictorHuang Image caption More heat means less oxygen in the water which could have implications for many species\n\n\"The ocean circulation that controls the ocean heat uptake/release operates on time scales of centuries, meaning that ocean heat would be released for the centuries to come.\"\n\nHow have other scientists responded to the findings?\n\nWith some concern.\n\n\"The authors have a very strong track record and very solid reputation... which lends the story credibility,\" said Prof Sybren Drijfhout from the University of Southampton.\n\n\"The updated estimate is indeed worrying in terms of how likely it is that society can meet 1.5 and 2 degree targets as it shifts the lower bound of climate sensitivity upward.\"\n\nOthers say that further work is required.\n\n\"The uncertainty in the ocean heat content change estimate is still large, even when using this new independent method, which also has uncertainties,\" said Thomas Froelicher from the University of Bern, Switzerland.\n\n\"The conclusion about a potential higher climate sensitivity and potentially less allowable carbon emission to stay below 2C should stimulate further investigation.\"\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature.", "Image copyright Annika Ogilvie, Fednav Image caption In 2014 the Nunavik became the first cargo ship to go through the Northwest Passage without an icebreaking escort ship leading the way\n\nClimate change is increasingly opening up the Northwest Passage, an Arctic sea route north of the Canadian mainland.\n\nCould it herald an era of more cargo shipping around the top of the world?\n\nBack in the 19th Century there was a race to map and navigate the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean as a shortcut between the North Atlantic and North Pacific.\n\nExplorers would take ships up Greenland's west coast, then try to weave through Canada's Arctic islands, before going down the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia.\n\nThe problem was that even in the summer the route was mostly blocked by impenetrable ice. On one of the best-known expeditions - that of the UK's Sir John Franklin in 1845 - all 129 crew members perished after their two vessels got stuck.\n\nToday, more than 170 years later, a warming Arctic means that the route is increasingly accessible for a few months each summer.\n\nAnd according to some estimates, Arctic ice is retreating to the extent that the Northwest Passage could become an economically viable shipping route.\n\nFor shipping firms transporting goods from China or Japan to Europe or the east coast of the US, the passage would cut thousands of miles off journeys that currently go via the Panama or Suez canals.\n\nThe Canadian government is certainly hopeful that this will be the case.\n\nLate last month the country's trade minister Jim Carr said that the route \"will in a matter of a generation, probably be available year round\".\n\nAt the moment it is still a risky business though, with ice remaining a serious problem.\n\nBut in 2014 the Nunavik became the first cargo ship to traverse the passage unescorted when it delivered nickel from the Canadian province of Quebec to China.\n\nImage copyright Fathom Marine Image caption The Arctic Ocean is not a place where you want something to go wrong with your vessel\n\nTim Keane, manager of Arctic operations for the ship's owner, Canadian maritime transport firm Fednav, was on board the Nunavik for the journey.\n\nHe says that the trip was pleasantly \"boring\" - the ship didn't have to spend days struggling through ice.\n\nInstead it did the journey from Quebec to China in 26 days, more than two weeks less than the 41-day return via the Panama Canal.\n\n\"From a distance point of view it makes tremendous sense to use the Northwest Passage when it's available to you,\" he says.\n\nWhile Fednav doesn't have immediate plans to use the route again, it remains a possibility depending on the cargo's destination, and the time of year.\n\nA year prior to the Nunavik's journey, another large vessel - the Nordic Orion - became the first cargo ship to go through the passage, albeit led by a Canadian coastguard icebreaker.\n\nOwner, Danish company Nordic Bulk Carriers, said afterwards that \"we hope and expect to do it\" again.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The wider North America Arctic region, including Canada's Nunavut territory (pictured) is very sparsely populated\n\nAt the moment the number of ships going through the passage is low, but is rising.\n\nIn 2017 a total of 32 vessels made the journey, but only one of those was a cargo ship. The others included adventure yachts, dedicated icebreakers, a cruise ship, and a tanker.\n\nThis compares with 18 vessels in total in 2016, and 16 in 2015.\n\nCanadian logistics company Fathom Marine expects shipping levels in the passage to keep growing, led by more mining projects across the region.\n\nPresident Niels Gram says his company is \"quite bullish in terms of providing marine support for projects that are in the area, and investing to support that\".\n\nHe says that as more mineral mining projects go into production, the raw materials will need to be shipped to world markets, and sites will need to be resupplied.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Ice, such as this in Lancaster Sound, Nunavut, remains a serious risk for shipping in the Northwest Passage\n\nHowever, some Arctic experts are not convinced that the Northwest Passage will ever be a busy commercial trade route.\n\nMalte Humpert, the founder of The Arctic Institute think-tank, is among them.\n\nHe says the passage is a \"less clear cut\" option for shipping than the Northern Sea Route, which runs along the Russian Arctic coast between Asia and Europe.\n\nHe points out that the Northwest Passage has several geographic disadvantages, including the many islands that keep the region more clogged with ice than the Russian route.\n\nOther challenges for the Canadian route is a lack of deep water ports and limited search and rescue capabilities.\n\nThere's also the continuing disagreement over access to the passage. Canada claims sovereignty, while the US and others consider the passage to be international.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption All members of Sir John Franklin's 1845 expedition perished, and were depicted in a number of paintings\n\nAnd when it comes to levels of investment and development, the wider North American Arctic region of Alaska, Canada's northern territories and Greenland is now trailing behind the Russian Arctic.\n\nRussia is trying to boost its northern economy, with plans to invest millions of dollars over the next few years to build nuclear-powered ice-breakers and develop port infrastructure along the Northern Sea Route.\n\nCanada is however planning to redevelop its one deep-water port with access to the Arctic - Churchill on Hudson Bay, in the province of Manitoba.\n\nInternational Trade Minister Mr Carr says the work will open up \"an entirely different world\" for Canada's northern regions.\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nJessica Shadian is director of Arctic 360, an organisation that promotes the North American Arctic and the geopolitical importance of sustainably investing there.\n\nShe sees its economic potential as vast, but says Canada is \"being slow to recognise its own north and the potential that it has\".\n\nInstead Ms Shadian adds that China is more closely looking at developing the North American Arctic as part of an ambitious scheme to transform its connections to Europe and beyond.\n\nShe wants Canadians and Americans to focus more on the economic returns the region can bring.\n\n\"When you start thinking about the North American Arctic as an emerging economy, it engenders a whole different mindset among investors,\" she says.", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Robots on building sites could become common as firms look to replace their ageing workforces\n\nShinichi Sakamoto is 57, and works for Shimizu, one of Japan's biggest construction companies.
