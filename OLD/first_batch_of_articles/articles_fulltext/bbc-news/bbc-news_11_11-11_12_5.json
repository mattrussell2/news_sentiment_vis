That's the hope of scientists who are scrambling to reverse the dramatic declines in bee populations.\n\nBees are in trouble, but we're not quite sure why.\n\nIt could be the overuse of insecticides; air pollution; warming temperatures; the varroa destructor mite; or even interference from electromagnetic radiation.\n\nOr it could be a combination of all these factors. But until we have more data, we won't know for sure.\n\nSo the World Bee Project and IT firm Oracle are creating a global network of AI \"smart hives\" to give scientists real-time data into the relationships between bees and their environments.\n\nUp to six sensors will be mounted on hives, capturing the sound of the bees' buzzing, the movement of their feet and wings, the weight of their honey, the hive's humidity, as well as local weather and pollution levels.\n\nImage copyright Christina Shand Image caption Sensors will provide data on sound, temperature, humidity and weight of honey in a hive\n\nSensors on beehives aren't new, but using AI and machine learning to analyse the data they collect should yield new insights, says John Abel, vice-president of cloud and technology at Oracle.\n\n\"Sound is probably the most important data set,\" he says.\n\n\"We convert it into a data feed and use this via machine learning to inform the beekeeper. And with Oracle Cloud we can get lots of data into it very quickly - we've got technology which is self-learning, self-tuning and self-patching, so it can automate what it needs to do.\"\n\nOracle - which says the data will be owned by the World Bee Project - will use blockchain to verify that the data is coming from a particular hive and hasn't been tampered with.\n\nSimon Potts, professor of biodiversity at Reading University, says it can be quite hard with simple laboratory or field experiments to tease out what is affecting bees.\n\nImage copyright Reading University Image caption \"Honey bees are the single most important pollinator on the planet,\" says Simon Potts\n\n\"With AI and machine learning we can start to put together the signature of health and unhealthy hives,\" he says.\n\n\"The holy grail would be to indentify early warning indicators of problems.\"\n\nFor instance, when bees swarm, the existing hive can lose half its population and half of its honey, as those bees about to leave will gorge themselves first.\n\nSo beekeepers want to minimise swarming.\n\nBees often swarm due to inadequate ventilation or high temperatures, so having live data on humidity, temperature and the weight of a hive's honey would all give early indications of problems.\n\nA beekeeper would then be able to take preventative action.\n\nWhy are bees so important?\n\nBees are crucial for agriculture: 1.4 billion farming jobs and three-quarters of the world's food supply - worth about $577bn (\u00a3447bn) a year - depend on the pollination of crops.\n\nAnd of the 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world's population, 70 are pollinated by domesticated and wild bees.\n\n\"Honey bees are the single most important pollinator on the planet,\" says Prof Simon Potts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Honey bee numbers have fallen dramatically in the UK in the past 70 years\n\nIn the past 50 years, the volume of agricultural production dependent on pollination has risen by 300%, yet at the same time bee populations have plunged.\n\nIn the UK, for instance, the number of honey bees fell by 54% between 1985 and 2005. In the US the number of honey-producing bee colonies fell from 5.9 million to 2.4 million between 1947 and 2008 - a fall of 59%.\n\n\"Over-industrialisation, the use of pesticides, the destruction of natural habitats and climate change are all behind this,\" says Sabiha Rumani Malik, founder and executive president of the World Bee Project, which aims to monitor the health of bees across the planet.\n\nImage copyright World Bee Project Image caption World Bee Project founder Sabiha Malik believes climate change has contributed to bee decline\n\nMore than 40% of invertebrate pollinator species - particularly bees and butterflies - are facing extinction, and the potential impact of this on agricultural production is just one of the factors behind last year's stark warning on global food security from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).\n\nYet what scientists have lacked is a comprehensive set of data to analyse the rates of bee declines in different regions of the world and the differing reasons for this.\n\nIn the UK, an invasive species that is now threatening honey bees is the Asian hornet. When the much larger hornet enters a hive, worker bees will surround it and effectively cook it - and themselves - to death by raising their own body temperatures.\n\nLive monitoring would again allow earlier action to be taken in removing such predators.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Asian hornet is considered to be a threat to the honey\n\nIn Manchester, Cisco and the city's Mi-Idea innovation centre have partnered with Australia's data innovation group, Data61, to track bees' movements by using IoT technology.\n\nThe team wants to understand phenomena such as colony collapse disorder, which sees the worker bees disappearing and leaving the queen isolated.\n\nThe project fits RFID [radio-frequency identification] chips safely onto individual bees so researchers can record their movements.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Bees 'go online' in Manchester\n\n\"We need to increase food production in the next two decades and we have declining bee populations around the world,\" says Peter Carter at Data61.\n\n\"So we're using the data analytics and machine learning to accelerate the rate at which we're making discoveries. We can then make smart decisions about where we invest our human resources, our scientists.\"\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nOnce the AI has been taught what to look for on UK bee hives, the World Bee Project plans to roll out these smart hives globally.

But, as Sudha G Tilak writes, the glossy period film about a rebellion against British rule has failed to excite critics and the box office reception has been mixed.\n\n(Warning: This article contains spoilers.)\n\nThugs of Hindostan is set in 19th-Century India with a noble guerrilla leader, played by Bachchan, and his ragtag army, led by a fierce female archer, attacking mighty English ships to avenge their lost kingdom and assassinated ruler.\n\nThe 76-year-old Bachchan plays the role of the elder general, leading and mentoring his army.\n\nKhan plays a cocky robber with shifting loyalties. His duplicitous schemes include robbing local maharajahs and milking rewards from representatives of the East India Company - which was transformed from a trading enterprise into the rulers of India - to whom he also plays informer. He infiltrates the gang of rebels led by Bachchan and wins their confidence. However, he later has a change of heart and joins them in defeating the British.\n\nComplete with kohl-lined eyes, Khan looks like a poor man's Jack Sparrow - the lead character in Pirates of the Caribbean, the Disney franchise to which Thugs has been compared. Khan swigs rum and takes part in a risqu\u00e9 song and dance routine with a local dancing girl, all the while pursuing his double deception with both the guerrilla leader and a British general, played by British actor Lloyd Owen.\n\nThe female lead is Fatima Sana Sheikh, who plays the archer and is in many of the action scenes. But Bollywood star Katrina Kaif, playing the dancing girl. lacks a substantial part.\n\nImage copyright Thugs of Hindostan Image caption Aamir Khan (centre left) plays an irreverent poor man's Jack Sparrow\n\nViewers have likened the premise of the film to Confessions of a Thug, an English novel written by Philip Meadows Taylor in 1839. (The word thug, from the Hindi \"thag\", possibly goes back to the 14th Century, when huge criminal networks operated all around India's main roads.)\n\nThe novel told the story of Ameer Ali - a figure based on many of the \"thugs\" of the time - who waylaid rich travelling parties and doubled as an informer to the British.\n\nThe film tries to hit the high-octane notes with blistering cannon fire and special effects-aided fight sequences over seas with mighty ships. Warring thugs brandish swords and bare their knuckles.\n\n'Feeble and formulaic'\n\nBut despite it lavish production and array of stars, Thugs of Hindostan is no match for Pirates of the Caribbean, critics say.\n\n\"From Amitabh Bachchan, who plays a rebellious pirate determined to free India from the clutches of the British Empire, to Aamir Khan, a manipulative, self-seeking character that largely draws from the eccentricities of captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean universe, there's nothing original or exciting about Thugs of Hindostan,\" wrote Ankur Pathak of the Huffington Post.\n\nNDTV found the 164-minute film \"too tacky and unconvincing to lay legitimate claims to being India's answer to Pirates of the Caribbean\".\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Katrina Kaif, who plays a dancing girl, lacks a substantial part\n\n\"Big, bloated, bombastic, Thugs Of Hindostan is a period saga that banks solely upon action and spectacle for impact,\" wrote Saibal Chatterjee.\n\n\"The characters that populate it are, like the thousand ships that the film launches in the service of a bitter early 19th Century battle between the fast-expanding British East India Company and a band of intrepid rebels who refuse to be enslaved by a foreign power, as flimsy as cardboard,\" he added.\n\n\"This giant period epic turns out to be feeble, formulaic and entirely forgettable,\" chimed the Hindustan Times in its takedown.\n\n\"I may be old school, but I believe pirate movies need to have eye-patches. This one doesn't, and that's a shame. The viewing experience would have been hugely improved. I should have gone in wearing two,\" wrote the paper's critic Raja Sen.\n\nHowever, the Guardian felt that Thugs \"has that rare and unmistakable look of an event movie that was huge fun to assemble\".\n\n\"We get tactical sea battles, plenty of cove action, swordfights choreographed like dance numbers, even a fiery 19th-Century South Asian equivalent of a Norse burial.

so impenetrable is his serve - but Djokovic already had him under pressure in the opening game with a break point.\n\nAlthough he netted his shot to squander the chance, and then missed another in the third, he made no mistake in the fifth game when he broke with a beautiful baseline return from yet another thundering first serve from the American.\n\nDjokovic's own serving was impeccable, winning six of his service games to love, to give Isner no chance of a breakthrough.\n\nHe sealed his first break in the second set when Isner netted a forehand in the seventh game and then set up three match points on Isner's next service game - eventually wrapping up victory on the third one with a fantastic backhand crosscourt winner after one hour 13 minutes.\n\n\"I had three breaks of serve of John which is sometimes 'mission impossible' but I managed to be at right place at the right time,\" said Djokovic.\n\n\"I held serve well, I backed it up from the baseline, I played very solid and didn't give him many opportunities.\"\n\nGroup Gustavo Kuerten W-L Sets Games Novak Djokovic 1-0 2-0 12-7 Alexander Zverev 1-0 2-0 14-12 Marin Cilic 0-1 0-2 12-14 John Isner 0-1 0-2 7-12\n\nHow Djokovic out-served a server\n\nIsner, who at 33 is the oldest debutant at the season-ending finals since Andres Gimeno in 1972, had qualified for the tournament as a result of Nadal and Del Potro's withdrawals.\n\nHe has enjoyed his most successful year - reaching his maiden Grand Slam semi-final at Wimbledon, winning his first Masters 1000 title at Miami and finishing the season ranked inside the world's top 10 for the first time.\n\nAnd he was not overawed by his first appearance on this stage - still managing to deliver 13 aces and serves of more than 140mph, including some second serves reaching more than 125mph.\n\nBut the most telling number was the 66% of first-serve points won by a player whose average for the season is a huge 81%.\n\nThat is testament to the returning of Djokovic, who kept reading the serves and getting his racquet to whatever was thrown at him time and again.\n\nAnd the Serb's own percentage of first-serve points won was 86%, which is more the kind of figure Isner is used to posting.\n\nAnalysis\n\nGB Davis Cup captain Leon Smith on 5 live sports extra\n\nNovak Djokovic is as good as ever.

but sources wouldn't be drawn on any specific arrangements for Northern Ireland on rules and regulation within the UK-wide one, she added.\n\nThis \"backstop\" has proved to the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work.\n\nThe pound surged against the dollar and the euro following the negotiations breakthrough - but analysts warned it could be short-lived, with the cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans.\n\nThe EU said it would \"take stock\" on Wednesday, while the Irish government said negotiations were \"ongoing and have not concluded\".\n\nLeading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, immediately criticised what has been reported to be in the draft agreement, saying it would keep the UK under EU control.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which gives Theresa May vital support in key votes, said it would be a \"very, very hard sell\".\n\nBut Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was \"confident\" it would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called for \"a little bit of calm\" before the cabinet gives its verdict on Wednesday.\n\nBoth the UK and EU hope to be able to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the deal.\n\nWhat's been agreed?\n\nThe details of the draft agreement have not been published, so we don't know the small print yet.\n\nBut it is made up of a withdrawal agreement - said to run to 500 pages - alongside a statement about what the UK and EU's future relationship will look like.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement includes how to guarantee there will not be physical border checks reintroduced in Northern Ireland - the major sticking point in recent weeks.\n\nSome Brexiteers fear the likely arrangement will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years to come in order to maintain a frictionless border.\n\nThe agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\".\n\nThe future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled.\n\nNo 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to \"consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps\".\n\nBefore they do so, they will be able to read relevant \"documentation\".\n\nWhat does the cabinet do now?\n\nBy BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document.\n\nIt's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament.\n\nOne source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament.\n\nSlamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down.\n\nWho doesn't like it?\n\nFormer foreign secretary Mr Johnson said the plan would see the UK remain in the customs union and \"large parts\" of the single market.\n\nHe told the BBC it was \"utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy\" and he would vote against it.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg warned of the UK becoming a \"vassal state\" with Northern Ireland \"being ruled from Dublin\".\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said \"given the shambolic nature of the negotiations, this is unlikely to be the good deal for the country.\"\n\nPro-EU Conservative MP Justine Greening said the agreement would leave the UK with less influence and undermine its credibility.\n\nSpeaking at a rally calling for another EU referendum to be held, she said: \"Even if some people in my party can't see this is a bad deal, everyone else around this entire planet can.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption At the rally, former minister Jo Johnson was interviewed by Match of the Day host Gary Lineker\n\nFormer Transport Minister Jo Johnson told the audience at a packed Westminster Hall that cabinet ministers were \"looking deep into their consciences\" about whether to support the deal.\n\nMr Johnson, who quit his ministerial role last week over Brexit policy, added: \"The whips are going to tighten the thumbscrews on all our colleagues across Parliament in all parties probably, so it is very hard to predict.\"\n\nThe view from the EU\n\nBBC Europe editor Katya Adler\n\nBrussels is keeping schtum this evening.

And that won't be with an uncritical eye.\n\nMeanwhile, following pressure from all sides of the Commons, ministers have agreed to provide MPs with a legal assessment of the implications for the UK of the Irish backstop and other controversial aspects of any deal.\n\nCabinet Office minister David Lidington said Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement to MPs and take questions ahead of the final vote on any Brexit deal.\n\nMPs, he said, would get to see \"a full reasoned position statement laying out the government's both political and also legal position on the proposed withdrawal agreement\".", "BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello and analyst Steve Bunce discuss whether Tony Bellew should have been interviewed so soon after being stopped in the eighth round by Ukrainian undisputed cruiserweight world champion Oleksandr Usyk on Saturday in Manchester.\n\nListen to the latest 5 Live Boxing with Costello and Bunce podcast.", "Mourinho said City's matches with Southampton and Shakhtar Donetsk were \"friendly\"\n\nJose Mourinho has behaved \"like a big baby\" and Manchester United will only improve under a different manager, says Premier League winner Chris Sutton.\n\nMourinho's United lost 3-1 to derby rivals Manchester City on Sunday, leaving them eighth in the table.\n\nAfter the match, he said City had benefited from playing two \"friendly\" matches beforehand, while United were \"fatigued\" after beating Juventus.\n\nSutton said those comments were \"disrespectful\" and \"utter rubbish\".\n\nCity beat Southampton 6-1 in the league and Shakhtar Donetsk 6-0 in the Champions League before playing United, who defeated Bournemouth 2-1 and beat Juve by the same scoreline.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Monday Night Club, former Blackburn and Celtic striker Sutton added: \"United were outclassed.

Too often, we get stuck on the same old philosophical arguments about gun violence,\" Dr Morris, who is based in Utah, explained to the BBC.\n\nGuns send 8,300 children to hospital each year in the US, while the number of violent gun deaths in America is greater than the Middle East, once armed conflict-related casualties are factored out.\n\nHe was deliberately vague about the details behind the photograph of his bloodied scrubs \"because it is representative of countless times that this has happened to me and every other person who works in trauma\".\n\nDoctors like him are not anti-gun or anti-NRA, he suggests.\n\n\"We are anti-violence. Violence is the real problem; guns are simply a vector. What we hope for is the opportunity to study the problem and apply sound scientific methodology to making things better.\"\n\nThe question of studying gun violence as a public health issue, an approach Dr Morris supports, is at the centre of a long-running conflict between the health profession and the NRA.\n\nThe NRA tweet that spurred so much anger was prompted by the publication of a paper by the American College of Physicians stating that medical professionals have a \"special responsibility\" to speak out on prevention of gun-related injuries and that they should support \"appropriate regulation of the purchase of legal firearms.\"\n\nFor years, the NRA, which spent more than $5 million on political lobbying in 2017, has tried to stifle public research into gun violence, including by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nA bill passed in March allows the CDC to research the causes of gun violence, but a 1996 law still prevents the organisation from advocating or promoting gun control.\n\nAnother doctor whose condemnation of the NRA was widely shared is forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, based in San Francisco.\n\nImage copyright Doug Zimmerman Image caption Judy Melinek is author of best-selling book Working Stiff,about forensic training\n\n\"I was incensed that the NRA would tell doctors to 'stay in their lane'.

a formula which revolutionised comics.\n\nThe Hulk, Iron Man, Daredevil and the Fantastic Four all sprang from his fertile imagination and spilled onto the page.\n\nBut while his career may have started in pen and ink, it grew and evolved into much more.\n\nFrom digital graphic novels to blockbuster Hollywood films; leading Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation; Stan Lee was prolific.\n\nBorn in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stanley Martin Lieber got a job in Timely Publications - that would eventually become Marvel Comics - a company owned by a relative.\n\nHe was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to the reach of his imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18.\n\nFor more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWords of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or all bad, with no shades of grey.\n\nSo embarrassed was Lieber by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the by-line. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, which he later legally adopted.\n\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create.\n\nAfter a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\n\nLee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays.\n\nThey were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever.\n\nLee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other.\n\nThe fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the so-called 'silver age' of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics.\n\nSoon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nHe was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends.\n\nAt last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\n\n\"Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC.\n\nThe Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality.\n\nRadically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and and others achieved cult status in their own right.\n\nOther superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet.\n\nIn its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images/Mat Szwajkos\n\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud.\n\nIn 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which went on to develop films and TV programmes.\n\nHis half-century-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man and the Avengers all given the Hollywood treatment.\n\nSpider-Man was a huge box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (\u00a3857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales were counted.\n\nMore recently the three Captain America films, starring Chris Evans, took $2.24bn at the worldwide box office. Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man pulled in $2.4bn. Marvel's appeal was unequivocal.\n\nAnd fans also delighted in seeing Lee's brief cameo appearances in almost every Marvel live-action movie.\n\nLee also enjoyed success with graphic novels. In 2012 he co-wrote Romeo and Juliet: The War which landed on The New York Times' best-seller list and launched a YouTube channel, Stan Lee's World of Heroes.\n\nHe introduced his digital graphic novel Stan Lee's God Woke at the 2016 Comic-Con. The print version won the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards' independent voice award.\n\nIn later years he lamented his deteriorating eyesight, which meant he could no longer read the comic books where he made his name.\n\nHe told the Radio Times in 2016 that he \"missed reading 100%\".\n\nAnd he also talked about what he considered to be the greatest superpower - luck.\n\nHe said: \"Every time I go to a comic book convention, at least one fan will ask me, 'What is the greatest superpower of all?' I always say that luck is the greatest superpower, because if you have good luck then everything goes your way.\"", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stan Lee was born Stan Lieberman in 1922\n\nTributes are being paid to American writer and former president of Marvel Comics Stan Lee, who has died at the age of 95.\n\nLee created The Fantastic Four for Marvel Comics in 1961 and went on to create titles including Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk.\n\nActor Chris Evans, best known for playing Marvel's Captain America, wrote \"there will never be another Stan Lee\".\n\nX-Men star Hugh Jackman said \"we've lost a creative genius.\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr, who played Iron Man, simply wrote: \"I owe it all to you, Rest in Peace Stan.\"\n\nKevin Feige, the producer and president of Marvel Studios, tweeted: \"No one has had more of an impact on my career and everything we do at Marvel Studios than Stan Lee.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @Kevfeige No one has had more of an impact on my career and everything we do at Marvel Studios than Stan Lee.

of a new public body to encourage better designed homes.\n\nBut Labour said past \"hateful\" comments about homosexuality, which he once said was \"not normal\", and Islamophobia, which he called a \"propaganda word\", raised questions about his suitability.\n\nCommunities Secretary James Brokenshire said his views had been misrepresented.\n\nThe philosopher's character had been \"smeared\", Mr Brokenshire told MPs, saying he was \"uniquely qualified\" for the role because he was a world-leading authority on aesthetics.\n\nOne of the UK's leading public intellectuals and the author of more than 50 books, Sir Roger was named as chairman of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission earlier this month.\n\nThe unpaid appointment has divided opinion, with Labour and Lib Dem MPs saying he is unsuitable because of remarks he has made in the past on social, religious and moral issues.\n\n'Conspiracy theories'\n\nIn an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2007, Sir Roger wrote: \"Every now and then, however, we wake up to the fact that, although homosexuality has been normalised, it is not normal.\"\n\nIn an interview for online magazine Spiked in 2016, he said: \"Lesbianism is usually an attempt by a woman to find that committed love that she can't get from men any more.\"\n\nIn a 2005 lecture in the United States, he said date rape was not a crime and what \"supposed\" victims were actually saying was: \"'The whole thing went too quickly,' you know, 'I was not prepared,' and so consent is withdrawn as it were in retrospect.\"\n\nSpeaking in Hungary in 2016 on the future of Europe and the nation state, he made remarks about the financier George Soros which one Labour MP has said amounted to \"peddling anti-Semitic conspiracy theories\".\n\n\"Many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros empire,\" Sir Roger said.\n\nHe added: \"As the world knows, indigenous anti-Semitism still plays a part in Hungarian society and politics and presents an obstacle to the emergence of a shared national loyalty among ethnic Hungarians and Jews.\"\n\n'Due diligence'\n\nRaising the appointment in the House of Commons, shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne suggested Sir Roger had made a number of other \"unacceptable\" comments, including \"speaking favourably\" of far-right movements such as the National Front.\n\n\"If we are going to have a society which welcomes free speech, we should hold people to account for what they use that privilege to say,\" he said.\n\nHis Labour colleague Clive Efford said what was at stake was not defending freedom of speech but whether someone who had \"extreme views\" was suitable for a high-profile public role.\n\nBut a succession of Conservative MPs offered their support to Sir Roger, saying the selective quotes cited by his critics were not a proper reflection of his arguments.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg said as a philosopher his role was to \"advance debate and discussion\" on difficult issues, while Bob Seely said the government should not allow itself \"to be bullied by the thought police rent-a-mob\".\n\nMr Brokenshire said \"due diligence\" had been carried out before the appointment and ministers did not have to agree with all Sir Roger's \"strong and controversial views\", some of which he said he had changed his mind on, to recognise the contribution he could make.\n\n\"It saddens me that someone who has done so much to champion freedom of speech, expression and thought should be subject to such misinformed, ill judged and personal attacks we have seen over the last few days.\"\n\nSir Roger has said he is \"offended and hurt\" by suggestions that he is any way anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, insisting \"nothing could be further than the truth\".\n\nIn a statement on his blog last week, he said: \"If people actually read my comments regarding the interplay between George Soros and Hungary, they will realise they are not in any way anti-Semitic, indeed quite the opposite.\n\n\"My statements on Islamic states points only to the failure of these states, which is a fact.\n\n\"My views on Islam are well known and can

as well as that Slam quarter-final at this year's French Open - coming on the slower surface.\n\nBefore August's US Open, Zverev brought eight-time Grand Slam champion Ivan Lendl into his team to help him go deeper in the four majors - and he showed his mental resilience against Cilic on Monday at a tournament considered second only to the four Slams in terms of prestige.\n\nZverev, without reaching his highest level against Cilic, cut out the errors in the key moments and took control of the second tie-break to win in two hours and six minutes.\n\n\"That first set was key because against Marin you never want to fall behind. He's such a hard-hitting, aggressive player, when he gets confidence it is tough to play against him,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"I wanted to fight back from every score, he was up a break in both sets.\n\n\"I knew it was a very important match, you don't want to start the group stage with a losing record. it was very important to get the win.\n\n\"I'm happy with how I played and happy to build from here.\"\n\nCilic still not feeling at home in London\n\nDespite reaching Grand Slam finals and cementing his place in the world's top 10 over the past couple of years, Cilic has never managed to make an impact at the end-of-season finals.\n\nOne win in his three previous appearances at the O2 is a meagre return for a player of his undoubted ability and he was hoping to improve his fortunes with an opening win against Zverev.\n\nYet he paid the price for a sloppy display against the world number five in a match which lacked real quality on either side of the court.\n\nAfter digging deep to hold serve in the first game, Cilic was rewarded for his determination by breaking in the second but missed three chances to go a double break up at 4-0 and 5-1.\n\nUltimately that proved costly for the world number seven.\n\nStill he was left serving for the set at 5-3, only to gift the break back to Zverev with three unforced errors and a double fault, allowing the German to take the first set in the tie-break.\n\nA low first-serve percentage and more unforced errors continued to blight Cilic's progress in the second, despite him moving a break up for 4-3 after saving a break point in the previous game with a 137mph serve.\n\nHe handed the advantage back to Zverev in the next game -

analysis\n\nTim Henman, former British number one and BBC Sport analyst:\n\nThere were a lot of errors in that match, it seems like the ball is difficult to control on this court.\n\nI think there were 80 unforced errors between them and Cilic made more, he was up to about 45 errors.\n\nWhen it came to the business end of both sets Zverev was able to cut down the unforced errors.\n\nHis first-serve percentage was a bit higher - around 60% - whereas Cilic was under 50%, and for a guy whose serve is a weapon that is not good enough.\n\nFor Zverev, it was a great match to come through because he did not play particularly well.", "Video\n\nHe has asked a court to legally change his age arguing that trans people can change their gender because they feel like a different sex.\n\nHis stance has angered LGBT campaigners who say the comparison is \"tasteless\".\n\nWatch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel -and see more of our films here.", "Video\n\nIn the House of Lords, Liberal Democrat Baroness Smith wonders if the resignations of \"Johnson and Johnson\" (a reference to Boris and brother Jo) mean the Brexit deal could be \"worse than remaining\".\n\nThis reference sounds \"more like an advertisement for toilet products\", says government spokeswoman Baroness Goldie, sparking laughter among peers.", "Image caption Chris Harris (right) has featured on Top Gear since 2016\n\nTop Gear presenter Chris Harris has been involved in a car crash while working for the show's magazine.\n\nHarris was driving a black Porsche GT3 Touring on the A466 near Tintern in Monmouthshire when he crashed into a pick-up truck doing a three-point turn.\n\nNobody was injured in the crash, which happened at about 13:30 GMT on Monday, but both vehicles were damaged.\n\nHarris was working ahead of the 26th series of Top Gear, its last with Matt LeBlanc, which will air in early 2019.\n\nImage caption The Porsche Harris was driving was badly damaged, but nobody was hurt in the crash\n\nHe was driving through the Wye Valley, with a senior executive from the magazine also in the car at the time of the crash.\n\nAn eyewitness, said the pick-up truck was manoeuvring in an apparent three-point-turn before the collision and the Porsche was embedded in the side of the truck between the front and back wheels.\n\nA Spokesman for BBC Top Gear said: \"We can confirm that Chris Harris was involved in a car accident in Wales earlier today whilst working on a feature for Top Gear magazine.\n\n\"Chris, his passenger, and the driver of the other car, were unhurt and Police were called to the scene.\"\n\nHarris has presented Top Gear since 2016, when he was brought as part of the team which replaced Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.", "The board of Glasgow School of Art has hit back at claims it failed to look after the A-listed Mackintosh building.\n\nA submission to a parliamentary inquiry strongly defended its record following two devastating fires in four years.\n\nIn documents released ahead of an evidence session in parliament on Thursday, bosses denied claims of \"systemic management failure\".\n\nThey said the school was \"robust and well-managed\" and fit and able to oversee repair of the iconic building.\n\nMSPs on the culture committee have heard from architects and other experts but this is the first time those in charge of the art school have had their say.\n\nIn their written submission, the board members responded to statements from previous sessions -

It said a website was dedicated to putting out information following June's fire, but accepted it was \"not entirely successful in communicating with the public in the immediate aftermath\".\n\nA temporary fire suppression system was not installed after the 2014 fire because there was no system \"suitable for a building of the scale and complexity of the Mackintosh Building that could have been installed during the construction period\".\n\nThe school's monetising of the Mackintosh building was limited in scope, and revenue amounted to no more than about \u00a360,000 from tours of the building and the sale of merchandise.\n\nOn claims it failed to engage with experts, the board said it put in place an expert panel so that its design team could have access to the right advice when required. These experts have been called upon to provide advice to other institutions following major disasters including the National Museum of Brazil.\n\nThe board said events hosted within the building after the 2014 fire followed stringent procedures agreed with the contractors. About half a dozen events were held over the four years since the 2014 fire. \"Safety of visitors and operatives and efficient site operations remained the absolute priorities at all times,\" it said.\n\nIt rejected the idea of rebuilding the Mackintosh as a museum. \"To strip it of its primary function and consign it to the status of a visitor attraction, would be to strip life and purpose from the building... converting the Mackintosh Building to a museum would not be an expression of responsible custodianship, it would be a piece of sabotage against our built heritage and a failure of our duty to future generations.\"\n\nImage copyright Police Scotland Image caption The Mackintosh building was devastated by a fire in June just months before it was due to reopen\n\nElsewhere, the board said the decision on whether a public inquiry was necessary was a matter for the Scottish government.\n\nIt recognised, however, that the scale of the rebuild following the 2018 fire was \"significantly different\" to the task it faced four years ago.\n\nTo that end, the board said \"we are committed to working with our partners across national and local government to define the most appropriate model for the GSA to lead on the rebuild of the Mackintosh building\".\n\nIn other submission papers, the board said the art school's fire prevention plans had been worked up over many years.\n\nIt stated: \"It was suggested at the hearing on 20 September 2018 that 'the failure was systemic and that there was a misjudged attitude to risk for such a hazardous and iconic building.'\n\n\"It is understood that none of the witnesses are experts in this area. We strongly rebut that allegation.\n\n\"We have always taken fire precautions seriously across our whole estate.\n\n\"Our decision to commission a water mist fire suppression system to enhance the protection of the Mackintosh building, and the installation of sprinkler systems within the Reid and Stow buildings demonstrates our approach.\"", "Image copyright BMG Image caption Dido will play four UK dates during the tour\n\nMultimillion-selling singer Dido has announced her first tour for 15 years.\n\nThe 27-date world tour begins in Prague on 5 May, reaches the UK on 26 May and then heads to the US.\n\nFans will hope to hear her perform some of her biggest hits, such as Thank You, Here With Me and White Flag, alongside music from her new studio album.\n\nTitled Still On My Mind, it is her first album for five years.

United are also 12 points from Cardiff in 18th, the same distance as they are from City at the top.\n\nMourinho continues to set unwanted records. The City loss was United's fourth in the league this season - the first time they have lost that many in their opening 12 games since the 1990-91 season, when they finished sixth in the old First Division.\n\nLast season, when they finished second, it took them to January to lose four league games, a 2-0 defeat by Tottenham in their 25th match.\n\nCase for the defence\n\nGoalkeeper David de Gea beat Manchester City counterpart Ederson last year to the Premier League Golden Glove, with 19 clean sheets to the Brazilian's 18.\n\nIt's highly unlikely he will repeat the feat this year, with just one blank this season - only Fulham, without a clean sheet, have a worse record.\n\nSince that 3-2 comeback win against Newcastle on 6 October, Mourinho has named an unchanged back four in the last four league games, with Luke Shaw, Chris Smalling, Victor Lindelof and Ashley Young starting every match. Centre-back Eric Bailly, signed for \u00a330m in 2016, has not got a look in after he was subbed in the 19th minute, with United 2-0 down to the Magpies.\n\nBut consistency in selection has not stopped the goals. Only four other sides in the league have conceded more this season - Fulham (31), Huddersfield (22), Cardiff (25) and Burnley (25).\n\nIt's a different story a few miles up the road from Old Trafford at the Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola's side share the fewest goals conceded (five) and most clean sheets (seven) with Liverpool.\n\nBlunt attack\n\nRomelu Lukaku's problems up front, with four league goals, contrast with City's frontman Sergio Aguero, who tops the goal charts after he scored against United to take his tally to eight for the season.\n\nAnthony Martial is United's top scorer in the league with six, the same amount as City's Raheem Sterling.\n\nBut overall, United are way behind Guardiola's free scoring side.\n\nBack to the 70s\n\nSo conceding a lot and not scoring much equals not a great goal difference.\n\nIn fact, this is the first time since 1977-78 that United have a negative goal difference after 12 games of a top-flight season - Baccara were top of the charts with Yes Sir, I Can Boogie. (Who? Exactly.)\n\nSo what could this mean for the season?\n\nSports data company Gracenote, which ranks European clubs, has Man City at an all-time high of fourth in Europe after beating United, who are down in 12th.\n\nThe rankings are produced from results over the past four seasons, but the most recent campaign carries a weight of about two-thirds.\n\n\"The last time an English club were in the Euro Club Index top four was towards the end of the 2012-2013 season when Manchester United were fourth under Sir Alex Ferguson,\" said Gracenote's head of sports analysis Simon Gleave.\n\n\"Manchester United's decline was sharp after Ferguson's departure and they had already dropped out of the Euro Club Index top 10 in their first season without their legendary Scottish manager. Manchester United eventually dropped as low as 19th in March 2016 before something of a recovery began which has taken them up to 12th place now.\"\n\nGracenote are currently projecting City to be champions and finish on 91 points, with United in fifth place, 20 points behind them.\n\nThat would mean United finishing behind City for a sixth straight season.", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The pilots spotted fast flying objects and bright lights in the sky\n\nThe Irish Aviation Authority is investigating reports of bright lights and UFOs off the south-west coast of Ireland.\n\nIt began at 06:47 local time on Friday 9 November when a British Airways pilot contacted Shannon air traffic control.\n\nShe wanted to know if there were military exercises in the area because there was something \"moving so fast\".\n\nThe air traffic controller said there were no such exercises.\n\nThe pilot, flying from the Canadian city of Montreal to Heathrow, said there was a \"very bright light\" and the object had come up along the left side of the aircraft before it \"rapidly veered to the north\".\n\nShe was wondering what it could be but said it did not seem to be heading for a collision.\n\nAnother pilot from a Virgin plane joined in and suggested it might be a meteor or another object re-entering the earth's atmosphere.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\nHe said there were \"multiple objects following the same sort of trajectory\" and that they were very bright.\n\nThe pilot said he saw \"two bright lights\" over to the right which climbed away at speed.\n\nOne pilot said the speed was \"astronomical, it was like Mach 2\" - which is twice the speed of sound.\n\nWhat could it have been?\n\nApostolos Christou, an astronomer from the Armagh Observatory and Planetarium, said what the pilots saw was probably a piece of dust entering the earth's atmosphere at very high speed.\n\n\"It was most likely what are commonly called shooting stars,\" he said.\n\n\"It appears the matter was extremely bright so it must have been quite a large piece of material.\n\n\"I cannot say from the pilots' description, but it could have been the size of a walnut or an apple.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe astronomer said November tended to be a very busy month for such activity.\n\n\"It also appears there were bits coming off the object and flying past the aeroplane, that is also what you would expect if it was a particularly large rock from space hitting the atmosphere, it would tend to fragment.\"\n\n\"Following reports from a small number of aircraft on Friday 9 November of unusual air activity the IAA has filed a report,\" the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) said.\n\n\"This report will be investigated under the normal confidential occurrence investigation process.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Shannon Airport said it would not be appropriate for the airport to comment while the IAA investigation is ongoing.", "Video\n\nThe British people \"have got a right to have the final say\" on the UK's relations with the EU, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said.\n\nAnd he predicted there would be a new referendum, but he did not know when it would be.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Drew Brees passes Brett Favre to go second in all-time touchdown passes list\n\nThe New Orleans Saints continued their run as the most in-form team in the NFL and quarterback Drew Brees reached another milestone as they enjoyed a dominant 51-14 victory at the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nBrees moved on to 509 career touchdown passes to move above Brett Favre and sit behind only Peyton Manning on 539 in the all-time list.\n\nAnd the Saints proved the are genuine Super Bowl contenders by following up last week's win over the previously unbeaten LA Rams.\n\nIt was the joint-worst defeat in Bengals history and the second-most points they ever conceded as they became the first team in the Super Bowl era to allow 500 yards in three straight games.\n\nWith running backs Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, wide receiver Michael Thomas and even Brees himself scoring in the six-touchdown romp, New Orleans moved on to 8-1 for the season to match the Rams and Kansas City Chiefs as the only NFL teams with just one loss.\n\n\"We just found our swag, we found our stride,\" said Kamara after the win. \"This team is persistent, consistent, we take advantage of opportunity.\n\n\"We execute and we make sure we handle our business, from top to bottom, no matter who's in.

Kelly, 22, pulled off a series of superb saves in Sunday's goalless draw with league leaders Celtic.\n\nDefenders - Tavernier, Devlin, Findlay, Taylor\n\nAnother goal and a couple of assists in Sunday's 7-1 mauling of Motherwell to add to James Tavernier's already impressive total. The Rangers captain has netted all eight penalties he's taken this season. This latest one had an added degree of difficulty in that he had to take it twice. Tavernier just doesn't miss.\n\nFormer Hamilton captain Michael Devlin is proving to be a hugely significant signing for Derek McInnes, and his inclusion in the Scotland squad confirms his pace of progress. The much-improved Aberdeen defence has lost only one goal in the last four games and that was a crazily-conceded penalty.\n\nKilmarnock boss Stevie Clarke was pleasantly surprised that former Celtic youngster Stuart Findlay didn't get a better offer in the summer than a permanent switch from Newcastle to Rugby Park. Not that he was complaining. The 23-year-old central defender delivered another top performance at Tynecastle on Saturday as Kilmarnock moved to within two points of the Premiership.\n\nGreg Taylor featured in a fascinating head-to-head with Hearts winger Calumn Morrison at the weekend and it was the Kilmarnock youngster who came out on top. Another example of a player who's been given a specific job to do by Clarke and who consistently delivers the goods.\n\nMidfielders - Wright, Arfield, Jacobs, Mackay-Steven\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Watch: Mackay-Steven scores terrific winner\n\nDrey Wright made the cut for me last weekend and he keeps his place courtesy of another outstanding showing. The former Colchester winger tormented Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon all day long at McDiarmid Park and created the first two goals.\n\nScott Arfield turned in a complete midfield performance, a constant driving force and scored two of Rangers seven goals against Motherwell on Sunday. Shame he's captaining Canada rather than playing for Scotland. Can't believe he wasn't capped while he was playing for Burnley in the English Premier League.\n\nKeaghan Jacobs is perpetual motion in the Livingston midfield and was one big reason for a big result at home to Celtic on Sunday. He's had two spells and 10 years in the Livingston first team, having come through the club's youth development system, and he typifies what they're all about.\n\nGary Mackay Steven is a joy to watch when he's at the top of his game. Produced a moment of quality to win a drab match against Hibs at Pittodrie on Friday night. Must surely have a part to play for Scotland in the upcoming Nations League double header.\n\nForwards - Grezda, Kennedy\n\nSt Johnstone are Matty Kennedy's 10th club and he's just turned 24. The move to Perth is working well and he was a top performer when he was switched into a central striking role against Hamilton on Saturday. A clinical finish for the third goal and he smacked a 25 yarder against the crossbar.\n\nEros Grezda enjoyed scoring his first goal for Rangers so much that he headed in a second in Sunday's 7-1 home win against Motherwell. The Albanian attacker's move to Ibrox got off to a slow start because of injury but he now looks ready to make a serious impact.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright W MIDS CTU\n\nThree people have been convicted of belonging to the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Adam Thomas, 22, and his partner Claudia Patatas, 38, were found guilty with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, of being members of the far-right group - which was proscribed under anti-terror laws after it celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.\n\nThe BBC can now tell the story of National Action and the threat posed by its members.\n\nIt appeared to be a normal home.\n\nThe property, in a quiet part of an Oxfordshire town, was occupied by a couple who had just welcomed their first child into the world.\n\nNeighbours sometimes saw the pair taking their baby out in a pram.\n\nThe male, who often dressed in combat trousers, worked as a security guard. The woman - a part-time wedding photographer - had, until recently, worked in a clothes shop.\n\nBut inside their house Adam Thomas and his Portuguese partner Claudia Patatas had created a disturbing world.\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU Image caption Adam Thomas\n\nTheir bedroom was strewn with weapons - machetes, crossbows, an axe under the bed, a Nazi-style dagger.\n\nIn the hallway were pendants bearing a black sun - a symbol associated with the SS and the occult - and the insignia of the Ku Klux Klan. Cushions emblazoned with swastikas decorated the lounge. In the kitchen, there was a swastika-shaped pastry cutter.\n\nThe fridge was adorned with a poster by the banned neo-Nazi group National Action, declaring 'Britain is ours - the rest must go'.\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU Image caption Adam Thomas with his son\n\nA memory card hidden beneath a floorboard under the dining table contained several startling photographs of the couple.\n\nIn one, Thomas holds the flag of Nazi Germany while Patatas cradles their baby. In another, mother and baby are with a different man, Darren Fletcher, who performs a Nazi salute while both adults hold the flag.\n\nImage caption Darren Fletcher, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas\n\nOther images found on a mobile phone show Thomas dressed in the distinctive white costume of the KKK, looking down at his son through the eyeholes of a white, peaked hood.\n\nThe baby, a little over a month old at the time, had been given the middle name Adolf by his parents - in tribute to the leader of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe pictures were found by counter terrorism detectives who arrived at the property early in the morning of 3 January this year to arrest Thomas and Patatas for membership of National Action - a group that had been banned under terrorism legislation in December 2016.\n\nImage copyright HOPE NOT HATE Image caption Alex Davies (l) and Ben Raymond\n\nNational Action was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24.\n\nAt the time, Raymond, a recent politics graduate from the University of Essex and avowed neo-Nazi, was living in Bognor Regis. After university, he had drifted into a job as a double-glazing salesman and would go on to work at a job centre, assisting claimants.\n\nMuch of his free time was spent online immersed in disturbing extreme right-wing content. He designed memes, edited videos, and wrote long diatribes, including for the obscure Integralist Party, which was seeking a \"nationwide fascist army\" for its \"racial religion that inspires and demands fanaticism\".\n\nImage caption Ben Raymond\n\nIt was that online activity that first attracted Davies, a University of Warwick student from Carmarthen and member of the British National Party. By then, the party was in steep decline from its best ever performance in European elections four years earlier.\n\nThe pair believed that, in recent years, British far-right organisations had diluted their message by seeking to appeal beyond their core support.\n\nNational Action's founders determined that, in contrast, the group would be unashamedly racist and overtly neo-Nazi.\n\nImage caption Alex Davies\n\nIt had all the characteristics of post-war neo-Nazism - hatred of non-white and Jewish people, a worldview entirely based on racism, veneration of white \"Aryans\", and lionisation of the Nazi era and its worst war criminals.\n\nDavies was eventually forced out of Warwick university for his far-right political activities and moved back to Wales, where he eventually found work as an insurance salesman.\n\nThe pair believed young people across the UK would eagerly embrace the group's toxic blend of Hitler worship, Holocaust denial, and malicious conspiracy theories.\n\nIn reality, it would never exceed 100 members and those it did attract were a disparate set of fanatics united by various deviancies and irrational hatreds.\n\nNo attempt was made at engaging in democratic politics, with the organisation instead regarding itself as a youth-based street movement. Its logo was strikingly similar to the paramilitary arm of the Nazi party - the Sturmabteilung, or SA\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU\n\nRecruitment focused on those in their teens and 20s, although some of those targeted were children of secondary school age.\n\nThe group's strategy initially involved leafleting university campuses. But it soon turned to organising aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations, with activities chronicled on the group's website and social media channels.\n\nAs it grew, National Action developed into a clandestine network of small, regional networks, with senior figures in each cooperating at a national level.\n\nImage caption National Action regional map\n\nMembers, who dressed in black during demonstrations, promoted the idea that the UK was on the brink of a \"race war\" and that a predatory elite was deliberately encouraging immigration in an attempt to destroy the native white population.\n\nThe group claimed to be patriotic, but was hostile to all domestic institutions, the rule of law, the democratic process, and everyone who did not share its worldview.\n\nPoliticians and other public servants were a particular focus of hatred.\n\nDuring one speech, senior National Action member Matthew Hankinson said they would ensure that \"traitors\" ended up \"hanging from lampposts\".\n\n\"We must be ruthless - and if innocent people are cut down in the process, then so be it,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock Image caption Matthew Hankinson\n\nThe organisation was openly genocidal and said that all Jewish and non-white people would have to go. In one document it declared: \"It is with glee that we will enact the final solution across Europe.\"\n\nBut National Action did not restrict itself to admiration for the Nazis. Its members also took inspiration from the Khmer Rouge, the brutal regime that ruled Cambodia in the late 1970s under the Marxist leader Pol Pot; the radical right-wing Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik; and even the Islamic State group.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Anders Breivik\n\nOnline, the group announced: \"We are the white jihad\" and \"Our motto is 'Long Live Death!' because only those who are willing to die for their beliefs are truly alive.\"\n\nThe logic of such ideas ends in violence - and violence, both planned and executed, is what they generated.\n\nIn 2015, Zack Davies, a 25-year-old member from Mold, North Wales, used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist in a Tesco store because of his skin colour.\n\nDavies shouted, \"White power\" during the assault, for which he was later convicted of attempted murder.\n\nHe had earlier posed for a selfie in front of a National Action flag while holding a blade.\n\nImage copyright YOUTUBE Image caption Zack Davies\n\nThe following year Jack Coulson, a then 17-year-old member from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was arrested by counter terrorism police after posting images of a homemade pipe-bomb on Snapchat, along with threats against Muslims.\n\nCoulson, who would be convicted of making explosives, had joined National Action months earlier and was associating with older members both in person and online.\n\nImage copyright INSTAGRAM Image caption Jack Coulson dressed in a Nazi uniform\n\nOn the day in June 2016 that Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by the white supremacist Thomas Mair, the teenager took to social media to say: \"There's one less race traitor in Britain thanks to this man.\"\n\n\"He's a hero, we need more people like him to butcher the race traitors,\" Coulson continued.\n\nAn official National Action Twitter account also celebrated the murder, stating: \"Don't let this man's sacrifice go in vain,\" and \"Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad.\"\n\nImage copyright Twitter Image caption National Action tweet\n\nBy 2016, Christopher Lythgoe, a former regional leader for the North West, was heading up the whole group.\n\nRaymond and Davies remained influential figures, but it was Lythgoe, now 32, who sought to enforce structure and rigour on the entire organisation.\n\nHe lived with his parents in Warrington, worked infrequently in warehouses, and spent much of his time trying to turn National Action into a paramilitary-style organisation. He drew up detailed manuals, explaining things like how to carry flags correctly, and sent hectoring emails to other members.\n\nIn one, he wrote: \"Just a reminder guys that National Action now operates what I like to call a No-Deadweight Policy. That means everyone trains in case we need it. We don't carry anyone. No exceptions.\"\n\nHe added: \"Imagine what it will be like when we have 20, 30, 50 or more guys who can ALL punch unconscious an 18-stone adversary. AND we will fight as one disciplined body. That's what I would call formidable unit. So like I said, We all train.\"\n\nImage copyright NW CTU Image caption Christopher Lythgoe\n\nTraining included boxing, martial arts, and a series of outdoor training camps. One such camp - where participants were expected to \"drink mead and live like Vikings\" - ended in farce when one neo-Nazi ended up sleeping in a phone box to escape rain and snow.\n\nBut one need not consider the group's paramilitary fantasies realistic to find them troubling and dangerous.\n\nThe threat National Action posed came from the hatred it encouraged, which generated a very real threat to the general public and anyone chosen as a target by those it radicalised.\n\nA government assessment in late 2016 concluded the group was \"concerned in terrorism\", and described it as \"virulently racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic\". It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two.\n\nThe move, which made membership of National Action a criminal offence, was specifically linked to its glorification of terrorism and extreme violence.\n\nImage caption National Action promoting one of its \"conferences\"\n\nAhead of the ban, the group's leadership came together via a secure conference call, including Lythgoe, founders Raymond and Davies, and regional organisers.\n\nLythgoe insisted the group carry on as usual - just without the name or more obvious public trappings.\n\nIn the days before the ban, he sent his followers a series of emails.\n\n\"Long term we'll keep moving forward just as we have been,\" stated one.\n\nAnother, sent to the regional leaders, said: \"Make sure you maintain contact with ALL your members. Reassure them that they will be personally ok as long as they don't promote NA from Friday on. Make sure that they understand that the SUBSTANCE of NA is the people, our talents, the bonds between us, our ideas, and our sustained force of will. All of that will continue into the future. We're just shedding one skin for another. All genuinely revolutionary movements in the past have needed to exist partly underground. These are exciting times.\"\n\nOne of those on Lythgoe's mailing list was Alex Deakin, leader for the Midlands.\n\nLess than two hours after getting the email, Deakin used the encrypted messaging app Telegram to create a chat group that became his main regional organising tool for National Action after the ban.\n\nHe called it the Triple KKK Mafia, a reference to the Ku Klux Klan. Over time, the chat group would have as many as 21 people in it.\n\nHe created another one - called Inner - which contained a select band of seven from the larger chat group.\n\nImage copyright Facebook (r) Image caption Alex Deakin\n\nDeakin, now 24, from Birmingham, was a university student who had been radicalised on the internet.\n\nIn September 2016, after spending two years studying in Aberystwyth, he dropped out and transferred to a history course at the University of Coventry.\n\nHe told one contact his path to National Action involved \"getting redpilled by forums, spending years arguing online, and then finally deciding to take action when this group impressed me\".\n\nDeakin regularly reported back to Lythgoe and co-founder Raymond, telling them about his efforts to recruit new members, organise existing ones, and spread National Action propaganda.\n\nImage caption Alex Deakin\n\nMessages in the year before the ban show the extent of his delusional ambitions.\n\nIn an exchange about targeting working class cities, he wrote: \"We should move to radicalise these areas, turning them into NI [Northern Irish] style sectarian ghettoes would be the first target to fermenting race war.\"\n\nIn correspondence with Lythgoe, Deakin stated: \"Like the IRA and Viet Cong we'd need to have embedded local support among the communities we'd fight in; streets and cul-de-sacs would function as barracks as supportive locals would shelter us, and it would be necessary to fade into the background at moment's notice.\"\n\nThe nature of such conversations only intensified once the group had been proscribed.\n\nIn the Midlands, the organisation ceased overt campaigning, but members continued to communicate, meet up, seek new recruits, and encourage one another's worst tendencies.\n\nThere were explicit references to the the fact that National Action still existed.\n\nIn one message, Deakin said: \"Anyway the Midlands group continues under the name Triple K Mafia.\"\n\nIn another, Adam Thomas wrote: \"So since NA has been destroyed, the leadership generally of NA agreed it's to be disbanded. No attempt at revival. But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this... Midlands will continue the fight alone.\"\n\nMessages in the Telegram group, numbering in the thousands, show members using violent racist language, discussing their desire for a \"race war\", and fantasising about the murder of those they hated.\n\nDeakin wrote that all Jewish people should be \"burned\", and that Chinese and black people should be turned into \"biofuel\".\n\nA member from Wolverhampton, Darren Fletcher, 28, referred to Thomas Mair, the killer of Jo Cox, when he asked: \"Why aren't there more Mairs out there? We need a good few hundred of them to sort out these anti-white MPs.\"\n\nImage caption Darren Fletcher and Adam Thomas\n\nFletcher, a truck driver and old friend of Adam Thomas, had once been jailed after posting videos on YouTube of himself on stage at an extremist music event dressed in a KKK outfit, hanging a life-sized golliwog doll from a noose.\n\nWhen Fletcher wrote that people in government should be killed, he received support from Thomas, who said: \"I agree bump them off but there's 600MPs unless you take them all down in one go they will just replace each other.\"\n\nClaudia Patatas, who studied to postgraduate level in Portugal before moving to the UK over a decade ago, had spent years as a marketing professional. In public she provided bland quotes to corporate journals, while in private she wrote messages exclaiming: \"All Jews must be put to death\" and \"bring back those concentration camps.\"\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU Image caption Claudia Patatas and a KKK flag in her home\n\nShe told members of the group that \"Adolf is life\" and was enthusiastic about holding a celebration for Hitler's birthday, recalling one she had attended in Lisbon years earlier.\n\n\"We had a cake with the fuhrer face,\" she described, before adding, \"I did struggle to slice his face\".\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU Image caption Claudia Patatas\n\nPerhaps the most dangerous member of the group was a serving lance corporal in the British Army.\n\nMikko Vehvilainen, now 34, joined the Army in 2012, having earlier spent time in the navy in Finland, the homeland of his father.\n\nIn an email to one friend, he wrote: \"I'm only in to learn useful combat skills.\"\n\nThe married father of young children, an adherent of a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity called Christian Identity, was a senior National Action member obsessed with ideas about the collapse of civilisation and racial war.\n\nImage caption Mikko Vehvilainen\n\nIn a diary entry last year, beneath the heading \"key points for leadership meeting\", he referred to \"later stages terrorism, civil disorder, destruction of infrastructure and power grid\".\n\nIn another document, he said there a was a need to be \"prepared to fight and die for your race in a possible last stand for our survival\".\n\n\"Every part of me wants war. There is no other way,\" he wrote in one message on Telegram.\n\nHis personal weapons collection, stockpiled for what he appeared to regard as imminent conflicts, included legally held firearms, as well as knives, machetes, knuckle dusters, a crossbow, a bow and arrow, pepper spray, handcuffs, and a so-called war hammer bearing the Biblical inscription: \"There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked.\"\n\nImage caption Vehvilainen's weapon collection - and photo of him performing a Nazi salute\n\nThe solider, latterly based at the Army's Welsh headquarters in Powys, actively sought recruits from those serving under him in the Royal Anglian Regiment.\n\nThree men holding the rank of private were invited into the main Telegram group after Vehvilainen told Deakin they were \"committed\" Nazis.\n\nOne of them, Mark Barrett, wrote racist messages in the chat group, and had Vehvilainen, another of the soldiers, and a National Action member called Nathan Pryke, over to his Army property where they spent an evening firing arrows at a burning cross in the back garden.\n\nVehvilainen, who served in Afghanistan, was also keen that civilian neo-Nazis join him in the forces, telling them: \"If we get enough of us into the Army, we'll be in the right place when things start to collapse.\"\n\nHe wrote in the Inner chat group that National Action members should focus on gaining \"military and key civil positions\".\n\nImage caption Nathan Pryke\n\nFour National Action members in his circle had been, or were, attempting to join the Army: Alex Deakin, Adam Thomas, Nathan Pryke, a 27-year-old a van driver from Cambridgeshire, and Joel Wilmore, 24, originally from Lincolnshire, who had served in the Territorial Army before entering a sensitive job as an information security expert. This involved acting as an \"ethical hacker\" in order to test the strength of organisational IT systems.\n\nVehvilainen advised Thomas and offered to act as a referee of good character.\n\nThomas, in turn, asked if he could buy a gun from Vehvilainen and whether anybody would notice if assault rifles were stolen from his base.\n\nBut, before anything more could happen, the group was disrupted.\n\nFor several months, detectives from West Midlands Police had been investigating an incident in July 2016 during which several men had pasted National Action stickers at the Aston University campus in Birmingham.\n\nIn spring 2017, some of the suspects were arrested, including Alex Deakin.\n\nIncriminating chat groups were found on his phone, and that of another man who cannot be named for legal reasons.\n\nAfter being released under investigation, Deakin sent a panicked email to several National Action contacts. \"My seized phone is full of texts that will mark me as an organizer,\" he wrote. \"I understand if you despise me for this sloppiness (it really couldn't have been worse if I tried).\"\n\nImage copyright FACEBOOK Image caption Alex Deakin\n\nDeakin's \"sloppiness\" led to three trials at Birmingham Crown Court this year, many details of which can only be reported now that the final one has concluded.\n\nThe first, which ended in April, saw Deakin himself, Vehvilainen and soldier Mark Barrett stand trial accused of National Action membership.\n\nBarrett was acquitted, but his co-defendants were convicted and received eight-year prison sentences.\n\nThe three had been arrested in September 2017, along with the other two soldiers in the chat group, both of whom were released without charge.\n\nOnly Barrett elected to give evidence, telling the court that he had not joined National Action despite being in the Telegram chat group and that he regretted his racist postings.\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU Image caption Alex Deakin and Mikko Vehvilainen\n\nDeakin was also convicted of two counts of possessing documents useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism - including bomb-making manuals and an instructional book for white extremists - which were found on his laptop.\n\nHe was further convicted of distributing a terrorist publication, for sending a document called Ethnic Cleansing Operations to the National Action co-founder Ben Raymond and two other contacts.\n\nVehvilainen was cleared of stirring up racial hatred for using a Christian Identity online forum to write racist posts. Among other things, he wrote: \"I have vowed to fight the Jew forever in any way possible,\" and used the word \"beasts\" to refer to black people.\n\nReferring to his position in the Army, he had written: \"There are ways around everything and I've simply learned to avoid beasts.\"\n\nHe added: \"The sooner they're eliminated the better.\"\n\nIt is understood that both Vehvilainen and Barrett have since been discharged from the Army. The other two arrested soldiers were disciplined but not discharged, although one has since left voluntarily.\n\nLt Col Jackie Fletcher, from the Army personnel branch, described them as \"exceptional cases\".\n\n\"These are very rare in the Army,\" she said. \"The Army's value and standards are very clear for soldiers and any individual found to breach those value and standards will have action taken against them.\"\n\nThe second trial, which ended in May, saw Deakin and three other men convicted of stirring up racial hatred in relation to the sticker campaign at Aston University - Daniel Bogunovic, 27, a warehouse worker and beekeeper from Leicester, Chad Wiliams-Allen, 27, a pre-ban National Action member and welder from West Bromwich, as well as a man in his early 20s who cannot be identified for legal reasons.\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU Image caption Chad Williams-Allen, Daniel Bogunovic and Alex Deakin\n\nIn the third case, that of Thomas, Patatas and Bogunovic, three other defendants pleaded guilty to membership of National Action in pre-trial hearings.\n\nThey were Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke, and Joel Wilmore. Wilmore also admitted to possessing terrorist information, namely a document called Homemade Molotov Cocktails.\n\nThomas, who was also convicted of possessing a bomb-making manual, was the only one to give evidence.\n\nImage copyright W MIDS CTU Image caption Adam Thomas, Claudia Patatas, Daniel Bogunovic, Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke and Joel Wilmore\n\nThe former Amazon security guard admitted being a racist and told jurors he had been exposed to such beliefs from a young age, adding that his stepfather was in a \"white power band\" and had started shaving Thomas's head at the age of five.\n\nHe also described telling a female Holocaust survivor, whom he visited with a government de-radicalisation mentor, that he \"couldn't see\" how she could have endured the WW2 Nazi death camps.\n\nThomas told jurors that, aged 18, he went to Israel and considered converting to Judaism because it would have allowed him to join the Israeli military\n\nThe BBC has spoken to people who knew Thomas in Israel.\n\nDavid Simpkins, who shared a room with him at the Machon Meir yeshiva in Jerusalem, said his roommate used the name Avi Ben Abraham.\n\nSimpkins said Thomas had described a \"horrible childhood which he characterised as a situation of constantly being bullied, growing up with far-right British extremists who were also neo-Nazis\".\n\nThomas disclosed that he first \"started learning about Judaism to discover why he was supposed to hate them,\" Simpkins recalled.\n\nHe described Thomas as \"extremely intelligent\" but said he had \"an extreme approach to Judaism\" and wanted to join a small fringe group which regards most Jewish people as heretics.\n\n\"The rabbis decided that Adam needed to deal with his childhood professionally and return to convert with a clear head,\" he said. \"He was making the common mistake many who desire conversion make, which is to replace one psychological extreme with another.\"\n\nAvishai Grosser, who works with converts, told the BBC that Thomas, who \"knew big proportions of the Torah by heart\", dropped out of several conversion programmes and eventually ended up on the streets before returning to the UK.\n\nIt is understood that, after he returned, he told people in far-right circles that his time in Israel related to an involvement with the white supremacist Christian Identity movement.\n\nIt was around this time that he got to know Patatas through National Action chat groups. They met for the first time at a pub social in December 2016 and soon moved in together.\n\nImage caption Adam Thomas in Israel\n\nBefore proscription, National Action may have been \"perceived as just one of those groups who incited racial hatred and were racist\", says Det Chief Supt Matt Ward from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit.\n\nHe explains how his team's understanding of the threat posed by National Action has \"changed considerably\" during their investigations.\n\nEvents after it was banned, he says, show \"a really dangerous, well-structured organisation at the heart of a neo-Nazi ideology that seeks to divide communities, is preparing to instigate and wage a race war within the United Kingdom and has spent years acquiring skills, tactics, weapons, recruiting and training people to be able to do that.\"\n\nAs in the Midlands, National Action had continued operating covertly in the North West, but had continued more overtly in several other English regions and Scotland using the aliases NS131 and Scottish Dawn.\n\nThere are ongoing inquiries into people associated with the group, and several trials have already taken place elsewhere in the UK.\n\nAt the Old Bailey in July, Christopher Lythgoe and Matthew Hankinson, both from the North West, were convicted of membership offences in a trial that saw another man plead guilty to threatening to kill a female police officer, and preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete in order to kill Labour MP Rosie Cooper.\n\nMr Justice Jay, sentencing Lythgoe and Hankinson to eight and six years in prison respectively, said their \"truly evil and dystopian vision\" could never \"have been achieved through the activities of National Action, a very small group operating at the very periphery of far-right wing extremism\".\n\nBut he said, \"The real risk to society inheres instead in the carrying out of isolated acts of terror,\" inspired by what he described as the group's \"perverted ideology\".\n\nWhat of the National Action founders who inspired such hatred?\n\nWe found Ben Raymond and Alex Davies living at separate addresses in Swansea.\n\nBoth were arrested in September 2017 on suspicion of membership of National Action but have been told they will not be charged. Raymond was also arrested on suspicion of possessing terrorist material and remains under investigation for that.\n\nThe police enquiries relate to their involvement with the far-right group NS131, which had been created after National Action had been banned. Last year, it was also proscribed.\n\nImage caption NS131 promotional image\n\nThe men have continued to make public pronouncements.\n\nEarlier this year, Davies used an online neo-Nazi radio station to call for far-right activists to engage in a campaign of \"direct action\" against the Labour MP who succeeded Jo Cox as the MP for Batley and Spen.\n\nRaymond used the same radio station to discuss the trial of Lythgoe and Hankinson while it was ongoing and declare the defendants \"innocent men\".\n\nThe BBC asked both Raymond and Davies for an interview, but they declined.\n\nWe wanted to ask whether they accept any responsibility for all that has happened and about their relationship with National Action members since proscription.\n\nFor example, a private gym in Warrington set up by group leader Lythgoe for violent training sessions was made possible by \u00a31,500 given to him by Davies - who then visited it along with members of the group after the ban.\n\nRaymond continued communicating with members of National Action, post-proscription, via encrypted emails and applications.\n\nHe was an active member of both the Midlands Telegram groups - musing on racial theory, engaging in anti-Semitism, discussing his correspondence with neo-Nazis abroad, and lecturing the others on the threat from infiltrators.\n\nOn the day National Action was banned, Raymond had emailed several contacts, including Deakin and Lythgoe, to say he was \"super excited about working on all the new projects\".

That's a few million pounds, that's incredibly important, but right now I'm focused on the jobs.\n\n\"All the other grants they met the conditions, but the most recent one they've only drawn down some of that, so that would have to be paid back.

I would argue those first three rounds [against Usyk] were the finest three rounds of his entire career.\n\nIn the Usyk fight, the two Haye fights and Makabu fight, there were a lot of tactics involved and a lot of power, but what was also needed was an awful lot of heart and guts.\n\nHe suffered a broken hand against Haye, he was under steady pressure against Usyk and against Makabu he was on the floor and had his nose broken. He drew on a combination of grit and bravery and there also has to be a little bit of ridiculous fearlessness and heart.\n\nThe top ones push themselves to and through pain barriers. They get abused and get hurt and hit. They put themselves in danger's way. That is what Bellew has done repeatedly.\n\nSure, he annoys and infuriates people sometimes with his repeated soundbites. But, at the end of the day, he has never let us down when it comes to getting in there and risking it all. All boxers are risk takers and Bellew proved himself to be a very big risk-taker.\n\nThree years ago if you'd have said to Tony, 'you'll have four more fights, win a world title and make \u00a35m', he'd have sold his granny. The bottom line is it might be nearer \u00a320m in two and half years.\n\nHe has catapulted himself by grabbing that microphone, taking control of his career, telling us what we wanted to see, delivering what we wanted to see and doing what he said. He stepped above those lines and started to make those vast sums.\n\nOleksandr Usyk has won his 16 professional fights\n\n'He can compete as a heavyweight, no two ways about it'\n\nIn his past three outings, Usyk has now beaten Latvia's Mairis Bredis in Riga, Russia's Murat Gassiev in Moscow and Bellew in Manchester, earning and defending the IBF, WBA, WBO and WBC titles in the process.\n\nThe 31-year-old - who has four wins in 14 months - said it was \"too early\" to threaten moving up a division for a shot at unified world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua.\n\nUsyk is 6ft 3in and weighed in for the Bellew fight at 14st 2lb. Joshua is 6ft 6in and weighed 17st 8lb for September's victory against Alexander Povetkin.\n\nCostello: It does seem the momentum is beginning to quicken for a contest between Usyk and Joshua if they keep winning. Where he has to find the balance is between the weight and how many of those skills does he deplete by putting on extra poundage.\n\nBunce: There are plenty of heavyweights he can find that out against. He is not Anthony Joshua's next opponent, but every heavyweight will fancy it. They will consider him a fantastic scalp.\n\nHe can compete as a heavyweight, no two ways about it. Can he compete against the 6ft 6in plus of Deontay Wilder, Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury? I don't know. But Usyk's frames allows him to carry more weight.\n\nThese three or four giants at the moment [Joshua, Wilder, Fury] are yet to be beaten by ordinary men, that's the slight problem. But if an Evander Holyfield or a Mike Tyson at his peak was around, you think they'd find a way to do it. So perhaps Oleksandr Usyk can find a way to do it.\n\nBefore the Bellew fight, we said he [Usyk] is the guy in late 2019 and 2020 who will be in the heavyweight mix.

The fact that the face of knife crime they project nationally is black youths, as I said this morning implies institutional racism and criminalises a whole race, fitting their agenda to bring back racially-profiled stop and search.\"\n\nHe said all stop and search achieved was to cause \"more division, friction and lack of trust\" of police.\n\nWhile speaking on GMB, he added that while he was stabbed, he does not see himself as a victim.\n\nIn London alone, there have been 119 homicides this year - including 69 fatal stabbings.

With the riches and the opportunities available elsewhere it was always a racing certainty that Hogg would move on when his current contract expired. At the age of 26, and having given every season of his professional life to Glasgow, it was time.\n\nWhen he makes his move - Exeter Chiefs would appear to be the club that has got him - he'll be paid a salary more in tandem with a player of his class, a wedge that the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) couldn't match no more than they could match the fortunes Racing threw at Finn Russell before him.\n\nSome of this has to do with money, of course, but much of it has to do with ambition, too. In any reckoning of the world's great full-backs, Hogg at his best would be in the conversation.\n\nHis talent doesn't chime with his trophies, however. He has just one - a Pro12 from three years ago. That's a paltry return.\n\nHe has never played in a European final or a European semi-final. He has appeared in one Champions Cup quarter-final and that was a mismatch against Saracens in 2017. It's not enough - and Hogg can't have liked the chances of it improving in the future had he stayed at Glasgow.\n\nJust like the last time his contract was up for renewal the SRU would have put its best offer on the table and if its renegotiations worked once they were never going to work twice. The landscape has changed and there's more money out there now for the Hoggs of this world.\n\nHe's departing to explore a terrain where, yes, the deal is better but also where, in the pursuit of winning big trophies, the odds are more in his favour.\n\nHe'll be sorely missed by Glasgow, but this is just another reminder of their place in the grand scheme of things. When the monied leagues, fuelled by benefactors and television dough, want your top boys, they have a fair old chance of getting them.\n\nHogg's exit should have a minimal impact on Gregor Townsend. There will be the inconvenience of not being able to play him and rest him as he sees fit but there's also the likely benefit of Hogg being galvanised anew by a fresh challenge as Russell has undoubtedly been in France.\n\nHogg and Russell 'ambassadors as much as players'\n\nHogg and Finn Russell have provided 'reasons for turning up at Scotstoun' to watch Glasgow\n\nTownsend won't have many fears about Hogg going south, but plenty at Glasgow will be fretting, head coach Dave Rennie possibly chief among them. What we're seeing is the best parts of their machine falling off piece by piece: first Leone Nakarawa in 2016, then Russell this year and now Hogg next year.\n\nThree men who quickened the pulse - gone and going. Glasgow have worked hard to establish a brand at Scotstoun. It's a fun place to go. A good day out. If the marquee names keep vanishing though, the fun stops and the results worsen and the whole thing runs the risk of collapsing into mediocrity.\n\nGlasgow couldn't afford to keep Russell or Hogg. Everybody gets that. But these are not just rugby players they've lost and are about to lose. Russell and Hogg and Nakarawa before them were reasons for turning up at Scotstoun in the first place, reasons why kids turned up.\n\nThey were, and are, ambassadors as much as players. Their loss is not just felt on the field, it's felt off it as well. Losing your key assets doesn't only stifle growth, it sends it into reverse unless you can find new stars - and quickly.\n\nGlasgow and Edinburgh want to kick-on as clubs, but the reality is that they exist in order to feed the cash cow that is the international game.\n\nNakarawa wasn't replaced by a big talent from abroad that illustrated ambition, but by Scott Cummings, a promising young player from home. Russell wasn't replaced by an Aaron Cruden or anybody else in Russell's classy ilk, but by Adam Hastings, a talented work-in-progress.\n\nThere's an obvious logic in that. Why would you want to put roadblocks in the way of your best young home-grown players? How is Hastings supposed to show his stuff if he's perpetually playing second fiddle?\n\nThat kind of thinking makes sense for the international team as they attempt to deepen the pool of players for the future, but it compromises Glasgow, who want to achieve in the here and now.\n\nAnd the business of replacing Hogg when the time comes? There's no obvious internal candidate, no tyro-in-waiting. If the SRU had in the region of \u00a3400,000 a year for the 'Keep Hoggy Campaign' then there are multiple reasons why they should lump the lot into a fund to land as heavy a hitter as they can from Rennie's book of contacts.\n\nElsewhere in the Pro14 the big clubs are moving forward. Leinster's academy mass-produces phenomenal rugby players but when they needed to go into the market, they got Scott Fardy and James Lowe, two hugely influential operators.\n\nIn the summer, Munster brought in Tadhg Beirne and Joey Carbery, two Irish internationals. In Wales, the Ospreys got George North and Scott Williams. Edinburgh landed John Barclay and others.\n\nGlasgow have recruited, but not at that kind of level. In replacing Hogg, for the good of the team and the people who pay to watch them, the SRU needs to show a little aspiration now. The supporters need to be convinced that beyond this season there is still going to be a title-chase in Glasgow despite the wounding departure of another favourite son.\n\nThe SRU may have been powerless in trying to keep Hogg. In replacing him, it needs to be bold.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright West Mids Police Image caption Claudia Patatas and Adam Thomas named their baby Adolf out of \"admiration\" for Hitler\n\nA couple who named their baby after Adolf Hitler have been found guilty of being members of a banned terrorist group.\n\nAdam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, along with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, from Leicester, were convicted of being in National Action.\n\nBirmingham Crown Court heard the couple gave their child the middle name Adolf in honour of the Nazi leader.\n\nJurors saw images of Thomas in Ku Klux Klan robes while cradling his baby.\n\nThe Neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, founded in 2013, was outlawed under anti-terror legislation three years later after it celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.\n\n'White supremacy'\n\nProsecutors said the Midlands chapter of the group \"shed one skin for another\" and \"rebranded\" after being banned.\n\nThey said the case was about \"a specific type of terror... born out of fanatical and tribal belief in white supremacy\".\n\nThomas told the court that the pictures showing him wearing KKK clothing were \"just play\", but he admitted being a racist.\n\nThomas was also found guilty of having a copy of terrorist manual the Anarchist Cookbook.\n\nImage copyright West Mids Police Image caption Daniel Bogunovic, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas stayed in National Action after it was banned\n\nThomas and Patatas had two machetes, one with a serrated 18in (46cm) blade, in the bedroom where their baby son slept.\n\nA police search of their home in January also found one of two crossbows just a few feet from the baby's crib, the jury was told.\n\nAlso found was a pastry cutter shaped like a swastika in a kitchen drawer, as well as pendants, flags and clothing emblazoned with symbols of the Nazi-era SS and National Action.\n\nBarnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said a deleted Skype log was recovered from Thomas's laptop.\n\nHe said the messages sent between two parties spoke of National Action being \"destroyed\", with its leaders agreeing to disband with \"no attempt at revival\".\n\nNational Action\n\nThe group was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24\n\nIt was intended to be an explicitly neo-Nazi party\n\nRaymond was a politics graduate from the University of Essex, and Davies was a Welsh former member of the British National Party\n\nNational Action shunned democratic politics, regarding itself instead as a youth-based street movement\n\nIt is believed it never had more than 100 members\n\nIts activities involved leafleting university campuses, aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations\n\nIn 2015, 25-year-old member Zack Davies used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist and was jailed for attempted murder\n\nAfter the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, an official National Action Twitter account posted: \"Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad\"\n\nThe group was banned later that year after the government concluded it was \"concerned in terrorism\"\n\nIt became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two\n\nReading from the log, Mr Jameson said: \"But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this and we've renamed ourselves the Thule Combat League.\n\n\"Traitors.

Fulham 12 1 2 9 -20 5\n\nSaints game could decide Jokanovic future\n\nIt does not help Jokanovic is that he clearly does not have a clue what his best team is yet - he has chopped and changed players for every game so far.\n\nBut you could not fault their effort against the Reds, and there were some encouraging signs in that game despite the result.\n\nJokanovic has made 33 line-up changes in Fulham's 12 Premier League games this season - another of the promoted teams, Wolves, have made two. Against Liverpool, he brought Cyrus Christie and Alfie Mawson into his back-four, and recalled Calum Chambers as a defensive midfielder\n\nDefensively, they definitely looked a better side than when I have seen them before this season.\n\nThey created chances too, but it is not much good if you are doing all of that and still being beaten.\n\nIt is refreshing that no Premier League clubs have changed their managers yet, but clearly Jokanovic's future depends on results improving quickly.\n\nHe is not the only one. Fulham's next game is at home to Southampton on 24 November, and Saints boss Mark Hughes is also under pressure.\n\nThat is a massive game for both clubs and both managers and if the Fulham board are considering Jokanovic's position, then I think it is one he has to win.\n\nAt last Fulham find a formation that works?\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Jokanovic bemoans referee's decisions\n\nSouthampton boss Hughes felt a big decision went against his side when they had a goal disallowed in their draw with Watford on Saturday and Jokanovic was also unhappy with the way his side fell behind at Anfield.\n\nJokanovic had a point too. The officials were right to disallow Aleksandar Mitrovic's header because he was just offside - by his shoulder - but Liverpool's goal 14 seconds later should not have stood either.\n\nThe ball was still rolling when Alisson took the free-kick to launch the attack that ended with Mohamed Salah scoring and, if we had video assistant referee (VAR) in the Premier League, that would have been spotted.\n\nSo Fulham were unlucky to fall behind, especially after looking far more solid than usual up until then, and frustrating a strong Liverpool forward line.\n\nCalum Chambers was sitting in front of another new-look back four playing together for the first time, but looked like a more settled unit.\n\nIf Jokanovic is trying to find a formation that works defensively, then that was probably the biggest positive he can take away from the game.\n\nAt 0-0 they had some chances at the other end too, the best one falling to Ryan Sessegnon who ran clear but shot wide.\n\nFulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic did put the ball in the net but his header was disallowed for a marginal offside decision\n\nCreating opportunities is one thing, though, and taking them is another.\n\nThe Cottagers have now failed to score in their past four matches and scoring goals is becoming just as much of an issue for them as stopping them has been.\n\nIt is obvious they have been working on things at the back, because they made a slight improvement in that department at Anfield - now they have got two weeks to get better in attack too.\n\nEveryone at the bottom has got their own problems\n\nDespite their awful run, Fulham are only three points below Crystal Palace in 16th place, and everyone else down at the bottom of the table have got their own problems too.\n\nNewcastle have had two great wins to climb the table but before then they were struggling for goals, just like Crystal Palace and Saints.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Newcastle 2-1 Bournemouth: Three points massive boost for Magpies - Rafael Benitez\n\nBurnley were shipping goals all over the place until their 0-0 draw with Leicester on Saturday and although Cardiff and Huddersfield are triers, they lack quality.\n\nLooking at the table and what we have seen already this season, it is any three from the bottom seven who will be going down.\n\nJust above them, I think Wolves, Brighton and West Ham have got enough about them to stay out of trouble, but it is going to be a real scrap for survival for the rest.\n\nThings like confidence and momentum will play a big part, as we have seen in the past couple of weeks.\n\nNewcastle have gone from 20th to 16th after taking seven points from their past three games - but even one win is huge when you are desperate for points.\n\nIt is the same with Cardiff's win over Brighton this weekend, and the belief that they and the Magpies have got right now is the biggest difference between them and Fulham going into this international break.\n\nThings are even tighter at the bottom of the table than they are at the top, and this is a battle where nobody is going to be sure of safety until the very end of the season.\n\nAlan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"All options are on the table\" if there is a no deal Brexit, Starmer tells Today\n\nParliament will not allow the UK to leave the European Union without a negotiated agreement, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has claimed.\n\nAsked during a BBC interview whether MPs could prevent a no-deal exit, he replied \"absolutely\".\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested on Friday Brexit could not be stopped because the people had voted to leave.\n\nBut Sir Keir said if 400 or so MPs were opposed to a no-deal exit, they would be able to force the government's hand.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said no-one really knew what would happen if Parliament voted down any agreement reached between the UK and the EU in the coming weeks and it could open a \"Pandora's Box\".\n\nOne former cabinet minister, John Whittingdale, has suggested that Theresa May would have to step down if she \"staked her credibility\" on a deal which did not command the confidence of MPs.\n\nThe UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nThe two sides are trying to hammer out an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit in the coming days which could be put to a special summit of the 28 EU leaders at the end of November.\n\nThe EU's negotiator Michel Barnier told European ministers on Monday that intense negotiating efforts were continuing but no agreement had been reached and the EU must prepare for every possible scenario.\n\nArriving for the meeting in Brussels, Brexit minister Lord Callanan said the UK was trying hard to get a deal but claimed it had not set a \"particular deadline\" and we \"have to take time to make sure its right\".\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said preparations need to be made for all scenarios\n\nBut the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said if no agreement was reached imminently, the reality was that things would get \"more ominous\" for Mrs May.\n\nWhile the UK's no deal preparations would have to be intensified, he said there were fears it would be harder to get MPs' support if the crunch Commons vote on accepting or rejecting the deal did not happen until the start of 2019.\n\nLabour leaders have said they are unlikely to support any agreement as it stands, with Sir Keir telling BBC Radio 4's Today that \"there is no duty to vote for the wrong deal\".\n\nThe opposition has said it will press for a general election in the event of Parliament rejecting a deal but -

You try not to focus on it, but it's something that I was looking forward to doing again,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm delighted to score again and just pleased for the boys that we were able to put away a really dangerous Fiji side who could have caused us a lot of problems.\"\n\nSeymour scored 13 tries in his first 25 Tests, but only three in his next 19 after March 2016 until Saturday, when he became only the second Scotland player - after hooker George Turner against Canada this summer - to score a hat-trick since Chris Paterson's treble against Japan 14 years ago.\n\nHampered by injuries and having recently suffered a family bereavement, he has struggled to recapture the form that saw him selected for the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand.\n\n\"Since this time last year, roughly around the autumn, there have been a couple of things that have gone on that have made it quite a challenging year for me,\" Seymour said.\n\n\"I'm not wanting to talk about them. But, after having a good pre-season with Glasgow and getting back involved with the national side, it's been great.\"\n\nSeymour's hat-trick - taking him to 19 tries from his 45 Tests - also elevated him above club-mate Stuart Hogg into fourth on Scotland's all-time try-scoring list.\n\n\"He mentioned it in the changing room afterwards - that's a bonus. Brilliant,\" he said. \"It's always nice getting one over on Hoggy because it's probably the only one I've got.\n\n\"It just adds fuel to the competition between the two of us. He's got a few years on me, so I'm guessing he might be able to outdo me over the long run.\"\n\nScotland now prepare for a huge Test next Saturday against an in-form South Africa side, a team that evokes special memories for Seymour.\n\n\"I won my first cap against them (in 2013). That sticks strong in the memory. You never forget your first cap,\" he added.\n\n\"I remember the bus journey back from training and being told that I was playing. We've played them a few times since, in the World Cup and a couple of other times.\n\n\"They are always unbelievable games against South Africa. They are in really hot form at the moment.\n\n\"We need to make sure we are ready for what will be a very fierce contest next week.\"", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Chapron aimed a kick at Nantes' Diego Carlos in January\n\nA tumble to the turf, a rush of blood, a lashing out, and a long career unravels in an instant.\n\nTony Chapron speaks calmly now, as he looks back on the \"nightmare\" moment that essentially cost him his job as a referee in the French top flight. But he still has regrets.\n\nIt all happened back in January, during a Ligue 1 fixture between Nantes and Paris St-Germain.\n\nKylian Mbappe was breaking clear and everyone was racing back behind him, including Chapron.\n\nHe and Nantes player Diego Carlos collided. Chapron was inadvertently knocked over.\n\nStaggering to his feet, Chapron swung a boot at the defender.\n\nThen he sent the defender off.\n\nDiego Carlos' red card was rescinded after the game\n\nMost likely you will have seen the clip - Chapron says it feels like the whole world saw it.\n\nThe footage went viral and he was heavily criticised on social media. He was banned for six months by the French Football Federation and then decided to end his career as referee.\n\n\"I didn't want to kick him,\" he tells the BBC's World Football Podcast.\n\n\"It's a pity because I finished my career on this game, on this situation. It's difficult to accept after being a referee for 1,500 matches because in the moment it was just reflex.\n\n\"I'm a human and I felt a pain and I was scared. I was tired. It was not aggressive.\n\n\"I just fell down, someone pushed me and as a reflex I put my foot out and said, 'Hey guy, take care!'\n\n\"In fact, the reaction of the players and the coaches was, 'OK, this guy made a mistake, so what?'\n\n\"But for the media and social media it was a big affair. Because the referee should not act like this and I agree and apologise for my reaction.\"\n\nHe says he was treated more harshly than players who have instinctively lashed out, however.\n\n\"Just remember when Zinedine Zidane gave a headbutt in the 2006 World Cup final.\n\n\"He was a fantastic player, maybe one of the best in the world for many years. And the reaction in this situation with Zidane was not so big if you compare with my situation.\"\n\nEducating Zlatan\n\nChapron now works for French media and is free to say what he really thinks about the players he used to referee.\n\nOne story stands out.\n\n\"He is a very annoying guy, Zlatan Ibrahimovic,\" Chapron begins. \"Not only with referees, he was always blaming his team-mates, always trying to cause some trouble with the opponents.\n\nWhat Zlatan wants...\n\n\"He was a crazy guy. I think he's a fantastic player, but on the pitch he's someone else. And it was very difficult as a referee.\n\n\"I hope for him that he's a kind of actor, because he says so many things, crazy things, I hope he doesn't think what he says.\"\n\nIn 2015, Chapron was in charge when Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick for PSG in a victory over Lorient.\n\nAfter the match, the striker approached him. Chapron had the ball in his hands.\n\n... Zlatan doesn't always get\n\n\"He arrived close to me he just clicked his fingers and said; 'The ball!'\" Chapron says.\n\n\"I have four daughters and when we're together and they ask something, if we don't have the word 'please' at the end of the sentence, there is no reaction.\n\n\"So, it's the same, it's a kind of education. I think it was a kind of disrespect. There is something wrong with society if we forget the simple things such as 'please' and 'thank you'.\n\n\"It was the beginning of the Ibrahimovic show, because nobody says no to Zlatan. I was probably the only one.\"\n\nHaving given up his life as a referee, Tony Chapron remains philosophical when he looks back at his headline-making career.\n\n\"Winston Churchill once said, 'Success is to go from failure to failure and to keep smiling',\" he says.\n\n\"I think this is the way we must think as referee!\"", "Video\n\nNothing to be Written is a virtual reality (VR) experience that moves you between war trenches, hospitals, trains and anxiously waiting at home for field postcards sent by soldiers during World War One.\n\nBBC Click visited two Chelsea Pensioners, Michael Allen and Michael Paling asking them to put on VR headsets to try out the immersive journey and give their verdict.\n\nWhat would they make of it?\n\nProduced by BBC VR Hub, Nothing to be Written has been created jointly by composers, Anna Meredith, and the award-winning company of artists, 59 Productions.\n\nSee more at Click's website and @BBCClick.", "Image caption\n\nThe Daily Mail combines its commemoration of those who died 100 years ago with a contemporary plea. \"Treat TODAY'S heroes with the dignity they deserve,\" the paper says.

The spread of fake news can also undermine legitimate news because it erodes trust.\n\nBy analysing fake news messages on private networks like WhatsApp and Facebook, and surveying people in Nigeria, Kenya and India, researchers have pinpointed the motivations, anxieties and aspirations that drive it.\n\nThe study also help us understand the relationship between fake news and mainstream politics on digital networks.\n\nWhy does fake news matter?\n\nErodes trust\n\nBuilds and feeds on community divisions\n\nThreat to a notion of truth\n\nToxic for mainstream media - all media given the same equivalence\n\nMakes citizens less able to make decisions based on facts\n\nToxic for public discourse\n\nThreats to health\n\nWorse case scenario - fuels hate speech, leads to violence and death\n\nDistorts democratic processes\n\nWeaponises information\n\nWhy are people fooled by fake news?\n\nMany overestimate their ability to spot fake news, the BBC found when speaking to social media users in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough many people understand the consequences of sharing fake news, that is often only on a conceptual level. Researchers found that the link between disinformation and things like electoral manipulation and democracy is too abstract for users to grasp.\n\nEmotions trump reason when it comes to sharing news, the team found. \"After watching the news I was touched, so I had to post it,\" said one interviewee in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria and Kenya have lower levels of digital literacy say researchers, especially in rural areas, where Facebook may be seen as synonymous with the internet and there all things on it may be seen as \"true\".\n\nImage caption Fake scare stories about health, like this one, are often shared\n\nBut Nigerians and Kenyans do better than Indians when it comes to checking for themselves if a dubious story is true, which they do through search engines like Google or verifying with others in their network, among other things.\n\nSome fake news is harder to identify than other kinds.\n\nWhile users show a fair amount of scrutiny on political updates especially in Nigeria, they are less stringent if a news story positively affirms an aspect of their identity. That could be a story on ethic identity in Kenya for example, or an issue relating to geopolitics such as Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta.\n\nBut young people are less focused on ethnic and religious allegiances than the generations before them, and so are less likely to be driven by these identities when sharing fake news.\n\nWhy else do people share fake news?\n\nOften they care more about who the sender is than the source. They might trust that a story is true because the sender is someone they trust to share worthy news, as opposed to a \"pointless spammer\".\n\n[Even] though it ain't real, I just like the gossip Florence, Kenya\n\nSharing news is socially validating too. Being the first to share a story in your group of friends, showing others you are in the know and provoking discussion make social media users feel good. Sometimes people will rush to share information not knowing if it is true.\n\nReading is hard, but sharing is easy. Researchers found most people do not consume their online news in-depth or critically, and many users will share stories based on a headline or image without having digested it in detail themselves.\n\nFor some, it is a civic duty. They will share information, regardless of its veracity, because they want to warn and update others. \"Maybe there is a person who didn't know about it, and [I share the story] to avoid something like this happening to my friend, \" one of dozens of people surveyed in Kenya told the BBC.\n\nThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.\n\nTo see more stories and learn more about the series visit www.bbc.co.uk/fakenews\n\nThese users often strongly believe that access to information is stifled or unequal, and want to do their part to democratise it.\n\nOther people choose to read known fake news sources simply because they find it entertaining. \"[Even] though it ain't real, I just like the gossip,\" explained one of the Kenyan readers surveyed, Florence.\n\nHow can I spot fake news?\n\nIf you are unsure if a story is true, fact-checking website Africa Check is a good place to start.\n\nAfrica Check and others are working on creating data banks for people to source accurate data. But timeliness and speed in checking fake news or misinformation can be a challenge.\n\nI look at the headlines. If it's too flashy then it's probably fake Mary, Kenya\n\nRemember that comments sections on mainstream media and Facebook cannot always be trusted, because it is a place where fake news is debated and amplified. Money and jobs scams are commonly found there, say researchers who analysed posts in African users' networks.\n\nAs things stand, many users say they end up relying on their instinct as to whether a story \"feels\" true, and whether they can find it reported by other sources.\n\n\"I look at the headlines. If it's too flashy then it's probably fake,\" a woman in Kenya called Mary told the BBC.\n\n\"Whenever I read something on the blog I double-check it, whichever blog I am reading something on I Google search it, I want to read two articles,\" said Chijioke in Nigeria.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is fake news and how can you identify it?\n\nBut these two methods are far from foolproof.\n\nThe researchers used two examples to illustrate the origin and spread of fake news:\n\nA tweet saying that a gay rights association, which doesn't actually exist, had backed the election campaign of opposition leader Atiku Abubakar ended up being reported in mainstream newspapers in Nigeria\n\nA photograph of a car falling into a sinkhole in Pakistan was copied by a Facebook user, saying it was in Nairobi\n\nVerifying information can be difficult, which African fact-checkers say is because of the lack of reliable, accurate and independent data across a lot of sectors - which means manipulation of information is easier.\n\nWhat fake news did the investigation find?\n\nNational anxieties and aspirations are often reflected in fake news messages.\n\nIn Nigeria where almost 19% of people are jobless, employment scams make up 6.2% of fake news stories shared in WhatsApp.\n\nRoughly 3% of fake news circulated on WhatsApp concerns terrorism and the army, mirroring Nigerians' anxieties about instability and uncertainty caused by Islamist militants among other things.\n\nScams related to money and technology contribute to about a third of the fake news stories shared in Kenyans' WhatsApp conversations. Religion accounts for roughly 8%, researchers found.\n\nFacebook users frequently fail to distinguish between fake news content and legitimate news on their feeds, the BBC team found by analysing Facebook advertising data by users' interests.\n\nHow organised is the spread of misinformation on private and public networks?\n\nFinding the answer to this question is the ultimate aim of BBC's Beyond Fake News project.\n\nSo far it has used big data to analyse 8,000 news articles in Kenya and Nigeria, analysed 3,000 Facebook pages and interests, conducted in-depth interviews with 40 individuals in both countries, and analysed a sample of more than 2,000 messages.\n\nKenyan and Nigerian social media users told the BBC they believe sensationalist and fake stories are being written on digital platforms purely to make money.\n\nSensationalist headlines used by parts of the mainstream journalistic sources, and the rush to publish without verification, are further blurring the lines between legitimate journalism and out-and-out misinformation.\n\nTelevision news, however, is seen as harder to fake because it is not \"faceless\" and involves sophisticated production methods.", "Video\n\nWhat began as a way to describe misinformation was quickly diverted into a propaganda tool.

And, indeed, the current situation in the cull zone says there is an increased prevalence.\n\n\"So, either their figures were calculated on an extremely inaccurate basis and they've got it very badly wrong, or they have actually gerrymandered those figures to make it look as if the incidence is falling when the evidence clearly shows that the prevalence has gone up.\n\n\"Badger culling has not worked. They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter.\"\n\nThe letter to chief vet Dr Christine Middlemiss goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustice of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).\n\nMr Eustice had said: \"Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire are evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results.\"\n\nHowever, the APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, \"these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle\".\n\nWeight of science\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nOn 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: \"The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence.\"\n\nThe department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset.\n\nDr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy.\n\n\"Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,\" he told BBC News. \"The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science.\"\n\nIn response, a Defra statement said: \"The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact.\n\n\"Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging.\"\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nDr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed.\n\nOn Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness \"lies between 52% and 100% with an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation\".\n\nBut two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best.\n\nJan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests.\n\nShe said: \"Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers.\n\n\"Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected.\"\n\nDefra conceded in a paragraph of a consultation paper published in 2016 - but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: \"This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds.\"\n\nMedia access\n\nMuch of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey.\n\nDefra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions.\n\nA spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFormer Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: \"When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth.\n\n\"I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy.\"\n\nDefra responded: \"Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line with the civil service code. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department.\n\n\"As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright EPA Image caption My Ut Trinh was arrested in Queensland on Sunday\n\nAn Australian woman accused of putting sewing needles inside strawberries in a high-profile sabotage case was motivated by spite, a court has heard.\n\nMy Ut Trinh, 50, was arrested on Sunday following a nationwide police investigation that began in September.\n\nMs Trinh had worked as a supervisor at a strawberry farm north of Brisbane, according to Queensland Police.\n\nThe maximum prison term for contaminating goods in Australia was recently raised to 15 years.\n\nMs Trinh faces seven counts, and has not said whether she will fight the charges.\n\nThe \"unprecedented\" strawberry scare spread to every Australian state and later to New Zealand, raising public alarm.\n\nPolice said there had been 186 reports of needle-contaminated strawberries since September, though 15 turned out to have been hoaxes.\n\nIt is not yet clear how many of those Ms Trinh is alleged to have caused.

To others, he was a dangerous vigilante who wanted to kill and maim.\n\nMartin, now 74, was released from prison in 2003 after his murder conviction was downgraded to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.\n\nFifteen years on, his story is still divisive and is being retold in a Channel 4 drama using police interviews that were conducted in the days following his arrest.\n\nWriter-director Dave Nath says he was drawn to recreating Martin's interrogation because the transcripts \"give a sense of the biography of the man as well as the crime\".\n\nEvery word in the piece is taken verbatim from the interviews or from police statements made by people relevant to the case.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Martin, pictured here in October 2001, served three years in prison\n\n\"It's quite risky because you're effectively putting a play on the telly,\" continues Nath, whose other credits include The Murder Detectives and I'm Running Sainsbury's.\n\n\"It was about looking for the right case.

What is the true situation?\n\nIn March 2007, following a wave of fatal stabbings of teenage boys and young men in London and Manchester, the government announced that knife crime would be officially recorded in England and Wales in a way it had never been done before.\n\nSince then, we have been able to chart the trends and set them in context.\n\nUntil around 2014, knife crime, as with overall violence, appeared to be on the decline - that's certainly what figures from the police, Ministry of Justice, and health service suggested.\n\nSince then police forces have been logging more violent offences. Some of that is due to better recording methods - but among the most serious types of violence there has been a genuine increase.\n\nWorryingly, the involvement of young people in knife crime seems to be growing, confirming anecdotal evidence that more boys (and girls) are carrying weapons, being drawn into gangs and exploited by drug dealers.\n\nTen-to-17-year-olds represent roughly 20% of those cautioned or convicted of knife offences - that's possession of a knife or threatening someone with one.\n\nMost in that age group caught with a knife receive a community sentence or warning. One in eight is sentenced to a spell in youth custody.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe Office for National Statistics is responsible for the Crime Survey of England and Wales, which estimates crime trends from a sample of 34,000 people aged between 16 and 64.\n\nThe advantage of the survey is that it captures incidents that aren't reported to police, as well as those that are.\n\nIn a more recent development, the survey has begun interviewing about 3,000 10-15-year-olds to pick up crime trends among children.\n\nThe results indicate that the majority of violent incidents involving children aged 10-15 occur around schools, in daylight - and 81% lead to injury. Around 8% resulted in serious injury.\n\nPolice are alerted in only a minority of cases.\n\nThe survey also asked children whether they had carried a knife in the past year: 0.7% said they had, a figure which has remained stable.\n\nKnives and schools\n\nLegislation banning people from carrying knives without good reason dates back 65 years. The maximum sentence is a four-year jail term.\n\nOver the decades the law has been extended and penalties toughened. In 1988 it was made a specific offence to possess a knife in school.\n\nStaff do not need consent to search a pupil for a knife, but guidance recommends that there are two teachers present and that children are not asked to remove clothes, except items such as coats.\n\nFurther measures are currently being considered by Parliament, including widening the knife ban to further education colleges.\n\nThere's some evidence that more children are taking in knives.\n\nA Freedom of Information request last year, to which 32 police forces responded, showed a 20% increase on the previous year in knives found in schools.\n\nThe Department for Education has compiled information about those who have been caught.\n\nIt showed that 10-18-year-olds convicted of knife-possession offences were generally lower achievers - 91.1% of them achieved one or more GCSEs, compared with 99.7% for the population as a whole - and they were also more likely than their peers to have been excluded from school.\n\nIncreasing security\n\nThere are clear benefits of having police officers permanently stationed in secondary schools, where they can pick up intelligence, help defuse tensions and win the trust of students. Not every school would want or need one, of course, but some do.\n\nHowever, in London, there are only 305 Safer School Officers in a city with 3,155 schools. The Met aims to increase this to 600 by the end of March 2019.\n\nThe Mayor's office has also encouraged every state-funded secondary school to take up their offer for a knife-detecting \"hand wand\" -

The results from the 129 councils that responded showed the average amount owed by tenants claiming universal credit across the UK is \u00a3662.56. For those still on housing benefit it is \u00a3262.50\n\nFlintshire council said this week that tenants on universal credit in the county owe on average four times as much rent as those on the old benefits. At times it has been even higher; in September it was six times as much.\n\nIn the 18 months since universal credit was introduced in Flintshire, the council's rent arrears have increased by \u00a31m, something officials say is largely due to the new benefit.\n\nUniversal credit, which had cross-party support when it was first proposed, brings together six benefits, such as job seekers allowance, child tax credits and, crucially, housing benefit, into one payment.\n\nTo mirror being paid a salary, it is paid once a month - in arrears.\n\nWhile this has worked for some, other claimants have said it is this delay in the payment, combined with confusion over the online application process, that has seen families left with no income for weeks, forced to turn to food banks and choose between paying bills or paying their rent.\n\nUniversal credit was rolled out to job centres in Flintshire in April 2017, meaning the local authority is ahead of much of the UK. Eighteen months on, 23% of benefit claimants are now on universal credit in Flintshire, compared with about 10% nationally.\n\nCurrently one million people across the UK claim the new benefit, a figure that will eventually rise to eight million.

Evictions have increased by 55% compared to the same time last year.\n\n\"We do undertake a lot of intensive support before we get to that stage (eviction), but there is a degree of inevitability,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a bit of an ostrich situation that develops - you put your head in the sand and it will go away. It won't go away, the rent has to be paid.\"\n\nBecause universal credit is claimed online, the council has also had to employ four new staff to help with applications and arrears, another cost at a time when budgets are stretched.\n\nThe government has given them more funding to offset this, but the council said not only is it not enough, it is stopping in April 2019.\n\nImage caption Prof Paul Hickman said universal credit should probably be scrapped\n\n'I would scrap it'\n\nPanorama has also discovered that the government knew rent arrears caused by universal credit could be a problem.\n\nProf Paul Hickman of Sheffield Hallam University was asked by the UK government to look into the progress of the new benefit.\n\nHis study, in 2011, found only 8% of tenants who made seven or more rent payments managed to pay their rent in full.\n\nHe said the UK government had these figures but still went ahead with universal credit.\n\n\"Were we ignored?\" said Prof Hickman. \"Some of what we said was listened to but I think they were so committed to the course of rolling out universal credit so in some senses, whatever we found they were going to continue to plough ahead.\n\n\"I think realistically given the billions that have been spent in terms of implementing it, it's not going to happen... but I would probably scrap it.\"\n\nUniversal credit 'is working well'\n\nThe government has delayed migrating the majority of claimants over to universal credit for another year, as well as announcing more money for improvements to the system. Employment minister Alok Sharma said the new benefit is working, and claimed the rise in rent arrears is only temporary.\n\nHe said: \"Universal credit is working well. What we have is a system which is simpler, a system which people understand and ultimately makes sure they get into work faster and stay in work longer.\n\n\"After a period of time people will on average see those (rent) arrears coming down. But the key point here is to make sure that people get support in terms of funding, and that is why early this year we introduced a package worth one and a half billion pounds which means that anyone who's coming onto universal credit who is currently receiving housing benefit will get an extra two weeks of run-on - two weeks of extra money.\"\n\nWhen questioned about direct payments to claimants, the minister said: \"We have listened and made sure that it is possible for direct payments to be made to their landlord and that is actually happening across the country.\"\n\nWatch BBC Panorama's The Universal Credit Crisis on Monday at 19:30.

The trial could last up to four months.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThere is a case to be made that El Chapo is the most powerful person to be prosecuted in modern times. He is certainly among the richest.\n\nHe headed up the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico, which became the world's most powerful drug trafficking gang and dominated the heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine trade into the US.\n\nThe cartel made up to $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) a year and had influence in at least 50 countries.\n\nEl Chapo escaped twice from prison and was finally caught in 2016, then extradited to the US. He's also accused of being behind the killing of rivals and witnesses, so security in court will be extremely tight.\n\n2) Crunch time in Italy\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nItaly has struggled to agree its budget for months, and faces a deadline of Tuesday to do so.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis isn't just an issue that could affect Italy, but Europe and the world as well.\n\nItaly is governed by a coalition of populist far-right and far-left parties, who had made various spending promises during their campaigns.\n\nBut the country's debt is already worryingly high - equivalent to 131% of the country's GDP, the second-highest figure in the eurozone after Greece.\n\nEurope needs to approve Italy's budget - but the problem is Italy's eurosceptic government is proposing only to increase its debt, not manage it, and has hit back at what it sees as interference by Europe.\n\nIf Italy doesn't put forward a new budget by Tuesday, it faces a fine.\n\nThings could easily spiral from there - this is the third-biggest economy in the eurozone after all. But there are plenty of reasons that may not happen, and European officials are doing everything they can to ensure it doesn't.\n\n3) A heavy decision to weigh up\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption This is what the international prototype of a kilogram looks like\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nFrom this week, the kilogram may no longer weigh a kilogram. Sort of.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThere are few certainties in life, but you would have thought this was one of them.\n\nIt turns out what we think of as a kilogram has been based, for all this time, on a Perfect Kilogram, the Kilogram To End All Kilograms, that is made of platinum and iridium and kept in a nice jar in Paris.\n\nUnlike us humans though, the thing known as the International Prototype Kilogram has been losing weight as it has been getting older (as you will know if you read this viral Twitter thread earlier this month).\n\nIt's been losing only a tiny amount, but it's not really clear why, so now scientists are to meet this week to discuss a new way to accurately define what a kilogram is, using electromagnetism.\n\nWill this redefinition change all our lives?\n\nNo, but it's interesting.\n\n4) Join the queue?\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nA decision will be taken on Tuesday on whether British passport holders will need a visa to visit the EU after Brexit.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe European Commission could decide British people will need permission to travel to EU countries after 29 March 2019, a requirement that usually applies to countries in the developing world.\n\nIf this is the case, Britons would have to fill in a three-page form, pay \u20ac60 (\u00a352; $68) for a visa and wait up to six weeks for approval. Romantic last-minute trips on the Eurostar would become a thing of the past.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron suggested last month that Brits travelling to France wouldn't need visas in the event of no Brexit deal being agreed between the UK and Europe.\n\nBut will his European partners agree?", "There are two sides to every story, they say, and that was certainly true of the incident between Max Verstappen and Esteban Ocon that decided the destiny of the Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nVerstappen was cruising to what would have been a superb second victory in a row when the two crashed on lap 44, forcing the Red Bull into a spin, and handing the lead and eventual victory back to Lewis Hamilton.\n\nVerstappen was furious, Ocon unrepentant. The stewards decided the Frenchman was at fault and handed him a 10-second stop-and-go penalty, the most severe punishment before a disqualification.\n\nBut in the green room before the podium, Hamilton suggested the incident was not quite so clear-cut.\n\nHe told Verstappen that Ocon had the right to unlap himself. Verstappen agreed, yet added: \"But you can't crash into the leader, who's not doing anything crazy.\"\n\nHamilton's response? \"You had more to lose than he did. He had nothing to lose.\"\n\nVerstappen was briefly lost for words. This sounded very much like advice from someone he can not help but admire and respect.\n\nHamilton's view is where moral correctness and racing judgement diverge. And, some would say, that's the difference between a five-time world champion of 12 years' experience and a brilliantly talented but occasionally rash 20-year-old who still sees the world very much in black and white.\n\nVerstappen's view\n\nWhen the incident happened, Verstappen had 27 laps to go before he completed a brilliant win.\n\nHe had started fifth, optimistic that despite the Red Bull's lack of qualifying pace, he would be able to challenge the Mercedes and Ferraris in front of him. He quickly passed Kimi Raikkonen, Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas and was 1.8 seconds behind Hamilton after just 10 laps and clearly quicker.\n\nHis pace persuaded Mercedes' strategists they had to stop Hamilton as soon as they could, to protect against the Red Bull stopping first and passing the world champion with what is known as the 'under-cut'.\n\nThe worst bit of driving I think I've seen in F1 Jolyon Palmer Former Renault driver on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra\n\nHamilton was called in on lap 19, the team over-ruling his request to stay out because he felt it was too early and he still had life in his tyres. Verstappen's job now was to extend his first stint as long as possible.\n\nHe did this superbly, the team not stopping him until lap 35 to give him the biggest possible tyre advantage into the final part of the race, and when he rejoined a couple of seconds behind Hamilton he passed him within three laps.\n\nThat should have been the race won. He had better tyres than Hamilton behind him, and the world champion was in any case concentrating mainly on securing the constructors' title for Mercedes and was running into potentially terminal engine problems.\n\nIndeed, Mercedes at one point had a warning of imminent failure within a lap, before they managed to bring Hamilton's exhaust temperatures under control.\n\nBut the lap after Verstappen had retaken the lead, already into cruise-to-the-end mode, Ocon himself pitted for fresh tyres and came out behind him, a lap down, but on fresh super-soft tyres and going quicker.\n\nAfter a lap behind Verstappen, Ocon was told by his team he could unlap himself and he went for it, going around the outside of Verstappen into Turn One.\n\nVerstappen fought him, was slightly more than half a car's width ahead as they turned into Turn Two, and his right rear corner collected Ocon's front left.\n\nThe win was gone. Verstappen was furious.\n\n\"I was just trying to do my race and then a back marker takes a stupid risk,\" he said. \"I lost a victory but hopefully in 15 years' time we can laugh about it.\n\n\"He has the right to unlap himself but still you have to be careful. He has always been an idiot.\"\n\nHis team boss Christian Horner backed him. \"Through the irresponsible actions of a backmarker we have lost the grand prix,\" he said.\n\n\"Max is the race leader and Ocon had been lapped. He has a car much quicker on the straight. What on Earth he thought he was doing\u2026 It was not at all well handled by Ocon and totally irresponsible to be even dreaming of racing the race leader.\"\n\nRed Bull's motorsport boss Helmut Marko went even further, alluding to Ocon's status as a young Mercedes driver and implying it might have been deliberate, saying: \"This is a driver seeking a Mercedes contract and he is an idiot.\"\n\nBut Horner rejected that. \"That's a coincidence,\" he said. \"There is obviously history between the two drivers but it was just a very bad judgement call. He is a lap down, not even in the points and he is racing the race leader. The team have to take some responsibility.\"\n\nThe less simplistic view\n\nOcon said: \"I came out of the box (pit). The first lap I stayed behind. The second lap the team said: 'You can unlap yourself if you want'. I went around the outside, the same overtake I did on Fernando (Alonso) and many other drivers but clearly he didn't give me enough space.\n\n\"I was side by side and I couldn't disappear and then I saw he turned and we collided. He can be upset but if you are leading the race you have to control it.\"\n\nHamilton had a grandstand view of the incident from just 2.7 seconds behind.\n\n\"I wasn't surprised by it or anything like that,\" he said. \"I saw them racing but they weren't racing for the same position.\n\n\"I would have been in a different frame of mind. Fortunately, no one got hurt, and they kept going. It's a racing incident, I guess. Max is that go-getter guy and every now and then it bites you.\n\n\"There are no rules that say you can't unlap yourself. I've done it before. When you're in Ocon's position, you've got nothing to lose. You can go much quicker on the tyres and you're trapped. The guy in front is saving his tyres.\n\n\"It felt like it was fair game to unlap himself. Of course you don't want to cause an incident but in those scenarios you give each other space. You can never assume the guy is not on the inside. You have to assume he is and leave extra space.\"\n\nBoth views have merit. They are not even necessarily mutually exclusive. It's possible to believe both that Ocon was in the wrong in putting the race leader at risk and also that Verstappen might have been wiser to give him more space in the circumstances.\n\nHamilton's team boss Toto Wolff is a friend of Verstappen's father Jos, and rates Max very highly. Many believe the 20-year-old could one day end up at Mercedes, perhaps as a replacement for Hamilton when he retires.\n\nWolff said: \"You can see there is a future champion coming together. Unbelievable talent and speed and I think once the raw edges are off, he will be someone who will be a world champion one day.\n\n\"In a few years he will look at the footage of today and maybe have his own opinion whether it was the right behaviour or not. But you can't accelerate these things. It's a learning process.\"\n\nThe fisticuffs afterwards\n\n'Pushgate' erupts as Max Verstappen angrily confronts Esteban Ocon after the race\n\nImmediately after the race, Verstappen confronted Ocon in the driver weighing area.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, he had talked about his frustration after losing pole at the previous race in Mexico and said he \"could literally do some damage if somebody said something wrong to me after qualifying. I was that angry\".\n\nIn the car on the slowing down lap, he had intimated the same thing, when he said Ocon had to hope he did not find him in the paddock afterwards.\n\nNow, he pushed Ocon once, then again and again, while clearly expressing his anger in words, too.\n\nOcon said: \"What I am really surprised about is his behaviour after the race. We went on the scales and he started to push me and wanted to punch me and stuff. This is not proper.\"\n\nOcon on top: All smiles between the two on the Formula 3 podium back in 2014\n\nThis was not an incident that arose out of nothing. Ocon and Verstappen are old rivals. They have raced against each other since karting, Ocon beating Verstappen to the European Formula 3 title in 2014. They clearly do not like each other.\n\n\"There is a lot of history between those drivers,\" Horner said. \"It goes right back to karting. We don't know what words were exchanged between them. We don't condone violence but you have to understand emotions - you've had a victory taken away from you and they are running high.\n\n\"Of course there is a human reaction in these competitive animals. Emotions occasionally boil over.\"\n\nVerstappen was called to see the stewards, and they said that while they were \"sympathetic to his passion\", it was \"the obligation of sportsmen at this level to act appropriately and as role models to other drivers\". His punishment is two days of \"public service\" at the direction of the FIA.\n\nIt is a penalty that carries echoes of those handed out to Sebastian Vettel for driving into Hamilton in Baku in 2017 and Michael Schumacher for trying to take out Jacques Villeneuve in the 1997 title decider in Jerez.\n\nA remarkable achievement overshadowed\n\nAll the fives: Mercedes are one constructors' championship away from equalling Ferrari's tally of six consecutive titles\n\nVerstappen's incident-packed day did two things.\n\nFirstly, it provided a window into a potentially fascinating F1 future.\n\nBoth short-term, in the sense of hinting at the strength of the challenge he and Red Bull could mount to Mercedes and Hamilton if new engine partner Honda can deliver on the promise their latest engine is showing this season.\n\nAnd long-term regarding the intensity of a potential future fight between Verstappen and Ocon, if the Frenchman, as many expect, ends up in a Mercedes in 2020.\n\nBut it also overshadowed Mercedes clinching their fifth consecutive constructors' championship and world title double, the latter matching Ferrari's achievements from 2000-4 with Schumacher.\n\nThis, Wolff said, had been the most difficult championship to win and as a result felt the best of all.\n\n\"We had a hell of a fight with Ferrari,\" he said, \"and being able to win a fifth consecutive championship is something we wouldn't have dreamt of six years ago. In our wildest dreams it would not have come to my mind, equalising a Ferrari record that seemed unachievable.\n\n\"I feel so fortunate to be in this team. That Ferrari success is something I really looked up to and admired. To achieve it, you have to say a thousand times thank you to all the team members.\"\n\nAnd there was a final word for the exceptional job Hamilton has done in overcoming what more often than not was a faster car.\n\n\"He is an exceptional driver and an unbelievable human and he has been an integral part of the team,\" Wolff said. \"He is the one in the forefront and in the car. Many people have contributed to the success but clearly it wouldn't have happened without him.\"", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Codebreaker, 95, still keeping Bletchley secrets\n\nA World War Two codebreaker has vowed to take the secrets of her work \"to the end of my days\".\n\nMargaret Wilson, 95, trained as a wireless operator before being transferred to Bletchley Park in 1942, where she listened to German radio.\n\n\"That's all I can tell you, a secret is a secret,\" she said.\n\nAt the time, she did not realise the importance of the work - but even now she knows its significance she will not reveal all.\n\nDespite pleas from researchers and family, Mrs Wilson, from Shirebrook, said: \"No one else has talked, so I will not.\"\n\nShe joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, aged 19.

People were also overly confident in their ability to spot fake news.\n\nThe sheer flood of digital information being spread in 2018 is worsening the problem. Participants in the BBC research made little attempt to query the original source of fake news messages, looking instead to alternative signs that the information was reliable.\n\nThese included the number of comments on a Facebook post, the kinds of images on the posts, or the sender, with people assuming WhatsApp messages from family and friends could be trusted and sent on without checking.\n\nWidespread sharing of false rumours on WhatsApp has led to a wave of violence in India, with people forwarding on fake messages about child abductors to friends and family out of a sense of duty to protect loved ones and communities.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The digital epidemic killing Indians\n\nAccording to a separate BBC analysis, at least 32 people have been killed in the past year in incidents involving rumours spread on social media or messaging apps.\n\nWe examined one case in detail - the deaths of Nilotpal and Abhishek in Assam - while another reporter travelled to Mexico to see how WhatsApp rumours fuelled similar deadly violence there.\n\nThe research in Africa suggested that national identity was insignificant in the spread of fake news.\n\nIn Kenya, scams related to money and technology were a stronger driving force, contributing to around a third of stories shared on WhatsApp, while fake stories relating to terrorism and the army were widely shared in Nigeria.\n\nIn both countries, health scares were prominent among widely shared fake news stories, and many news consumers visited both credible and fake news sources without distinguishing between them.\n\nResearchers spent hundreds of hours with 80 participants across the three countries, interviewing them at home about their media consumption as well as examining how they shared information via WhatsApp and Facebook during a seven-day period.\n\nThey also conducted extensive analysis of how fake news spreads on Twitter and Facebook in India, to understand whether the spread of fake news was politically polarised.\n\nAbout 16,000 Twitter accounts and 3,000 Facebook pages were analysed. The results showed a strong and coherent promotion of right-wing messages, while left-wing fake news networks were loosely organised, if at all, and less effective.\n\nThe methodology\n\nBy Santanu Chakrabarti\n\nWe set out with this research to try to answer the question of why ordinary citizens spread fake news - a little-understood part of the fake news equation.\n\nWhen a phenomenon is new or not very well understood, qualitative research techniques are useful. These techniques - in this case, in-depth interviews and up-close observation of sharing behaviours - allowed us to explore fake news with nuance, richness and depth.\n\nBecause we wanted to know what was spreading in encrypted private networks such as WhatsApp, ethnographic approaches - visiting people at home - were essential.\n\nThis is the first known research project in these countries that uses these methods to understand the fake news phenomenon at the level of ordinary citizens.\n\nIt is also the first to use data science and network analysis techniques to understand how known sources of fake news are organised on Twitter and Facebook, and what their connections are with audiences.\n\nThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.\n\nMore stories published today:\n\nYou can find more stories and more information about this series here.", "Video\n\nA BBC investigation has found that Russian media and officials presented false claims about a US-funded laboratory in neighbouring Georgia.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry, Defence Ministry and pro-Kremlin media claimed recently that untested drugs were given to Georgian citizens at the lab, resulting in a large number of deaths.\n\nThe US has accused Russia of disinformation in order to distract attention away from incidents such as the Salisbury poisonings.\n\nCorrespondent: Steve Rosenberg\n\nProducer: Will Vernon\n\nCamera/editor: Matt Goddard\n\nThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.\n\nTo see more stories and learn more about the series visit www.bbc.co.uk/beyondfakenews", "The spread of fake news in Africa has been blamed for igniting ethnic violence, sowing confusion among voters and even causing currency fluctuations.

Nigerian presidential candidate 'endorsed by gay rights groups'\n\nWhat was the story?\n\nWhen Atiku Abubakar was confirmed as a presidential candidate for the Nigerian elections in 2019, a fake Twitter account in the name of the opposition leader posted a message thanking the \"Association of Nigerian Gay Men (ANGAM)\" for its support.\n\nIn the post, \"Mr Abubakar\" writes that the first thing he would do if he were to become president would be to scrap the country's controversial anti-gay legislation, signed into law by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014.\n\nHomosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Nigeria, while gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also banned.\n\nWhat impact did it have?\n\nImage copyright The Nation Image caption A screengrab of the fake news story from a Nigerian blog\n\nAfter originally being shared on Twitter on 14 October, the story was picked up by two Nigerian blogs. Then 12 days later, two prominent Nigerian newspapers, The Nation and the Vanguard, both published stories with a very similar theme.\n\nThey reported that an LGBT organisation called \"Diverse\" was also backing Mr Abubakar for president, considering him a truly \"liberal candidate\".\n\nA fake news story about a presidential candidate advocating for gay rights could be used to undermine them. Highly influential Muslim and Christian leaders in Nigeria, who were united in their support for the anti-gay legislation, could tell their followers not to vote for such a candidate.\n\nHow do we know the story was fake?\n\nThe Twitter account which was the source of the original story is not an official account for the politician Atiku Abubakar. This is his real account, verified with a blue tick by Twitter.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fake news is often published on legitimate-looking websites\n\nThere is also no evidence that the LGBT rights organisations quoted in the initial tweet, or the subsequent blogposts and newspaper articles, even exist. There are no official records of the organisations themselves, which would be illegal under Nigerian law anyway.\n\nAnd neither they nor their purported spokesperson (Spinky Victor Lee) existed online before the emergence of the first tweet in October, as detailed in this fact-check by the Agence France Press (AFP) news agency.\n\n2. Top Kenya media personality shares fake praise\n\nWhat was the story?\n\nCNN business presenter Richard Quest was in the Kenyan capital Nairobi in October filming for his TV show.\n\nFormer news anchor and media personality Julie Gichuru posted on her Twitter account on 25 October to discuss how much Mr Quest was apparently enjoying his time in Kenya.\n\nShe posted the following quote, attributing it to Mr Quest.\n\n\"Nothing beats the service industry in Kenya... Here I am surrounded by giraffes while having breakfast! In a country declared by the World Bank as the Preferred Investment Destination in Africa, what else can I ask for? KENYA IS MAGICAL!\"\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\nWhat impact did it have?\n\nJulie has over a million followers on her verified Twitter account and 600,000 on Instagram, so within minutes thousands of people had seen what she had posted and believed it to be true.\n\nMany poked fun at her for falling for a hoax given her high profile and her long career in the media industry.\n\nHow do we know the story was fake?\n\nThe CNN journalist came across Julie's tweet and was quick to point out that he hadn't made any such statement. He replied to her original post.\n\nMs Gichuru then had to go on Twitter to set the record straight to her followers, issuing a retraction and deleting her initial tweet.\n\n3. Somalis 'pushed into shallow grave' in Ethiopia\n\nWhat was the story?\n\nIn July, the US-based Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT) station broadcast a video which it said showed ethnic Oromos in Ethiopia pushing the bodies of ethnic Somalis into a shallow grave.\n\nIt claimed that the footage was taken in Ethiopia's Oromia region, where there has been deadly violence between the two groups this year.\n\nWhat impact did it have?\n\nImage copyright YouTube Image caption The film showed bodies being rolled into a shallow grave\n\nThe BBC's Afaan Oromo language service reported that the broadcast and subsequent widespread circulation of the video on social media in Ethiopia resulted in deadly attacks on ethnic Oromo people living in neighbouring Djibouti and Somalia.\n\nOromo refugees in neigbouring Djibouti told the BBC that they had been beaten and their shops looted after the video was aired there.\n\nHow do we know it was fake?\n\nAfter an uproar on social media with many questioning its authenticity, ESAT admitted that the video was not real and described it as \"deliberately misleading\" in an official apology on its YouTube channel.\n\nThe same unverified video had been widely shared in June on social media in relation to the current conflict between Anglophone separatists and the government in Cameroon, some 3,000km (1,800 miles) west of Ethiopia.\n\nThe video aired on ESAT TV had apparently also been doctored, with audio of what were supposedly Oromo youths chanting inserted on top of the video's original sound.\n\n4. South African President Jacob Zuma's \"resignation\"\n\nWhat was the story?\n\nOn 12 February, a correspondent for South Africa's national broadcaster SABC reported that then-President Jacob Zuma had agreed to resign.\n\nCiting \"authoritative sources\", Tshepo Ikaneng broke the story during a live report outside a high-level meeting of members from the ruling African National Congress (ANC), who were discussing his future.\n\nAnother South African journalist uploaded the announcement on Twitter.\n\nMr Zuma had been under immense pressure over multiple corruption scandals and had faced repeated calls from his party to step down.\n\nThe country was waiting on news of his possible resignation.\n\nWhat impact did it have?\n\nThe South African rand, which had gained about 1% on the expectation that Mr Zuma would resign on 12 February, gave up some of its gains after the spokesman dismissed the SABC report.\n\nDo we know it was fake?\n\nMr Zuma's spokesperson came out to deny the reports, saying they were \"fake news\".\n\nBut three days later, Mr Zuma resigned - this time for real.\n\n5. Tanzanian leader 'backs polygamy to end prostitution'\n\nImage copyright Zambian Observer\n\nWhat was the story?\n\nAn article claiming Tanzanian President John Magufuli had told men to marry more than one wife as a way to end prostitution went viral.\n\nIt said that the president had addressed a \"conference of about 14,000 men\" telling them that \"out of approximately 70 million Tanzanians, 40 million are women and only 30 million are men.\"\n\nThis scarcity of men was leading to an increase in prostitution and adultery among women, the article claimed the president had said.\n\nWhat impact did it have?\n\nThe initial story published in the English language Zambia Observer website in February 2018 didn't create much of a stir.\n\nBut it was only when it was published in Swahili, the national language of Tanzania, on a website called nipasheonline.com that the story really started to gain momentum.\n\nFrom there it was posted on the popular JamiiForums website, where it became a hot topic of discussion and spread to other news websites in Kenya, Zambia, South Africa and Ghana.\n\nHow do we know it was fake?\n\nTanzania's official government spokesperson condemned the story on Twitter in Swahili, saying the president never uttered such remarks and people should ignore them.\n\nA fact-check by BBC Swahili exposed further reasons we know the article was untrue.\n\nIn the fake article, \"Mr Magufuli\" refers to a population of 70 million, with 10 million more women than men.\n\nBut the latest UN estimates put the total population of Tanzania at just under 60 million, with no substantial gender disparity.\n\nThe website where the fake article was posted may also have sounded familiar to readers of the prominent Tanzanian newspaper Nipashe.\n\nBut it has no connection to the real website for that newspaper, whose official home on the web is https://www.ippmedia.com/sw/nipashe.\n\nThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.\n\nTo see more stories and learn more about the series visit www.bbc.co.uk/beyondfakenews", "Video\n\nFake news can sometimes very closely mimic real news.

The rumours were fake, but a mob burned two men to death before anyone checked.\n\nOn August 29, a little after midday, Maura Cordero, the owner of an arts and crafts shop in the small town of Acatl\u00e1n in the central Mexican state of Puebla, noticed an unusual number of people gathering outside the municipal police station next to her shop.\n\nCordero, 75, moved closer to the door and peered out. Dozens of people were outside the police station on Reforma Street, the town's main thoroughfare, and the crowd was swelling. Soon there would be more than a hundred people. Cordero could not remember seeing such a crowd in Acatl\u00e1n outside of a holiday.\n\nAs she watched, a police car passed her shop bearing two men into the small jail house. The car was followed by more people and cries went up from the crowd accusing the two men who were taken into the jail house of being child abductors. From behind a narrow metal gate at the entrance to the station, police replied that the men were not child abductors but minor offenders. They were minor offenders, the officers said again and again, as the crowd grew in size.\n\nInside the station sat 21-year-old Ricardo Flores, who had grown up just outside Acatl\u00e1n but moved to Xalapa, 250km to the north east, to study law, and his uncle Alberto Flores, a 43-year-old farmer who had lived for decades in a small community just outside Acatl\u00e1n. Ricardo had recently returned to Acatl\u00e1n to visit relatives, who said the two men went to the centre of town that day to buy construction supplies to finish work on a concrete block water well. Police said there was no evidence the men had committed any crime, and that they had been taken into the station for \"disturbing the peace\" after they were accosted by local residents.\n\nBut the mob outside the station on Reforma Street was in the grip of a different version of events, a story stirred up somewhere unknown and spread through the private messaging app WhatsApp.\n\n\"Please everyone be alert because a plague of child kidnappers has entered the country,\" said the message that pinged from phone to phone.\n\n\"It appears that these criminals are involved in organ trafficking... In the past few days, children aged four, eight and 14 have disappeared and some of these kids have been found dead with signs that their organs were removed. Their abdomens had been cut open and were empty.\"\n\nSighted near an elementary school in a nearby community called San Vicente Boqueron, Ricardo and Alberto became the child abductors conjured up by collective fear, and news of their arrest spread just as the rumours of the child abductors had.\n\nThe crowd that descended on the police station was whipped up in part by Francisco Martinez, a long-time resident of Acatl\u00e1n known as \"El Tecuanito\". According to police, Martinez was among those who spread messages on Facebook and Whatsapp accusing Ricardo and Alberto. Outside the police station, he began to livestream events on Facebook via his phone.\n\n\"People of Acatl\u00e1n de Osorio, Puebla, please come give your support, give your support,\" he said into the camera. \"Believe me, the kidnappers are now here.\"\n\nAs Martinez attempted to rally the town, another man, identified by the police only as Manuel, climbed up onto the roof of the colonial-style town hall building next to the police station, and rang the bells of the government office to alert locals that the police were planning to release Ricardo and Alberto.\n\nA third man, Petronilo Castelan \u2014 \"El Paisa\" \u2014 used a loudspeaker to call on the citizens to contribute money to buy petrol to set the two men on fire, and he walked through the crowd to collect it.\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Life carries on in Acatl\u00e1n, at the spot where Ricardo and Alberto Flores burned to death\n\nIn her shop, Maura Cordero watched with fright, until she heard from someone outside that they should run because the crowd would set the men on fire. Dear God, she thought, this is not possible.\n\nMoments later, the crowd coalesced into a mob with one goal. The narrow gate at the entrance to the police station was wrenched open and Ricardo and Alberto Flores were dragged out. As people held their phones aloft to film, the men were pushed to the floor at the base of four stone steps and savagely beaten. Then the petrol that was brought earlier was poured on them.\n\nEyewitnesses believe Ricardo was already dead from the beating, but his uncle Alberto was still alive when they set the two men on fire. Video footage shows his limbs moving slowly as the flames licked around them.\n\nThe blackened bodies remained on the ground for two hours after they were burned, while state prosecutors made their way from Puebla City to Acatl\u00e1n, and the reek of the petrol remained in the air. Petra Elia Garcia, Ricardo's grandmother, was called to the scene to identify the men, and she said tears were still on Alberto's cheeks when she arrived. \"Look what you did to them!\" she shouted at the remnants of the mob, which had begun to disperse.\n\n\"It was one of the most horrific things that ever happened in Acatl\u00e1n,\" said Carlos Fuentes, a driver who works from a taxi stand near the police station. \"The columns of smoke could be seen from every point in the town.\"\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Ricardo Flores' father, Jose Guadalupe, looks over his family's ranch in Acatl\u00e1n\n\nThe road that runs into Acatl\u00e1n is lined on either side by maize and marigold fields. Mango, fig and walnut trees grow from vast plots of land owned by local farmers. The town is nestled in the heart of the Mixteca highlands and is known as the \"Pearl of the Mixteca region\" \u2014 a reference to the Mixtecs Mesoamerican indigenous groups that first settled in the region centuries ago.\n\nMost families in Acatl\u00e1n depend on remittances sent to them by relatives who have migrated to the United States. Like many other towns in Mexico, it has seen thousands of its citizens leave to head north in search of better opportunities.\n\nAmong those migrants in the early 2000s were Maria del Rosario Rodriguez and Jose Guadalupe Flores, who moved north in the hope of providing better living conditions for their two young sons left behind, Jose Guadalupe Jr and his younger brother Ricardo.\n\nThe two boys, aged seven and three, stayed behind with their grandmother, Petra Elia Garcia, in Xalapa in the state of Veracruz. Their parents, Maria and Jose Guadalupe, moved from city to city in the US before making their home in the east coast city of Baltimore. Maria became a domestic worker and Jose Guadalupe a construction worker, and they had a third child and called her Kimberley. Via Facebook and Facetime, they kept in constant communication with their two sons at home.\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Few people in Acatl\u00e1n would talk about the violence that day\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Maria with baby Ricardo at the family home in Acatl\u00e1n\n\nThen on 29 August, Maria received a string of Facebook messages which seemed at first like a bad dream. A close friend in Acatl\u00e1n was telling her that her son Ricardo had been arrested and was suspected of child abductions. It was a mistake, she thought. Ricardo would never be involved with such a thing. But the messages kept coming. Then came a link to a livestream on Facebook, and when she clicked on it she saw a mob, then she saw her son and his brother in law being beaten by the mob.\n\nIn vain, she posted a comment on the livestream. \"Please don't hurt them, don't kill them, they're not child kidnappers,\" she recalled writing. But her message had no effect and she watched in horror as the men were doused in petrol, and the same technology that allowed a man in Acatl\u00e1n to summon a mob to kill her son allowed her to watch him die.\n\nLater that day, Maria, Jose Guadalupe, and Kimberley returned to Acatl\u00e1n for the first time in more than a decade. There they met Jazmin Sanchez, Alberto's widow, who had also watched the events unfold on Facebook. For decades Jazmin and Alberto had lived just 14km outside Acatl\u00e1n, in Xayacatlan de Bravo. Every day, Alberto went to work in the Maize fields he had planted on the land he owned in nearby Tianguistengo. When he died he left behind a small, half-built house in Tianguistengo, as well as the wife and three daughters he was building it for.\n\n\"He was a good man, he didn't deserve to die the way he did,\" said Jazmin, clutching a cap, a belt, and a wallet that had belonged to her late husband.\n\nMaria and Jose Guadalupe returned to another small house in Tianguistengo which they had left for their sons when they set out for the US. Standing at the back of the house, Maria recalled her son. He liked butterflies and running through the maize fields around the house. He left to study law because he wanted to defend people from injustices. \"They took him from us and he didn't even leave a child behind for us to take care of,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Jazmin Sanchez, Alberto's widow, hands her daughter a marigold flower on their family's ranch in Acatl\u00e1n\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Alberto Flores was a father to three girls, including Xiamara Kaori Flores\n\nIn Acatl\u00e1n, the family was met with a wall of silence. With the exception of Maura Cordero, the shop owners on Reforma Street said they were out of town when the violence happened, or that they shut their shops and fled, or that they never opened in the first place that day, which was not a holiday.\n\n\"No one wants to talk about it,\" said Fuentes, the taxi driver. \"And the people who were directly involved are already gone.\"\n\nAccording to state authorities, five people have now been charged with instigating the crime and four more with carrying out the murder. Martinez, who broadcast the livestream, Castelan, who called for petrol, and the man identified as Manuel, who rang the bells, were among the five. But the remaining two alleged instigators, and the four suspects charged with the murder were on the run, police said.\n\nThe day after Ricardo and Alberto died, a funeral service was held in Acatl\u00e1n. Maria believed there were eyewitnesses to the crime among the crowd who gathered at the service.\n\n\"Look how you killed them! You all have children! And I want justice for my loved ones!\" she shouted as tears rolled down her cheeks and the cameras from the local and national TV stations filmed.\n\nNow the family lives in fear in Acatl\u00e1n, Maria said. They are afraid to go to the market. \"I lost my grandson who was like my son,\" said Ricardo's grandmother. \"They accused them of being criminals, with no proof.\"\n\nMaria still cannot understand why the mob was swept up in the lie. \"Why didn't they check? No children were kidnapped, no one filed a formal complaint. It was fake news,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Jose Guadalupe Flores, 45, his daughter Kimberly, 10, in Acatl\u00e1n\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption A man rings the church bells in the town, the same bells that were rung that day to rally the mob\n\nRicardo and Alberto Flores's deaths in small-town Mexico were not isolated. Rumours and fake news stories on Facebook and WhatsApp have fomented fatal violence in India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, to name just three. In India, as in Mexico, the technology \u2014 WhatsApp is an encrypted private messaging app that lets people send messages to large groups \u2014 has upgraded time-old rumours about child abductors for the 21st Century, allowing them to spread faster and farther with less accountability.\n\nWhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook for $19bn in 2014, has been linked to a wave of lynchings across India, often fuelled by fake stories of child abductors. In the state of Assam in June, in an incident frighteningly similar to that in Acatl\u00e1n, Abhijit Nath and Nilotpal Das were beaten to death by a mob of 200.\n\nBoth WhatsApp and Facebook are widely used for news consumption in Mexico, according to a 2018 report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. According to the same report, 63% of internet users in Mexico say they are either very concerned or extremely concerned about the spread of fake news.\n\n\"The digital platforms serve as instantaneous vehicles to channel the best and the worst of us, including our fears and prejudices,\" said Manuel Guerrero, the director of the School of Communication at Mexico's Universidad Iberoamericana. \"And that becomes more evident in the absence of effective authorities that can guarantee our safety,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Maria del Rosario Rodriguez, holds her son's phone. She can not bear to look at the fake rumours which led to his death\n\nOn 30 August, the day after Ricardo and Alberto died in Acatl\u00e1n, residents of the town of San Martin Tilcajete in the southern state of Oaxaca attempted to lynch a group of seven men, a group of housepainters, who were falsely accused of being child kidnappers. That day, police officers were able to rescue the men.\n\nBut the same day, in Tula in central Hidalgo state, the grisly scene from Acatl\u00e1n repeated itself when two innocent men were accused of being child abductors, beaten, and burned to death.\n\nBeyond Mexico, in Ecuador, on 16 October, two men and a woman arrested for allegedly stealing 200 US dollars were killed by a mob after a message circulated on WhatsApp falsely accusing them of being child snatchers. And on 26 October, a mob in Colombia's capital Bogota killed a man who was falsely accused in WhatsApp messages of being linked to the kidnapping of a child.\n\nBecause of WhatsApp's ironclad end-to-end encryption, the origin of anything shared on the app is impossible to trace. The company resisted calls in July from the Indian government to break its encryption and allow authorities to track messages.\n\nImage caption Jose Gil, the deputy minister for Information and Cyber Intelligence in Mexico City, oversees his team\n\nWhatsApp has taken steps to try and stem the tide, adding a label to messages that have been forwarded and limiting the number of groups messages can be forwarded to 20 worldwide and to five in India. \"We believe the challenge of mob violence requires action from technology companies, civil society, and governments,\" the company told the BBC. \"We've stepped up user education about misinformation and provided training for law enforcement on how to use WhatsApp as a resource in their community.\"\n\nA spokesman for Facebook told the BBC the platform \"did not want our services to be used to incite violence\".\n\n\"Earlier this year we identified and removed videos showing mob violence in the Mexican state of Puebla, and we have updated our policies to remove content that could lead to real-world harm,\" the spokesman said. \"We will continue to work with tech companies, civil society, and governments to fight the spread of content that has the potential to cause harm.\"\n\nAt least 10 state governments in Mexico, including Puebla's, have now launched information campaigns alerting citizens to the wave of fake social media messages about child abductions, and Mexico City's cyber police have created chat groups on Whatsapp to allow direct communication with residents of at least 300 neighbourhoods across the capital.\n\nCitizens ask the police via the groups to verify stories and police use the groups in turn to gather evidence against those who spread fake news. Also on the team's remit: identity theft, extortion attempts, and human trafficking.\n\n\"We believe that of every 10 crimes, technology is used in nine,\" said Jose Gil the deputy minister for Information and Cyber Intelligence in Mexico City.\n\n\"Social media can really alter a community through the spread of false information that many of us perceive as truthful, because it's being sent by people we trust,\" he said. \"Society really needs to evaluate what is true and what is false, and decide what is trustworthy and what is not.\"\n\nA lack of effective law enforcement and culture of impunity in Mexico made rumours inciting violence \"pure dynamite\", said Tatiana Clouthier, a member of parliament in the country's Chamber of Deputies. The lynchings in Acatl\u00e1n had weighed privacy and freedom of expression against a terrible cost, she said.\n\n\"But to what do we give priority? We have to give priority to freedom of expression, but where is the limit? And that's a topic that none of us want to get into because nobody wants to curtail freedom of expression, but we cannot allow disinformation. The situation we are facing is very dangerous.\"\n\nImage copyright Brett Gundlock\n\nOn 24 October in the afternoon, a group of around 30 relatives of Ricardo and Alberto gathered under the sun at the Church of the Calvary in Acatl\u00e1n for a memorial service. The priest prayed for both families and blessed two metallic crosses that they had brought. The service lasted for an hour, and then the families walked half a kilometre carrying the crosses to the place they had avoided for the past two months.\n\nRicardo's father, Jose Guadalupe, placed the crosses by the stone steps where Ricardo and Alberto died, and the group stood for a while in silence on a quiet afternoon on the main street in town.\n\n\"It was very painful to be in the same place that the bodies were left charred,\" Ricardo's mother Maria said later. \"All of this happened because of rumours and because people were carried away by those rumours.\"\n\nThose rumours still exist on Maria's phone - and perhaps on other phones all across the town and beyond \u2014 but she cannot bear to look at them now or show them to anyone else.\n\nThe day of the memorial, she made a pledge with Alberto's widow Jazmin to visit the site of the lynching once a week and replenish the votive candles they had left by the crosses.\n\n\"The crosses should remain there forever,\" she said, \"so the people of Acatl\u00e1n may see and remember what they did.\"\n\nThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.\n\nTo see more stories and learn more about the series visit bbc.com/fakenews\n\n.", "Image caption Yuki (right) says she's willing to face significant risks in order to advocate for medical cannabis\n\nA death sentence given to a young man selling cannabis oil to the ill has stirred debate in Muslim-majority Malaysia about its ultra-tough drug laws. The case has prompted calls for the country to become the first in Asia to legalise medical marijuana - but long-held stigma and a mostly conservative population means change could come slowly.\n\nYuki describes smoking her first joint as a turning point in her life.\n\nShe is willing to risk being thrown in jail rather than give up a drug that she says has worked for her unlike any other.\n\nShe first turned to what Malaysians call ganja at 29, after a frustrated Google search in pursuit of something that might help ease chronic, crippling pain from hypokalaemia - or low blood potassium. Beleaguered by a litany of health problems, including diabetes, she decided to try the drug.\n\nIt was the early 2000s and public discussion of medical cannabis use was non-existent in Malaysia, a country with some of the world's harshest drug laws. Cultivating a single cannabis plant at home can land you in prison for natural life, while possession of more than 200g is almost certain to result in a death sentence.\n\nBut Yuki, now 41, was desperate to try it. She bought some marijuana and asked her husband to roll her a joint.\n\n\"All the pain was gone so finally I could sleep, I slept like a baby,\" she said. When she woke up the next morning, she felt her appetite coming back and devoured a meal of curry and rice. She then smoked another joint, and for the first time in a long time, felt up to doing house chores.\n\n\"I had two growing kids at that time, one was nine years old, the other was 11. The two of them needed my attention but I could not give it to them because I was so sick,\" she said. After years of using opiates to deal with pain caused by her various medical problems, she felt liberated.\n\nMore than a decade later, and after several arrests - including one episode in which her entire family, including the children, were held in a jail cell - Yuki has put herself at the forefront of a campaign to reform Malaysia's drug laws.\n\nShe says she's not scared - for her \"it's either cannabis or die\".\n\nImage copyright HealTHCare Facebook page Image caption HealTHCare is said to have sold small bottles of oil to hundreds of customers\n\nOver the years Yuki has watched friend after friend be put behind bars and even lost her job at an airline as a result of her activism. But the events of recent months have made her and other marijuana advocates feel that they might finally have powerful voices on their side.\n\nIt began with a devastating blow - on 30 August - when 29-year-old Muhammad Lukman, a friend of Yuki's, was sentenced to death.\n\nA few years ago, she had begun using cannabis in the form of oil as an alternative to smoking and Lukman, who sold small dropper bottles of oil for $10 (\u00a38) via a Facebook page called HealTHCcare, supplied it to her. (THC is the main psychoactive compound in cannabis.)\n\nLukman's lawyers presented him as a kind-hearted and pious Muslim, who would give away oil to patients who could not afford it - including Yuki. It's clear that many people felt his product helped them with various ailments, but his page also made some unfounded claims about cannabis's ability to cure diseases like leukaemia.\n\nAlthough about 900 others are on death row in Malaysia for drug offences, Lukman's case prompted an outcry over what was widely seen as a disproportionate punishment.\n\nA petition gathered tens of thousands of signatures and high-profile politicians began to weigh in, including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said the case should be reviewed. Nurul Izzah Anwar, an MP with the governing coalition, said it looked to be a \"miscarriage of justice\".\n\nImage caption Muhammad Lukman seen in court during his trial\n\nReports then emerged in late September that the cabinet had discussed the medical benefits of cannabis, with one minister saying he was fully behind it.\n\nIn October, Yuki and her friends received another surprise. Mr Mahathir's reform-minded government announced it was going to to abolish the death penalty completely. Suspects convicted for drug trafficking, like Lukman, could however still face jail for decades or life.\n\nMedical cannabis - what the research says\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nConclusive or substantial evidence:\n\nas treatment for chronic pain in adults\n\nas treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting\n\nfor improving patient-reported multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms\n\nModerate evidence:\n\nimproving sleep in individuals with specific conditions including fibromyalgia and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome\n\nEpilepsy\n\nRecent studies have found that cannabidiol (CBD - an active ingredient in cannabis) reduced seizures in individuals with rare childhood epilepsy disorders - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome\n\nSources: US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine; New England Journal of Medicine; NHS\n\nLukman's case is not the only one the activists are watching. Mohammed Zaireen bin Zainal, the founder of the Malaysian Marijuana Education Movement, is also on death row and awaiting a final appeal. A 58-year-old ex-military captain known as \"Dr Ganja\", who treated himself and others with cannabis oil, is awaiting trial.\n\nSamantha Chong, Dr Ganja's lawyer, said that as a former prosecutor, she has seen first-hand that the draconian laws are not working. \"I kept on seeing the same accused person coming for drug offences. [We would] put them in jail or give them a fine but they would keep coming back.\"\n\nMalaysians like her who advocate drug policy reform feel that international momentum is on their side. They recently watched Canada and South Africa legalise the drug completely.\n\nIn the US, medical cannabis is legal in 31 states. And since 1 November, cannabis products have been available on the UK's National Health Service for certain patients.\n\nIn the region, India and Thailand have both signalled that they could liberalise laws around medical marijuana products.\n\nThe World Health Organization is currently conducting a \"critical review\" of cannabis to decide if the drug's strict scheduling next to cocaine and heroin under decades-old international drug control conventions is appropriate. It could pave the way to revisions of UN conventions which underpin tough drug laws around the world, says Professor Iain McGregor of the University of Sydney's Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics.\n\nImage copyright Supplied Image caption Cannabis activists have turned out as part of large political protests in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital\n\nBut for those changes to happen it will require \"a lot of the Muslim countries that are traditionally quite strongly anti-drug\" to change their positions. \"And I wonder if Malaysia\", he added, \"will now act as a key opinion leader amongst that cluster of countries to implement change.\"\n\nDocuments seen by the BBC confirm that both Prime Minister Mahathir and Health Minister Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad have been in contact with the organisers of a privately-funded project involving Malaysian and Indian researchers looking at the potential for medical cannabis to treat depression. And Nurul Izzah Anwar, the MP, says she has begun drafting a bill to present in parliament.\n\nHowever it's unclear how soon any major legal reforms could occur. Law Minister Liew Vui Keong insisted that the government had \"not come to any conclusion with regard to the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes\" but added that he would be willing to review the evidence available and based on that possibly make a recommendation that the laws be changed.\n\nFor Yuki, legalisation - at least for medical use - can't come fast enough. A regulated market, she and other advocates say, would allow ill people who already use cannabis in the shadows to access safer products.\n\n\"If you are desperate, you are sick, you will do anything,\" she says. \"We go online, we search about it, we find out about it.

Well now it seems they just don't talk anymore.\n\nInstead, the US and North Korea appear to be staring one another down, waiting for the other to blink or make a move. And neither appears willing to give way.\n\nDiscussions aimed at setting up a second summit between the two leaders didn't happen as planned this week.\n\nChairman Kim's aide, the hardliner Kim Yong-chol was supposed to travel to New York and meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nBut the BBC understands that the meeting was cancelled after the State Department discovered that the North Koreans didn't get on the plane as planned.\n\nThe official line is that the meeting will be rescheduled and Mr Trump said he's \"very happy\" with how things are going, and that he's in \"no rush\" while sanctions remain in place.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption It's been a while since Mike Pompeo (right) was last in Pyongyang\n\nIn Seoul, too, they are urging reporters not to read too much into the missed meeting - there have been missed meetings in the past, they say.\n\nAlthough officials from the Foreign Ministry did express \"disappointment\".\n\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in warned me in his BBC interview that he expected \"bumps and bruises\" on the way as the international community tries to persuade North Korea to disarm.\n\nBut it's hard not to feel that both the momentum for talks and the opportunity to engage with North Korea may be slipping away.\n\nEven at a lower level, the new US North Korean envoy Stephen Biegun has been in his job for over two months and has still not met his Pyongyang counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Choi Sun-hui.\n\nComplete denuclearisation?\n\nThe root of this standoff is that North Korea and the US have never really agreed on the goalposts of \"denuclearisation\".\n\nWhat do they actually mean when they talk about disarmament? Yes the two leaders signed an agreement in Singapore, but the lack of detail in the deal we talked about back then is now coming back to haunt these talks and potentially scupper progress.\n\nFrom the start, Pyongyang has been clear. They will not unilaterally disarm. They want a staged process where they give a little and get something in return.\n\nThat means, right now they feel they have done enough to warrant sanctions relief.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korea is rather reluctant to give up its nukes\n\nBoth the US and the UN have placed tough economic penalties on North Korea.\n\nAround 90% of its exports are banned including coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles. There are also caps on the amount of oil it can buy. If Kim Jong-un is going to build up his economy as he has promised his people, then he will need the sanctions lifted.\n\nHowever, the US has also been absolute. There will be no sanctions relief until \"complete denuclearisation\".\n\nRight now, that seems a lofty and unrealistic goal. President Trump did say that \"he'd love to take the sanctions off\", and then added that North Korea \"would have to be responsive, too\".\n\nWill Washington compromise?\n\nRussia called a meeting this week of the United Nations Security Council to discuss sanctions on North Korean banks.\n\nBut the US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, was unequivocal: \"The threat is still there. North Korea still has nuclear facilities and they've still not allowed inspectors in to inspect them.\"\n\nSeveral analysts have called on the US to adjust its thinking and approach. Bend a little before this process breaks completely. But so far there have been no signs that the Trump administration is willing to do this.\n\nSo if the US is not prepared to act, what does Pyongyang do? Last week it issued a threat in a statement from the Foreign Ministry's Institute for American Studies.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Pyongyang has stepped up its rhetoric against the US again\n\nIt claimed that \"the improvement of relations and sanctions is incompatible\", and that the US was \"bragging arrogantly without showing any change in its stand, while failing to properly understand our repeated demand\".\n\nThe statement went on to suggest that unless the US removed sanctions, then it could restart its nuclear programme.\n\nLet's be clear here, several studies by US intelligence and by the UN suggest North Korea has not stopped its building or stockpiling of weapons.\n\nBut it has stopped testing missiles and nuclear weapons, which President Trump has taken as a personal victory. Mr Trump even declared that \"there was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea\".\n\nNorth Korea's choices\n\nSo yes, North Korea has a choice. It could test another missile, which would be embarrassing to a US President who has declared that the problem was solved.\n\nBut that would come with huge risks.\n\nImage copyright kcna Image caption So far, Mr Kim has held off launching new test missiles\n\nA missile test is more likely to anger an unpredictable Donald Trump who hates when his administration shows any sign of weakness. It would, once again, raise international condemnation and is unlikely to have the desired effect of sanctions relief.\n\nAnother missile or nuclear test would also harm North Korea's developing relationship with the South, where several companies are poised to invest as soon as the restrictions are lifted.\n\nKim Jong-un's other choice is to blink first and fulfil some of his promises. He could let inspectors into Punggye-ri, the state's only known nuclear test site.\n\nTV cameras were brought in to witness a series of explosions there in May, which North Korea claims was its complete destruction.\n\nPresident Moon said Mr Kim told him he would allow inspectors in, and there have been reports in South Korea that preparations are being made. This would allow Pyongyang to argue that they are once again keeping their end of the bargain.\n\nMr Kim could also close the Yongbyon nuclear facility where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea pledged to close it earlier this year, but only if the US takes corresponding measures. It would be very difficult politically for Mr Kim to do this first, so the US would have to put something good on the table for Pyongyang to take this step.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kim Jong-un is thought to be under pressure as a young leader\n\nIt is worth mentioning that several people I speak to, who have regular contact with leaders in Pyongyang, have told me about the pressures facing Kim Jong-un as a young leader.\n\nHe is surrounded by a number of military hardliners who are not willing to disarm, nor do they wish to be seen as bowing to US requests.\n\nPyongyang's savvy games\n\nPerhaps both sides are calculating that they can simply \"run the clock\", play for time and wait. The US can keep sanctions in place until North Korea takes further action.\n\nPyongyang can continue to issue warnings and develop other diplomatic ties.\n\nHowever, this is a huge gamble for the US. North Korea's nuclear arsenal has been labelled an urgent problem by US defence and intelligence chiefs.\n\nThat threat is still there and the longer this standoff continues, the more likely it is that Pyongyang will continue to develop weapons.\n\nThe stringent economic sanctions imposed on the state may only have a limited effect. The Trump administration had managed to get China and Russia on board with its \"maximum pressure\" policy for some months.\n\nBut reports suggest the borders have become porous in places and the supplies are making their way into North Korea. Kim Jong-un has proved to be a savvy political operator and has rebuilt relationships with his neighbours.\n\nThe US maintains that another summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump will take place early next year.\n\nThe two leaders may prefer dealing with one another directly. But it still needs talks to take place between those lower down the chain of command to sort out the details of a deal. A timetable for disarmament and corresponding US actions for instance.\n\nWithout those details on paper, as you can see, we end up with what is the equivalent of this diplomatic game of chicken which puts president Mr Trump's much applauded North Korea policy in danger of crashing.", "Match of the Day 2 pundits Alan Shearer and Jermaine Jenas discuss the contrasting performances between the two Manchester sides after City's comprehensive victory in the derby.\n\nWATCH MORE: Man City wanted to perform well for the fans - Guardiola", "Video\n\nThe mother of a baby boy who was born prematurely has backed calls for parents like her to get extra maternity leave.\n\nSarah Kirker's son, Matthew, was born at just 24 weeks gestation on 1 April - more than three months earlier than expected.\n\nAs a consequence, Mrs Kirker's maternity leave also arrived early.

This week we speak to James Hind, founder of UK car price comparison website Carwow.\n\nWhile unforeseen circumstances can completely change all our lives, it was the global financial crisis that sent James Hind down an entirely different path.\n\nIn 2008 he was a 21-year-old intern working at a UK investment fund when the world of finance was hit by turmoil.\n\n\"I watched the industry collapse, it was just chaos,\" he says.\n\n\"I suddenly realised that people in the financial world didn't have any control, they were just riding a wave. Watching that I realised it wasn't for me.\"\n\nSo having previously planned to have a long career in finance, James walked away.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Hind nearly ended up in the finance industry\n\nNot immediately knowing what else to do with his life, he remembered that he had once been given the job advice that you should \"do what you love\".\n\nAs a big fan of cars, he decided to launch a website that collated car reviews, and then try to sell advertising on the pages.\n\nToday the business is London-based price comparison website Carwow, and in 2017 it had an annual turnover of \u00a315m.\n\nNot bad for a company that the Nottingham University graduate started in the loft of his parents' home on the Wirral peninsula in the north west of England, and one that initially found it impossible to secure any funding.\n\nAfter first going travelling for a year, James launched the initial iteration of Carwow in 2010, when it was called Carbuzz.\n\nWith his girlfriend Alexandra Margolis on board as co-founder, she designed the website while he set about adding all the content.\n\nImage copyright Edmund Dabney Image caption James Hind (right) co-founded the business with Alexandra Margolis in 2010 and David Santoro joined in 2012\n\nOver the next few years advertising revenues trickled in, before James realised that the operation could both be more useful to customers, and far more lucrative, if it changed its business model.\n\nSo he reinvented the website into one where users could search for the best price for a new car.\n\nMirroring the price comparison websites that have particularly changed the insurance industry, his idea was that people could enter the exact details of the make and model of car they wanted, not just the colour and engine-size, but the precise combination of optional extras.\n\nA list of prices offered by dealers across the UK would then be displayed on the screen.\n\n\"I realised that many people hated buying a car, they went into it expecting to have a bad time,\" says James, now 31.\n\n\"And a big reason for this was because most of us hate haggling, and buying a new car has always been a very rare example of a time when you were expected to have to do this.\n\n\"My idea was to completely remove the need for people to haggle.\"\n\nMore The Boss features:\n\nBringing a technology savvy friend called David Santoro on board to build the new website, the new version of the company was launched in 2012.\n\nBut while a number of car dealers across the UK were happy to give it a go, potential investors most certainly were not.\n\n\"In the early days we massively struggled to secure funding,\" says James.\n\n\"We contacted virtually every venture capital fund in London, and all either said no, or just ignored us.\n\n\"And I can understand why. We were young entrepreneurs with no track record, and we had very little proof at the time that the business was going to work.\"\n\nImage copyright Carwow Image caption In 2014 the company changed its name from Carbuzz\n\nIt took a year and a half of \"cold emailing\" potential investors before the company got its first investment.\n\nThe name change from Carbuzz to Carwow happened in 2014 because, ambitious for global growth in the future, James discovered that the Carbuzz brand had already been taken in other countries.\n\nCarwow has grown steadily since then, thanks to word of mouth and a popular YouTube channel where employees review cars. James says that the videos get 17 million views every month.\n\nLast year the company made 55,000 sales via its website, accounting for 5% of private new car sales in the UK. It also now operates in Germany and France.\n\nMore than 2,000 dealers across the UK pay an undisclosed fee to be listed on the site.

But she has interviewed many people whose lives have been severely affected by compulsive sexual behaviour - including one woman who discovered by chance, after 20 years of marriage, that her husband had a secret life. This is an edited transcript of her story.\n\nI always thought I had a very normal marriage. We'd been together a number of years before we got married and we'd been married for a couple of decades and had children. My husband was a successful businessman, who travelled a lot for work so I spent a lot of time on my own bringing the children up but he came home every weekend. I just assumed it was a very normal relationship. He always seemed happy when he was at home. I had no inkling of what was going on whatsoever.\n\nThen one day I had to pop into his study to find something on his desk, and his laptop was open. I'd never checked up on him, but the screen was on his emails, and I saw an email that showed a reservation for a hotel in London, for the day after I was leaving to go on a holiday with some friends. I thought, \"That's a bit strange, why has he got a hotel room booked?\" It just seemed odd. I couldn't understand it.\n\nI sat on it all day and thought about it. Later, when I was lying in bed, I just couldn't get it out of my head. So I plucked up the courage and asked him why he had a hotel booking. And he didn't reply.\n\nThe silence told me that there was something dreadfully wrong. It seemed like forever. After what felt like half an hour - I suspect it was probably more like two minutes - I got up and I said to him: \"What's going on?\"\n\nI can't remember his exact words but he just said he was sorry and that he was seeing somebody - at which point I grabbed my dressing gown and went downstairs. I just couldn't stay in the same room. And I cried.\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nEventually he came downstairs and sat opposite me and told me how sorry he was. He told me that he'd started going to strip clubs a while ago and had met a dancer at the strip club who he had become close to and that he had booked the room to meet her, in order to take the relationship further.\n\nSo I asked him there and then whether they'd had sex and he told me he hadn't, that at this point in time there had been some \"teasing\" but nothing more than that.\n\nI wanted to believe him. I think I was absolutely desperate to believe him. I was dreadfully upset but there was a little bit of me that thought, \"OK, we can, we can sort this out. This is just a middle-aged man, a moment of madness. We'll, we'll get through this.\"\n\nAnd because my friends were desperate for me to join them on our girls' weekend I thought I would have a few days away from him to give me time to process my thoughts.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to the Addicted to Sex podcast - six full and very frank conversations conducted by Sangita Myska\n\nOr listen online to Sangita's half-hour Radio 4 documentary, Addicted to Sex\n\nI didn't tell my friends. I wanted to keep it to myself. It was a really really difficult few days. I didn't sleep very well at all. I couldn't eat. Looking back, I'm not sure quite how I got through it.\n\nWhen I got home, we talked a lot. There was a lot of crying on my side.\n\nBut the truth is, I always felt it was far too coincidental that I should just happen to come across an email of a hotel booking before any sexual relationship had taken place. It was just far too much of a coincidence.\n\nSo I pushed him to look me in the eye and tell me he hadn't had sex with this woman, which he couldn't. This is probably two to three weeks after I found the email. Then he admitted that there had been a sexual relationship and that it had been going on for a few weeks, or a few months.\n\nI'm looking at this man I've known for all these years thinking: \"How could you have hidden it? How could I have not have realised anything was wrong?\"\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nI couldn't understand how the man I knew had done what he'd done, had got himself involved in something that just didn't ring true to the person I knew. None of it made sense so I went shopping for pain. I basically started looking through all his emails.\n\nI found other hotel reservations that dated back further than the dates that he'd given me. And after going back several months and even a couple of years I found that some of the dates didn't match his story of how long he'd been seeing this woman at all.\n\nThe turning point came one day when we went out for a walk. I just said to him, \"I have to know everything. I'm going to keep pressing and keep pressing because I don't think I know everything.\" I threatened to look at bank statements, threatened to look back through all his emails. I told him that I really needed to know the truth.\n\nAnd he said to me, \"Are you sure you want to go down this route?\" At which point I thought, \"Oh no, there's so much more to this.\" But I had no idea what he was going to say would be quite as devastating as what then came out.\n\nHe had been using prostitutes throughout our marriage. He also told me that he watched a lot of porn, sometimes for hours at a time. And that he went to strip clubs, and sex clubs, and sex cinemas while he was travelling abroad.\n\nI didn't tell anyone. One or two friends noticed that I was quieter and asked me if I was all right but I always had an excuse - \"I'm tired, I'm not sleeping very well, must be the menopause or my mum hadn't been particularly well.\"\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nI was ashamed of what had happened. I wondered what people would think when I told them, what they'd think of Dan, what they'd think of me. I assumed people would judge our marriage and think it was a sham marriage. I also felt people would think I hadn't been good enough for him, not pretty enough, not sexy enough.\n\nI've always been a relatively confident person. I wasn't the sort of woman who had her nails done every week or had botox. I'm middle-aged, I'm a little bit overweight, I'm getting old, I've got wrinkles but I thought that was just normal for my age. But this completely shattered my self-esteem. I questioned whether I was a fun person to be with.\n\nI started wearing more make-up and making sure that I looked as good as I could. I had already lost some weight - it took me quite a long time to really want to eat anything. I bought some new clothes, had my hair done more often, perhaps, and I did go and have some botox.\n\nBut I also believed there was something wrong with him in his psyche - some illness. I thought he needed help, and that he needed help from me.\n\nWhen I went along to the clinic, and it was explained that his behaviour was probably the behaviour of a sex addict, I believed that. I thought, \"Oh great, there's a label, that's it, he's ill. There's something wrong with him.\"\n\nI want to believe that because then I can keep reassuring myself that \"No, you had nothing to do with it, it was always going to happen.\"\n\nBut he came back from a counselling session once and said he wasn't certain it was a sex addiction or whether he had just made bad choices. I found that very difficult to hear and it did affect me for a couple of days.\n\nWhen we started marriage guidance, one thing I very clearly remember him saying was that life before I discovered the truth was like being in this dark tunnel holding the secret and hiding it and lying - and now he could see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd I remember looking at him and thinking, \"That's great for you but I'm the one now living in complete darkness. Everything for me is now dark and gloomy, and I'm holding the secret now because I can't tell anyone what's going on.\" And I felt that was just so unfair.\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nI don't want to tell people because I don't want people to judge me. For example, I was watching the Ryder Cup the other day and seeing Tiger Woods with a girlfriend and thinking people would be looking at her and thinking, \"Oh that's the little woman, the doormat. He probably treads all over her. You know he's the sex addict, he doesn't have respect for women.\" People judge people. They assume they know.\n\nIn a lot of ways our marriage is better than it was, which seems like a crazy thing to say but we spent months going to marriage guidance. We are much more open with each other. We talk a lot more and we actually talk about feelings, not just what we've been up to today or what we plan to do. We actually talk about feelings, both the good and the bad.\n\nThere are still quite a few occasions where I do get low but I would say most of the time now I feel that our marriage is on an even keel and my emotional state is on an even keel.\n\nCan I forgive him? This is something I've talked through with therapists and I don't really know what forgiveness is. I don't think I'll ever forgive him for the hurt he has caused me, it's so deep. I don't think I could ever forgive that but... I want to be with him and I do love him. And life is good with him. Is that forgiveness? I don't know.\n\nI think at the end of the day we're good together. We're good friends. I still love him, and he assures me he still loves me, that he always has loved me.\n\nAlso I'd hate for my kids to know, absolutely hate it. I think they'd lose all respect for their father. And my family adore my husband. I think if you met him, you just wouldn't believe it. He's just not the person to do something like this.\n\nHe would be the last person I would suspect of doing something as stupid as what he did.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of an interview that features in the Addicted to Sex podcast, with Sangita Myska, produced by Sarah Shebbeare\n\nAll illustrations: Karen Charmaine Chanakira for the BBC.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nThe BBC's Sangita Myska has been meeting people who say they've suffered from sex addiction, in order to understand whether it really exists, and if so, what it is.

They are looking like a proper team.\n\nDid you know? As well as making four saves and keeping a clean sheet at Chelsea, Pickford's 21 completed passes was his highest tally in a league game this season.\n\nDefenders - Matthew Lowton (Burnley), Sol Bamba (Cardiff), Juan Foyth (Tottenham), Andrew Robertson (Liverpool)\n\nMatthew Lowton: I've seen him make extraordinary clearances off the line before so these occurrences are not happening by accident.\n\nThis time it was against Leicester and what a clearance it was too. The ball came at him like a rocket from a Jamie Vardy shot.\n\nEven BBC commentator Guy Mowbray exclaimed \"what a block\". It was the turning point in the game.\n\nDid you know? Lowton made more recoveries (eight) and had more touches of the ball (78) than any other of his team-mates against Leicester City.\n\nSol Bamba: The overhead kick by Sol Bamba was brilliant and it provided the opening for his goal.\n\nCardiff just about deserved this victory but what cheek their players showed in remonstrating to the referee about Brighton's Dale Stephens' tackle on Greg Cunningham which led to a red card. They should have known better. I have seen some awful tackles dished out by Cardiff players and they have stayed on the pitch. Come on lads, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n\nDid you know? In addition to his late winner, Bamba made more tackles (three), clearances (three) and blocks (one) than any other Cardiff player against Brighton.\n\nJuan Foyth: I couldn't believe Mauricio Pochettino decided to start the game with this lad after he gave away two penalties against Wolves.\n\nWhat faith the manager must have had in him and what belief the player must have had in himself. After a shaky start, Foyth was brilliant, showing vision, composure and foresight and he got the winning goal his courage deserved.\n\nDid you know? Juan Foyth is the third Argentine player to score for Spurs in the Premier League, after Erik Lamela and Mauricio Taricco.\n\nAndrew Robertson: This lad has come a long way since his days of playing in front of a few hundred people at Queen's Park.\n\nRobertson has come through the ranks the hard way, also playing for Dundee United and Hull City before joining Liverpool and making a name for himself. I'm not entirely sure his left foot is as good as 1970s Liverpool legend Alec Lindsay's but the cross he provided for Xherdan Shaqiri to score looked pretty special.\n\nDid you know? Robertson made more successful passes in the opposition's half (42) and attempted more crosses (eight) than any other player in Liverpool's win over Fulham.\n\nMidfielders - Fernandinho (Man City), David Silva (Man City), Felipe Anderson (West Ham)\n\nFernandinho: Regular readers of my Team of the Week will know how I adore Fernandinho. There cannot be a manager in the Premier League who would not want him in his side.\n\nThere was a priceless moment in the Manchester derby where Fernandinho grabbed Riyad Mahrez by the scruff of the neck (in a Dave Mackay-Billy Bremner fashion) because he was forced to run past Mahrez in order to make a tackle when United appeared to be getting back into the game. Mahrez was substituted shortly afterwards, probably for his own safety.\n\nDid you know? Against Manchester United, Fernandinho had more touches (103) than any other player, and won more duels (seven) than any of his team-mates.\n\nDavid Silva: He doesn't score many goals but when he does they are either immensely important or spectacular. Silva's goal in the Manchester derby was certainly important.\n\nThe little Spaniard was superb in the first half and even better in the second. What a time to take Manchester City two points clear at the top of the Premier League table just before the international break.\n\nDid you know? David Silva has scored in three consecutive home games in all competitions for Manchester City for the first time.\n\nFelipe Anderson: It became very clear to me in the early exchanges against Huddersfield that the Brazilian had developed a taste for scoring goals after his double against Burnley last weekend and so it proved against the Terriers. Anderson spent the entire game looking for goals and could have had a hat-trick. The one he settled for wasn't bad either.\n\nDid you know? Felipe Anderson has scored three goals in his past two Premier League games for West Ham, as many as he managed in his previous 24 appearances in the big five European leagues.\n\nForwards - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool), Salomon Rondon (Newcastle), Raheem Sterling (Man City)\n\nMohamed Salah: This wasn't Liverpool at their exhilarating best but if you want to see a team transition from defence to attack seamlessly then there is no-one better. What makes matters worse for the opposition is they have Mohamed Salah, who is as fast as a hare, to put the finishing touches to the move.\n\nFulham were right to feel aggrieved about their disallowed goal for a dubious offside decision. Sadly for Fulham the ball from the subsequent free-kick ended up in the back of their net.\n\nLife just isn't fair sometimes.\n\nDid you know? Mohamed Salah has scored against 19 of the 21 Premier League opponents he's faced with Liverpool, failing only against Manchester United and Swansea.\n\nSalomon Rondon: I saw a lot of Salomon Rondon at West Brom and I came to the conclusion that here was a willing runner who was a little goal shy. Well, against Bournemouth the Newcastle striker put that notion to bed with two well-taken goals.\n\nHis second was especially impressive, although he should have had a hat-trick. I also noticed that the Venezuela international is sporting a new figure. A much leaner and meaner Rondon.\n\nRafael Benitez appears to have got hold of the striker and put him through a serious fitness programme. It looks like it's working.\n\nDid you know? Against Bournemouth, Rondon scored more than once in a Premier League game for just the second time in his career (also three versus Swansea in December 2016).\n\nRaheem Sterling: Last week I implored Raheem Sterling to sign the extension offer on his contract, not for the money but because it was the best move for his long-term career. Sterling has now settled that issue and signed.\n\nHis performance against Manchester United epitomised a player who is destined to win trophies and be the best. This Manchester City team is a bit special but to prove it they must win the Champions League and Sterling suddenly becomes world class.\n\nDid you know? Sterling has won more fouls (20) than any other Manchester City player in the Premier League this season - no other City player was fouled more than the forward against Manchester United.\n\nNow it's your turn\n\nYou've seen my picks this week. But who would you go for?\n\nPick your XI from our list and share with your friends.\n\nThe Crooks of the matter\n\nOn Final Score Paul Ince and I were thrown into the debate over Charlie Austin's disallowed goal against Watford. We were both highly entertained by the striker's post-match rant and agreed that the decision to rule the goal offside was badly misjudged. In fact, referee Simon Hooper's nightmare started much earlier when he waved play on despite Ryan Bertrand scything down Nathaniel Chalobah in the penalty area to the utter amazement of Chalobah and his Watford team-mates.\n\nMark Hughes went one step further by stating that Hooper (having admitted the error) did not meet the standard required by the Premier League and there was plenty of evidence on the day to support the argument . However, it was the suggestion by Paul that referees should openly admit when they had made a costly mistake that left me perplexed. Why? We have the irrefutable evidence of the television camera to tell us the truth. You now want to humiliate the referee by insisting he explain his incompetence?\n\nIf the game starts forcing referees to clarify their errors, or worse apologise, you immediately make their jobs infinitely more unpalatable and risk discouraging talented referees to do what is fast becoming an almost impossible job. No, the referee's decision is final even when it's wrong. A tradition that was instituted long before Paul Ince or I entered the soccer scene and hopefully it shall remain long after we've left it.", "Madrid have won each of their four games under caretaker boss Santiago Solari\n\nReal Madrid narrowed the gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to four points with a hard-fought victory at Celta Vigo.\n\nKarim Benzema put Madrid ahead with an expert finish from Luka Modric's pass.\n\nAfter the break Benzema's shot hit the post and went in off defender Gustavo Cabral to put Real 2-0 up but Celta's Hugo Mallo scored with a smart volley.\n\nSergio Ramos chipped in a penalty and Dani Ceballos smashed home in stoppage time after Cabral was sent off, with Brais Mendez adding a late consolation.\n\nIt was Madrid's fourth straight win under caretaker manager Santiago Solari, who was put in charge after Julen Lopetegui was sacked the day after a 5-1 defeat at Barcelona on 28 October.\n\nChampions Barca had earlier on Sunday lost 4-3 at home to an impressive Real Betis side, and this Madrid victory brings the European champions back into the Spanish title race.\n\nLa Liga rules say temporary managers can only be in place for 14 days, and it is expected Argentine former Madrid winger Solari, 42, will be made permanent manager on Monday.\n\nMadrid are sixth in the table, three points off the top four, while Celta are now 14th, four points above the relegation zone.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Women\u2019s World Twenty20 highlights: Australia thrash Ireland\n\nICC Women's World Twenty20, Guyana Ireland 93-6 (20 overs): Garth 24; Perry 2-12 Australia 94-1 (9.1 overs): Healy 56* Australia won by nine wickets Scorecard\n\nTournament favourites Australia maintained their 100% record at the Women's World Twenty20 with a crushing nine-wicket win over Ireland in Guyana.\n\nThe former champions restricted Ireland to 93-6 as Ellyse Perry took 2-12.\n\nKim Garth, on her 100th appearance, top-scored with 24 for Ireland but they were penalised five runs for running down the centre of the pitch.\n\nWith Alyssa Healy smashing 56 not out, Australia needed barely nine overs to reach their target and top Group B.\n\nIreland opted to bat and made a positive start as veteran opener Clare Shillington struck three boundaries in the opening five overs, but she and Eimear Richardson both attempted audacious scoop shots at Perry and saw their stumps rattled.\n\nHaving seen Pakistan concede 10 penalty runs for two similar indiscretions in their defeat against India on the same pitch earlier in the day, Ireland were penalised in the 13th over.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device World T20: 'Flossed' wickets and perfect starts\n\nSeventeen-year-old Gaby Lewis was warned and two balls later Zimbabwean umpire Langton Rusere enforced the penalty against skipper Laura Delany, even though she ran towards the edge of the cut strip after a couple of initial steps -

But as his errors began to mount, his mood visibly soured.\n\nNishikori looked like he would run away with the tie-break, forging a 6-1 lead before Federer clawed it back to 6-4, but the Swiss then sent a forehand into the net to hand the set to the Japanese player.\n\nThe 20-time Grand Slam champion grew increasingly frustrated with himself, while Nishikori simply grew in confidence.\n\nHaving traded early breaks in the second, the Japanese player broke in the sixth game to go 4-2 up and then served to love in the following game.\n\nMore Federer errors gave Nishikori three match points and one final mis-hit forehand way beyond the baseline handed him victory.\n\n\"I'm glad to win, it is never easy to play with my idol, it is always a big challenge against him, so it was great to win,\" said Nishikori, who has reached the semi-finals here twice.\n\nGroup Lleyton Hewitt W-L Sets Games Kei Nishikori 1-0 2-0 13-9 Kevin Anderson 1-0 2-0 13-9 Roger Federer 0-1 0-2 9-13 Dominic Thiem 0-1 0-2 9-13\n\nWhat went wrong for Federer?\n\nAn out-of-sorts Roger Federer lost to Kei Nishikori for only the third time in 10 meetings\n\nFederer pointed to a combination of nerves and the surface for his below-par showing, which followed a good run of results where he had won the title in Basel and reached the semi-finals in Shanghai and Paris.\n\n\"The court here plays differently, definitely slower than the last few tournaments I've played.

This was not easy and it's a shock for people to see.\n\nI said before the match, for Nishikori to win, Federer had to play way below par and that's what happened.\n\nFederer never found his rhythm from the back of the court. Nishikori is not a great server, but Federer didn't make a break point in the first set.\n\nTime and time again we saw errors from the back of the court and not getting his feet into the right areas.\n\nBBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller\n\nFederer had won his last 11 round-robin matches at the ATP Finals, but produced an erratic performance which hugely complicates his passage to the semi-finals. After Nishikori recovered from 5-6 0-30 down with the help of an extraordinarily athletic backhand half volley to win the first set on a tie-break 7-4, he was the stronger and more confident player.\n\nServing and volleying at opportune moments, Nishikori ended a run of six consecutive defeats against Federer.", "The Premier League's top three have won 90 points between them so far this season - 10 more than the bottom nine clubs combined\n\nMind the gap - the difference between the top and bottom of the Premier League looks to be wider than ever.\n\nIn the race for the title, just four points separate Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea after all three sides maintained their unbeaten starts to the season this weekend - the first time three teams have avoided defeat after 12 games of a top-flight campaign.\n\nAt the bottom, Fulham lost again, meaning they have made the third-worst start by any team at this stage of a Premier League campaign.\n\nThose results - Manchester City winning the Manchester derby, Liverpool beating Fulham and Chelsea drawing with Everton - leave City two points clear of Liverpool, with Chelsea just two points further back in third.\n\nPep Guardiola's side actually have two points fewer than they did this time last season, but perhaps more significant is what's going on immediately below them.\n\nCity were eight points clear of second-placed Manchester United this time 12 months ago. Chelsea were third but are three points better off this time around. After their record-breaking 100 points haul last season, it seems City's title rivals have stepped up a level to try and compete.\n\nBut how does that compare with previous seasons?\n\nTo put it in perspective, Liverpool have equalled their best start to a Premier League season, matching the total they achieved in 2002-03. Their points tally of 30 would have been enough to top the table at this stage in 18 of the previous 26 Premier League seasons.\n\nAnd the top three's combined points total of 90 is the most collected by the clubs in those positions at this stage of a Premier League season.\n\nMind the gap indeed.\n\nRecord-breaking Sarri\n\nChelsea may have failed to win this weekend but manager Maurizio Sarri was still able to create a little bit of history.\n\nSunday's goalless draw at Stamford Bridge means the Italian has become the first manager to avoid defeat in his first 12 Premier League games, moving ahead of Frank Clark at Nottingham Forest in 1994-95.\n\nIt's also just the second time in Chelsea's history that the club have gone unbeaten in their first 12 games of a top-flight season. The first time they did so - in 2014-15 - they went on to win the league under Jose Mourinho.\n\nDespite breaking the record, Sarri's total of 28 points from 12 games is only the fifth best start by a Chelsea manager in their first 12 Premier League games. Top of the list is Guus Hiddink, who earned 31 points from his first 12 matches in 2009-10 (Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Felipe Scolari and Jose Mourinho were the other three).\n\nTop five dominating bottom five\n\nOne of the reasons the top three have accrued so many points so far is their dominance over the teams at the bottom.\n\nIf you take the top five Premier League sides as a whole, they have won 19 out of the 20 meetings with the bottom five so far - with only Crystal Palace's 2-2 draw against Arsenal last month the exception.\n\nBut is the gap between top and bottom in the Premier League widening? We asked Simon Gleave of data analysts Gracenote to dig deeper into the numbers.\n\nHe said: \"With 40% of matches between the top and bottom five played, the big clubs are more dominant this season than ever before, winning all but one of these games. The top five's win percentage over the bottom five is 95% and they have won 96.7% of the possible points.\n\n\"With 11 goals in 20 matches, the bottom five score 0.55 goals per match in these fixtures. This is the fourth lowest return in the 27 Premier League seasons. This season's scoring rate of the bottom five against the top five is exactly half of what it was in the inaugural Premier League season (1992-93).\n\n\"There has been a remarkable difference in the scoring rate of the top five teams in these matches compared to previous Premier League seasons. The current top five clubs in the Premier League are scoring more than three goals per match against the bottom five, a figure which is unprecedented and nearly a goal per match higher than the average in these fixtures.\"\n\nTough at the bottom?\n\nAll those points collected at the top is inevitably having a negative effect on those at the bottom. And while the bottom three may only have four wins between them so far this season, it is a manager of a team just outside the relegation zone who is under pressure going into the international break.\n\nSouthampton's failure to beat Watford on Saturday created an unwanted club record. The 1-1 draw means the Saints have failed to win any of their first six home games in a season for the first time in the club's history.\n\nThe result also means Southampton are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference, increasing the pressure on boss Mark Hughes.\n\nHughes fulfilled his remit in keeping the Saints up last season, but his record of five wins from 24 games in charge means he has the worst win ratio - 20.8% - of any recent Saints manager.\n\nHow does Mark Hughes' Southampton record compare? Manager Matches Won Drawn Lost Win ratio% Mauricio Pochettino (2013-14) 60 23 18 19 38.33% Ronald Koeman (2014-16) 91 44 17 30 48.35% Claude Puel (2016-17) 53 20 13 20 37.74% Mauricio Pellegrino (2017-18) 34 8 13 13 23.53% Mark Hughes (2018-present) 24 5 8 11 20.8%\n\nNot only that, it is also the worst win ratio of Hughes' managerial career.\n\nMark Hughes' managerial record Team Matches Won Drawn Lost Win ratio% Blackburn (2004-08) 188 82 47 59 43.6% Man City (2008-09) 77 36 16 25 46.8% Fulham (2010-11) 43 14 16 13 32.6% QPR (2012) 34 8 6 20 23.5% Stoke (2013-18) 200 71 48 81 35.5% Southampton (2018-) 24 5 8 11 20.8%\n\nThe 55-year-old has won just three out of 20 Premier League games in charge, averaging 0.8 points per game. Of managers who have taken charge of 10 Premier League games or more since Hughes was appointed at St Mary's, only Slavisa Jokanovic, David Wagner and Neil Warnock have a worse points-per-game ratio - the managers of the three teams currently below Saints in the table.\n\nIf Southampton maintain their current points-per-game ratio, they are on course to end the season on 30 points. No team has ever avoided relegation from the Premier League with such a tally, with West Brom's total of 34 points the lowest in 2004-05.\n\nAnd finally...

Those, together with minimising errors and penalties against you, are the way to deny the opposition a chance of momentum and strangle the life out of the contest.\n\nAustralia back row David Pocock is the archetype. During the last World Cup, he secured a tournament-high total of 17 turnovers across five-and-a-half games, including three in the final.\n\nCurry, Underhill's main rival for the England seven shirt, averaged three a match for Sale last season.\n\nMaking 20 tackles a match does not make you indispensible in the same way.\n\nThat huge work-rate is commendable, but it comes at the cost of Underhill being effective at the breakdown.\n\nToo often he is the man on the floor, rather than next on the scene, jackalling over the top to slow up and steal opposition ball or secure his team's own.\n\nHis carrying is solid, but not exceptional. In the first minute, he was stripped of possession by Sam Whitelock. The very best don't allow that to happen to them.\n\nAs Kieran Read tackles Underhill low in the first minute, Sam Whitelock spots the opportunity to dislodge the ball\n\nWith Underhill too upright and his support too distant, Whitelock grapples for possession\n\nThe ball spills forward and referee Jerome Garces awards the scrum New Zealand's way\n\nHe has the powerful build and low centre of gravity to be immoveable over the ball.\n\nFrom what I have seen of him at Bath, he is very analytical about his performances and relishes the chance to disrupt the opposition.\n\nHis performance on Saturday must have made him England's first-choice open-side flanker, but he has to change his game if he is to be a genuine seven rather than another of the \"six-and-a-halves\" that Eddie Jones has made do with in his back row.\n\nChris Robshaw and James Haskell posed with 'six and a half' shirts after England's 2016 Grand Slam in reference to coach Eddie Jones' previous criticism of England's lack of a specialist open-side\n\nFast feet from Little Mac give England defence food for thought\n\nWhile Underhill operates in close quarters, it was New Zealand full-back Damian McKenzie who shone in broken field at Twickenham.\n\nWe should be careful. This was only his 14th Test start and he has taken his time to nail down his place ahead of Jordie Barrett and others. But, when coach Steve Hansen shunts a world-class full-back like Ben Smith out to the wing to accommodate McKenzie, you know he is a great talent.\n\nThere was one sequence early in the first half which showed his innate feeling for space and startling acceleration.\n\nNew Zealand were caught short-staffed in the backfield after Ardie Savea was superbly stripped of possession in England's 22m by Owen Farrell and Ben Youngs took the chance to kick deep.\n\nMcKenzie hurried back, but reaches the ball with no passing option and an England chase, led by Chris Ashton, hard on his heels.\n\nAfter initially looking infield, McKenzie doubles back to out-fox the onrushing Ashton with an audacious dart up the five-metre channel\n\nOwen Farrell comes across to cover, but McKenzie, using his vision to scan for tacklers rather then charging blindly forward, realises Farrell was stretching to make the tackle...\n\n..and he slams on the brakes to leave Farrell hopeless off balance\n\nFinally another 90-degree jag catches Ben Youngs by surprise...\n\n...making it three defenders beaten in under two seconds\n\nIt is that sort of elusive, mazy running that prompted Hansen to describe McKenzie as \"a fly in a bottle\" last year.\n\nHe seems to have a sixth sense for where tacklers are coming from and how to use their momentum against them, particularly on greasy surfaces like a sodden Twickenham.\n\nMany people say rugby is about size and power nowadays, but he has the speed and skills to make an impression without either of those.\n\nIn a sport that is so often focused on winning the collision, it also takes a bravery, composure and nerve to sacrifice forward momentum for those lateral side-steps.\n\nHe showed a different skill-set for his try, piercing the England defence with raw speed and an eye for a gap rather than dazzling one-on-one footwork.\n\nWith the England defence stretched and perhaps wary of Beauden Barrett's pace, Henry Slade races off the line towards the All Blacks fly-half. However McKenzie spots that Ben Te'o has given him a couple of yards on the outside and runs a line tight to Barrett to exploit the space\n\nAs he takes the ball flat from Barrett, McKenzie is at full pelt into the gap between the outpaced Te'o and Owen Farrell's despairing cover back inside\n\nThe gap is little more than a metre as Farrell and Te'o close together but McKenzie's pace and perfectly picked line take him through it for the try\n\nNext weekend will be interesting for McKenzie.\n\nAt 5ft 10in tall, he is an obvious target for Ireland to try and exploit with their aerial game.\n\nI could see Ireland coach Joe Schmidt conjuring some pre-planned ploy that attempts to occupy Ben Smith elsewhere and isolate McKenzie under a high ball with either Robbie Henshaw (6ft 3in) or Jacob Stockdale (6ft 4in) for company.\n\nBut the All Blacks will be ready for that and have their contingencies in place.\n\nJeremy Guscott was speaking to BBC Sport's Mike Henson.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Ilkay Gundogan's decisive goal in Man City's 3-1 derby win over United was the result of a 44-pass move\n\n\"Oh my word, what a team goal!

His advice is simple: \"Always believe in yourself\", and \"dreams are always worth fighting for\".\n\nIt seems easy, right? Not quite; some Formula 1 observers may look at these as 'empty words' he posts on social media, but Hamilton's rhetoric has a profound effect on some of his fans with more complex lives. These words of wisdom provide a beacon of hope, and inspire some life-changing moments for people.\n\nCorina Talbot is the mother of Ryan Talbot - who is now 29 and has a rare progressive and life-limiting illness for which there is no cure, and usually results in death in teens and early twenties. She spoke to BBC Sport to share her son's story, and the influence Hamilton has on his life...\n\n\"Ryan was like any other child. He was born full term, walked and talked at the usual age. But at the age of three became unsteady on his feet, falling into things quickly picking up bruises,\" Corina said.\n\n\"Over the years, I wasn't sure what it was that he had, and on several occasions I was referred to a child neurologist who said it was all in my head, and I had to accept him the way he was. I never gave up, and eventually, when Ryan was 19 we saw a professor who sees undiagnosed and misdiagnosed people.\"\n\nAfter two years, and numerous tests, Ryan was diagnosed with ataxia telangiectasia. He's lost his ability to speak, and his speech is sometimes slurred, but Corina says he remains very clever, passing all his school exams.\n\nShe said: \"Unfortunately, there is no cure and no medication he can take. Every year is a blessing I have him.\"\n\nRyan got into Formula 1 after watching the races with his mum and, as he grew up, became interested in the engineering and strategy side.\n\nCorina continued: \"As for Lewis Hamilton, he's always been a fan. I think he became connected by being similar ages and it gives Ryan the strength to carry on, giving him something to focus on. Lewis is very passionate and open about his feelings; he's always posting that you can be something in life and keep fighting.\"\n\nRyan's dream was always to go to a Grand Prix, and his mother made that happen last year, surprising him with tickets to Silverstone. She said: \"I'm Ryan's full-time carer and it took me a year to save the money to go. He said it was the best weekend of his life.\n\n\"You never know what's going to happen in life. Ryan is doing well and keeps surprising his doctors at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge - which is the only place in the country treating people with this condition.\n\n\"At present there are around 80 adults in the UK with the condition.

It doesn't stop there; the 12-year-old knows perhaps everything there is to know about the sport.

He lives and breathes the sport; it's every emotion and every thought in his head at any given moment.\"\n\n\"Ellis idolises Hamilton so much that when he's doing well, all is good in Ellis' world. When he's not doing so well, Ellis will struggle and shut himself away until he's ready to come out.\"\n\nEllis can draw all the circuits from memory, and is full of what he calls 'fun facts' about F1. He can look at a picture of an F1 car and tell you the driver, car, track and year.\n\nAlley recalls a time when he was younger, when she awoke early on a Sunday morning to find him already up and watching a race on television at 05:00. She said: \"I couldn't believe it, I would usually have to wake him up.\n\n\"When asked to sum up Hamilton, his response is: 'Lewis has always been with me, forever. He is everything to me. I can't imagine my life without him or F1.'\"\n\nIf Ellis isn't talking about Formula 1, he's playing the Playstation game, as Hamilton of course. But Alley said: \"I find his passion for F1 an inspiration.\n\n\"It can make me anxious sometimes, as I want Lewis to win for Ellis's sake.

But just when a second goal looked inevitable, Motherwell levelled.\n\nRyan Bowman took the ball past Nikola Katic on the left, and cut the ball across to Main who had an easy tap in.\n\nBut then it all went wrong for the visitors. Andy Halliday's shot was blocked by McHugh inside the box, leading to a penalty and a second yellow card for the Motherwell defender. His manager Stephen Robinson reacted with fury on the touchline and was also sent packing by referee Craig Thomson for his protests.\n\nThomson ordered Tavernier to take the resulting spot-kick again, with the Rangers captain sticking the ball in the same right hand corner as Carson went the wrong way.\n\nSoon it was three. After Katic's header was saved, Morelos was given the freedom of the box to nod home from the corner.\n\nIn the second half it was one-way traffic towards the Motherwell goal. Ovie Ejaria's shot was saved, but shortly after from a similar position on the edge of the box Middleton got enough purchase behind his effort to send it past Carson.\n\nRyan Jack then laid off for Arfield, who easily picked his spot for number five as it became a question of how many Rangers would score.\n\nGrezda was allowed to waltz his way past a cluster of dispirited defenders in the box and finish as Rangers made it six, before the Albania winger headed in a seventh to complete the rout.\n\nMotherwell's Carl McHugh was shown a second yellow card for handball, with Rangers awarded a penalty", "Media playback is not supported on this device Livingston 0-0 Celtic: Should Dolly Menga have been sent off?\n\nLivingston striker Dolly Menga was \"very, very lucky to stay on the pitch\" against Celtic, according to Brendan Rodgers.\n\nMenga was involved in a first-half clash with Ryan Christie as the champions were held to a 0-0 draw.\n\n\"He should have been sent off,\" said Celtic manager Rodgers.\n\n\"In real time, I thought he gestured with his head towards Ryan and when I saw it after the game it was actually more aggressive than I thought.\"\n\nThe incident took place as Livingston were defending a corner kick.\n\n\"It's not a great action by the player, so I assume the referee hasn't seen it,\" added Rodgers.\n\nLivingston boss Gary Holt said he was unaware of the episode.\n\n\"No one on our staff has mentioned it,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"It's probably nothing.

My IQ isn't what it used to be since the chemo.

I have defied the odds because I'm here three years later.\"\n\n'Making milestones'\n\nDespite finding a tumour on the back of her head, Mrs Mchendry was determined to return to work.

I have to get people to take me everywhere, to take my kids places or to take me to hospital appointments.\"\n\nWhen she was first diagnosed with cancer, she applied for the the Disability Living Allowance (DLA). She had received these payments until September, when she was told she needed to switch to the PIP system.\n\nMrs Mchendry said that the benefits helped to pay for a car, oxygen therapy and health supplements.\n\nWhile she is determined to fight to secure the PIP payments, she said the biggest battle is giving her husband and two sons a normal life.\n\n\"I just keep setting myself milestones.

It's developed me as a person more than any other career would.\"\n\nIn 2017, she was in charge for the Women's FA Cup final, and despite having to warn her proud mother not to wear a T-shirt that said \"I'm the ref's mam\" in the Royal box, she said it was \"a dream come true\".\n\nBut she is in no doubt that becoming a full-time official would help her development. She has used most of her annual leave from her job on Uefa courses as she seeks to represent England at the 2021 Women's European Championship.\n\nStacey Pearson (right) was a midfielder for Yeovil Town before becoming a referee, and was only booked once\n\nCriticism hurts - but standards are improving\n\nThe FA says that since the women's game has turned professional, refereeing has lagged behind - but that it's an issue they are already addressing.\n\nJoanna Stimpson, the women's referee manager at the FA, is aiming to increase the numbers of officials from 1,500 to 3,000 by 2021.\n\nAnd the body is offering more support by appointing mentors and offering training camps at its St George's Park HQ, which provides fitness testing, psychological help and tips on the difference between managing male and female players.\n\nThe support is most welcome, if recent criticism of female refereeing by high-profile figures such as Neville and Bronze is anything to go by.\n\nBut Pearson believes standards are already improving and are better in England than in other parts of Europe.\n\nThat's because of the sheer volume of leagues, allowing English officials to build up considerable experience before progressing to the next level.\n\nWelch, who has been on Fifa's list of referees since 2015, adds: \"Phil [Neville] and some players have asked for full-time referees and I would welcome it, but I don't think it will eliminate mistakes. We are human beings.\n\n\"They are entitled to their opinions, but I just think that we are the easiest ones to blame. Some people come across and have a go at the ref as if we don't care.\n\n\"I give up 80% of my life to referee, so if I've got something wrong it will hurt me more than any player. I feel it for days, weeks, and even when you go back to the club and it's mentioned again. I don't think people understand that.\"\n\nPearson was assistant referee for the 2018 Women's FA Cup final between Chelsea and Arsenal\n\n'Are you the physio?'\n\nWelch says she is fortunate that she has never heard any derogatory comments about her gender in the nine years she has been refereeing.\n\nIn fact, male referee colleagues have told her they are jealous of the subtler treatment she gets in men's football.\n\n\"Whether that is right or wrong, I don't know,\" Welch says. \"But players get to a certain point with me and then they think, 'I can't step over the mark'. If it works in my favour then, fair enough.\"\n\nShe says the surprise of her turning up to referee at games has subsided. But lower down the leagues, problems still exist, according to Pearson.\n\nThe former Yeovil midfielder, who is also a PE teacher, is a level three referee and was an assistant at this year's Women's FA Cup final, but says she still gets a mixed reaction in men's football.\n\n\"When you turn up to games, club staff might ask, 'Are you the physio?'\" the 31-year-old tells BBC Sport. \"I don't hear a lot of the comments, but recently I caught something about being a woman and making decisions.\n\n\"Two seasons ago, I had to send off an assistant manager who said I should be in the kitchen doing the washing up, not refereeing a football match.\n\n\"I just thought, 'Really? In 2016, are those comments still happening?' I told him this game is not continuing until you leave the field. He didn't admit to it, and then his manager told him to go off so it took a bit longer than it should have.\"\n\nLevel seven referee Caitlin O'Grady, 16, has been refereeing for a year and says she is well respected by junior teams\n\nWhen junior games turn sour\n\nTeenager O'Grady has only been a level seven referee in Sheffield for a year after \"falling out\" with playing football, but has already had what she calls a \"horrible experience\".\n\nShe is also an assistant referee in the Women's Premier League, but it is the junior leagues that she loves most, where she can coach young girls and boys through a game.\n\nThat turned sour when she agreed to help out an under-sevens game as they were short of a referee, but she was left \"more upset than angry\" after one older man started hurling abuse her way.\n\n\"He said I had no right to be out on the pitch and I should have been at home,\" O'Grady says.\n\n\"The whole game had stopped and the seven-year-old boys were just listening to this man. His grandson, who was one of the players, was in tears.\n\n\"The teenage boys that I referee are very respectful and you don't get as much trouble - it's more from spectators and parents at younger games. But things are improving. We have a lot more support than referees did in previous years.\"\n\nPearson, who says being a former player helps her empathise with those on the pitch, adds: \"If you asked any female referee if they'd heard any sexist abuse in their career, they'd probably say yes.\n\n\"Two or three times I've come home and thought, why do I bother? But I've had many games where I've really enjoyed it and had positive feedback.\n\n\"Sometimes fans might say, 'Oh you're better than some of the male refs we've had'. Obviously, they don't mean to refer to my gender but it would better if they said, 'You're better than some of the other refs we've had'. We're not quite in that place yet.\"\n\nIn addition to refereeing junior games, Caitlin O'Grady also runs the line in the Northern Women\u2019s Premier League\n\n'It will be better for the next generation'\n\nO'Grady says she \"feels positive about the future\" and has already seen the female refereeing community that is building at St George's Park.\n\nThe camps offer a network where referees can come together to share their experiences and hear from more experienced officials such as Welch.\n\nPerhaps Welch can inspire the likes of O'Grady, who says her dream is to referee the FA Cup final.\n\nBut Welch says she is reluctant to be regarded as a pioneer. \"I get a little bit embarrassed and play it down,\" she says. \"But if I can inspire people and help get more females refs, I don't mind.\n\n\"I've been involved for nine years, and the support has been unbelievable, so for the next generation it will be only better.\"", "Cerrone (left) made his UFC debut in 2011, after World Extreme Cagefighting merged with the Ultimate Fighting Championship\n\nWelterweight Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone set a new record of 21 UFC wins as he beat Mike Perry in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe 35-year-old home town favourite forced Perry to tap out with an arm bar submission at the end of round one.\n\nThe victory sees him move past England's Michael Bisping, who has retired, and Canada's Georges St-Pierre, who both have 20 wins.\n\nHe now also holds the record for most finishes with 15, passing Brazilians Vitor Belfort and Anderson Silva.\n\nIn the night's main event, Yair 'El Pantera' Rodriguez of Mexico knocked out Korea's Chan Sung Jung with one second remaining in their featherweight battle.\n\nRodriguez, bent over, managed to catch 'The Korean Zombie' with a backwards elbow to the face, sending him to the canvas.", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nGlastonbury organiser, Emily Eavis, has hinted that a \"great British artist\" will headline at the 2019 festival.\n\nSpeaking at BBC Music Introducing Live she revealed that the Friday headliner \"hasn't had a stage like this before\".\n\nShe also confirmed that Fleetwood Mac won't be playing, but that they're on her wish list along with Kate Bush, Led Zeppelin and Tom Waits.\n\nEmily said: \"It's really easy to get lost in the noise of all that.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the balance between showcasing new artists and booking bigger established names she explained: \"We can't keep putting those huge acts on because there aren't many that we haven't had now.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Emily with her dad, Michael Eavis, who founded Glastonbury festival\n\nAs always, there's been plenty of speculation over who exactly will headline at Worthy Farm.\n\nThe festival took a gap year in 2018, giving the ground there time to recover from the 135,000 people who turn up for the event.\n\nEven though most of the acts haven't been announced when tickets are released, they always sell out in record time.\n\nWho will it be?\n\nStormzy's name has come up several times, with NME claiming to have confirmed it - along with either Childish Gambino or Liam Gallagher also taking a key slot on the Friday night.\n\nEmily, however, isn't giving anything away, saying there's \"nothing we can announce yet.\"\n\nBut she did talk about the kind of \"great,\" \"exciting\" artist that \"he\" is.\n\n\"We have got one of the artists that I'm most excited about in Britain right now,\" she said.\n\n\"This to me is going to be a moment.

In Argyll and Bute, that sum could cover your rent for a whole year.\n\n1. More rooms? Move city\n\nLet's say you lived in a three-person house-share in SW4, Brixton, London. According to Hometrack, you could expect to pay around \u00a3767 per month, along with your two flatmates.\n\nWith that money, you could comfortably rent a one-bedroom flat in Southend or Milton Keynes - both within commuting distance of the capital - all to yourself. In fact, you'd be able to rent a one-bedroom flat in 79% of British postcodes, including locations such as Bristol.\n\nIf you wanted a bit more space, you could get a two-bedroom home in 65% of Britain's postcodes for \u00a3767 or less. You could live in L1, in the heart of Liverpool, where rents for a two-bed property are around \u00a3751.\n\nFor the same rent or less, you could also get a three-bedroom property in Leeds (LS8) with money to spare. Or, if Leeds isn't for you, around 50% of all British postcode areas have an average price of \u00a3767 or lower for a three-bed.\n\nIf you're in particular need of space, for the same price as a room in a Brixton flat-share, you can rent an entire four-bed property to yourself in 410 postcode districts across the country - including in cities such as Birmingham, Newcastle and Swansea and Glasgow.\n\n2. Who's renting?\n\nPrivate renting has more than doubled over the past 20 years, and young people are by far the most likely age group to be renting.\n\nDuring the same period, home ownership among young adults has collapsed.\n\nIn 1995-96, some 65% of middle-income 25 to 34-year-olds owned a home. Twenty years on just 27% do, with the biggest drop in London and south-east England.\n\n3. Renters pay a premium for isolation\n\nRenting a one-bedroom flat in England costs \u00a3600, yet buddy up with someone, and your share drops to \u00a3325.\n\nFind two flatmates, and you can get away with paying just \u00a3250 for a room in a three-bed home - less than half the cost of a one-bed flat.\n\nThis will be no mystery to renters in cities such as London, where for many young people, flat-sharing is the only option.\n\nIn the capital, the average one-bed costs \u00a31,237, but a third of a three-bed property costs \u00a3582 on average, saving you more than \u00a3650 each month.\n\n4. Four regions are 'unaffordable'\n\nWorking out what proportion rent makes up of your salary is a good measure of how affordable it is. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your income on housing costs.\n\nWhile Londoners earn more than residents of other regions, the city's rental properties still make up a bigger chunk of residents' salaries than renters in other areas.\n\nFor example, renting just a one-bed flat in the capital eats up nearly half of the average salary.\n\n5. Cambridgeshire rents rising the most\n\nIt will come as no surprise to anyone that London's rental market is the priciest. But rents have actually risen by more elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe median rent for a one-bedroom flat in the East of England rose from \u00a3495 in 2012-13, to \u00a3650 in 2017-18, according to official figures. That's an increase of almost a third.\n\nIn particular, rents in Cambridgeshire rose by two-thirds in that period, from \u00a3450 to \u00a3750 a month. Other big increases were found in Barking and Dagenham, Bristol, and Greenwich, where prices rose 40% or more.\n\nWe don't have local authority data for the other nations, but we do know that across England, there were only eight local authorities where one-bed rents fell. Three were in the North West, four in the North East, and, perhaps surprisingly, Kensington and Chelsea in London.\n\n6. London has huge rent inequality\n\nEven within large cities, you might still find rents that are less eye-watering if you look in the right place.\n\nThe data reveals the importance of location in determining how high your rent is likely to be.\n\nThe cheapest corner of London's postcode area (SE2, in Greenwich) is more expensive than the priciest areas of most of the country's major cities. However, the number of areas with extremely expensive rents means that it still has the biggest price gap.\n\nTo rent a one-bed flat in three London postcodes - SW1X, W1J and EC2R - you'd need to fork out more than \u00a33,000 every month.\n\nBut there are still three London postcodes - SE2, SE28, SE9 - where you can rent a one-bed for less than \u00a31,000.\n\n7. What about shared ownership?\n\nShared ownership lets residents part-buy, part-rent a property. This means they'd pay a rent, service charge, and a mortgage on the bit they own (which usually ranges from 35% to 75%).\n\nThese costs add up, but not - as it turns out - more than renting.\n\nWe looked at the total costs of all the shared ownership listings within a five-mile radius of central London, and matched them up to the equivalent rent for that postcode.\n\nTwo-thirds of the shared ownership properties were actually cheaper than renting in that area.\n\nBut don't get excited that shared ownership is affordable in London - the average shared ownership home listed still takes up almost 70% of young Londoners' incomes.", "Oleksandr Usyk (right) beat Tony Bellew in the eighth round of their contest at the Manchester Arena\n\nTony Bellew said his boxing career was \"over\" but insisted he had surpassed his dreams and \"won in life\" during an emotional news conference following defeat by Oleksandr Usyk.\n\nBellew, 35, briefly said he felt a \"failure\" because of his eighth-round stoppage defeat against the undisputed cruiserweight world champion.\n\nWife Rachael instantly shouted from the back of the news conference that he \"hadn't failed at all\", while Bellew's father also yelled words of praise.\n\n\"It's definitely over, you'll not see me in a ring again,\" said a sobbing Bellew.\n\n\"Now I just want to be normal, so please leave me alone.\n\n\"No one who knows me calls me Tony, I've always been Anthony to them.

His dad shouted he was the \"best son\", adding: \"I'm proud of you lad.\"\n\nTrainer Dave Coldwell fought back tears when stating his fighter was part of \"the best five years\" of his life, while promoter Eddie Hearn pointed to moments where Bellew's career was on a knife-edge long before he realised his dream of becoming a world champion in 2016.\n\n\"Tonight, I watched a great fighter,\" said Hearn. \"Someone who has improved so much. He has gone from being not at world level as we saw when he fought Nathan Cleverly in 2014, to elite level. We are so proud of this man and what he has achieved.\"\n\n'No excuses - Usyk may be the best ever'\n\nIn his last three outings, Usyk has now beaten Latvia's Mairis Bredis in Riga, Russia's Murat Gassiev in Moscow and Britain's Bellew in Manchester, earning and defending the IBF, WBA, WBO and WBC titles in the process.\n\nHe was priced as short as 1-7 with some bookmakers. But Bellew's eye-catching start saw him lead on two of the three judges' scorecards when the stoppage arrived, prompting him to concede: \"I got tired for the first time in my career.\"\n\nHe insisted moments of showboating in the ring were designed to frustrate his opponent rather than influence the sold-out crowd, while Usyk later admitted he was working hard not to be drawn into \"fighting\" rather than \"boxing\" early in the contest.\n\nBellew added: \"No excuses, I won't make any. I lost to the best fighter I have ever faced. I am not weight drained. He was awkward, intelligent. He fell for my traps a few times. But ultimately he got me.\n\n\"He is potentially the greatest cruiserweight that's ever lived. For me it is always Evander Holyfield but Usyk's done what no other cruiserweight has ever done by having all four belts.\"\n\n'Boxing's changed in 11 years'\n\nUsyk's immediate reaction to his win was to state he needs time off to recover from his \"most difficult\" year in boxing.\n\nThe 31-year-old - who has four wins in 14 months - said it was \"too early\" to threaten moving up a division for a shot at unified world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua.\n\nBellew believes Joshua's extra size will prove too much for Usyk if the two London 2012 Olympic gold medal winners were to meet.\n\nBellew also outlined how both he and the sport had changed during his 11 years as a professional.\n\n\"When I was turning pro the excitement wasn't there, even for gold medallists,\" added Bellew.\n\n\"Now football stadiums are being sold out. Boxing in this country is at an all-time high.\n\n\"I was mouthy early on as I wanted to make money. No one wants to pay to see two men shake hands.

And, if so, where does he fit in?\n\nJonny Bairstow missed the first Test after injuring his ankle playing football earlier in the tour\n\nAs the ancient saying goes, \"Do not twist your ankle playing football, thus ruling yourself out of an impending Test match, for your replacement may become the first Test debutant in cricket history both to score a century and execute a stumping\" (Aristotle, On Cricket, 347 BC).\n\nAfter Ben Foakes took to Test cricket like a duck to a Chinese pancake, the Bairstow conundrum will be exercising the England selectors this weekend, once they have finished vigorously high-fiving themselves about their increasing catalogue of recent successes.\n\nLast winter, England's selectors were reduced to filling up England's XI by appearing to randomly conscript players from the general public, with the same system that is used to select people for jury service, with mixed results.\n\nThis winter, they face the challenge of squeezing their squad down, rather than up, to 11, and much of the focus has been on whether to reincorporate Bairstow and, if so, how.\n\nBairstow's recent wicket-keeping has been excellent. His statistics with the bat, however, have been adequate but unspectacular.\n\nHe has averaged 27 in his last 17 Tests, albeit having played a few notable and influential innings, particularly his crucial 70 in the series-shaping first Test against India last summer.\n\nOver the course of his career, when playing as wicketkeeper, Bairstow has generally been outstanding in the opening innings of Tests, before keeping wicket, (averaging 57, with all five of his Test hundreds), but has been considerably less productive in the second, third and fourth innings of the game, after he has spent time in the field with the gloves (averaging 32, and with only one half-century in his past 18 such innings).\n\nThe numerical evidence, therefore, seems to suggest that Bairstow bats best when he thinks he is about to keep wicket, and bats less well when he has already kept wicket.\n\nWhat England clearly need to do is convince Bairstow that he will keep wicket, but find an excuse not to allow him to do so, whilst promising that he will definitely take the gloves next time England bat, before repeating the process for the next eight to 10 years.\n\nThus they will have the dominant peak-Bairstow that any team would want in their line-up. The logistics of this statistical subterfuge will presumably be within the scope of England's vast army of backroom staff.\n\nCan England's spinners out-perform Sri Lanka's by a decisive margin again?\n\nMoeen Ali, left, combined with Jack Leach, centre, and Adil Rashid to take 16 wickets in the match\n\nIn Galle, England's batsmen had one of their finest performances against spin, and England's spinners one of their best matches against anyone.\n\nEngland's spinners took 16 for 328 in the match, at 20.5 runs per wicket - only the second time since 1975 that an English spin attack has taken 15 or more wickets in a Test. The other was the famous victory in Mumbai late in 2012, when Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar took 19 between them.\n\nSri Lanka's slow bowlers took 12 wickets in the match, but at a cost of 548 runs; their collective match average of 45.6 being the worst by a Sri Lankan spin attack in the 14 home Test matches they have played against England, and the second worst by a Sri Lankan spin attack in 39 home Tests against non-Asian opposition since May 2003.\n\nKeaton Jennings was especially impressive and now averages 70 against spin - and 18 against pace - in his 13-Test career.\n\nHis spin average is currently the sixth best of the 142 players who have faced 300 or more balls of tweakery in the last five years of Test cricket.\n\nEngland will hope the confidence of success will enable him to narrow the gulf between his performances against spin and pace.\n\nWhat can we expect in Pallekele?\n\nThe pitch in Galle did not deteriorate as had been widely expected, and previous matches at Pallekele suggest batsmen may thrive in the second innings again.\n\nJennings' century was England's fourth second-innings hundred in their past four Tests; they had only one in their previous 45 matches, a truly extraordinary communal performance of endurance honours-board avoidance, in which, between May 2015 and August 2018, they converted only one of 60 second-innings half-centuries into three figures.\n\nOf the 49 grounds to have hosted three or more Tests this decade, Pallekelle has the sixth highest collective batting average in the second innings of matches.\n\nIt has also been the most productive ground in Sri Lanka this decade for visiting pace bowlers, who average 26.9 with a wicket every 53 balls.\n\nOne thing England should be aware of is the danger of bowling Sri Lanka out in 34.2 overs on the first day.\n\nAustralia made this fatal error in 2016, only for Kusal Mendis - the brilliant if inconsistent young batsman - to play one of the finest innings of the century so far, making 176 in a match in which no-one else reached 60. Sri Lanka eventually won by 106 runs.\n\nWho should bat at number three for England?\n\nNobody has bettered Ken Barrington's average of 77 batting at number three for England since the Surrey right-hander retired in 1968\n\n*Niche stat alert*... Moeen Ali's eight wickets were the joint second most ever taken in a Test by a player who has batted at three in both innings.\n\nHowever, his match total of three runs was, in modern parlance, suboptimal (the second-lowest two-innings match aggregate by an England number three in a Test in Asia, marginally ahead of Keith Fletcher's haul of two runs in Delhi in 1972-73).\n\nEngland have now played 26 consecutive Test matches without a number three batsman making a century (Joe Root's 124 in Rajkot two years ago was the last).\n\nThis is the fourth longest number-three-hundred-free sequence in their Test history - 38 was the longest, from 1971 to 1974.\n\nThree has long been a problem position for England. In the 51 years since Ken Barrington, who averaged 77 at three, last batted in that position, England's threes have collectively averaged 35.9, the third worst figure of the 10 regular Test-playing teams, ahead of only Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.\n\nEven with home advantage, England's Test threes have been less productive than their opponents - averaging 37.6, compared to the 40.6 of all other teams' number threes in Tests in England.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nHere are some other stats for you to casually drop into conversation with passing strangers, on public transport, on disappointing dates, or in awkwardly slow journeys in a lift:\n\nThe Galle Test was only the fourth time England have scored 300 or more in both innings of a Test in Asia.\n\nIt was also only the second time since the 2004-05 winter that England have bowled out their opponents for 250 or fewer in both innings of a Test away from home (the other was in Durban, against South Africa, in the Boxing Day Test of 2015).\n\nTo find the last Test away from home in which an England wicketkeeper did not concede a single bye, you have to delve all the way back through the murky wastelands of history to\u2026 brace yourselves\u2026 the last Test England played away from home. Jonny Bairstow kept the byes column unsullied in Christchurch this year. Ben Foakes was the first England wicketkeeper not to allow a bye in a Test in Asia since his erstwhile Essex mentor James Foster, in the Mohali Test against India in December 2001 (a match which, coincidentally, was also Foster's Test debut).\n\nMoeen Ali took the same number of wickets in Galle - eight - as he had in his previous nine overseas Tests. Two years ago, after the second Test in India in which he took four wickets, Moeen had a marginally better bowling average overseas than at home (37.7 to 40.5). From then until the Galle Test, he had taken just eight wickets, average 130, in nine Tests away from home, whilst reaping a tidy home harvest of 42 wickets at 21.2 in nine home Tests.\n\nGot a question for Andy?\n\nGot a burning statistical question you'd like to have answered.

Perhaps its most radical spin-off though is a comic that has used wit and humanity to reach a new, diverse fan base.\n\nTransformers started out as a boy's toy. The robot characters, which could be quickly reconfigured into guns and cars - tapped into the young male zeitgeist of 1984.\n\nThose children have grown into today's adult collectors. But thanks to a cult comic, the franchise's male-dominated audience has crossed the gender divide.\n\nAt Europe's largest Transformers convention this year, TFNation, women accounted for almost half of attendees aged 21 to 31. It caps a three-year trend in which female attendance grew by a third. Taking the credit is the comic Lost Light.\n\nBut how can a humble comic trigger such a turnaround?\n\nImage copyright @CWingsyun / @jamesydraws, @raadst Image caption Writer James Roberts points to the \"redemption arc\" of Megatron - the original Transformers villain - as one of the comic's most political stories\n\nUnlike much other sci-fi media, Lost Light and the community which has grown around it, made women feel \"invited to share in this world\".\n\nSo says female fan Alex Cole, a freelance animator whose fan-made \"trailers\" for the comic have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube.\n\nCompared with the comic books of her childhood, in which regularly \"some sexist trope showed up to upset me and pull me out of the story\", Lost Light made \"a wider variety of people feel welcome,\" she says.\n\n\"It helps that the female characters are written the same way as others and being gay is basically the default.\"\n\nAlthough the comic came to an end last week, its influence is \"going to stay with people\" she says.\n\nImage copyright TFNation / Nick Hardy Image caption Writer James Roberts: \"I've been struck by the passion of fans, how sincere they are\"\n\nResponsible for much of this is the comic's author, James Roberts, who penned all 80-odd issues.\n\nAlthough the stories are infused with a British sci-fi humour - BBC TV comedy Red Dwarf was a major influence - his ambition for the publication, which tackled topics such as same-sex relationships, freedom and self-determination, was \"unashamedly political\".\n\n\"Misfits and also-rans, in an enclosed space with a pitch-able quest - it's a good way into a story,\" says Roberts. \"This is the difference between American and British sci-fi and comics, and TV shows like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the new Doctor Who - their love of language, puns, banter.\n\n\"You can get away with more swear words if they're British.\"\n\nImage copyright Jar Of Loose Screws, @CWingsyun Image caption As well as original characters, Autobots from 1984 such as Mirage and Hound are Lost Light crew members\n\nOne prominent fan agrees Roberts' work has encouraged \"people who would not normally attend Transformers conventions to make the trip\".\n\n\"It has made them more visible,\" says Transformers blogger and photographer Maziar Shahsafdari. \"The mature way in which representation, diversity, issues of mental health, politics, sexuality, gender and more were presented throughout the series really helped.\"\n\nBut political themes alone do not explain Lost Light's influential reach.\n\nSocial media has also provided a link between the fans and the comic's creators.\n\nRoberts, along with artists Alex Milne and Jack Lawrence, engage with their audience online. Every October, for a month, fans are encouraged to post their art of the Transformers characters, tagging them #LostLightFest.\n\nImage copyright @Adithehella Image caption Fans have been drawn to Roberts' belief in \"character-driven story\" which has seen as many robots go through painful loss as interstellar gags\n\nTransformers' cornering of a young female fan base chimes nicely with the values of today's #MeToo era. But that interpretation would miss the vision of those involved.\n\nLost Light emerged after its publisher, which ran the Transformers comic licence for toy giant Hasbro, decided to experiment. Its lifespan was initially judged to be no more 12 issues.\n\n\"I was keen to fill out the cast with relative unknowns,\" says Roberts, of the Transformers character set. \"It would give it a bit of tension, a mix of distinct personalities.\"\n\nImage copyright TFNation / Nick Hardy Image caption Without the fans, \"we'd have got to 12 issues and stopped\", says Roberts\n\nThe publisher wanted the comic \"to speak to Transformers fans and beyond,\" he says.\n\nRoberts was given the freedom to look beyond the A-list of characters. And with that came the opportunity to take more chances.\n\nAn initial positive reception emboldened Roberts, leading to his favourite moment - issue 16, the \"declaration of love\" between two same-sex Transformers characters, Chromedome and Rewind. It was \"a first\".\n\n\"In the nicest possible way, it became normalised. The world didn't come to an end.

Winston Churchill's speech, proclaiming the end of the war in Europe, was the signal for those who were not already rejoicing in anticipation of peace to begin their celebrations.\n\nBut in 1918 news of the the Armistice that ended World War One trickled down in a way which may seem slow to us but which was actually fast for the time, thanks to the new technology of wireless communications.\n\nIt was, of course, the age just before the dawn of broadcasting - the public followed the war through newspapers and queued up at the pictures to gain glimpses of the fighting in silent newsreels.\n\n'Joyful sound of victory'\n\nWireless, at this time, was not the archaic word for radio - it meant sending morse code messages over the airwaves instead of down a wire.\n\nNow a fascinating story has come to light about how news of the Armistice reached one of the most isolated parts of the British mainland - Campbeltown, near the Mull of Kintyre.\n\nA cutting from the local newspaper, the Campbeltown Courier, describes how the historic news was first delivered in a morse code message to shipping, with the crew of one vessel taking the message to the pierhead in Campbeltown Loch.\n\nImage copyright Mary and Angus Hogg Image caption News of the Armistice was picked up by a ship in Campbeltown Loch, before being taken to the mainland\n\nThe news, the paper said, arrived at about eleven o'clock - but it does not say whether this was before or after the official cessation of hostilities at precisely 11am on 11 November 1918.\n\nThe report in that week's paper read: \"A wireless message was the first medium through which the great news came and it was at once made known ashore, a copy of the telegram being sent to Mr Ross Wallace at the Steamboat Office.\n\n\"There was a rush for the pierhead where the welcome announcement - \"Armistice signed. Hostilities suspended\" - was displayed on the Weigh-house window after Mr A Ollar had read it to the assembled throng.\n\n\"Having got the authentic information the joyous crowd hurried away in all directions, spreading the joyful sound of Victory and approaching Peace as they went... The outlying districts quickly learned the heartening intelligence and there was general rejoicing.\"\n\nLess than 21 years later, of course, Britain was at war again.\n\nBy then radio broadcasting had become established and millions, from the centre of London to the most isolated parts of the Highlands, listened together in silence as Neville Chamberlain announced that \"this country is at war with Germany\".", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Events to remember the fallen took place across the country\n\nPeople across Scotland have observed a two-minute silence in an act of remembrance marking 100 years since the end of World War One.\n\nIt was one a series of commemorative events taking place on Armistice Day.\n\nBefore sunrise, pipers around the country played the traditional Scottish lament Battle's O'er.\n\nAnd large crowds gathered at ceremonies of remembrance in Glasgow and Edinburgh, where the first minister laid a wreath.\n\nAfter four years of bloody conflict, the war between the Allied forces and Germany finally ended in 1918.\n\nThe armistice signed in Compi\u00e8gne came into force on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.\n\nOf the 700,000 Scots who joined the forces, more than 100,000 died during World War One.\n\nImage caption The Princess Royal attended a commemoration service at Glasgow Cathedral with her husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence\n\nNearly every village, city and town in Scotland has some form of memorial displaying the names of their war dead.\n\nAcross the UK, the centenary was marked with gun salutes before the two-minute silence at 11:00.\n\nFollowing the period of quiet observation, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon laid a wreath at a ceremony at the Stone of Remembrance outside the city chambers in Edinburgh.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nicola Sturgeon observes Armistice Day silence in Edinburgh\n\nImage caption First minister Nicola Sturgeon and Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh were among those at the Edinburgh remembrance service.\n\nShe did so after 11 rounds were fired from Edinburgh Castle, with the guns then falling silent.\n\nMs Sturgeon joined fellow politicians and members of the armed forces for the ceremony before a service at St Giles Cathedral.\n\nFollowing the service, the city thanked all those who served with a procession and service of commemoration in the Old Town.\n\nElsewhere, the silence was observed at the cenotaph in Glasgow's George Square, as it was at war memorials in towns and villages across Scotland.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Piper Louise Marshall played Battle's O'er, the traditional Scottish lament played at the end of battle, at dawn\n\nImage caption Crowds gathered in Glasgow's George Square for the service of remembrance\n\nLord Provost Eva Bolander, in her role as Lord Lieutenant, led the proceedings in George Square, with a guard of honour provided by the 52nd Lowland, 6th Battalion of The Royal Regiment of Scotland.\n\nAfter laying her wreath, Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland: \"Remembrance Sunday is always a very poignant occasion.

There's a tendency to say, 'Oh, she's just a girl and she doesn't know what she's doing.'\"\n\nOn the contrary for this teenager, who released her first EP having just turned 15, with her first album following two years later.\n\nShe's now releasing more material - with a second album on the way - full of the lessons a life of touring, couch-surfing in London, and working in a charity shop has taught her.\n\n'I hate being a bag lady'\n\n\"The first album was more about how endearing and how exciting everything was and how I just LOVE London,\" recalls Marten, who hails from near Ripon in North Yorkshire.\n\n\"This one is a bit more frank, the songs are a lot simpler. It's more of an insular album,\" says the songwriter.\n\nThis perhaps reflects what she describes as the \"disruptive\" experience of staying in other people's houses - on spare beds and sofas - and never having a place of her own. \"Like a stray puppy,\" she adds.\n\n\"I hate being a bag lady - and I'm always that person. Carrying guitars and carrying bags. And it makes me quite anxious.\n\n\"So just to have one key and one bed to come to has been really good for me,\" she says, having recently rented her own place in east London.\n\nIt's significant, however, that when asked where she is happiest she says: \"Home.\" And then clarifies that she means with her parents in Yorkshire.\n\nImage copyright Katie Silvester Image caption \"My motto is: Nobody's looking at you,\" says Marten\n\nThe singer admits she suffers from seasonal affective disorder (SAD) - a type of depression that is often linked to shorter autumn and winter days. And says she is more affected by the condition living in the city.\n\n\"I hate when the snow goes black - that's a really horrible thing for me. I hate it. Winter in the city is so much worse for me. Winter in the countryside is slightly better.\n\n\"In the city everybody's still grafting and working, heads down, and there's no communal love,\" she says.\n\n\"When I go home we're all miserable but we're all in it together, whereas here you're left on your own a lot. The Tube sucks and it's always dark. It's harder.\"\n\nHer latest release, Blue Sea Red Sea, was written by Marten on a wintry day, after having just moved to London.\n\n'I was completely miserable'\n\nThe song, in Marten's signature lyrical, folksy style, sounds like someone trying to convince themselves - and everyone else - that they are perfectly fine, thank you very much: \"I'm a fish in a blue sea, and I like it/I don't, don't need you to love me,\" run the lyrics - set to an upbeat tempo.\n\nBut later lines -\"This snow is falling heavy/Wish my mother would come and get me\" - somewhat give away the lie.\n\n\"I was working in this pub and was completely miserable,\" the singer remembers. \"So I decided to sit and write the happiest, simplest pop song I could.\"\n\nMarten says music isn't always key to getting herself out of a dip though: \"I will turn to baking or something quite homely and sentimental for me. Or walking is a huge help. I'll just walk for two to three hours and get lost.\n\n\"Your attitude to everything changes - to other people. You get very bitter, very resentful of people's lives if they're not affected by it - which isn't a nice trait to have.\n\n\"Most mental illnesses do that. They isolate you - rather than make you want to accept other people's love or your own love.\"\n\nImage caption Billie played the BBC Introducing stage at Reading when she was just 15 years old\n\nSo rather than turn inwards, Marten has turned outwards. Few teenagers - and even fewer artists in the music industry volunteer once a week at a charity shop.\n\n\"I quit the pub because that was just ruining my life,\" she says. \"And that day I walked past Crisis in Finsbury Park. They've got a really good charity shop there and there was just this little sign in the window that said, 'We really need volunteers'.\"\n\nThe singer says the volunteer work there is \"fulfilling\" and it's clear she is inspired by what she finds at the shop - but also that she uses it as a therapy of sorts.\n\n\"I like the idea of walking into this communal haven. There's just this huge ethos of hard work and giving.\n\n\"Most of the volunteers have such busy lives. Some of the volunteers have three or four kids and they have to sort childcare just so they can do this for four hours a day. There isn't a bad soul in that building - it's brilliant.\"\n\n'Nobody's looking at you'\n\nPerhaps it's some of these experiences that have helped Marten come to terms with her youth.\n\n\"My youth?\" she asks. \"It's fading,\" she says with a laugh. \"I do feel a lot more tired than I should, that's for sure.\n\n\"I'm slowly learning to care less. I envy a lot of people who have no self-doubt or don't analyse anything.\n\n\"But my motto is: Nobody's looking at you,\" she says echoing the lyrics of her previous single, Bird. \"When I did my first gigs, my dad used to say that to me and said if no-one shows up, it's fine.\n\n\"It's a general sense of just do your thing. I say it to myself all the time: Nobody's looking at you and don't think too much about it.\n\n\"It works, I promise.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

On 1 July 1916, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment was all but wiped out by German fire as they moved over open ground to make an attack.\n\nBeamish has been experimenting with the medium for some time, and is aware of its use in surveillance and military links.\n\n\"I started in Solferino near Lake Garda in Italy, the site of a terrible one-day battle in 1859 with nearly 40,000 casualties. The horrors of Solferino, especially the total lack of care for the injured would lead to the foundation of the International Red Cross,\" says Beamish.\n\nIt also seemed a perfect fit to document the long-lost battlefields of World War One, and the traces of a conflict now 100 years on.\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Beamish Image caption The huge crater at Vimy Ridge was caused by a devastating British mine detonation beneath German bunker positions at 21:50 on 27 November 1916. The Battle of Arras began on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917 and saw four divisions of the Canadian Corps fighting side-by-side for the first time. They scored a huge tactical victory in the capture of Vimy Ridge.\n\n\"Though much has grown back in the countryside and farmland of the Western Front, in many places the terrain still bears the unmistakable scars, gouges and fissures of battle,\" says Beamish.\n\n\"I wanted to do some act of remembrance and however minor, some reconstitution or consideration of the devastating history. Like many others I have ancestors that died on the Western Front. How many of us have had the chilling experience of seeing our surnames on the Menin or Thiepval Monuments?\n\n\"And what of the disappeared people and villages and the still cratered landscape?\"\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Beamish Image caption Front-line and support trenches for both the British and German armies remained in and around Sanctuary Wood until 31 July 1917 when the British launched a full-scale offensive on the German lines, beginning the Battle of Passchendaele.\n\nBeamish felt that using infrared would perhaps reveal something usually unseen, or a different vision.\n\n\"Infrared photography allows a wide range of visual options especially with new digital technology. Visually it can seem ethereal and bring gravitas to an image, he says.\n\n\"The colour can seem other-worldly.\"\n\nHe used two processes to filter the images, one which emphasises reds and blues and a second which leaves skies blue but foliage bright and pale.\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Beamish Image caption On 22 August 1914, in this woodland in Rossignol, hundreds of men were buried where they'd fallen, directly after battle. On this day in the Battle of the Frontiers, French soldiers fought German forces on five separate battlefields. More than 27,000 French soldiers lost their lives, making it France's highest ever death toll in a single day.\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Beamish Image caption In February 1916, German troops captured Forts Douaumont and Vaux, the principal positions guarding the city of Verdun. The fort wasn't recaptured until October 1916. The Battle of Verdun would become the longest and bloodiest conflict of World War One, resulting in more than 700,000 casualties.\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Beamish Image caption The Battle of Belleau Wood was the first large-scale battle fought by American soldiers in the war, during the German Spring Offensive.

But there are still many untold stories about the Indian Army from the conflict - personal accounts that show how global the war was, and how extraordinary Indian experiences were.\n\nHistorian George Morton-Jack relates some of these stories.\n\nArsala Khan\n\nOf all the Indian troops who fought between 1914 and 1918 - there were four times as many as those from Australian, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and the Caribbean combined - Arsala Khan of the 57th Wilde's Rifles was the first to go into battle.\n\nHe led the troops of the first Indian company to enter the British trenches on the western front, in Belgium on the night of 22 October 1914.\n\nArsala Khan went on to serve until 1918, in France, Egypt, German East Africa and India. Then, in the summer of 1919, he represented his regiment in London at the official Indian victory parade.\n\nWith a thousand other Indian veterans, he marched past the city's greatest war monument, the Cenotaph, where many of them broke into tears.\n\nAmar Singh\n\nWorld War One's great Western writers - from Wilfred Owen and Winston Churchill to Siegfried Sassoon and many more - have long been among the most famous.\n\nBut there was one writer in the Indian Army who wrote something perhaps even more extraordinary: Captain Amar Singh penned what is possibly the world's longest diary.\n\nSpanning 89 volumes from the 1890s to the 1940s, Singh's incredible diary covers his experience of the war from India to the western front and Britain, and on to the Iraq front, with his troopship dodging German U-boats in the Mediterranean along the way.\n\nSingh finished the war back in India, where in 1917 his wife, Rasal, gave birth at their home in Rajasthan to their daughter Ratan.\n\nThe baby girl was their sixth child and the first to survive disease in infancy, giving them new hope for a happy post-war family life.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nKasturba Gandhi\n\nKasturba Gandhi was with her husband Mahatma Gandhi in England when World War One broke out.\n\nTogether they volunteered as auxiliary hospital workers among the Allied troops in western Europe.\n\nIn 1914-15, Kasturba Gandhi worked in Indian Army hospitals - on England's southern coast - set up for some 16,000 Indian soldiers who had been wounded in France and Belgium.\n\n\"Mrs Gandhi was particularly anxious to see that no Indian patient suffered or felt embarrassed on those delicate questions of caste distinctions,\" wrote Daya Ram Thapar, a fellow Indian medical volunteer at the hospitals.\n\n\"She undertook to look after the feeding of seriously ill orthodox patients and often used to clean their utensils if they objected to being fed by non-Hindus.\"\n\nAwal Nur\n\nAwal Nur (centre) belonged to the most famous Indian Army regiment of 1914-18, Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides.\n\nHe served in Belgium, France and East Africa from 1914 to 1917, and he was wounded three times. But his most extraordinary exploit was on His Majesty's secret service.\n\nNur was one of 16 Indian soldiers specially chosen to join British officers on a secret Indian Army mission into Soviet Central Asia in early 1918.\n\nOn the direct orders of London, the mission's goal was to stop Soviet resources in Central Asia from reaching the Germans by railway and the Caspian Sea.\n\nNur's adventures as a secret agent took him across the Himalayas on a yak, before he worked tirelessly with other officers to frustrate enemy plans and escape capture.\n\nMir Dast\n\nMir Dast was the older brother of Mir Mast, a deserter and German secret agent. Dast was more like his brother than meets the eye: he also deserted.\n\nHe sailed for France in 1914, four months after his brother. It's not known if they saw one another there. Yet it's unlikely as they served in different divisions, places and battles on the western front.\n\nIn April 1915, Dast won the Victoria Cross for his actions in Ypres under chemical attack. The Germans had released poisonous chlorine gas from trench cylinders in yellow-green clouds that rolled on the breeze over the attacking Indian troops.\n\n\"I inhaled the gas, say, for eight or ten seconds,\" Mir Dast estimated, \"It brought water from my eyes and nose.\" Yet he fought on, rescuing wounded comrades and carrying them back to the British trenches into the night.\n\nIn August 1915, the medal was pinned to Dast's chest by King George V in front of a special audience in a hospital in England.\n\nDast returned to India in early 1916 to recuperate from wounds inflicted by the gas as well as other battles. When he returned to duty with his regiment in 1917, he was a war hero celebrated in the Indian media.\n\nYet Dast decided to quit the British service that year. He did so by joining his brother on the roll of deserters, an inconvenient truth the British covered up.\n\nLegend, which views Dast as ultra-loyal and his brother, Mast, as disloyal, has it that Mast won the Iron Cross, the German honour for military service. But this is a myth - he, in fact, won a medal for diplomatic service, the German Order of the Red Eagle.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPratap Singh\n\nPratap Singh, an aristocratic officer of the Jodhpur Lancers, had an incomparable mix of energy, professionalism and charm.\n\nHe was 73 years old when he went to war in 1914, becoming the oldest soldier in the British trenches on the western front. But he was still young at heart.\n\nAn indefatigable socialite, Singh would take leave of his regiment in France to dine with the powerful and famous - the list included French President Raymond Poincar\u00e9, the French Army's Commander-in-Chief Joseph Joffre, King Albert I of Belgium and the British Royal family.\n\nSingh's two teenage sons, Hanut and Sagat, joined him in the trenches also as officers of the Jodhpur Lancers. He took them with him when the Lancers moved to the Middle East in 1918, and they served together in Egypt, Jordan and Palestine.\n\nSingh's performance was astounding in September 1918 in Palestine at the Battle of Megiddo - the Indian Army's crowning battlefield achievement against the Turks to confirm the Ottoman Empire's downfall.\n\nAged 74, he stayed in the saddle for 24 hours among charging horsemen on the offensive. Yet this feat proved too much even for him; he had to retire sick.\n\nBut within weeks Singh was back on his feet pleading to represent India at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\n\"Of all the soldier princes of India, I think I am the only soldier who has stuck to his post at the front throughout the war,\" he wrote to the King George V to make his case.\n\nThe British did not grant him his wish, leaving him to rue the punitive Treaty of Versailles imposed on Germany in 1919. \"Politically, it was a mistake,\" he wrote at the time. \"I am sure the Germans would not rest without taking revenge some day.\"\n\nThe Armistice 100 years on\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nLong read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline\n\nVideo: War footage brought alive in colour\n\nInteractive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?\n\nLiving history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended\n\nGeorge Morton-Jack is the author of The Indian Empire at War: From Jihad to Victory, the Untold Story of the Indian Army in the First World War (Hachette India).", "Image copyright Katherine Hough Image caption Katherine Hough suffers from hair loss, IBS, and joint pain\n\nFor years, Katherine Hough, 27, suffered from a series of mystifying symptoms.\n\n\"I had unexplained stomach pains. Then when I got to university I began to faint frequently, my hair was falling out, I had severe joint pains and was constantly tired. My Mum thought it was down to my hectic student lifestyle.\"\n\nA visit to her GP and two blood tests for iron levels revealed that she was suffering from genetic haemochromatosis or GH - a genetic condition which causes iron to overload in the body.\n\nMost of us think of iron as a strength-giver and worry more about iron deficiency. There is little awareness of the risks of iron overload, and confusingly some of the symptoms, like fatigue, can be the same.\n\nSays Katherine: \"I was very lucky to get a quick diagnosis. A lot of health professionals believe women do not show symptoms until much later in life, which can then lead to potential organ damage.\n\n\"In the last year, I have had about 30 hospital and health visits. Today I suffer from chronic fatigue, IBS, and joint pains in my knees, hands and elbows. The only treatment for this is venesection, where I have a pint of blood removed every few months.\n\n\"I do feel lucky that I was diagnosed young as it allows me to monitor my health. Some days I am in excruciating pain, other days I am fine. But there needs to be more awareness of this condition.\"\n\nWhat is genetic haemochromatosis?\n\nGH is a condition which leads to the accumulation of iron in the organs of the body\n\nIn the UK, it is thought that approximately 250,000 people are at risk of GH, although many are undiagnosed, and the risk is higher for men than women\n\nIt is caused by a faulty gene - Northern Europeans with Celtic origins, particularly of Irish backgrounds, are more likely to carry the gene\n\nSymptoms of GH include fatigue, joint disease, skin problems, and sexual health issues. Left untreated GH can cause serious illness such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.\n\nTreatment is relatively simple and consists of venesection (bloodletting). As the body makes more blood to replace that taken, it uses up the excess stored iron.\n\nSource: Haemochromatosis UK\n\n'The most common condition you've never heard of'\n\nA recent report by the charity Haemochromatosis UK (HUK) surveyed 2,000 people with the condition worldwide.\n\nIt found that 73% of patients suffered with psychological difficulties, 81% experienced fatigue and 87% experienced arthritis or joint pain.\n\nAlthough most were satisfied with their treatment by specialists, about a third highlighted that information and support from GPs was poor.\n\nThe report was launched at the House of Commons, where MPs, campaigners and patients gathered to help raise awareness of the condition.\n\nDr Edward Fitzsimons, consultant haematologist, University of Glasgow, said: \"Haemochromatosis is one of the most frequent genetic disorders found in North European populations.\n\n\"Yet it is a condition that all too easily escapes diagnosis.\n\n\"For every one patient diagnosed, there are some eight to 10 who are undiagnosed.\n\n\"It is without doubt the most common condition you have never heard of.\"\n\n'I felt like an old aching lady instead of a young teen'\n\nImage copyright Abigail Harvey Image caption Abigail Harvey, 19, is having treatment for haemochromatosis\n\nAbigail Harvey, 19, was diagnosed with haemochromatosis at just 15.\n\nUp to that point she had suffered from severe period pain cramps and joint pain as well as depression.

The 2020 US presidential campaign begins now. Former US Assistant Secretary of State PJ Crowley has some advice for contenders on how to plan an Iran strategy.\n\nIt may be good politics to campaign on Anything But Trump, which is precisely what Donald Trump did with Barack Obama, but it's the wrong policy approach, particularly regarding Iran.\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump called the Iran nuclear deal \"the worst ever.\"\n\nEven though key members of his national security team preferred to both remain in the deal and work to improve its terms, he withdrew the US from it anyway, in no small measure because it was Obama's signature foreign policy achievement.\n\nThis week the Trump administration fully implemented its back to the future strategy on Iran. Engagement is out. Political and economic isolation is back in. Comprehensive sanctions have been restored, focused significantly on the Iranian energy, banking, shipping and shipbuilding sectors.\n\nThe US objective is to deny Tehran the resources to carry out its unhelpful role across the Middle East, particularly in conflict countries such as Syria and Yemen, and force a renegotiation of the nuclear deal.\n\nIran, suggests Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, \"should abandon its current revolutionary course\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US vows 'unprecedented pressure on Iran'\n\nSanctions haven't achieved that over the past four decades. They are unlikely to do so this time either.\n\nEuropean governments, supported by China and Russia, may attempt to cushion the impact of sanctions, although enthusiasm for that course has been dampened by news of an Iranian assassination plot in Denmark.\n\nBut Trump has read the private sector correctly. International corporations have already broadly retreated. Given the stark choice that the Trump administration presents \u2014 do business in Iran or do business in America - that retreat surely will continue.\n\nStrangely, Trump already claims that Iran is a different country. It isn't. The wars in Syria and Yemen grind on - Iran can make a reasonable case it is winning both of them.\n\nDespite the US withdrawal, Iran continues to respect the terms of the nuclear deal, thanks in large part to effective diplomacy by European leaders.\n\nEven if there is no discernible change in Iran's foreign policy, will Trump's revised strategy produce a better nuclear deal? It's unlikely during Trump's tenure.\n\nThe president craves \"wins\". Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei won't give him one.\n\nWhy Iran won't bend - yet\n\nRemember 1980. The hostage crisis over 444 days defined the presidency of Jimmy Carter and certainly contributed to his election defeat.\n\nIran delayed the release of 52 diplomats and citizens until Ronald Reagan assumed office.\n\nIn 2010, the Obama administration instituted a new round of sanctions against Iran in the aftermath of the so-called Green Revolution. It did create a diplomatic opening but it still took months to arrange secret talks, and years to reach an agreement.\n\nBarack Obama stressed in public that he was prepared to engage Iran on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect.\n\nWhile Donald Trump has taken a similar approach in his dealings with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, his rhetoric towards Iran has been much sharper.\n\nWhile sanctions will take a bite out of the Iranian economy and curtail its ability to sell oil, Tehran will wait out Trump and see what happens in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA number of potential Trump opponents - Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey - sit on congressional committees that oversee aspects of the Trump Iran strategy.\n\nThat list of presidential candidates is certain to grow. So where should Democrats position themselves?\n\nFor starters, recognise the American foreign policy that is, not the one they would construct in the abstract.\n\nCandidates should pledge to realistically engage America's adversaries \u2014 Russia without Trump's blind spots, North Korea without Trump's infatuation, and Iran without Trump's divisiveness.\n\nDemocrats can criticise Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and the strains it created in relations with America's key allies, although notably not Israel.\n\nBut simply returning to the existing Iran deal is a political non-starter.\n\nThere's politics in Iran, too\n\nThe conservative critique of the nuclear accord, that it was a bad deal because it didn't solve every problem the international community has with Iran, is flawed, but it remains politically potent.\n\nCritics who want nothing short of regime change would claim yet again that removing sanctions provided the failing clerical regime with a political and economic lifeline.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iranians are already feeling the effects of the sanctions\n\nIt's not true, but facts are under assault in this age of Trump.\n\nBut even though Trump has taken the wrong approach for the wrong reasons, Democratic candidates should not ignore the leverage his strategy has created.\n\nPolitics in America is only part of the equation. Politics in Iran matters as well.\n\nThere will be a new president in Iran in 2021. After three years of renewed sanctions, Tehran will be anxious to create new economic possibilities for its restive population.\n\nNot unlike American political sentiment, Iranians want their government to focus more attention on problems at home, not abroad.\n\nThus, there should be potential incentives for Tehran to re-engage someone not named Trump.\n\nThis could put the next president in a good position to renegotiate a more comprehensive agreement that extends the terms of the existing nuclear agreement and addresses a broader set of issues, including Iran's missile capability.\n\nAlthough the politics surrounding Iran is complicated on all sides, a strategy that avoids a complete reinvention and starts where Trump ends should gain traction at home and abroad.\n\nThe bottom line: A better deal is possible, but only a new president can deliver it.\n\nPJ Crowley is a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and author of Red Line: American Foreign Policy in a Time of Fractured Politics and Failing States.", "Image caption Kholofelo Moholola is juggling motherhood and her school studies\n\nRecently released figures showed that a shocking 6% of female students got pregnant in a single year at a school in South Africa's Limpopo province.

I'm convinced fracking will be a good thing.\"\n\nIn 2016 Mr Wensley took his own action when the actor Emma Thompson joined a Greenpeace anti-fracking demonstration on his land.\n\nEncouraged by his wife, he drove his tractor in circles around the double Oscar winner and Love Actually star, literally spraying her with manure.\n\nImage caption Farmer Allan Wensley sprayed protesters including Emma Thompson with manure when they went on his land\n\nImage caption Emma Thompson said Mr Wensley sent her a \"very powerful message\" after he sprayed her with manure\n\nThe protests have continued, but Mr Wensley believes people in the area are split 50-50 over fracking.\n\n\"It will supply lots of jobs in the area and I believe it will bring a cleaner, green energy for the country,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people here want it to supply jobs and money for the area.\"\n\nThe roots of Geza Tarjanyi's determined opposition to fracking lie in the 2.3 quake that hit the Blackpool area in 2011, and which a report later said was probably caused by exploratory fracking in the area.\n\nThe next day the children's entertainer found a 2ft crack in his wall and damage to his roof.\n\nIt was a turning point and he started a long protest campaign which has resulted in many court appearances, a hunger strike and a 15-day walk to Downing Street.\n\nHe even changed his surname to Frackman by deed poll and is now a full-time campaigner.\n\n\"Fracking is just not safe and most local people are against,\" he insists.\n\n\"The opposition to this has cost me everything but it's worth it.\n\n\"I've had serious threats of violence - people threatening to break my legs - but I'll carry on.\"\n\nImage caption Rodney Knight with his dogs Ghost and Simba, which guard his home and business\n\nRodney Knight runs a kennels just yards from the drilling site on Preston New Road - and the semi-permanent protest camp outside.\n\n\"I didn't want fracking here - I don't think anyone around here does,\" he said.\n\n\"But I believe that if it does take off then it will be good for the area, providing jobs and bringing money.\n\n\"I hope what they say is true and it will provide a source of energy that is green and good for the environment - this country certainly needs that.\"\n\nHe says his business has been adversely affected by the campaigners and calls the protest camp a \"disgrace\".\n\nA \u00a32,000 payment given to him out of Cuadrilla's community fund has been spent on security cameras and a gate after he says he found protesters intruding on his property.\n\n\"It's not the local protesters that I object to but the professional ones who just wander round the country and then move on,\" he added.\n\nCuadrilla has donated \u00a3100,000 to local projects and given another \u00a3100,000 to the community, which voted to share it among those affected.

It's located a couple of miles from its 17th-Century mother church, St Mary's, the oldest Anglican church not only in Chennai but anywhere east of Suez.\n\nThere is a poetic aspect to Nicolson's overgrown burial spot.\n\nHer poems - once hugely popular - are now almost as forgotten as her resting place. She belongs to another era - that last generation of the British in India whose confidence in Empire was unsullied, before war and the rise of nationalism heralded a slow, reluctant retreat.\n\nNicolson, whose formal name was Adela Florence Nicolson, shares the grave with her husband, Malcolm Nicolson, a retired general in the British Indian army.\n\nThey died in Madras within weeks of each other in 1904. They were both gifted linguists with a deep affinity for India, and Nicolson offered in her writing a startlingly unorthodox view of Britain's prize imperial possession.\n\nShe wrote of love, longing, suffering and death, and above all of India - of Punjab and the North West Frontier in particular.\n\nImage caption Nicolson and her husband are buried in a graveyard in Chennai\n\nShe at first made out that her poems were translations of Sufi-style poetry - and she published under a man's name, Laurence Hope. But they were all her own work. Her books sold impressively and, while she was never fashionable among the literary elite, the novelist Thomas Hardy was among those who expressed appreciation of her writing.\n\nSome verses of hers, set to music, became massively popular - and kept her name and work alive into the 1930s. One of these began: 'Pale hands I loved, Beside the Shalimar'. I remember my father singing those lines to no one in particular when I was a young boy. It includes a striking couplet addressed to those 'pale hands':\n\nI would rather have felt you round my throat\n\nCrushing out life; than waving me farewell!\n\nThe poem is called \"Kashmiri song\" - \"pale\" is a reference to the fact that Kashmiris are often described as fair-skinned. There is an ambiguity, perhaps deliberate, about the gender and racial identity of narrator and lover.\n\nSome of her poems are deeply transgressive: addressing not just gender and race, but betrayal, harm and the erotic, in ways which we rarely associate with that apparently strait-laced Edwardian era. Whether this was fantasy, exotic fable, or based in part on experience, we just don't know.\n\nThe story of Nicolson's death is both tragic and deeply disturbing. Her husband was much older. He needed a prostate operation, but it went wrong and the hospital had run out of oxygen.\n\nA few weeks later, his 39-year-old widow - with a four year-old son in the care of relatives in England - took her own life.\n\nImage caption This was one of Nicolson's most popular poems\n\nGossip travels fast, and the word went out that this poet, so knowledgeable about Indian customs and lore, had committed sati - an ancient, and long-outlawed, Hindu custom of a wife taking her own life when her husband dies.\n\nNicolson's poems gained in popularity after her death, and were published in many editions - from cheap, slim collections to deluxe, embossed volumes with elaborate illustrations. The sombre, reflective tone of her writing seems to have struck a chord in 1920s Britain as the country sought to come to terms with the trauma of World War One.\n\nHer sister, Annie Sophie Cory, was also a writer - using the pen name Victoria Cross, she wrote racy novels. Her most popular, Anna Lombard - published in 1901 - is said to have sold six million copies.\n\nSet in India, it's about a genteel young English woman who takes her Indian servant as her lover and won't give him up even when she gets engaged to an eligible English colonial administrator. Her lover dies, but she discovers she is expecting his child. She marries her English fianc\u00e9 and they move away; when the baby is born, she realises that her husband can never abide this living reminder of her Indian lover. So\u2026 she suffocates the child.\n\nImage caption Nicolson was just 39 years old when she took her own life\n\nIt's fiction, of course. But this sensational storyline does make you pause. The novel violates so much of what is expected of a refined English woman in India at the time.\n\nYou wonder whose anxieties are being expressed in this tangled plot - and what its emphatic commercial success says about its readership: that they liked to be shocked and appalled or, in some vicarious manner, wanted to share in the thrill, and agony, of a woman who breaks the rules.\n\nThe writings of both sisters challenge some of the conventional assumptions about Empire - about the attitudes and experiences of those Britons who made their lives in India. Colonial graveyards such as St Mary's are often among the most potent epitaphs of an enterprise which by-and-large history does not judge kindly.

Why did the news send many Americans into a tizzy?\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Justice Ginsburg fell in her office at the US Supreme Court and went to the hospital, where doctors discovered she had fractured three ribs. The reaction from the liberal corners of social media was an instantaneous mixture of well-wishes and barely-suppressed horror.\n\n\"#RuthBaderGinsburg DON'T YOU DARE DIE WE NEED YOU!\" wrote one.\n\n\"I hereby donate all of my ribs and organs to Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\" wrote Lauren Duca, a columnist for Teen Vogue.\n\nThat evening, late night television host Jimmy Kimmel introduced the \"Ruth Bader Gins-bubble\" on his programme, saying the 85-year-old needed to be \"protected at all costs\" as a Ginsburg stand-in rolled on stage encased in a gigantic plastic bubble.\n\nAlthough Ginsburg returned home on Friday, anxiety surrounding the health of the oldest sitting justice will surely continue. If Ginsburg were to retire or become too ill to serve, President Donald Trump would be able to cement the court's conservative majority with the appointment of his third justice, after Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBeyond that, the outpouring of concern can be credited to the fact that for liberals, Ginsburg has become a bona fide icon. She's the subject of a new biopic On the Basis of Sex, a documentary, and a bestselling book called Notorious RBG, which re-introduced her to a generation of millennial women. It's now possible to purchase T-shirts and coffee mugs with her likeness on them.\n\nOn Halloween, scores of miniature Ginsburgs waving tiny gavels filled social media:\n\n\"I think people of all ages are excited to see a woman in public life who has shown that, even at the age of 85, she can be unflinching in her commitment to equality and justice,\" says Irin Carmon, one of the co-authors of Notorious RBG. \"We don't have enough figures like her.\"\n\nFamous for her diminutive stature, serious demeanour and long pauses - she is said to have no tolerance for small talk - how did Ruth Bader Ginsburg go from celebrated legal scholar to full-blown celebrity?\n\nA pay cut for being pregnant\n\nJoan Ruth Bader was born in the Flatbush neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York, in 1933, the daughter of Jewish immigrants. Joan Ruth's mother died of cancer when her daughter was just 17.\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell University in 1954, she married Marty Ginsburg and not long after, the couple had their first child. While Ginsburg was pregnant, she was demoted at her job at a social security office - discrimination against pregnant women was still legal in the 1950s. The experience led her to conceal her second pregnancy years later.\n\nImage copyright Bettmann Image caption Ginsburg in 1977\n\nIn 1956, she became one of nine women to enrol at Harvard Law School, where the dean famously compelled his female students to tell him how they could justify taking the spot of a man in his school. She later transferred to Columbia Law School in New York, and became the first woman to work at both schools' law reviews.\n\nDespite that, Ginsburg struggled to find work, even though she'd been at the top of her class.\n\n\"Not a law firm in the entire city of New York would employ me,\" she once said. \"I struck out on three grounds: I was Jewish, a woman and a mother.\"\n\nPlaying 'kindergarten teacher' to all-male justices\n\nShe became a professor at Rutgers Law School in 1963, where she taught some of the first women and law classes, and co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1973, she became the ACLU's general counsel, which kicked off a prolific era of arguing gender discrimination cases, six of which brought her before the US Supreme Court.\n\nShe argued on behalf of a female Air Force lieutenant who was denied a housing benefit for her husband that her male colleagues received for their wives. She also took men's cases. In 1975, she argued the case of a young widower who was denied benefits after his wife died in childbirth.\n\n\"His case was a the perfect example of how gender-based discrimination hurts everyone,\" Ginsburg said years later, at her confirmation hearing.\n\nShe won five out of the six cases she argued before the Supreme Court, a time when she says she felt she had to explain gender discrimination to the all-male justices like \"a kindergarten teacher\".\n\nIt was also during this time that she argued on behalf of a female Air Force captain who'd become pregnant, and was being told to abort the baby or lose her job. Ginsburg hoped that the case would make reproductive autonomy a constitutionally-protected right, but instead, the Air Force changed its policy and the case was dismissed.\n\nThe next year, Roe v Wade decided the question of abortion, and Ginsburg fretted that since the decision hinged on right to privacy instead of equal protection, it was open to legal attack.\n\n\"The Court ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action,\" she said in a 1984 lecture.\n\nThe second woman on Supreme Court\n\nIn 1980, as a part of President Jimmy Carter's efforts to diversify the nation's federal courts, Ginsburg was nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. She gained a reputation as a centrist, voting with conservatives many times and against, for example, hearing the discrimination case of a sailor who said he'd been discharged from the Navy for being gay.\n\nImage copyright Mark Reinstein Image caption Justice Ginsburg is sworn in, with her husband Martin holding the bible\n\nPresident Bill Clinton nominated her to the Supreme Court in 1993, after a protracted search process in which some feminist groups, according to the New Yorker, spoke privately against her over her past remarks on Roe. But Clinton eventually made up his mind, making Ginsburg the second woman ever nominated to the US Supreme Court.\n\n\"It was her interview that did it,\" Clinton says in the 2018 documentary, RBG. \"Literally within 15 minutes, I decided I was gonna name her.\"\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing, Ginsburg proclaimed staunch pro-choice views.\n\n\"It is essential to woman's equality with man that she be the decision maker,\" she said in the hearing before Congress. \"If you impose restraints that impede her choice, you are disadvantaging her because of her sex.\"\n\nThe fiery dissenter\n\nOne of her most important, early cases on the Supreme Court was United States v Virginia, which struck down the men-only admission policy at Virginia Military Institute. Writing for the majority, Ginsburg said that no law or policy should deny women \"full citizenship stature - equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities\".\n\n\"It really was the last step in her own trajectory as a lawyer in trying to get the Supreme Court to recognise that gender classifications are a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,\" says Paul Schiff Berman, professor of law at George Washington University and one of Ginsburg's law clerks in the late '90s.\n\nImage copyright SOPA Images\n\nOver the decades, as the court has become more conservative, Ginsburg has increasingly moved to the left, and is now famous for her fiery dissents.\n\nIn the case of Shelby County v Holder, the court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a 5-to-4 vote, eliminating federal preclearance for changes to local voting laws - a provision intended to prevent voter suppression.\n\nIn response to the majority's assertion that America had changed so much for the better that the preclearance was no longer needed, Ginsburg wrote in her dissent that this was \"like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet\".\n\nFrom justice to icon\n\nIn part thanks to her unsparing dissents, a young law student named Shana Knizhnik created a Tumblr account dedicated to Ginsburg called Notorious RBG - a reference to the late rapper The Notorious BIG. The account reintroduced Ginsburg to a new generation of young feminists, and became so popular that Knizhnik and her co-author Carmon turned the blog into a book of the same name, which became a bestseller.\n\nNotorious RBG helped propel Ginsburg into pop culture stardom. Actress Kate McKinnon began playing Ginsburg on Saturday Night Live. The justice herself is said to distribute T-shirts with her own likeness on them.\n\n\"I think that it's actually something that Justice Ginsburg has really enjoyed in these last few years,\" says Berman, her former clerk. \"For her to feel as if her legacy can inspire a new generation of young women in particular, I think, is very exciting to her.\"\n\nAs a part of her new pop culture relevance, all aspects of Ginsburg's life have become the subject of internet fascination - her workout routine, for example, has been attempted by comedian Stephen Colbert. She's been lauded as a fashion icon, from her penchant for lace gloves to her elaborate jabots, the collars she wears over her robes. Her famous \"dissent collar\" has been reproduced in miniature for necklaces.\n\nImage caption One of many RBG novelty items for sale\n\nHer marriage to husband Marty is central to the new biopic, On the Basis of Sex. Marty Ginsburg died in 2010 - during the course of their 56-year marriage, he became his wife's greatest advocate, happy to play second fiddle to his famous partner.\n\n\"Meeting Marty was by far the most fortunate thing that ever happened to me,\" Ginsburg says in the documentary RBG.\n\nGinsburg is a famously stoic woman, but she adores the opera, a passion she shared with the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who despite being her ideological opposite was a close friend before he died in 2016.\n\n\"I get totally carried away,\" she says of opera in the documentary. \"It's like an electric current going through me.\"\n\nBut the justice is not immune from criticism - or from error. During the 2016 election, she called then-candidate Donald Trump a \"faker\", and said she could not imagine a world with him as president.\n\n\"He says whatever comes into his head at the moment.

If you're searching for natural gold in England it's unlikely you'll cover your costs, let alone make your fortune.\n\nAlthough some lucky metal detectorists have struck it rich by digging up buried treasure in England, gold nuggets and tiny fragments of the metal found in the UK tend to be in Scotland and Wales.\n\nIn fact, experts say that English gold is among the rarest in the world. But there is a dedicated band of enthusiasts who grab their sieves and spend their weekends sifting through chilly streams in England, hoping to unearth a few tiny elusive grains or minute shiny flakes.\n\nImage copyright Punch Image caption A Punch cartoon from 1852 tempts Englishmen to Australia with depictions of gold\n\nTo have any chance of finding natural gold in England you have to go west.\n\nYoung rocks, such as chalk, crag, clay, mudstone and the sand and gravel \"glacial drift\" washed out from under the Scandinavian ice sheet, cover much of the east and south. But in Devon, Cornwall and the Lake District the rocks are much older and more likely to have the quartz and calcite veins from which grains of gold could be eroded.\n\nThere are also reports of gold being found in the iron-rich rocks around the Forest of Dean and along the mineral-rich Pennines.\n\nVincent Thurkettle, a former president of the World Goldpanning Association, full-time gold prospector and finder of Britain's biggest ever nugget, equates it with a love of being out in the countryside.\n\n\"There are a hundred good reasons to take up gold panning as a hobby, but to get rich is not one of them,\" according to Mr Thurkettle, who says he had \"the most extraordinary piece of good luck while studying woodland management and forestry in the Lake District\".\n\n\"I developed a passion for rocks and minerals and would spend much of my free time out in the Cumbrian Fells hunting for them around old mines.\n\n\"While looking for specimens at a mine near Penrith, I met another collector who turned out to also prospect for gold. It was a life-changing moment; I became fascinated by the thrill of gold hunting and have never looked back.\n\n\"I have always treated gold prospecting as a family outing; it has always pleased me to see them really excited at every piece, even the tiniest speck shining like a minute star in the gold pan.\"\n\nImage copyright Universal History Archive Image caption The Latrobe nugget is the largest cluster of cubic gold crystals currently known and was found in Australia in 1853\n\nMr Thurkettle points out that deposits are likely to be on a granular level: \"Nuggets, by which I mean any piece of gold you can pick up easily, are seriously rare.\n\n\"In 1808 a beautiful piece, said to be like a lady's finger, was found in the Carnon Valley and is now in the Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro.\n\n\"Although it's now trusted as a genuine local find there was once some question over this nugget's provenance. 'Is it really local, or was it seeded [placed deliberately] by a miner seeking to improve the value of his claim?'\n\n\"More recently another splendid gold nugget was found on the beach at Westward Ho! by a metal detectorist.\"\n\nEven though Mr Thurkettle has found enough gold samples to make into wedding rings for his friends and family, as well as giving some to museums, he says the attraction of his hobby is that it's like \"being on a treasure hunt with nature\",\n\n\"Patience is needed to both find the gold and to deal with it. I am still waiting for the authorities to decide what will happen to a huge lump of gold I found on a shipwreck six years ago.\"\n\nAdmittedly, for most people it's a treasure hunt without a financial jackpot but Mr Thurkettle believes that does not matter.\n\n\"I know it sounds a bit cheesy, but I value the memories far more than the gold.\n\n\"Thinking back to time spent by the river with giggling, splashing, laughing children - or with dear friends, now dead - my hours with them cannot be repeated.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Men wearing sandwich boards on the streets of London in 1932 tout for gold, its value boosted by a high exchange rate\n\nThe UK's biggest gold finds\n\nMr Thurkettle found the biggest and most valuable nugget in the UK off the coast of Anglesey.

This is called \"salting\" or \"seeding\".\n\n\"There's something special about striking gold,\" he says. \"Even when we found out the deposit had been salted, there was a real thrill in seeing that sparkle.\n\n\"That's why we keep going - it's not about what we hope to find in the future, it's about being in the moment and being satisfied with just a glimpse.\"\n\nHow to pan for gold\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nResearch where to go\n\nThe Lake District: Mungrisdale, Dunmail Raise and Blencathra Mountain are reputed to be good spots and traces have also been found in Troutbeck and Sedbergh.\n\nThe Northern Pennines: A wealth of minerals, including gold, has been found here.

Apparently there is still gold in the ground to be found.\n\nYou must have the landowner's permission and avoid sites with an environmental designation.\n\nLearn how to use a gold pan accurately\n\nGold has a high specific gravity. That means it's denser and therefore heavier than lots of other sediment. In running water, gold will sink and stay put, while other objects float or roll along downstream.\n\nTo get the heavy gold particles to settle to the bottom of the pan, vigorously shake the sediment-water mixture.\n\nKeep reducing the amount of sediment in the pan by gently washing off the top layer of material.\n\nIt might be useful to sign up for a gold-panning course and join the British Gold Panning Association.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A prospector pans for gold in northern California in about 1890\n\nMr Jones's six-year-old daughter Elinor has also picked up the gold bug - and to encourage her, he has joined an increasing number of people buying \"pay dirt\".\n\nThis is waste soil from mineral-rich places like Alaska that is likely to contain ore, although it is also available from places closer to home, such as Scotland or the northern Pennines.\n\nIt can be bought seeded, which means the seller has added gold to the pay dirt to guarantee there is some in it - and therefore charges more.\n\n\"I am aware I could be teaching my daughter the wrong lesson about enjoying the journey rather than the destination - but hey - she's a kid. I want her to keep the enthusiasm.\n\n\"We went to a place in Cornwall [Cornwall Gold] and she loved panning.\"\n\nOne of the benefits of using pay dirt is that people don't have to travel long distances to pan in rivers - but negatives can include unscrupulous vendors.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The International Gold Panning Championships are held annually\n\nOne seller of pay dirt, who goes by the name of Harley Davidson, says there are a lot of scammers and even the honest agents are making a good profit.\n\n\"The gold in pay dirt is placer. There are two types of gold - placer and lode. Lodes are the veins of ore that need to be blasted or mined. Placer happens when a lode deposit is eroded by weather and the heavier minerals - including gold - are transported down a stream.\n\n\"Now placer is impure and you'll never get full spot [bullion] price if you try to sell it. Gold pay dirt bags are priced to make the seller about 10-20% on the price of a bag. When you're starting out, pay dirt might be good for practice. Just to understand what gold does in the pan.\n\n\"You seldom get what you pay for and you never get what you ain't paid for. You won't get rich - they do. You buy it for the enjoyment of finding the gold yourself and you will always pay more than spot price.\n\n\"Beyond that, you'd be better off taking a road trip to help with the fever.\"", "Video\n\nThe role of women in the Catholic Church is being reassessed after a Synod held in October launched new proposals for churches and diocese across the world.\n\nBut women weren't allowed to vote in this Synod, and some are now not just asking for votes \u2013 they\u2019re asking for shared ministry, or women\u2019s ordination.\n\nYou can find out more about the issues young Catholics are currently debating in the World Service's Heart and Soul programme.\n\nProducer: Sophia Smith Galer", "Image copyright Linda Withey Image caption The eight brothers were aged from 43 to 20 when they enlisted\n\nThousands of soldiers fought and died alongside family members in World War One, but Thomas and Eliza Everton watched as all eight of their sons went off to battle.\n\nOnly one of the couple's boys did not come home.\n\nThe rarity of the family's situation prompted The Privy Council to send a letter in 1915 on behalf of King George V thanking the parents for their sons' contribution to the war.\n\nSigned by the keeper of the Privy purse, it said the King had \"heard with much interest\" about the brothers.\n\n\"I am commanded to express to you The King's congratulations and to assure you that His Majesty much appreciates the spirit of patriotism which prompted this example, in one family, of loyalty and devotion to their Sovereign and Empire,\" it read.\n\n'Tremendous stuff'\n\nThe framed letter with photos of each serving son has been passed down through generations of the Birmingham family.\n\n\"Eight sons all serving at the same time - it's unique, outstanding,\" said John Jones, 76, whose wife Rita is Eliza's great-granddaughter.\n\n\"And they were all volunteers.

The world's first four-weight world champion Tommy Hearns sat two rows from the ring. Enthralled like the masses, his eyes were wide as Usyk started letting his hands go by halfway.\n\nHis caution ebbed away, each shot that landed added belief and, with Bellew suddenly breathing more heavily in the eighth, Usyk threw shots which served to create space for the hook, sending Bellew down and into the ropes.\n\nThe fairytale career the Liverpool fighter has enjoyed was brutally ended but he had taken on a challenge few believed he could overcome.\n\nOleksandr Usyk has won all 16 of his professional fights\n\nOne step too far on a remarkable journey\n\nBookmakers had made Usyk as short as 1-7 to defeat a man known for upsetting the odds.\n\nBoxing simply to impress his father as a child, Bellew's mother said he would be \"too soft\" in this most vicious of sports.\n\nAnd yet the Evertonian rose from the canvas to land the WBC cruiserweight title at his beloved Goodison Park in 2016, upset David Haye twice at heavyweight and somehow found himself starring in a Rocky movie.\n\nBut to topple a man as refined between the ropes as Usyk, Bellew would need every ounce of the ring craft acquired over his previous 33 outings.\n\nFew in the sport study like he does, lending hope he would deliver on his words and \"find a way\" to fell a \"monster\".\n\nNine minutes in he appeared in with a shout, beating a mover at his own game by gallantly taking up a position on the ropes, often pivoting right before throwing the right hand.\n\nThe early rounds seemed to go his way but suddenly the sheer pressure that comes with concentrating against one so dangerous took its toll.\n\nA three-time British amateur champion, and a British, Commonwealth and world champion as a professional, the Bellew journey in the ring is over.
